4595,low lying barrier islands present ideal locations to investigate hydrogeochemical processes in sandy coastal aquifers as they i host typical geographic features of the coast including beaches dunes as well as salt marshes ii are susceptible to the impacts of a global climate change because of their low surface elevations and iii are ubiquitous 2 100 amongst the global coastlines the aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of hydrogeochemical patterns in near surface groundwater on developing barrier islands using the ostplate on spiekeroog island germany as an example the impact of inundation season and vegetation on the hydrogeochemical processes were of particular interest six groundwater monitoring wells were installed for this purpose covering main geographic features of the ostplate i e supratidal beaches dunes and salt marshes groundwater samples were collected bimonthly from april 2016 to march 2017 measured parameters included major ions nutrients dissolved organic carbon matter doc dom δ13c signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon as well as δ34s signatures of dissolved sulfate and sulfide we found major ion compositions to be a function of the annual flooding frequency although cation concentrations were further impacted by calcite dissolution and cation exchange the redox chemistry varied at the different sites and through seasons aerobic respiration was the dominant pathway for carbon oxidation at the dune locations whereas organic matter mineralization in the salt marsh was also mediated by anaerobic processes regarding electron donors the presence of labile dom was linked to salinity and terrestrial dom signatures as well as gross inputs of organic carbon agreed with vegetation patterns a physico chemical interpretation of the pore water compositions revealed a potential for the authigenic formation of carbonate and phosphate minerals in the investigated sediments triggered by the redox processes

coastal groundwater resources low lying barrier islands present ideal locations to investigate the role of inundation season and vegetation on the hydrogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers as they i host typical geographic features of the coast including sandy beaches terrestrial dune areas as well as salt marshes and ii are susceptible to the impacts of a global climate change because of their low surface elevations and exposure to the high energy dynamics of the coastal oceans besides mixing of fresh and saline endmembers the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater below barrier islands is influenced by carbonate dissolution for instance seibert et al 2018 and pollmann et al 2020 observed rapid dissolution of biogenic carbonates in permeable dune sands of spiekeroog island germany resulting in the development of a ca hco3 type fresh groundwater interactions of dissolved cations with the aquifer matrix i e cation exchange may further influence the hydrochemical composition of coastal groundwater e g magaritz and luzier 1985 stuyfzand 1993 2008 as an example seibert et al 2018 estimated a long freshening time of 600 years for their investigated freshwater lens which had been evolving for 350 years redox reactions coupled to the mineralization of organic matter exert a further important control on the coastal hydrogeochemistry snyder et al 2004 found aerobic respiration and iron oxide reduction to dominate organic matter mineralization in near surface groundwater on sapelo island georgia u s a the prevalence of aerobic respiration in near surface groundwater was also ascertained for intertidal beaches e g anschutz et al 2009 charbonnier et al 2013 although anaerobic processes can become seasonally important with increasing sediment depth and dependence on the prevailing flow system reckhardt et al 2015 charbonnier et al 2016 ahrens et al 2020 regarding sulfate reduction seibert et al 2018 2019b could demonstrate that this process occurred in the deeper zones of the main freshwater lens at spiekeroog island germany while pollmann et al 2021 and al raei et al 2009 reported sulfate reduction for the inundated salt marshes of the island and the intertidal surface sediments of its backbarrier tidal area respectively furthermore studies on the biogeochemistry of terrestrial salt marshes which have been particularly carried out at the east coast of the united states e g giblin and howarth 1984 hines et al 1989 kostka et al 2002 gribsholt et al 2003 showed that redox conditions i strongly depend on macroflora and faunal activity and ii can comprise intense metal and sulfate reduction e g nedwell and abram 1978 kostka et al 2002 hyun et al 2007 previous work regarding the hydrochemistry of sandy barrier islands has mainly focused on fresh groundwater lenses e g röper et al 2012 houben et al 2014 seibert et al 2018 and intertidal beaches e g reckhardt et al 2015 2017 beck et al 2017 waska et al 2019a ahrens et al 2020 whereby the latter have been extensively studied to characterize and quantify solute fluxes from land to sea the hydrogeochemistry of supratidal beaches near shore sandy dune areas and salt marshes on barrier islands has received much less attention even though these zones are equally impacted by the dynamics of the coastal oceans as an example the devastating and persistent impact of a storm flood in 1962 was shown for baltrum island germany by post and houben 2017 this storm flood led to the inundation of large parts of the island and caused temporal salinization of its freshwater lens furthermore holt et al 2017 found that near surface groundwater salinities on a developing barrier island were a function of tide storm floods and seasonal freshening the aim of the present study was to investigate the evolution of hydrogeochemical patterns in near surface groundwater on a young developing barrier island using the ostplate at spiekeroog island germany as an example specific objectives were to i assess the dependency of the water ion chemistry on the flooding frequency ii delineate and characterize typical hydrogeochemical zones at supratidal beach dune and salt marsh locations and iii explore redox processes and subsequent mineral reactions linked to the microbial degradation of organic matter the ostplate at spiekeroog island offers unique conditions for such investigations as it is barely affected by human activities due to the protection by the wadden sea national park of lower saxony 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area spiekeroog island is located in the southern north sea 5 km in front of the coastline of northwest germany fig 1 a b west to east and north to south extents correspond to 9 8 km and 2 km respectively röper et al 2012 the estimated total island area is 21 3 km2 streif 1990 the island can be roughly divided in an older inhabited part to the west which started to form at its present position around 1650 and a relatively younger part to the east called ostplate fig 1b the ostplate has been evolving since 1940 and is part of the wadden sea national park of lower saxony with a tidal range of 2 72 m spiekeroog island is characterized by mesotidal conditions mean high water 1 39 m above sea level masl mean low water 1 33 m below sea level mbsl annual means from 1995 to 2015 federal waterways and shipping administration wsv 2017 2 2 geology and geomorphology the geology of the top 40 to 60 m in the spiekeroog area mainly consists of fine to coarse grained quartz sands which originate from pliocene pleistocene and holocene times and were deposited under changing glacio fluviatile marine and aeolian conditions cf röper et al 2012 2013 and references cited therein the relatively young ostplate evolved due to the accumulation of marine and aeolian sands linked to a change of the regional sediment deposition regime caused by land reclamation at the mainland röper et al 2013 and references cited therein a dune ridge with secondary dunes and a maximum height of 12 masl has been forming since the 1940s accompanied by the appearance of ammophila arenaria since the 1970s cf röper et al 2013 the reader is referred to röper et al 2013 for detailed information on the geomorphologic evolution of the ostplate in the shelter of the dunes low surface slopes and slow current velocities allowed for the evolution of species rich salt marshes extending up to 1 km southward from the dunes to the pioneer marsh topsoils in the salt marsh area are either characterized by fine grained sands or finer sediments such as loam and clay pollmann et al 2021 underlying sediments consist of fine to coarse grained sands to the north of the dune ridge a wide beach area is present beach and dune areas consist of medium to coarse grained permeable sands containing calcareous shell fragments seibert et al 2019a and having hydraulic conductivities in the order of 2 10 4 m s 1 holt et al 2019 2 3 hydrology and hydrogeology spiekeroog island receives all season rainfall with a mean precipitation rate of 800 mm a 1 which is typical for the east frisian island region cf seibert et al 2018 average fresh groundwater recharge rates in the dune areas amount to 300 to 400 mm a 1 according to röper et al 2012 matching well with recharge rates reported for other frisian islands e g sulzbacher et al 2012 post and houben 2017 locally however higher fresh recharge rates of up to 520 mm a 1 seem likely for the permeable dune areas according to modeling results for the ostplate by holt et al 2019 in the same study the authors estimated a groundwater recharge rate of 400 500 mm a 1 for the sandy beaches at the ostplate salt marsh areas are characterized by lower recharge rates presumably 200 mm a 1 due to the physical properties of the fine grained topsoils and drainage by the tidal creek system sulzbacher et al 2012 holt et al 2019 pollmann et al 2021 as well as higher evapotranspiration rates compared to the barely vegetated beaches the western part of spiekeroog island is underlain by a freshwater lens extending up to 45 to 50 mbsl tronicke et al 1999 röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 several smaller disconnected freshwater lenses were also ascertained below the young dune ridge at the ostplate fig 1d röper et al 2013 holt et al 2017 holt et al 2019 measured a vertical thickness of 4 m and a several m thick brackish transition zone for the freshwater lens located at the sampling transect of this study notably the near surface extent of the freshwater lenses at the ostplate is strongly affected by seasonal storm tides resulting in largest and smallest near surface freshwater extents at the end of summer and winter respectively holt et al 2017 here the term storm tide refers to an event resulting from the superposition of a storm primarily caused by wind pressure and the effect of the astronomical tide 2 4 instrumentation and groundwater sampling six monitoring wells were installed along a north to south oriented transect at the ostplate in march 2016 to study seasonal hydrochemical patterns of near surface groundwater fig 1c d cf fig 2 in holt et al 2019 well b a is located at a supratidal beach dn a and ds a screen a freshwater lens at the dune ridge and sm 1 sm 2 and sm 3 monitor near surface groundwater at the salt marsh fig 1c all wells have a screen length of 1 m and were placed close to the groundwater table within the saturated zone table 1 while vegetation was not present at b a and dn a ds a hosted plant communities commonly observed for secondary dunes table 1 sm 1 and sm 2 were characterized by upper salt marsh plant communities and sm 3 was marked by a salicornia stricta pioneer zone groundwater from the monitoring wells was collected during six field campaigns in april june september and november 2016 as well as in january and march 2017 furthermore seawater samples were collected close to the high water line

oxygen do were measured on site using a multi device with attached sampling probes hach hq 40d a flow cell was employed to minimize contact to the atmosphere during sampling samples for major ions and phosphate were collected during all campaigns for this purpose groundwater was filtered using 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters sartorius stedim biotech and major ion samples were filled bubble free into 50 ml polyethylene bottles phosphate samples were filled into 100 ml glass vials note that cation samples were acidified upon sampling with nitric acid to avoid metal oxide precipitation samples

using 0 15 µl hcl 32 wt additional samples for the analyses of dissolved organic matter dom δ13c signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13c dic and δ34s signatures of sulfate δ34s so4 and sulfide δ34s h2s were collected once in september 2016 δ34s so4 signatures were determined for two additional brackish samples collected at dn a in january and march 2017 note that hydrochemical parameters at well site dn a and dom compositions at dn a ds a and b a have been partly presented in seibert et al 2018 2019a dom samples were filled unfiltered into 200 ml high density polyethylene bottles and acidified to ph 2 using hcl as for the major ion samples δ13c dic samples were filtered with 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters sartorius stedim biotech and stored in 12 cm3 acid pre cleaned glass exetainers samples for the analysis of δ34s h2s were collected in 5 l canisters and mixed with 100 ml of a 20 znac solution immediately after sampling subsequently precipitated zns was filtered from these samples in the laboratory and then dried in culture dishes 24 to 48 h after sampling employing 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters attached to a water jet vacuum pump to quantitatively precipitate dissolved so4 2 two to three weeks after sampling the h2s free samples were heated to 60 c ph was lowered to 2 3 using 37 hcl and sufficient 5 bacl2 solution was added cf seibert et al 2019b precipitated baso4 was then treated as described for the zns precipitates 2 5 sample analysis bicarbonate hco3 was determined in the field employing a merck carbonate hardness test detection limit dl

analyzed with the help of high temperature catalytic oxidation employing a shimadzu toc vcph dl 8 2 µm ac 5 trueness 10 deep atlantic seawater was used as reference material for this purpose d a hansell university of miami fl u s a regarding dom analyses the acidified samples were passed through agilent bond elut solid phase extraction cartridges 300 mg 3 ml part number 12105005 to desalinate and pre concentrate dom dittmar et al 2008 the adsorbed and washed dom was eluted from the cartridges with lc ms grade methanol and stored at 20 c in the freezer for dom analyses on a 15 t bruker solarix electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer esi ft icr ms the dom extracts were diluted to 5 ppm doc in a 1 1 methanol water matrix samples were measured via hand injection in negative ionization mode with a flow rate of 20 µl min 1 and an ion accumulation time of 0 2 s for each sample 500 scans were acquired an in house reference material north equatorial pacific intermediate water neqpiw was measured with the samples to observe instrument drift after internal calibration to an error of 100 ppb using an in house neqpiw based reference mass list numerical lists of sample mass spectra were imported into the online freeware icbm ocean merder et al 2020 for noise correction sample mass junction and molecular formula attribution molecular formula attribution was done with an error of 500 ppb using the elements c h o n s and p after assigning unequivocal molecular formulae to each mass icbm ocean groups them into compound classes based on their elemental stoichiometry e g aromatic highly unsaturated unsaturated and saturated which can be indicative of their reactivity and provenance for example the groups unsaturated and saturated include all molecular formulae with an h c ratio 1 5 which are regarded as more readily available for microbial consumption compared to those with h c 1 5 and which are enriched in marine waters with phytoplankton as main primary producer d andrilli et al 2015 on the other hand elevated aromatic compound abundances are linked to terrestrial origin due to their enrichment in vascular plants waska et al 2019b in addition to the compound classes and h c and o c ratios provided by icbm ocean a terrestrial index iterr was calculated to approximate the relative contribution of terrigenous dom following medeiros et al 2016 iterr represents the ratio of the sum of normalized intensities of esi ft icr ms peaks sum magnitudes of terrestrial dom vs sum magnitudes of terrestrial and marine dom medeiros et al 2016 regarding δ34s analyses zns and baso4 precipitates were used to determine δ34s h2s and δ34s so4 2 values at the leibniz institute of baltic sea research iow by means of c irmms employing a thermo flash 2000 ea elemental analyzer coupled to a thermo finnigan mat 253 gas mass spectrometer via a thermo electron conflo iv split interface cf seibert et al 2019a 2019b following mann et al 2009 the v cdt scale was used for conversion of the measured sulfur isotope ratios the international intercomparison materials iaea s s 22 6 iaea s 3 33 5 and nbs127 21 3 were used for this purpose cf seibert et al 2019b concentrations of do nitrate no3 dissolved manganese mndiss dissolved iron fediss and nh4 below the detection limit are presented as zero concentrations in the following a summary of all hydrochemical data presented in this study is provided in si table b1 note that the hydrochemical compositions of seawater and precipitation endmembers in the following were previously reported by seibert et al 2018 dom δ13c dic and δ34s so4 signatures were determined once for a seawater sample collected in september 2016 electrical balances were calculated for all samples n 35 according to appelo and postma 2005 and a threshold of 6 was applied samples not fulfilling this criterion were disregarded for further interpretations n 2 to determine saturation indices si of minerals suspected to play a role in the investigated sediments i e calcite caco3 siderite feco3 rhodochrosite mnco3 vivianite fe3 po4 2 and hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh speciation calculations were carried out using the hydrogeochemical software tool phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 the default database phreeqc dat was applied for this purpose note that solutions which were originally supersaturated with respect to calcite were re adjusted to calcite equilibrium via co2 titration using phreeqc and assuming that calcite supersaturation resulted from co2 degassing during sampling observed ph and hco3 concentrations as well as calculated mineral sis were corrected accordingly and the corrected values are presented in the following furthermore δ13c dic values were corrected for co2 degassing following michaelis et al 1985 an overview of the correction procedure for the carbon system is provided in si section a 2 6 re construction of sea levels and flooding frequencies high tide water levels were obtained from wsv 2017 for the tide gauges wangerooge nord latitude 53 806 longitude 7 929 and wangerooge west latitude 53 776 longitude 7 868 which are located in close proximity to the sampling transect 15 km at the neighboring island wangerooge high tide water levels were used to calculate i the number of floodings at the sampling locations within 365 days prior to each sampling campaign and ii the time passed since the last flood reached a site prior to sampling for this purpose ground surface elevations were measured at all well locations with a differential gps leica sr530 vertical accuracy of 2 cm in spring 2016 table 1 because water levels slightly differ in the open north sea and the back barrier regions cf holt et al 2019 data from tide gauge wangerooge nord and wangerooge west were used to approximate high tide water levels at the locations north to the dune ridge b a and dn a and south to the dune ridge ds a sm 1 sm 2 and sm 3 respectively due to technical issues data was lacking for some days from august until november 2015 at wangerooge nord and wangerooge west data was used instead n 72 measurements results show that the low lying locations sm 2 sm 3 and b a surface elevation 2 masl were subject to 50 floodings per year whereas sm 1 and dn a were only occasionally flooded fig 2 table 1 si fig e1 e2 dune location ds a has not been impacted by floods in recent years note that we applied tide data for the flooding frequency calculations which corresponds to still water levels resulting from the tide and regional wind and pressure setups following the approach of holt et al 2017 the impact of wave setup and runup respectively was not accounted for a qualitative comparison of groundwater head data with tide data revealed a good match between head indicated and tide indicated flood events si fig e2 particularly at the salt marsh sites sm 1 to 3 this demonstrates that tide data is generally applicable to estimate annual flooding frequencies at the here investigated study site we expect that the slight underestimation of actual flooding frequencies at the elevated northern beach has no considerable impact on the calculated annual flooding frequencies and thereby on our hydrochemical interpretations 2 7 approximation of salinities and major ion concentrations holt et al 2017 established an empirical logarithmic relationship between flooding frequency and near surface groundwater salinities at the ostplate 1 sal gw a ln ω b g l 1 where a is 4 85 ω is the flooding frequency in the year prior to sampling and b is 0 047 this equation was based on high resolution porewater sampling campaigns at the ostplate n 983 sampling points and yields an estimation of near surface groundwater salinities where the effect of hydro geo logic processes having an impact on the salinities is regarded in a lumped fashion including inundation and precipitation this relationship was used to calculate theoretical salinities for the range of flooding frequencies observed at the ostplate theoretical salinities were then transformed into theoretical major ion concentrations to evaluate if groundwater species resulted from binary mixing of fresh and saline endmembers the hydrochemical composition of seawater salinity 32 g l 1 collected at spiekeroog was used for this purpose cf seibert et al 2018 note that estimated salinity and major ion concentrations in the following i e lines in fig 3 correspond to diluted seawater assuming that major ion contributions of low ionic strength precipitation are negligible 3 results 3 1 major ion chemistry groundwater salinities were fresh within the dune regions dn a ds a usually below 0 6 g l 1 throughout the year fig 3a however a steep increase of salinities 10 g l 1 was observed in january 2017 15 days after a storm flood reached location dn a fig 2 and salinities remained elevated even in march 2017 cf seibert et al 2019a groundwater at b a was brackish with salinities in the range of 20 to 24 g l 1 highest values were measured in winter 2016 2017 reflecting the impact of recent flood events fig 2 salinities at the salt marsh were increasing with proximity to the sea groundwater at sm 1 and sm 2 was brackish 9 and 17 g l 1 while salinities at sm 3 were matching seawater 32 g l in general observed salinities fit well with predictions using eq 1 compare symbols and line see rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse fig 3a note that rmse and nse could only be calculated for locations with 1 floodings in previous 365 days since the logarithmic eq 1 does not yield predictions for 0 floodings the non flooded site ds a was thus not regarded in the rmse and nse calculations observations for most major ions i e chloride cl sulfate so4 2 sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 resembled the described salinity trends fig 3b d h as for salinity major ion concentrations match well with predictions using eq 1 and applying the ratio of salinity ion concentration of seawater reported in seibert et al 2018 compare symbols and lines see rmse and nse fig 3b d h in addition the evaluation of major ion concentrations as a function of salinity showed that major ions behaved mostly conservatively meaning their concentrations resulted from binary mixing between seawater and precipitation endmembers si fig c1 however this did not account for hco3 fig 3c si fig c1b hco3 concentrations were low at dn a ds a and b a 4 mm fig 3c while higher and seasonally varying hco3 concentrations were detected at sm 2 and sm 3 3 5 to 9 5 mm seawater had the lowest hco3 concentrations 2 7 mm seibert et al 2018 demonstrating that the carbonate chemistry was not governed by simple mixing of fresh and saline endmembers moreover deviations from the binary mixing line were detected for cations in some samples e g ca2 at dn a and sm 2 si fig c1f 3 2 redox chemistry organic carbon and nutrients doc concentrations were low 500 μm at the unvegetated locations b a and dn a fig 4 a higher doc concentrations were observed at the vegetated dune site ds a 850 μm and highest doc concentrations up to 2

concentrations of 200 μm seibert et al 2018 the vegetated sites were enriched in aromatic compounds but depleted in highly unsaturated and saturated dom compounds fig 4b contributions of unsaturated dom as well as labile dom i e molecules with h c 1 5 d andrilli et al 2015 increased with salinity si fig c2b c which was linked to the flooding frequency fig 3a seawater showed highest amounts of labile dom 18 8 mlbl lowest contributions of labile dom 5 mlbl were detected at the densely vegetated but barely non flooded site ds a iterr values indicated a large fraction of terrigenous dom 40 at the vegetated sites sm 1 ds a sm 2 which decreased with proximity to the sea located north and south of b a and sm 3 respectively fig 4d fig 1c nh4 concentrations increased with flooding frequencies and salinities at the salt marsh up to 166 μm at sm 3 fig 4e si fig c2e concentrations at dune dn a ds a 12 μm and beach b a 6 to 28 μm were lower po4 3 concentrations were high and seasonally varying at sm 1 up to 58 μm fig 4f and dn a up to 18 μm lowest po4 3 concentrations were measured at ds a 2 μm δ13c dic signatures ranged between 16 0 and 3 6 fig 4g and were depleted in 13c compared to seawater dic 0 7 most negative signatures 16 0 to 13 4 were observed at the densely vegetated sites sm 2 sm 1 and ds a signatures at sm 3 dn a and b a were less negative 9 3 to 3 6 3 3 redox chemistry electron acceptors salt marsh sm 1 2 3 and dune locations dn a ds a showed lowest and highest ph values respectively 6 9 to 7 9 fig 5 a eh potentials marked increasingly reducing conditions at the salt marsh 300 mv to 210 mv whereas redox conditions were oxic to suboxic 580 mv to 130 mv at the dune and beach locations fig 5b do was present at the dune locations throughout the year but seasonally varying 40 to 320 μm fig 5c elevated concentrations of do at b a were only measured in winter 130 to 260 μm when the beach was impacted by storm floods fig 2 generally do concentrations at the salt marsh were low 10 μm except for more elevated concentrations in april 2016 20 to 60 μm high levels of no3 were detected at dn a up to 385 μm fig 5d and in one sample at b a in september 2016 75 μm no3 concentrations were below the detection limit for the remainder of the wells note that no3 detection limits were relatively large for some of the brackish saline groundwater samples as samples were diluted prior to the ic measurements compare si table b1 although this circumstance limits our interpretations of the no3 patterns we expect that no3 was fully depleted in the brackish saline samples showing iron manganese oxide to sulfate reducing conditions i e all salt marsh samples mndiss was always detected at sm 2 13 to 21 μm fig 5e and concentrations remained below the detection limit at the other locations fediss concentrations i e primarily ferrous iron were high and strongly varying at sm 1 and sm 2 21 to 489 μm fig 5f sm 3 showed much lower concentrations up to

enriched in 34s compared to seawater whereas freshwater at dn a 9 5 vs v cdt and ds a 5 0 vs v cdt was enriched in 32s due to the very low h2s concentrations 2 μm δ34s h2s signatures could only be determined for sm 3 31 1 vs v cdt 4 discussion 4 1 the role of inundation and precipitation for the major ion chemistry the agreement between predicted and observed major ion concentrations fig 3 shows that major ion compositions in near surface groundwater at the ostplate are mainly a function of the flooding frequency which agrees with the general conclusions of holt et al 2017 regarding near surface groundwater salinities on evolving barrier islands under mesotidal conditions yet the data of this study indicates non conservative behavior of cations at some locations fig 3 si fig c1 this demonstrates additional hydrogeochemical reactions impacting the major ion chemistry besides binary mixing of seawater and precipitation endmembers first the infiltration of precipitation into the calcareous sandy sediments at the ostplate is accompanied by the dissolution of calcite seibert et al 2018 explaining the surplus of ca2 and hco3 ions in fresh dune groundwater fig 6 a si fig c1b

close to or slightly above seawater lower na cl ratios at dn a ds a and b a in winter fig 6b mark seasonal salinization presumably linked to the more frequent flood events during this period fig 2 moreover stuyfzand 1986 2008 introduced the base exchange index bex to assess if cation exchange may occur 4 bex na k mg 2 1 0716 cl meq l 1 where na k mg2 and cl are measured solute concentrations positive and negative bex values show if an aquifer is freshening or salinizing respectively to avoid the interpretation of false bex values which can result from silicate dissolution and charge imbalances stuyfzand 2008 proposed boundary limits serving as additional thresholds for calculated bex values besides the applied electrical balance threshold section 2 5 eleven samples were fulfilling these conditions and are presented in the following fig 6c d in line with the na cl ratios bex values for the dunes mainly show freshening trends dn a ds a 0 6 to 2 3 meq l 1 fig 6c d

overall increase in surface elevations holt et al 2017 4 2 sources and degradation of organic matter the major fraction of doc at the vegetated sites ds a sm 1 sm 2 originates from terrestrial plants which release organic matter om into the subsurface this is demonstrated by i the high doc concentrations up to 2 000 µm fig 4a ii elevated relative abundances of aromatic compounds in dom 20 dom fig 4b and iii iterr ratios 0 4 fig 4d on the other hand doc concentrations at the unvegetated dune dn a and beach b a locations as well as the pioneer marsh sm 3 were lower 600 µm and had higher abundances of labile dom 8 12 mlbl fig 4c providing evidence for an increasingly marine origin docseawater 200 µm mlbl seawater 19 mlbl the contribution of labile dom from the marine environment is supported by the finding that it was correlated with salinity si fig c2c p value of pearson correlation 0 02 therefore redox processes of near surface groundwater at the ostplate are driven by both inputs i e terrestrial and labile marine om and the relative role of the two electron donors is site dependent regarding om mineralization we postulate that its intensity is primarily controlled by i flooding frequency conveying labile dom to the sites ii vegetation resulting in large inputs of om and possibly enhancing aerobic respiration via radial root o2 loss rol and iii fluctuating groundwater tables leading to aeration of the near surface sediments this is evidenced by first nh4 concentration patterns marking a general increase of om mineralization with flooding frequency salinity fig 4e si fig c2e which are linked to the input of labile marine om fig 4c si fig c2c second the important role of vegetation as driver for om mineralization becomes evident when taking into account that concentrations of nh4 and hco3 were higher at the vegetated salt marsh compared to the beach b a vs sm 2 fig 3c 4e and that hco3 concentrations are a function of doc concentrations fig 7 a in addition the injection of o2 into the subsurface via rol which has been shown for several marsh plants e g spartina alterniflora spartina anglica and juncus roemerianus e g mendelssohn et al 1995 and references cited therein holmer et al 2002 colmer 2003 might amplify om mineralization at the vegetated sites in fact rol in combination with faunal burrowing results in aerobic degradation of om while it hampers the consumption of less favorable electron acceptors and or causes their re oxidation gribsholt and kristensen 2002 kostka et al 2002 hyun et al 2007 third seasonally fluctuating groundwater tables close to the sediment surface might contribute to more intense om mineralization as an example the fluctuating groundwater table at sm 2 and sm 3 caused a frequent change between saturated unsaturated conditions in the om exposed surface sediments si fig e1 presumably leading to aeration of the sediments and thereby enhancing aerobic respiration more intense om mineralization at the vegetated salt marsh agrees with the behavior of electron acceptors showing iron to sulfate reducing conditions at the latter while oxic to nitrate reducing conditions were found at dn a ds a and b a see section redox processes coupled to the oxidation of organic matter therefore we further postulate that locations frequently exposed to flood events conveying labile om and do to the sites in conjunction with the presence of terrestrial biomass and fluctuating near surface groundwater tables result in hotspots for doc mobilization and respiration respectively the microbial oxidation of om results in the production of carbon dioxide co2 which causes the dissolution of marine carbonates 5 h 2 co 3 caco 3 ca 2 2 hco 3 δ13c dic signatures indicate dissolution of biogenic co2 as all samples were depleted in 13c compared to inorganic carbon in seawater fig 4g and atmospheric co2 e g francey et al 1999 burt et al 2016 moreover δ13c dic signatures were negatively correlated with observed doc concentrations fig 7b p value of spearman rank correlation 0 01 marking different co2 origins for the sampling sites for a closed system dic is derived in equal portions from the om source and dissolving marine carbonate caco3 eq 5 which typically has δ13c signatures close to 0 see δ13c dic value of seawater fig 4g thus assuming mixing of the two carbon endmembers h2co3 and caco3 during closed calcite dissolution the oc endmember h2co3 must have a δ13c signature corresponding to the two fold of the observed δ13c dic hco3 signature fig 7c the estimated δ13c om signatures for the sites mainly exposed to marine om b a dn a sm 3 agree with δ13c ranges reported for marine macroalgae and mussels collected at the back barrier tidal area of spiekeroog island 17 9 to 10 0 böttcher et al 1998 fig 7c on the other hand estimated δ13c om signatures for om with a suspected larger fraction of terrigenous provenance ds a sm1 sm 2 agree with signatures reported for top sediments collected at the ostplate salt marsh 29 9 to 21 5 pollmann et al 2021 fig 7c as well as similar salt marsh environments e g 30 5 to 24 0 c3 salt marsh sediments goslin et al 2017 28 6 1 3 upland c3 salt marsh plants peterson et al 1985 27 5 to 24 top 20 cm sediments of a semi natural wadden sea salt marsh mueller et al 2019 seemingly δ13c dic om signatures confirm the proposed om sources for the different sampling sits however we recognize that the evolution of δ13c dic signatures at the ostplate might not take place entirely under closed system conditions for instance at the more elevated dune locations here assuming that δ13c dic signatures evolve under open system conditions calcite dissolution would result in δ13c dic signatures controlled by soil co2 and solution ph e g deines et al 1974 appelo and postma 2005 yet the agreement between δ13c signatures and proposed om sources shows that the assumption of om mineralization under closed system conditions is generally legitimate for the low lying and regularly flooded ostplate finally our findings show that doc concentrations 0 6 mm are indicative for the contribution of terrestrial om while lower concentrations were found for samples only exposed to marine om 4 3 redox processes coupled to the oxidation of organic matter 4 3 1 aerobic respiration aerobic respiration is the dominant metabolism for the oxidation of organic matter within fresh dune sediments where do was found throughout the year fig 5c our findings agree with a study by snyder et al 2004 who reported that aerobic respiration governs the oxidation of oc within near surface groundwater on sapelo island georgia u s a previous investigations on the much thicker freshwater lens in the western part of spiekeroog have shown that anaerobic pathways comprising denitrification metal oxide and sulfate reduction become dominant in deeper older groundwater 2 4 years residence time seibert et al 2018 at the beach b a do was detected in winter when frequency and intensity of storm floods were highest fig 2 while do was depleted and redox processes controlled by anaerobic metabolisms during the remaining seasons hence it appears that aerobic respiration in supratidal near surface beach porewaters could result from the advective flow of oxygenated seawater in winter this assumption is supported by salinity increases at b a for the november and january campaigns 4g l 1 fig 3a in addition less microbial activity and substrate availability during seasons of lower temperature e g thamdrup et al 1998 al raei et al 2009 might contribute to a switch from anaerobic to aerobic pathways previous studies on the biogeochemistry of intertidal beach sediments on spiekeroog waska et al 2019a ahrens et al 2020 and the french aquitanian coast anschutz et al 2009 charbonnier et al 2013 2016 support the general paradigm that aerobic respiration seasonally dominates om mineralization in near surface porewaters of permeable beach sands similar conclusions regarding the effect of advective flow on the developing biogeochemistry were drawn by de beer et al 2005 for organic poor intertidal sandy north sea sediments however they found that intense aerobic degradation was restricted to the top 10 cm while microbial sulfate reduction msr proceeded concurrently and usually dominated at depth 10 cm further research efforts are needed to clarify the role of msr in sandy inter supratidal coastal sediments 4 3 2 nitrogen cycling nh4 presents the dominant dissolved inorganic nitrogen din species in near surface groundwater at most locations which points to the mineralization of om see sources and degradation of organic matter patterns of rising nh4 concentrations demonstrate an increase of om mineralization with higher flooding frequency vegetation coverage and fluctuating groundwater tables yet we recognize that low nh4 concentrations might locally result from nitrification followed by denitrification or plant uptake koretsky and miller 2008 considering for instance lower concentrations of nh4 at sm 2 up to 72 µm fig 4e compared to sm 3 up to 166 µm no3 was absent at most locations fig 5d which could be indicative of low no3 inputs or a loss of din to the atmosphere via denitrification the only exception was site dn a where high no3 concentrations were measured up to 385 μm reckhardt et al 2015 reported equally high concentrations up to 310 μm for near surface groundwater collected at a different dune location on spiekeroog and we have previously suggested that nutrient rich remains of migrating birds such as bird guano or nh4 released during om mineralization are potential nitrogen sources in this region seibert et al 2018 similarly schutte et al 2018 observed high no3 concentrations median 431 μm in shallow beach pore waters of two barrier islands in the southeastern usa they could demonstrate that nitrification rates coupled to ammonification of buried marine om can exceed the stoichiometry of aerobic nitrification due to the dissolution of excess oxygen at the interface of the unsaturated saturated zones in accordance with schutte et al 2018 and considering that the northern dune base at spiekeroog is impacted and eroded by storm floods fig 2 ammonification nitrification of labile marine om recently buried close to the fluctuating groundwater table si fig e1 possibly caused the high no3 loads evidence for this mechanism are i a high contribution of labile dom 8 4 mlbl fig 4c which traces the input of labile marine om ii the detection of po4 3 with a mean concentration of 9 µm nearly matching the redfield ratio 16 1 for n p taking the mean no3 concentration of 140 µm into account and iii a δ13c dic signature similar to the other sites exposed to marine om 7 fig 4g for the unvegetated beach and dune areas large fractions of n might have been lost to the atmosphere via nitrification followed by denitrification cf marchant et al 2016 2017 as suggested for intertidal beach sediments at spiekeroog ahrens et al 2020 or to the water column of the sea by drainage of anoxic nh4 rich porewaters in the intertidal zone e g beck et al 2017 in contrast previous studies on the biogeochemistry of more densely vegetated salt marshes have suggested that the dominant fraction of n is re cycled and temporarily stored in macrophytes tobias and neubauer 2019 and references cited therein 4 3 3 iron and manganese cycling high fediss concentrations at the vegetated salt marsh sm 1 and sm 2 fig 5f point toward anaerobic mineralization of om coupled to microbial reduction of iron oxides however these patterns could also result from a rapid cycling of sulfur where h2s produced during msr chemically reacts with sedimentary iron oxides e g thamdrup et al 1994 thus anaerobic om mineralization in the interior of the salt marsh is coupled to i microbial reduction of iron oxides ii msr or iii both metabolisms proceeding simultaneously the prevalence of microbial iron reduction would confirm more recent studies showing that this process can dominate in bioturbated salt marsh environments e g kostka et al 2002 gribsholt et al 2003 hyun et al 2007 although msr is generally viewed as the by far most dominant anaerobic metabolism in marine sediments including salt marshes jørgensen 1982 howarth and hobbie 1982 howarth 1984 a detailed analysis of the sedimentary iron phases and accompanying incubation experiments canfield et al 1993 should be carried out in future studies to clarify which anaerobic metabolism dominates in the investigated salt marsh sediments furthermore the iron cycle within the salt marsh might involve the formation of siderite which acts as sink for both fediss and carbonate this assumption is corroborated by mineral sisiderite values 0 2 in our study fig 8 a even though this process is anomalous in marine h2s rich environments coleman et al 1993 showed that it can take place in salt marsh sediments and is mediated by microbial iron oxide reduction recently lin et al 2020 showed for east anglian salt marsh sediments that siderite formation was rapid within 400 hrs in case sufficient fediss and alkalinity were present the authors further argued that low sulfate reduction counteracting high ph might cause ideal conditions for the formation of siderite similar hydrogeochemical conditions were observed at sm 1 and sm 2 suggesting that siderite formation takes place at the investigated salt marsh mndiss detected at sm 2 marks the reduction of manganese oxides presumably manganese reduction is caused by chemical reduction via reaction with fe ii rather than microbial reduction considering the high fediss concentrations and the fact that manganese oxides are rapidly reduced by dissolved fe ii postma 1985 myers and nealson 1988 similarly snyder et al 2004 attributed small peaks of mndiss in the presence of high fe ii in near surface groundwater mainly to the chemical reduction of manganese oxides in addition mndiss might also result from chemical reduction via h2s myers and nealson 1988 snyder et al 2004 mndiss concentrations might be further impacted by precipitation of ca rhodochrosite fig 8b böttcher and dietzel 2010 or sorption to mineral surfaces e g nyffeler et al 1984 the absence of notable concentrations of fediss and mndiss at the beach b a and dune locations dn a ds a shows that anaerobic oxidation of om coupled to mn fe oxide reduction pathways is less relevant compared to aerobic respiration here or that re oxidative processes lead to an efficient re oxidation and precipitation e g balzer 1982 high po4 3 concentrations detected at sm 1 can result from both the release of sorbed p during iron oxide reduction carlyle and hill 2001 or organic bound p during om mineralization surprisingly po4 3 concentrations at sm 2 and sm 3 were much lower than at sm 1 fig 4f despite higher expected om mineralization rates see section sources and degradation of organic matter which were to some extent linked to iron oxide reduction considering the elevated fediss concentrations at sm 2 fig 5f this finding could result from precipitation of vivianite and or hydroxyapatite following microbial reduction of iron oxides zachara et al 2002 slomp and van cappellen 2004 however the hydrochemical data did not provide evidence for the precipitation of the latter minerals at sm 2 and sm 3 as sivivianite and sihydroxyapatite values were 0 for all campaigns fig 8c d except for one sample collected at sm 2 in april 2016 thus lower po4 3 concentrations at sm 2 and sm 3 compared to sm 1 might be related to different compositions of the degrading om and or the available iron oxides groundwater at sm 1 was supersaturated for vivianite and hydroxyapatite during most of the year indicating that both minerals and or its precursors might precipitate furthermore hydroxyapatite could seasonally control po4 3 concentrations at dn a fig 8d 4 3 4 sulfur cycling so4 2 concentrations in most samples behaved almost conservatively with respect to salinity si fig c1c particularly when compared to highly sulfate reducing conditions found in similar sandy surface sediments of the southern north sea e g tidal flats böttcher et al 1998 al raei et al 2009 yet we detected deviations from conservative so4 2 concentration distributions for some samples δso4 2 fig 5g showing loss i e msr sulfide oxidation sox and gain msr sox of so4 2 respectively δso4 2 values demonstrated that the salt marsh sm 2 sm 3 and beach b a wells alternate between situations where msr sox and msr sox respectively while sm 3 was the only well showing net msr throughout all campaigns fig 5g the absence of h2s which is produced during msr is probably linked to the fast reaction with fe iii to form iron sulfides berner 1984 or reaction with mn iv thamdrup et al 1994 msr is typically accompanied by sulfur isotope fractionation leaving residual so4 2 enriched and produced sulfide depleted in heavy 34s respectively kaplan and rittenberg 1964 rees 1973 hartmann and nielsen 2012 therefore δ34s so4 2 signatures heavier than seawater so4 2 21 vs v cdt in north sea seawater böttcher et al 2007 indicate ongoing msr whereas lighter δ34s so4 2 signatures show the input of so4 2 from other sources e g atmospheric so4 2 emissions of reduced sulfur gases from salt marshes or so4 2 derived from sox δ34s so4 2 signatures of most brackish samples ranged from 21 to 24 vs v cdt fig 5h demonstrating ongoing msr despite the lack of traceable concentrations of h2s the only available δ34s h2s signature at sm 3 which was highly depleted in 34s 31 1 vs v cdt confirms ongoing msr the resulting sulfur isotope fractionation of 54 3 at sm 3 is in the range observed for similar coastal sediments in the southern north sea e g böttcher et al 2000 δ34s so4 2 signatures in freshwater considerably lower than those in brackish and marine samples fig 5h demonstrate the input of atmospheric so4 2 from natural or anthropogenic 34s depleted sources reckhardt et al 2017 kristensen et al 2000 with an additional impact of 34s depleted so4 2 derived from pyrite oxidation as discussed in seibert et al 2019a 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to investigate the environmental factors controlling the hydrogeochemistry of near surface groundwater on a young developing barrier island under mesotidal conditions covering supratidal beach dune and salt marsh sub environments the linkage of season inundation and vegetation to the hydrogeochemical processes were of particular interest the results of our study lead to the following conclusions the major ion chemistry is a function of the annual flooding frequency in addition calcite dissolution and cation exchange have an impact on major ion concentrations the redox chemistry is primarily controlled by vegetation patterns and flooding frequencies conveying labile om to the sites the prevalence of terrestrial electron donors increases with distance to the sea while labile om is a function of salinity dune locations are characterized by aerobic respiration sulfate and iron reducing conditions have been encountered in the salt marsh as the role of microbial sulfate reduction for near surface groundwater in permeable coastal sands remains subject of an ongoing debate it should be explored in more detail as a first approach the physico chemical interpretation of pore water compositions provided indications for the formation of minerals such as carbonates and phosphates triggered by redox reactions future work should investigate mineral formation in similar salt marsh sediments by combining field with experimental and detailed solid phase analytical investigations the role of seasonal effects on the hydrogeochemistry such as temperature and seawater compositions has to be studied in more detail therefore future studies should carry out field campaigns with a higher temporal and

4595,low lying barrier islands present ideal locations to investigate hydrogeochemical processes in sandy coastal aquifers as they i host typical geographic features of the coast including beaches

this study was to investigate the evolution of hydrogeochemical patterns in near surface groundwater on developing barrier islands using the ostplate on spiekeroog island germany as an example the

dissolved organic carbon matter doc dom δ13c signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon as well as δ34s signatures of dissolved sulfate and sulfide we found major ion compositions to be a function of the annual flooding frequency although cation concentrations were further impacted by calcite dissolution and cation exchange the redox chemistry varied at the different sites and through seasons aerobic respiration was the dominant pathway for carbon oxidation at the dune locations whereas organic matter mineralization in the salt marsh was also mediated by anaerobic processes regarding electron donors the presence of labile dom was linked to salinity and terrestrial dom signatures as well as gross inputs of organic carbon agreed with vegetation patterns a physico chemical

systems e g craft et al 2009 lovelock et al 2015 kirwan et al 2016 therefore an accurate interpretation on how environmental factors impact the coastal hydrogeochemistry will help to project future coastal groundwater resources low lying barrier islands present ideal locations to investigate the role of inundation season and vegetation on the hydrogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers as they i host typical geographic features of the coast including sandy beaches terrestrial dune areas as well as salt marshes and ii are susceptible to the impacts of a global climate change because of their low surface elevations and exposure to the high energy dynamics of the coastal oceans besides mixing of fresh and saline endmembers the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater below barrier islands is influenced by carbonate dissolution for instance seibert et al 2018 and pollmann et al 2020 observed rapid dissolution of biogenic carbonates in permeable dune sands of spiekeroog island germany resulting in the development of a ca hco3 type fresh groundwater interactions of dissolved cations with the aquifer matrix i e cation exchange may further influence the hydrochemical composition of coastal groundwater e g magaritz and luzier 1985 stuyfzand 1993 2008 as an example seibert et al 2018 estimated a long freshening time of 600 years for their investigated freshwater lens which had been evolving for 350 years redox reactions coupled to the mineralization of organic matter exert a further important control on the coastal hydrogeochemistry snyder et al 2004 found aerobic respiration and iron oxide reduction to dominate organic matter mineralization in near surface groundwater on sapelo island georgia u s a the prevalence of aerobic respiration in near surface groundwater was also ascertained for intertidal beaches e g anschutz et al 2009 charbonnier et al 2013 although anaerobic processes can become seasonally important with increasing sediment depth and dependence on the prevailing flow system reckhardt et al 2015 charbonnier et al 2016 ahrens et al 2020 regarding sulfate reduction seibert et al 2018 2019b could demonstrate that this process occurred in the deeper zones of the main freshwater lens at spiekeroog island germany while pollmann et al 2021 and al raei et al 2009 reported sulfate reduction for the inundated salt marshes of the island and the intertidal surface sediments of its backbarrier tidal area respectively furthermore studies on the biogeochemistry of terrestrial salt marshes which have been particularly carried out at the east coast of the united states e g giblin and howarth 1984 hines et al 1989 kostka et al 2002 gribsholt et al 2003 showed that redox conditions i strongly depend on macroflora and faunal activity and ii can comprise intense metal and sulfate reduction e g nedwell and abram 1978 kostka et al 2002 hyun et al 2007 previous work regarding the hydrochemistry of sandy barrier islands has mainly focused on fresh groundwater lenses e g röper et al 2012 houben et al 2014 seibert et al 2018 and intertidal beaches e g reckhardt et al 2015 2017 beck et al 2017 waska et al 2019a ahrens et al 2020 whereby the latter have been extensively studied to characterize and quantify solute fluxes from land to sea the hydrogeochemistry of supratidal beaches near shore sandy dune areas and salt marshes on barrier islands has received much less attention even though these zones are equally impacted by the dynamics of the coastal oceans as an example the devastating and persistent impact of a storm flood in 1962 was shown for baltrum island germany by post and houben 2017 this storm flood led to the inundation of large parts of the island and caused temporal salinization of its freshwater lens furthermore holt et al 2017 found that near surface groundwater salinities on a developing barrier island were a function of tide storm floods and seasonal freshening the aim of the present study was to investigate the evolution of hydrogeochemical patterns in near surface groundwater on a young developing barrier island using the ostplate at spiekeroog island germany as an example specific objectives were to i assess the dependency of the water ion chemistry on the flooding frequency ii delineate and characterize typical hydrogeochemical zones at supratidal beach dune and salt marsh locations and iii explore redox processes and subsequent mineral reactions linked to the microbial degradation of organic matter the ostplate at spiekeroog island offers unique conditions for such investigations as it is barely affected by human activities due to the protection by the wadden sea national park of lower saxony 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area spiekeroog island is located in the southern north sea 5 km in front of the coastline of northwest germany fig 1 a b west to east and north to south extents correspond to 9 8 km and 2 km respectively röper et al 2012 the estimated total island area is 21 3 km2 streif 1990 the island can be roughly divided in an older inhabited part to the west which started to form at its present position around 1650 and a relatively younger part to the east called ostplate fig 1b the ostplate has been evolving since 1940 and is part of the wadden sea national park of lower saxony with a tidal range of 2 72 m spiekeroog island is characterized by mesotidal conditions mean high water 1 39 m above sea level masl mean low water 1 33 m below sea level mbsl annual means from 1995 to 2015 federal waterways and shipping administration wsv 2017 2 2 geology and geomorphology the geology of the top 40 to 60 m in the spiekeroog area mainly consists of fine to coarse grained quartz sands which originate from pliocene pleistocene and holocene times and were deposited under changing glacio fluviatile marine and aeolian conditions cf röper et al 2012 2013 and references cited therein the relatively young ostplate evolved due to the accumulation of marine and aeolian sands linked to a change of the regional sediment deposition regime caused by land reclamation at the mainland röper et al 2013 and references cited therein a dune ridge with secondary dunes and a maximum height of 12 masl has been forming since the 1940s accompanied by the appearance of ammophila arenaria since the 1970s cf röper et al 2013 the reader is referred to röper et al 2013 for detailed information on the geomorphologic evolution of the ostplate in the shelter of the dunes low surface slopes and slow current velocities allowed for the evolution of species rich salt marshes extending up to 1 km southward from the dunes to the pioneer marsh topsoils in the salt marsh area are either characterized by fine grained sands or finer sediments such as loam and clay pollmann et al 2021 underlying sediments consist of fine to coarse grained sands to the north of the dune ridge a wide beach area is present beach and dune areas consist of medium to coarse grained permeable sands containing calcareous shell fragments seibert et al 2019a and having hydraulic conductivities in the order of 2 10 4 m s 1 holt et al 2019 2 3 hydrology and hydrogeology spiekeroog island receives all season rainfall with a mean precipitation rate of 800 mm a 1 which is typical for the east frisian island region cf seibert et al 2018 average fresh groundwater recharge rates in the dune areas amount to 300 to 400 mm a 1 according to röper et al 2012 matching well with recharge rates reported for other frisian islands e g sulzbacher et al 2012 post and houben 2017 locally however higher fresh recharge rates of up to 520 mm a 1 seem likely for the permeable dune areas according to modeling results for the ostplate by holt et al 2019 in the same study the authors estimated a groundwater recharge rate of 400 500 mm a 1 for the sandy beaches at the ostplate salt marsh areas are characterized by lower recharge rates presumably 200 mm a 1 due to the physical properties of the fine grained topsoils and drainage by the tidal creek system sulzbacher et al 2012 holt et al 2019 pollmann et al 2021 as well as higher evapotranspiration rates compared to the barely vegetated beaches the western part of spiekeroog island is underlain by a freshwater lens extending up to 45 to 50 mbsl tronicke et al 1999 röper et al 2012 seibert et al 2018 several smaller disconnected freshwater lenses were also ascertained below the young dune ridge at the ostplate fig 1d röper et al 2013 holt et al 2017 holt et al 2019 measured a vertical thickness of 4 m and a several m thick brackish transition zone for the freshwater lens located at the sampling transect of this study notably the near surface extent of the freshwater lenses at the ostplate is strongly affected by seasonal storm tides resulting in largest and smallest near surface freshwater extents at the end of summer and winter respectively holt et al 2017 here the term storm tide refers to an event resulting from the superposition of a storm primarily caused by wind pressure and the effect of the astronomical tide 2 4 instrumentation and groundwater sampling six monitoring wells were installed along a north to south oriented transect at the ostplate in march 2016 to study seasonal hydrochemical patterns of near surface groundwater fig 1c d cf fig 2 in holt et

have a screen length of 1 m and were placed close to the groundwater table within the saturated zone table 1 while vegetation was not present at b a and dn a ds a hosted plant communities commonly observed for secondary dunes table 1 sm 1 and sm 2 were characterized by upper salt marsh plant communities and sm 3 was marked by a salicornia stricta pioneer zone groundwater from the monitoring

tide water levels were obtained from wsv 2017 for the tide gauges wangerooge nord latitude 53 806 longitude 7 929 and wangerooge west latitude 53 776 longitude 7 868 which are located in close proximity to the sampling transect 15 km at the neighboring island wangerooge high tide water levels were used to calculate i the number of floodings at the sampling locations within 365 days prior to each sampling campaign and ii the time passed since the last flood reached a site prior to sampling for this purpose ground surface elevations were measured at all well locations with a differential gps leica sr530 vertical accuracy of 2 cm in spring 2016 table 1 because water levels slightly differ in the open north sea and the back barrier regions cf holt et al 2019 data from tide gauge wangerooge nord and wangerooge west were used to approximate high tide water levels at the locations north to the dune ridge b a and dn a and south to the dune ridge ds a sm 1 sm 2 and sm 3 respectively due to technical issues data was lacking for some days from august until november 2015 at wangerooge nord and wangerooge west data was used instead n 72 measurements results show that the low lying locations sm 2 sm 3 and b a surface elevation 2 masl were subject to 50 floodings per year whereas sm 1 and dn a were only occasionally flooded fig 2 table 1 si fig e1 e2 dune location ds a has not been impacted by floods in recent years note that we applied tide data for the flooding frequency calculations which corresponds to still water levels resulting from the tide and regional wind and pressure setups following the approach of holt et al 2017 the impact of wave setup and runup respectively was not accounted for a qualitative comparison of groundwater head data with tide data revealed a good match between head indicated and tide indicated flood events si fig e2 particularly at the salt marsh sites sm 1 to 3 this demonstrates that tide data is generally applicable to estimate annual flooding frequencies at the here investigated study site we expect that the slight underestimation of actual flooding frequencies at the elevated northern beach has no considerable impact on the calculated annual flooding frequencies and thereby on our hydrochemical interpretations 2 7 approximation of salinities and major ion concentrations holt et al 2017 established an empirical logarithmic relationship between flooding frequency and near surface groundwater salinities at the ostplate 1 sal gw a ln ω b g l 1 where a is 4 85 ω is the flooding frequency in the year prior to sampling and b is 0 047 this equation was based on high resolution porewater sampling campaigns at the ostplate n 983 sampling points and yields an estimation of near surface groundwater salinities where the effect of hydro geo logic processes having an impact on the salinities is regarded in a lumped fashion including inundation and precipitation this relationship was used to calculate theoretical salinities for the range of flooding frequencies observed at the ostplate theoretical salinities were then transformed into theoretical major ion concentrations to evaluate if groundwater species resulted from binary mixing of fresh and saline endmembers the hydrochemical composition of seawater salinity 32 g l 1 collected at spiekeroog was used for this purpose cf seibert et al 2018 note that estimated salinity and major ion concentrations in the following i e lines in fig 3 correspond to diluted seawater assuming that major ion contributions of low ionic strength precipitation are negligible 3 results 3 1 major ion chemistry groundwater salinities were fresh within the dune regions dn a ds a usually below 0 6 g l 1 throughout the year fig 3a however a steep increase of salinities 10 g l 1 was observed in january 2017 15 days after a storm flood reached location dn a fig 2 and salinities remained elevated even in march 2017 cf seibert et al 2019a groundwater at b a was brackish with salinities in the range of 20 to 24 g l 1 highest values were measured in winter 2016 2017 reflecting the impact of recent flood events fig 2 salinities at the salt marsh were increasing with proximity to the sea groundwater at sm 1 and sm 2 was brackish 9 and 17 g l 1 while salinities at sm 3 were matching seawater 32 g l in general observed salinities fit well with predictions using eq 1 compare symbols and line see rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse fig 3a note that rmse and nse could only be calculated for locations with 1 floodings in previous 365 days since the logarithmic eq 1 does not yield predictions for 0 floodings the non flooded site ds a was thus not regarded in the rmse and nse calculations observations for most major ions i e chloride cl sulfate so4 2 sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 resembled the described salinity trends fig 3b d h as for salinity major ion concentrations match well with predictions using eq 1 and applying the ratio of salinity ion concentration of seawater reported in seibert et al 2018 compare symbols and lines see rmse and nse fig 3b d h in addition the evaluation of major ion concentrations as a function of salinity showed that major ions behaved mostly conservatively meaning their concentrations resulted from binary mixing between seawater and precipitation endmembers si fig c1 however this did not account for hco3 fig 3c si fig c1b hco3 concentrations were low at dn a ds a and b a 4 mm fig 3c while higher and seasonally varying hco3 concentrations were detected at sm 2 and sm 3 3 5 to 9 5 mm seawater had the lowest hco3 concentrations 2 7 mm seibert et al 2018 demonstrating that the carbonate chemistry was not governed by simple mixing of fresh and saline endmembers moreover deviations from the binary mixing line were detected for cations in some samples e g ca2 at dn a and sm 2 si fig c1f 3 2 redox chemistry organic carbon and nutrients doc

labile dom 18 8 mlbl lowest contributions of labile dom 5 mlbl were detected at the densely vegetated but barely non flooded site ds a iterr values indicated a large fraction of terrigenous dom 40 at the vegetated sites sm 1 ds a sm 2 which decreased with proximity to the sea located north and south of b a and sm 3 respectively fig 4d fig 1c nh4 concentrations increased with flooding frequencies and salinities at the salt marsh up to 166 μm at sm 3 fig 4e si fig c2e concentrations at dune dn a ds a 12 μm and beach b a 6 to 28 μm were lower po4 3 concentrations were high and seasonally varying at sm 1 up to 58 μm fig 4f and dn a up to 18 μm lowest po4 3 concentrations were measured at ds a 2 μm δ13c dic signatures ranged between 16 0 and 3 6 fig 4g and were depleted in 13c compared to seawater dic 0 7 most negative signatures 16 0 to 13 4 were observed at the densely vegetated sites sm 2 sm 1 and ds a signatures at sm 3 dn a and b a were less negative 9 3 to 3 6 3 3 redox chemistry electron acceptors salt marsh sm 1 2 3 and dune locations dn a ds a showed lowest and highest ph values respectively 6 9 to 7 9 fig 5 a eh potentials marked increasingly reducing conditions at the salt marsh 300 mv to 210 mv whereas redox conditions were oxic to suboxic 580 mv to 130 mv at the dune and beach locations fig 5b do was present at the dune locations throughout the year but seasonally varying 40 to 320 μm fig 5c elevated concentrations of do at b a were only measured in winter 130 to 260 μm when the beach was impacted by storm floods fig 2 generally do concentrations at the salt marsh were low 10 μm except for more elevated concentrations in april 2016 20 to 60 μm high levels of no3 were detected at dn a up to 385 μm fig 5d and in one sample at b a in september 2016 75 μm no3 concentrations were below the detection limit for the remainder of the wells note that no3 detection limits were relatively large for some of the brackish saline groundwater samples as samples were diluted prior to the ic measurements compare si table b1 although this circumstance limits our interpretations of the no3 patterns we expect that no3 was fully depleted in the brackish saline samples showing iron manganese oxide to sulfate reducing conditions i e all salt marsh samples mndiss was always detected at sm 2 13 to 21 μm fig 5e and concentrations remained below the detection limit at the other locations fediss concentrations i e primarily ferrous iron were high and strongly varying at sm 1 and sm 2 21 to 489 μm fig 5f sm 3 showed much lower concentrations up to

values at sm 3 demonstrated so4 2 loss throughout the year fig 5g δso4 2 was 0 2 mm at dn a and ds a except for one sample collected in march 2017 0 6 mm δ34s so4 2 signatures were similar to seawater so4 2 21 vs v cdt böttcher et al 2007 for most brackish to saline groundwater samples fig 5h si fig c3h however samples at sm 1 23 9 vs v cdt sm 3 23 2 vs v cdt and b a 21 5 vs v cdt were slightly enriched in 34s compared to seawater whereas freshwater at dn a 9 5 vs v cdt and ds a 5 0 vs v cdt was enriched in 32s due to the very low h2s concentrations 2 μm δ34s h2s signatures could only be determined for sm 3 31 1 vs v cdt 4 discussion 4 1 the role of inundation and precipitation for the major ion chemistry the agreement between predicted and observed major ion concentrations fig 3 shows that major ion compositions in near surface groundwater at the ostplate are mainly a function of the flooding frequency which agrees with the general conclusions of holt et al 2017 regarding near surface groundwater salinities on evolving barrier islands under mesotidal conditions yet the data of this study indicates non conservative behavior of cations at some locations fig 3 si fig c1 this demonstrates additional hydrogeochemical reactions impacting the major ion chemistry besides binary mixing of seawater and precipitation endmembers first the infiltration of precipitation into the calcareous sandy sediments at the ostplate is accompanied by the dissolution of calcite seibert et al 2018 explaining the surplus of ca2 and hco3 ions in fresh dune groundwater fig 6 a si fig c1b f second cation exchange presents an important process affecting cation concentrations in coastal aquifers thereby resulting in solute cation concentrations lower or higher than expected from binary mixing of seawater and freshwater endmembers e g appelo and geirnaert 1991 stuyfzand 1993 molar na cl ratios above the ratio of seawater 0 857 appelo and postma 2005 demonstrate ongoing cation exchange i e aquifer freshening at the dune locations during most seasons fig 6b dn a ds a appelo and postma 2005 3 0 5 ca 2 na x 0 5 ca x na while most of the remaining locations show na cl ratios close to or slightly above seawater lower na cl ratios at dn a ds a and b a in winter fig 6b mark seasonal salinization presumably linked to the more frequent flood events during this period fig 2 moreover stuyfzand 1986 2008 introduced the base exchange index bex to assess if cation exchange may occur 4 bex na k mg 2 1 0716 cl meq l 1 where na k mg2 and cl are measured solute concentrations positive and negative bex values show if an aquifer is freshening or salinizing respectively to avoid the interpretation of false bex values which can result from silicate dissolution and charge imbalances stuyfzand 2008 proposed boundary limits serving as additional thresholds for calculated bex values besides the applied electrical balance threshold section 2 5 eleven samples were fulfilling these conditions and are presented in the following fig 6c d in line with the na cl ratios bex values for the dunes mainly show freshening trends dn a ds a 0 6 to 2 3 meq l 1 fig 6c d similar to the range of bex values reported for the much older freshwater lens at the western part of spiekeroog 0 5 to 2 6 meq l 1 seibert et al 2018 in general the prevalence of na cl ratios 0 857 na clmean 0 95 together with positive bex values bexmean 2 3 meq l 1 points toward the ongoing expansion of fresh brackish groundwater at the ostplate due to the infiltration of precipitation and an overall increase in surface elevations holt et al 2017 4 2 sources and degradation of organic matter the major fraction of doc at the vegetated sites ds a sm 1 sm 2 originates from terrestrial plants which release organic matter om into the subsurface this is demonstrated by i the high doc concentrations up to 2 000 µm fig 4a ii elevated relative abundances of aromatic compounds in dom 20 dom fig 4b and iii iterr ratios 0 4 fig 4d on the other hand doc concentrations at the unvegetated dune dn a and beach b a locations as well as the pioneer marsh sm 3 were lower 600 µm and had higher abundances of labile dom 8 12 mlbl fig 4c providing evidence for an increasingly marine origin docseawater 200 µm mlbl seawater 19 mlbl the contribution of labile dom from the marine environment is supported by the finding that it was correlated with salinity si fig c2c p value of pearson correlation 0 02 therefore redox processes of near surface groundwater at the ostplate are driven by both inputs i e terrestrial and labile marine om and the relative role of the two electron donors is site dependent regarding om mineralization we postulate that its intensity is primarily controlled by i flooding frequency conveying labile dom to the sites ii vegetation resulting in large inputs of om and possibly enhancing aerobic respiration via radial root o2 loss rol and iii fluctuating groundwater tables leading to aeration of the near surface sediments this is evidenced by first nh4 concentration patterns marking a general increase of om mineralization with flooding frequency salinity fig 4e si fig c2e which are linked to the input of labile marine om fig 4c si fig c2c second the important role of vegetation as driver for om mineralization becomes evident when taking into account that concentrations of nh4 and hco3 were higher at the vegetated salt marsh compared to the beach b a vs sm 2 fig 3c 4e and that hco3 concentrations are a function of doc concentrations fig 7 a in addition the injection of o2 into the subsurface via rol which has been shown for several marsh plants e g spartina alterniflora spartina anglica and juncus roemerianus e g mendelssohn et al 1995 and references cited therein holmer et al 2002 colmer 2003 might amplify om mineralization at the vegetated sites in fact rol in combination with faunal burrowing results in aerobic degradation of om while it hampers the consumption of less favorable electron acceptors and or causes their re oxidation gribsholt and kristensen 2002 kostka et al 2002 hyun et al 2007 third seasonally fluctuating groundwater tables close to the sediment surface might contribute to more intense om mineralization as an example the fluctuating groundwater table at sm 2 and sm 3 caused a frequent change between saturated unsaturated conditions in the om exposed surface sediments si fig e1 presumably leading to aeration of the sediments and thereby enhancing aerobic respiration more intense om mineralization at the vegetated salt marsh agrees with the behavior of electron acceptors showing iron to sulfate reducing conditions at the latter while oxic to nitrate reducing conditions were found at dn a ds a and b a see section redox processes coupled to the oxidation of organic matter therefore we further postulate that locations frequently exposed to flood events conveying labile om and do to the sites in conjunction with the presence of terrestrial biomass and fluctuating near surface groundwater tables result in hotspots for doc mobilization and respiration respectively the microbial oxidation of om results in the production of carbon dioxide co2 which causes the dissolution of marine carbonates 5 h 2 co 3 caco 3 ca 2 2 hco 3 δ13c dic signatures indicate dissolution of biogenic co2 as all samples were depleted in 13c compared to inorganic carbon in seawater fig 4g and atmospheric co2 e g francey et al 1999 burt et al 2016 moreover δ13c dic signatures were negatively correlated with observed doc concentrations fig 7b p value of spearman rank correlation 0 01 marking different co2 origins for the sampling sites for a closed system dic is derived in equal portions from the om source and dissolving marine carbonate caco3 eq 5 which typically has δ13c signatures close to 0 see δ13c dic value of seawater fig 4g thus assuming mixing of the two carbon endmembers h2co3 and caco3 during closed calcite dissolution the oc endmember h2co3 must have a δ13c signature corresponding to the two fold of the observed δ13c dic hco3 signature fig 7c the estimated δ13c om signatures for the sites mainly exposed to marine om b a dn a sm 3 agree with δ13c ranges reported for marine macroalgae and mussels collected at the back barrier tidal area of spiekeroog island 17 9 to 10 0 böttcher et al 1998 fig 7c on the other hand estimated δ13c om signatures for om with a suspected larger fraction of terrigenous provenance ds a sm1 sm 2 agree with signatures reported for top sediments collected at the ostplate salt marsh 29 9 to 21 5 pollmann et al 2021 fig 7c as well as similar salt marsh environments e g 30 5 to 24 0 c3 salt marsh sediments goslin et al 2017 28 6 1 3 upland c3 salt marsh plants peterson et al 1985 27 5 to 24 top 20 cm sediments of a semi natural wadden sea salt marsh mueller et al 2019 seemingly δ13c dic om signatures confirm the proposed om sources for the different sampling sits however we recognize that the evolution of δ13c dic signatures at the ostplate might not take place entirely under closed system conditions for instance at the more elevated dune locations here assuming that δ13c dic signatures evolve under open system conditions calcite dissolution would result in δ13c dic signatures controlled by soil co2 and solution ph e g deines et al 1974 appelo and postma 2005 yet the agreement between δ13c signatures and proposed om sources shows that the assumption of om mineralization under closed system conditions is generally legitimate for the low lying and regularly flooded ostplate finally our findings show that doc concentrations 0 6 mm are indicative for the contribution of terrestrial om while lower concentrations were found for samples only exposed to marine om 4 3 redox processes coupled to the oxidation of organic matter 4 3 1 aerobic respiration aerobic respiration is the dominant metabolism for the oxidation of organic matter within fresh dune sediments where do was found throughout the year fig 5c our findings agree with a study by snyder et al 2004 who reported that aerobic respiration governs the oxidation of oc within near surface groundwater on sapelo island georgia u s a previous investigations on the much thicker freshwater lens in the western part of spiekeroog have shown that anaerobic pathways comprising denitrification metal oxide and sulfate reduction become dominant in deeper older groundwater 2 4 years residence time seibert et al 2018 at the beach b a do was detected in winter when frequency and intensity of storm floods were highest fig 2 while do was depleted and redox processes controlled by anaerobic metabolisms during the remaining seasons hence it appears that aerobic respiration in supratidal near surface beach porewaters could result from the advective flow of oxygenated seawater in winter this assumption is supported by salinity increases at b a for the november and january campaigns 4g l 1 fig 3a in addition less microbial activity and substrate availability during seasons of lower temperature e g thamdrup et al 1998 al raei et al 2009 might contribute to a switch from anaerobic to aerobic pathways previous studies on the biogeochemistry of intertidal beach sediments on spiekeroog waska et al 2019a ahrens et al 2020 and the french aquitanian coast anschutz et al 2009 charbonnier et al 2013 2016 support the general paradigm that aerobic respiration seasonally dominates om mineralization in near surface porewaters of permeable beach sands similar conclusions regarding the effect of advective flow on the developing biogeochemistry were drawn by de beer et al 2005 for organic poor intertidal sandy north sea sediments however they found that intense aerobic degradation was restricted to the top 10 cm while microbial sulfate reduction msr proceeded concurrently and usually dominated at depth 10 cm further research efforts are needed to clarify the role of msr in sandy inter supratidal coastal sediments 4 3 2 nitrogen cycling nh4 presents the dominant dissolved inorganic nitrogen din species in near surface groundwater at most locations which points to the mineralization of om see sources and degradation of organic matter patterns of rising nh4 concentrations demonstrate an increase of om mineralization with higher flooding frequency vegetation coverage and fluctuating groundwater tables yet we recognize that low nh4 concentrations might locally result from nitrification followed by denitrification or plant uptake koretsky and miller 2008 considering for instance lower concentrations of nh4 at sm 2 up to 72 µm fig 4e compared to sm 3 up to 166 µm no3 was absent at most locations fig 5d which could be indicative of low no3 inputs or a loss of din to the atmosphere via denitrification the only exception was site dn a where high no3 concentrations were measured up to 385 μm reckhardt et al 2015 reported equally high concentrations up to 310 μm for near surface groundwater collected at a different dune location on spiekeroog and we have previously suggested that nutrient rich remains of migrating birds such as bird guano or nh4 released during om mineralization are potential nitrogen sources in this region seibert et al 2018 similarly schutte et al 2018 observed high no3 concentrations median 431 μm in shallow beach pore waters of two barrier islands in the southeastern usa they could demonstrate that nitrification rates coupled to ammonification of buried marine om can exceed the stoichiometry of aerobic nitrification due to the dissolution of excess oxygen at the interface of the unsaturated saturated zones in accordance with schutte et al 2018 and considering that the northern dune base at spiekeroog is impacted and eroded by storm floods fig 2 ammonification nitrification of labile marine om recently buried close to the fluctuating groundwater table si fig e1 possibly caused the high no3 loads evidence for this mechanism are i a high contribution of labile dom 8 4 mlbl fig 4c which traces the input of labile marine om ii the detection of po4 3 with a mean concentration of 9 µm nearly matching the redfield ratio 16 1 for n p taking the mean no3 concentration of 140 µm into account and iii a δ13c dic signature similar to the other sites exposed to marine om 7 fig 4g for the unvegetated beach and dune areas large fractions of n might have been lost to the atmosphere via nitrification followed by denitrification cf marchant et al 2016 2017 as suggested for intertidal beach sediments at spiekeroog ahrens et al 2020 or to the water column of the sea by drainage of anoxic nh4 rich porewaters in the intertidal zone e g beck et al 2017 in contrast previous studies on the biogeochemistry of more densely vegetated salt marshes have suggested that the dominant fraction of n is re cycled and temporarily stored in macrophytes tobias and neubauer 2019 and references cited therein 4 3 3 iron and manganese cycling high fediss concentrations at the vegetated salt marsh sm 1 and sm 2 fig 5f point toward anaerobic mineralization of om coupled to microbial reduction of iron oxides however these patterns could also result from a rapid cycling of sulfur where h2s produced during msr chemically reacts with sedimentary iron oxides e g thamdrup et al 1994 thus anaerobic om mineralization in the interior of the salt marsh is coupled to i microbial reduction of iron oxides ii msr or iii both metabolisms proceeding simultaneously the prevalence of microbial iron reduction would confirm more recent studies showing that this process can dominate in bioturbated salt marsh environments e g kostka et al 2002 gribsholt et al 2003 hyun et al 2007 although msr is generally viewed as the by far most dominant anaerobic metabolism in marine sediments including salt marshes jørgensen 1982 howarth and hobbie 1982 howarth 1984 a detailed analysis of the sedimentary iron phases and accompanying incubation experiments canfield et al 1993 should be carried out in future studies to clarify which anaerobic metabolism dominates in the investigated salt marsh sediments furthermore the iron cycle within the salt marsh might involve the formation of siderite which acts as sink for both fediss and carbonate this assumption is corroborated by mineral sisiderite values 0 2 in our study fig 8 a even though this process is anomalous in marine h2s rich environments coleman et al 1993 showed that it can take place in salt marsh sediments and is mediated by microbial iron oxide reduction recently lin et al 2020 showed for east anglian salt marsh sediments that siderite formation was rapid within 400 hrs in case sufficient fediss and alkalinity were present the authors further argued that low sulfate reduction counteracting high ph might cause ideal conditions for the formation of siderite similar hydrogeochemical conditions were observed at sm 1 and sm 2 suggesting that siderite formation takes place at the investigated salt marsh mndiss detected at sm 2 marks the reduction of manganese oxides presumably manganese reduction is caused by chemical reduction via reaction with fe ii rather than microbial reduction considering the high fediss concentrations and the fact that manganese oxides are rapidly reduced by dissolved fe ii postma 1985 myers and nealson 1988 similarly snyder et al 2004 attributed small peaks of mndiss in the presence of high fe ii in near surface groundwater mainly to the chemical reduction of manganese oxides in addition mndiss might also result from chemical reduction via h2s myers and nealson 1988 snyder et al 2004 mndiss concentrations might be further impacted by precipitation of ca rhodochrosite fig 8b böttcher and dietzel 2010 or sorption to mineral surfaces e g nyffeler et al 1984 the absence of notable concentrations of fediss and mndiss at the beach b a and dune locations dn a ds a shows that anaerobic oxidation of om coupled to mn fe oxide reduction pathways is less relevant compared to aerobic respiration here or that re oxidative processes lead to an efficient re oxidation and precipitation e g balzer 1982 high po4 3 concentrations detected at sm 1 can result from both the release of sorbed p during iron oxide reduction carlyle and hill 2001 or organic bound p during om mineralization surprisingly po4 3 concentrations at sm 2 and sm 3 were much lower than at sm 1 fig 4f despite higher expected om mineralization rates see section sources and degradation of organic matter which were to some extent linked to iron oxide reduction considering the elevated fediss concentrations at sm 2 fig 5f this finding could result from precipitation of vivianite and or hydroxyapatite following microbial reduction of iron oxides zachara et al 2002 slomp and van cappellen 2004 however the hydrochemical data did not provide evidence for the precipitation of the latter minerals at sm 2 and sm 3 as sivivianite and sihydroxyapatite values were 0 for all campaigns fig 8c d except for one sample collected at sm 2 in april 2016 thus lower po4 3 concentrations at sm 2 and sm 3 compared to sm 1 might be related to different compositions of the degrading om and or the available iron oxides groundwater at sm 1 was supersaturated for vivianite and hydroxyapatite during most of the year indicating that both minerals and or its precursors might precipitate furthermore hydroxyapatite could seasonally control po4 3 concentrations at dn a fig 8d 4 3 4 sulfur cycling so4 2 concentrations in most samples behaved almost conservatively with respect to salinity si fig c1c particularly when compared to highly sulfate reducing conditions found in similar sandy surface sediments of the southern north sea e g tidal flats böttcher et al 1998 al raei et al 2009 yet we detected deviations from conservative so4 2 concentration distributions for some samples δso4 2 fig 5g showing loss i e msr sulfide oxidation sox and gain msr sox of so4 2 respectively δso4 2 values demonstrated that the salt marsh sm 2 sm 3 and beach b a wells alternate between situations where msr sox and msr sox respectively while sm 3 was the only well showing net msr throughout all campaigns fig 5g the absence of h2s which is produced during msr is probably linked to the fast reaction with fe iii to form iron sulfides berner 1984 or reaction with mn iv thamdrup et al 1994 msr is typically accompanied by sulfur isotope fractionation leaving residual so4 2 enriched and produced sulfide depleted in heavy 34s respectively kaplan and rittenberg 1964 rees 1973 hartmann and nielsen 2012 therefore δ34s so4 2 signatures heavier than seawater so4 2 21 vs v cdt in north sea seawater böttcher et al 2007 indicate ongoing msr whereas lighter δ34s so4 2 signatures show the input of so4 2 from other sources e g atmospheric so4 2 emissions of reduced sulfur gases from salt marshes or so4 2 derived from sox δ34s so4 2 signatures of most brackish samples ranged from 21 to 24 vs v cdt fig 5h demonstrating ongoing msr despite the lack of traceable concentrations of h2s the only available δ34s h2s signature at sm 3 which was highly depleted in 34s 31 1 vs v cdt confirms ongoing msr the resulting sulfur isotope fractionation of 54 3 at sm 3 is in the range observed for similar coastal sediments in the southern north sea e g böttcher et al 2000 δ34s so4 2 signatures in freshwater considerably lower than those in brackish and marine samples fig 5h demonstrate the input of atmospheric so4 2 from natural or anthropogenic 34s depleted sources reckhardt et al 2017 kristensen et al 2000 with an additional impact of 34s depleted so4 2 derived from pyrite oxidation as discussed in seibert et al 2019a 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to investigate the environmental factors controlling the hydrogeochemistry of near surface groundwater on a young developing barrier island under mesotidal conditions covering supratidal beach dune and salt marsh sub environments the linkage of season inundation and vegetation to the hydrogeochemical processes were of particular interest the results of our study lead to the following conclusions the major ion chemistry is a function of the annual flooding frequency in addition calcite dissolution and cation exchange have an impact on major ion concentrations the redox chemistry is primarily controlled by vegetation patterns and flooding frequencies conveying labile om to the sites the prevalence of terrestrial electron donors increases with distance to the sea while labile om is a function of salinity dune locations are characterized by aerobic respiration sulfate and iron reducing conditions have been encountered in the salt marsh as the role of microbial sulfate reduction for near surface groundwater in permeable coastal sands remains subject of an ongoing debate it should be explored in more detail as a first approach the physico chemical interpretation of pore water compositions provided indications for the formation of minerals such as carbonates and phosphates triggered by redox reactions future work should investigate mineral formation in similar salt marsh sediments by combining field with experimental and detailed solid phase analytical investigations the role of seasonal effects on the hydrogeochemistry such as temperature and seawater compositions has to be studied in more detail therefore future studies should carry out field campaigns with a higher temporal and

4596,daily rainfall simulated by general circulation models gcms are usually provided on coarse grids and need some adjustment i e bias correction to meet historical statistics observed in gauged based data moreover for hydrological applications the simulated rainfall is needed at fine user specified grids to be used as input into hydrological models simulated rainfall also must preserve the spatial variability observed in gauged data here we explore an alternative approach to downscale daily gcm rainfall simulation at any desired grid resolution using a bayesian kriging bk model that better addresses parameter uncertainties compared with traditional approaches the bk model also attempts to reproduce using downscaled rainfall the spatial variability observed in gauged rainfall data the proposed model is tested using historical data from 59 rainfall gauges located in south korea and from retrospective simulations and projected climate change scenarios simulated by the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao model in the first step a bernoulli gamma bayesian model is fit to the observed daily rainfall the resulting parameters are interpolated into a fine resolution grid through the bk model where the uncertainties are considered and a set of parameters for downscaling and bias correction through quantile mapping qm is generated for the fine resolution grid in the second step a bernoulli gamma model is fit to the gridded daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model and a qm or parametric distribution mapping is employed to simultaneously downscale and correct the bias from the retrospective daily rainfall simulated by the gcm the results show the adequacy of the proposed model to downscale gcm determined daily rainfall at any specified grid scale accounting for bias correction and parameter uncertainties the spatial variability observed in the gauged data was reasonably well reproduced in retrospective gcm rainfall for future rainfall the proposed model allowed identification of an increase in spatial variability in the hadgem2 ao simulations of scenario rcp6 the bk model can easily be extended to other applications including downscaling of temperature or future rainfall simulated from other models and approaches keywords daily rainfall bias correction bayesian model downscaling climate change 1 introduction general circulation models gcms are currently the best tool to quantitatively assess future changes in rainfall patterns in response to the increase in average global temperature however the typical coarse scale spatial resolution of gcms associated with intrinsic complexity in modeling the rainfall process leads to significant systematic biases in simulated rain even when produced by fine scale regional circulation models rcms numerous statistical models have been employed to correct such biases e g berg et al 2012 sachindra et al 2014 cannon et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2015 mehrotra and sharma 2015 um et al 2016 mehrotra et al 2018 smitha et al 2018 when simulated rainfall is produced at coarse scale grids the bias correction procedure is usually accompanied by a downscaling algorithm to carry rainfall to the station scale zhang 2005 or more often at finer resolution grid boxes e g vrac et al 2007 wood et al 2004 a variety of dynamical and statistical models has been employed for downscaling e g yoon et al 2012 zhang et al apr 2012 pierce et al 2013 hwang and graham 2013 glotter et al 2014 bastola and misra 2014 nahar et al 2017 eum and cannon 2017 and comparisons among methods are routinely evaluated e g abatzoglou and brown 2012 gutmann et al 2012 gutmann et al 2014 due to its relative simplicity and ability to downscale gcm rainfall at any desired position together with bias correction statistical models are often preferred for bias correction and downscaling when the goal is to simulate rainfall at specific points usually for climate change impact assessment such as input into hydrological models e g wood et al 2004 in this case the rainfall simulated by the gcm needs to be estimated at the desired points usually a fine resolution grid where no observation exists the gcm rainfall can be first bias corrected and then downscaled hwang and graham 2013 or vice versa abatzoglou and brown 2012 among the bias correction algorithms local intensity scaling loci power transformation pwtr constructed analogs ca and quantile mapping qm and its extensions e g qdm dqm equidistant quantile matching are the most popular e g schmidli et al 2006 leander and buishand 2007 lenderink et al 2007 li et al 2010 cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 li et al 2018 smitha et al 2018 these methods are applied directly for fine scale rainfall simulations from rcms e g laflamme et al 2016 li et al 2017 or associated with statistical methods of spatial disaggregation sd to produce downscaled rainfall among the sd methods one often employs the bias correction and spatial disaggregation bscd algorithm wood et al 2004 and its extensions sdqm sddqm sdqdm etc we refer the reader to the works of abatzoglou and brown 2012 hwang and graham 2013 nahar et al 2017 and eum and cannon 2017 for examples of bscd and related methods a cumbersome of both statistical and dynamical methods of downscaling is much their inability to produce robust statistics at the desired points with the major uncertainties for instance it is not common to express the uncertainty for bilinear interpolation when applying it for spatial disaggregation associated with that a robust method of downscaling at a fine resolution grid scale should be able to reproduce the spatial variability of observed data particularly when simulating daily rainfall as input to hydrological models the spatial resolution of gcms as well as of rcms prevents them from simulating the correct spatial variability of daily rainfall as observed in gauged data even after applying traditional bias correction methods lee et al 2019 here we propose to advance this field by generating over a fine resolution grid all parameters associated with a bias correction algorithm incorporating kriging functions cressie 1993 within a bayesian inference framework gelman et al 2013 in particular we employ the qm algorithm or parametric distribution mapping using a mixture of bernoulli gamma distributions together with spatial disaggregation from the kriging interpolation to simultaneously downscale and correct the bias from rainfall simulated by gcms the advantage of the proposed model is its ability to better consider the uncertainties in the spatial disaggregation parameters i e kriging parameters while seeking to preserve in the simulated rainfall the spatial variability observed in the historical daily rainfall data thus the proposed models are able to downscale and provide bias corrected simulated rainfall from gcms at any specified spatial scale together with the estimates of all parameter uncertainties involved which are poorly discussed in the literature to the best of our knowledge this is the first approach to explore the use of bayesian kriging inference for downscaling of gcm rainfall the model is evaluated using daily rainfall series from several stations in korea and retrospective and future rainfall simulated by the cmip5 hadgem2 ao model after this introduction this study is organized as follows the rainfall data and climate change scenario simulations are presented in section 2 the methodology describing the proposed bayesian kriging model for spatial interpolation as well as the bias correction and downscaling approaches are introduced in section 3 the results are presented in section 4 finally in section 5 we offer a discussion and a summary of this work 2 rainfall data and scenario simulations 2 1 rainfall data daily rainfall series from 59 rainfall gauges located in korea fig 1 are used to evaluate the proposed model the rainfall data are provided by the automatic synoptic observation system asos operated by the korean meteorological administration kma and covers the 1973 2011 historical period 2 2 scenario simulation and downscaling the national institute of meteorological research of korea nimr has selected the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao gcm model for use in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 for this reason we adopted daily rainfall simulations provided by the hadgem2 ao model to evaluate the ability of the model described in this work to downscale such simulations to a finer grid the horizontal resolution of the hadgem2 ao grid is about 1 87 longitude and 1 25 latitude fig 1 displays the location of the gcm grid points over the domain of this work the reference or historical period of the gcm simulation is from 1960 through 2005 for the future rainfall scenarios we adopted the representative concentration pathways rcp 6 0 scenario with daily rainfall data from 2011 to 2051 the gcm rainfall simulations are downscaled to a finer grid of about 0 25 resolution fig 1 which might be more appropriate for rainfall simulations as input to hydrological models the grid was designed to cover a rectangular region that includes all rainfall gauges as climate models tend to overestimate light rain while moderate and extreme rainfalls are underestimated over south korea lima et al 2016 so et al 2017 we adopted a bias correction algorithm as explained in the next section to correct the quantiles of simulated daily rainfall series for both the reference and future periods 3 methodology fig 2 summarizes the general methodology employed in this work to obtain downscaled bias corrected gcm rainfall simulation at finer grid scales our proposed approach is divided into two phases 1 estimation of the observed rainfall distribution parameters at a finer grid whose scale can be set as needed and 2 downscaling and bias correction of gcm rainfall simulations at the finer grid the major contribution of this work consists in application of a bayesian kriging bk in fig 2 model to interpolate the distribution parameters of observed rainfall data at the specified grid points by doing that we try to better address the parameter uncertainties and spatial variance of the observed rainfall data in our case we adopted the bernoulli gamma distribution for the observed rainfall under a bayesian inference framework hb model in fig 2 this is also an important contribution of this work as it allows proper spatial interpolation of the two parameters of the gamma distribution which are highly correlated in the second phase we fit a bernoulli gamma distribution model b g model in fig 2 to the retrospective gcm rainfall data and apply a quantile mapping approach qm in fig 2 to generate bias corrected gcm rainfall simulations at the finer grid details of each phase are presented in the following sections 3 1 framework of the bayesian kriging model bayesian models have been successfully applied in hydrology studies due to their versatility and powerfulness in dealing with parameter uncertainties and small sample size the framework of bayesian inference in particular hierarchical bayesian models allows inclusion of more information compared with most traditional statistical approaches during the estimation phase which leads to more robust estimators it is not in the scope of this work to explore the literature in bayesian models for which we refer the reader to kwon et al 2008 lima and lall 2010 liang et al 2011 renard 2011 haddad et al 2012 viglione et al 2013 lima et al 2016 and ragno et al 2018 for examples of bayesian models in hydrology to banerjee et al 2004 for theoretical aspects of bayesian kriging models and to sahu and mardia 2005 and verdin et al 2015 for recent applications assume that we have estimates of a given parameter s e g shape parameters of the gamma distribution for n rainfall gauges with coordinates x longitude and y latitude we consider that the spatial distribution of those parameters follows a multivariate normal distribution mvn 1 s mvn μ τ 2 σ where μ denotes the mean vector τ 2 0 controls the overall spatial variability of s and σ is a positive definite matrix of size n the spatial correlation of s is addressed through a parametric formulation for σ 2 σ ij f d ij θ in which d ij is the distance between sites i and j and θ is a set of correlation parameters in our case we adopt the powered exponential family for f d ij θ 3 f d ij ϕ κ exp ϕ d ij κ where ϕ 0 controls how the correlation decays with distance and 0 κ 2 regulates the smoothing degree of s across space for high values of ϕ there is rapid decay in the correlation whereas a slow decay applies for small values of ϕ the parameters expressed in eqs 1 can be estimated using traditional methods in ordinary kriging e g cressie 1993 but here we adopt bayesian inference banerjee et al 2004 gelman et al 2013 which provides an interesting framework to handle the uncertainties involved in estimating such parameters particularly for limited data over the spatial domain hence we need to define the prior distributions for the parameters μ τ 2 ϕ and κ which should express knowledge if any we have about those parameters as we do not know any relevant information about the vector μ we assume independent and weakly informative distributions for each parameter μ i i 1 n 4 μ i 1 it is worth noting that μ i can be constrained to positive values e g when it represents the shape parameter of the gamma distribution in this case eq 4 must be modified accordingly for this work as our parameter s is the shape of the gamma distribution we used the gamma distribution g 0 001 0 001 as a prior for μ i which is mathematically appealing for noninformative priors in the positive values domain gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 for the overall variance parameter τ 2 a common weakly informative conjugate prior distribution gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 is adopted 5 τ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 the prior distribution for ϕ should reflect the expected range of correlations at the minimum and maximum distances d ij to avoid identifiability issues for very high correlations at the maximum distance richardson 1992 for that we assume a minimum correlation of ρ min 0 99 at the minimum distance d min and a maximum correlation of ρ max 0 1 at the maximum distance d max hence we set the prior distribution for ϕ as 6 ϕ u ϕ min ϕ max where u denotes the uniform distribution therefore ϕ min and ϕ max in eq 6 can be determined as follows 7 ϕ min log ρ max d max 8 ϕ max log ρ min d min here d min 0 0003 degrees and d max 6 74 degrees about 600 km which lead to very high ranges of ϕ min and ϕ max for small changes of ρ min and ρ max we also noticed that a high range in eq 6 leads to difficulties in the process described below of parameter estimation as for the smoothing parameter κ we just set κ 1 as recommended in the literature richardson 1992 since we do not have any reliable prior information we also tested a uniform prior in the range 0 2 for κ and observed that the estimation process through monte carlo markov chain simulation see below is extremely slow and hard to achieve under the bayesian framework the joint posterior density of the set of parameters θ μ τ 2 ϕ can be written using the bayes rule as 9 pr θ s l s θ π θ l x l s θ π θ with l s as the marginal likelihood of observations and acting as a normalization constant to ensure that the integral of pr θ s is equal to 1 and π θ is the prior distribution of the parameter set given by eqs 4 6 the joint posterior distribution of the parameters is finally obtained by replacing the appropriate likelihood function l s θ derived from eq 1 and the prior distributions eqs 4 6 into eq 9 however its analytical integration with respect to the set of parameters θ is not tractable and we used the well known markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to sample from it we coded all models in the r platform and used the associated packages sturtz et al 2005 wu et al 2015 and the module geobugs from the free software openbugs for the mcmc sampling scheme the standard code is provided as supplementary material the convergence of the posterior distributions was evaluated visually based on the mixture of 5 chains with 2 000 simulations each and based on the r coefficient as described in gelman et al 2013 3 2 modeling the observed daily rainfall the bayesian kriging model as specified in eq 1 can be applied for spatial interpolation of any variable or parameter in our case we tested it for bias correction and downscaling of daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model specifically we want to use the proposed model to spatially downscale the simulated rainfall to any user specified grid and not only to the station scale where rainfall is observed we also intend to preserve as much as possible the spatial variability observed in the rainfall data we follow the well known quantile mapping approach e g cannon et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2012 piani et al 2010 for bias correction as it adjusts the distribution of the simulated rainfall to resemble that of observed rainfall for downscaling we estimate the distribution parameters at the station scale and use the proposed bayesian kriging model eq 1 to interpolate them at the desired grid points hence we simultaneously correct the gcm bias and spatially downscale the simulations at any grid point we assume that the observed daily rainfall follows a two component mixture of bernoulli and gamma distributions where the bernoulli distribution is used to model the occurrence of rainfall while the gamma distribution is applied to the rainfall amounts this a common approach to model daily rainfall e g gudmundsson et al 2012 thereby after considering the seasonality of rainfall we assume that the daily rainfall y jk for gauge j at month k has the following probability density function 10 g y jk p jk gamma y jk α jk β jk for y jk 0 1 p jk else where α 0 and β 0 are respectively the shape and rate parameters for the gamma distribution and p jk is the probability of rainfall i e pr y jk 0 the set of parameters p α β for all rainfall gauges and calendar months could be easily estimated using traditional maximum likelihood methods mles from that one could potentially use the bayesian kriging model as described in eq 1 for spatial interpolation to estimate the set p α β at any specified location and proceed with the bias correction and downscaling procedures however strong correlations 0 90 appear between the mles of α and β for all months k not shown here and must be taken into account during the spatial interpolation to consider the relation between α and β during the spatial interpolation phase we chose to estimate them for the observed rainfall data also using bayesian inference so that a parametric relation between the two can be established within the inference framework and later used in the spatial interpolation stage as such we first assume independent and weakly informative prior distributions for the shape parameter α 11 α jk gamma 0 001 0 001 whereas for the rate parameter β we assume a parametric relation with α 12 β jk ln a 0 a 1 α jk σ 2 where ln denotes the log normal distribution as β jk must be greater than zero the hyperpriors for the parameters in 12 are set as weakly informative 13 a 0 1 14 a 1 1 15 σ 2 inv gamma 0 001 0 001 estimation of the set of parameters α β a 0 a 1 σ 2 from the observed rainfall data follows the same bayesian procedure and diagnostic check explained in section 3 1 to avoid numerical instabilities in the mcmc procedure for small values of rainfall we assumed a threshold of 1 0 mm i e we considered zero for all values of y jk below this threshold 3 3 spatial interpolation of the mixture of distribution parameters once the shape α jk parameter of the daily rainfall is estimated for all gauges j and months k as well as the parameters a 0 a 1 σ 2 we apply the bayesian kriging model eq 1 to estimate the spatial interpolation parameters μ τ 2 ϕ within the bayesian framework we estimate the posterior predictive distribution of the shape parameter α lk at any new specified location l for the purpose of this work we consider in the subsequent analysis the mean value of α lk obtained from its predictive distribution for a more detailed analysis including future simulation one could use the complete posterior distribution of α lk for the rate parameter β lk at the new locations l we apply the relationship expressed in eq 12 and consider the posterior distributions of a 0 a 1 and σ 2 by doing this we predict α and β at the new locations l by taking into account their relationship again for this work all subsequent analysis are performed considering the mean value of β lk obtained from its posterior distribution since the relation of α jk and p jk is relatively weak particularly for the wet months we apply the bayesian kriging model eq 1 directly on the estimates of p jk based on the frequency of wet days for each month the mean value of p lk obtained from its predictive posterior distribution at the new locations l is used in all subsequent analyses 3 4 modeling the gcm daily rainfall a two component mixture of bernoulli and gamma distributions as showed in eq 10 is also used to model the daily rainfall z rk for the reference and future periods simulated by the gcm model hadgem2 ao model in this case for month k and gcm grid point r for simplicity a standard maximum likelihood method is applied to obtain the estimates of the shape and rate parameters for rainfall 0 the parameter p rk is estimated based on the frequency of rainfall days for the reference period to avoid numerical instabilities during the inference process for small values of rainfall we consider a small threshold 1 0 mm to define the rainy days 3 5 the bias correction and downscaling algorithms we use here the well known quantile mapping approach e g gudmundsson et al 2012 to correct the bias from the gcm simulated rainfall at its grid points r bias correction only as well as to estimate the gcm rainfall at the finer grid points l bias correction downscaling let us consider then f gcm the cumulative distribution fit to the rainfall simulated by the gcm model at grid point r as previously described in the specific case of this work f gcm has parameters α r β r and p r for simplicity we omit the subscript k that indicates the respective month now let us define f krg as the cumulative distribution with the associated parameters α l β l p l at the finer resolution grid point l which is the closest spatial point of the gcm grid point r for a given day and month of the historical record the gcm daily rainfall z r at the grid point r is bias corrected through the following transfer function 16 z r f krg 1 f gcm z r where z r is the bias corrected daily rainfall simulated by the gcm model and f krg 1 is the inverse quantile function inverse cdf obtained in the procedure described in section 3 3 for the l point of the finer grid fig 1 closest to the gcm grid point r for downscaling rainfall i e estimation of the gcm daily rainfall at the finer resolution grid points l we use eq 16 but f gcm z r should be of the gcm grid point r closest to the point l so that we can estimate z l the future rainfall simulated by the gcm model is bias corrected and downscaled similarly as described before the only difference is that z r in eq 16 will represent future values and there is no need to fit any further distributions 4 results 4 1 posterior distribution of kriging model parameters for illustrative purposes the posterior distribution of the bayesian kriging parameters obtained from the spatial distribution of the shape parameter α for january and september is displayed in fig 3 it is interesting to note the change in distributions across the months suggesting adequate choice of seasonally varying parameters the largest values of ϕ for september also indicated that at this month there is a faster decay in the correlation compared with january suggesting that more local regional processes dominate the rainfall in september compared with the rainfall in january the empirical semivariogram cressie 1993 obtained from the estimates of α jk at the station scale hereafter denoted as empirical semivariogram for simplicity is shown in fig 4 for january and september along with the semivariograms calculated using the posterior distributions of the bayesian kriging parameters ϕ and τ 2 we observed that the proposed model could reasonably well reproduce the semivariograms obtained directly from the estimates of α jk particularly when the parameter uncertainties are considered again the range is smaller in september about 2 degrees 200 km showing faster decay in correlation as observed for ϕ in fig 3 the sill is also smaller than that estimated for january similar results were obtained for the remaining months not shown here similarly in fig 5 we show the empirical semivariograms for the probability of rainfall parameter p jk from eq 10 for both months the average semivariograms from the kriging model tend to follow the empirical semivariograms up to about 2 5 of distance about 230 km for larger distances the empirical estimates tend to be larger than those of the average kriging model being even larger than the most extreme curves for january this pattern is not common over the remaining months not shown here and we believe as the semivariance is well captured by the kriging model for the shortest distances that it will not substantially affect the spatial interpolations of the estimates for the finer grid next section 4 2 spatial interpolation of rainfall distribution parameters application of the bayesian kriging model described before for spatial interpolation of the shape α jk parameter is illustrated in fig 6 for january and september and also shows the estimates for the gauged stations used in this work the kriging model clearly reproduces the major patterns of the direct estimates of α jk top row in january the largest values are concentrated in the western region while in september they are displaced to the central area it is also interesting to note that the extreme point in the northeastern part induces a pattern of high values in the top rightmost rows from left to right of the finer grid in fact there is a large region that extends from southwest and southeast up to the extreme point in the northeast that is over the pacific ocean and does not include korea fig 1 as such there is no rainfall gauge station in this area and the values obtained from the kriging extrapolation over it should be considered with caution the predicted variance bottom panel of fig 6 is clearly higher across this region the grid estimates of the rate parameter β jk obtained from eq 12 along with the posterior distributions of a 0 a 1 σ 2 and the estimates of α jk showed in fig 6 bottom row are displayed in fig 7 together with the estimates obtained from the observed values of rainfall top row again the general pattern for both months is well captured by the kriging model the approximate trend is very similar to that observed for the shape parameter fig 6 high values in the western region for january and in the central area for september finally fig 8 shows the spatial interpolation from the bayesian kriging model for the daily probability of rainfall p jk for january and september high values appear in the southwestern and central western regions for january while september shows an increasing gradient from southwest to northeast indicating the regions with high probability of rainfall 4 3 bias correction and downscaling the grid estimates showed in figs 6 8 were used to define the cumulative distributions for bias correction eq 16 and and downscaling of the daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model for the reference period 1960 2005 fig 9 displays the average rainfall obtained from the hadgem2 ao model for its own grid without bias correction as well as for the finer grid after bias correction the average rainfall obtained from the gauge stations also is shown in fig 9 while the changes in rainfall amounts during the months are relatively well capture by the hadgem2 ao model with the largest amounts occurring in september it is hard to evaluate whether the simulated rainfall is well reproducing the observed spatial pattern given that the gcm grid scale is large compared with the domain of observations conversely the simulated rainfall at the finer grid bias corrected downscaled satisfactorily reproduces the rainfall amounts as well as the general spatial variabilities with most large amounts in the northern and southern regions the ability of the hadgem2 ao model to simulate daily rainfall considering the spatial variability observed in historical gauged data is illustrated in fig 10 showing for some months the average semivariances across days for the observed rainfall as well as for the simulated rainfall after bias correction and downscaling although the curves for simulated rainfall do not perfectly follow those of observed rainfall the general pattern and scale which shows large variation across the months are relatively well reproduced by the simulated rainfall 4 4 future simulation to illustrate one of the applications of the model proposed in this work we show in fig 11 the average future rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model scenario rcp 6 period 2011 2051 after bias correction and downscaling at the finer grid in general there is a tendency of increasing rainfall in january and slight reduction in september in addition there is substantial change in spatial patterns large blocks of homogeneous rainfall appear in the grid compared with the simulation for the reference period fig 9 this last finding is suggestive of a higher variance across space in the future period as we can also infer from fig 12 which shows the average semivariance for the observed rainfall during the historical period and for the future gcm simulation for most months there is a clear tendency in the future to increase the semivariance for all distances which is suggestive of increasing spatial variability 5 summary and discussion we proposed a bayesian kriging bk model for spatial interpolation of distribution parameters associated with observed daily rainfall from that we obtained the associated parameters at a user specified grid which can be further employed for bias correction and downscaling of gcm rainfall at the specified spatial resolution the advantage of the proposed model over traditional methods of downscaling including dynamic and statistical ones relies on better treatment of the uncertainties associated with spatial interpolation as well as the attempt to better reproduce in the simulated rainfall the historical spatial variabilities identified in the observed rainfall data both aspects constitute relevant challenges in downscaling procedures e g verdin et al 2015 lee et al 2019 the bk model was tested using daily rainfall obtained from 59 rainfall gauges located in the korean peninsula and retrospective and future daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model for downscaling we chose the quantile mapping approach associated with a bernoulli gamma distribution for both observed and modeled daily rainfall while the shape and probability of rainfall parameters were estimated at the fine grid scale using the proposed bk model applied to the estimates at the station scale the rate parameter at the fine grid was estimated under a bayesian inference framework where a parametric relationship with the shape parameter was defined by doing that we ensured that the spatial correlation between the two parameters was maintained in the finer grid the results show that without considering the uncertainties associated with the kriging parameters it is hard to reproduce the exact spatial variability observed for the distribution parameters estimated at the station scale overall the magnitude and spatial variability of all parameters estimated at the station scale were well reproduced at the grid scale for regions of low density of stations the model predicted high variance i e high uncertainty in the estimates the rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model for the retrospective period had a significant bias which was properly corrected using quantile mapping the downscaling algorithm was also able to satisfactorily reproduce the spatial variability observed at the station scale into the grid scale for future rainfall we demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to simulate from the gcm grid scale to the desired scale together with bias correction in the rcp 6 0 scenario from the hadgem2 ao model we noticed a large increase in spatial variability with large clusters of homogeneous rainfall there are no substantial signs of tendencies of increasing or decreasing rainfall to the best of our knowledge this is the first bayesian kriging approach used in the literature for rainfall downscaling at any desired grid scale in a more detailed study of the impacts of climate change on rainfall and streamflow the model proposed here could be fully explored by translating the uncertainties estimated for the kriging parameters into the distribution parameters and consequently into the bias corrected simulated rainfall at the finer grid scale more gcms should also be evaluated as our intention here was more focused on testing the proposed bk model rather than assessing the impacts of climate change on future rainfall in korea the bk model was employed for spatial interpolation of parameters that also were estimated in a bayesian framework but this may not be the case as it could be applied as well for estimates obtained from simpler approaches and other distributions as long as the correlations among the parameters if any are properly considered the bk model could also be complementary to other approaches of climate downscaling such as those using hidden markov models e g hughes et al 1999 robertson et al 2004 and machine learning methods e g vandal et al 2019 pan et al 2019 which may need further models to properly downscale the climate variables at the specified grid a large hierarchical bayesian model that comprises all intermediate models used in this work the distribution of rainfall kriging modeling for spatial variability and the bias correction algorithm could be explored and used to overcome many issues in the traditional approaches of bias correction and downscaling including the best way to deal with parameter uncertainties and use of quantile mapping for bias correction such a model will be a theme of future work credit authorship contribution statement carlos h r lima conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing software

4596,daily rainfall simulated by general circulation models gcms are usually provided on coarse grids and need some adjustment i e bias correction to meet historical statistics observed in gauged based data moreover for hydrological applications the simulated rainfall is needed at fine user specified grids to be used as input into hydrological models simulated rainfall also must preserve the spatial variability observed in gauged data here we explore an alternative approach to downscale daily gcm rainfall simulation at any desired grid resolution using a bayesian kriging bk model that better addresses parameter uncertainties compared with traditional approaches the bk model also attempts to reproduce using downscaled rainfall the spatial variability observed in gauged rainfall data the proposed model is tested using historical data from 59 rainfall gauges located in south korea and from retrospective simulations and projected climate change scenarios simulated by the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao model in the first step a bernoulli gamma bayesian model is fit to the observed daily rainfall the resulting parameters are interpolated into a fine resolution grid through the bk model where the uncertainties are considered and a set of parameters for downscaling and bias correction through quantile mapping qm is generated for the fine resolution grid in the second step a bernoulli gamma model is fit to the gridded daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model and a qm or parametric distribution mapping is employed to simultaneously downscale and correct the bias from the retrospective daily rainfall simulated by the gcm the results show the adequacy of the proposed model to downscale gcm determined daily rainfall at any specified grid scale accounting for bias correction and parameter uncertainties the spatial variability observed in the gauged data was reasonably well reproduced in retrospective gcm rainfall for future rainfall the proposed model allowed identification of an increase in spatial variability in the hadgem2 ao simulations of scenario rcp6 the bk model can easily be extended to other applications including downscaling of temperature or future rainfall simulated from other models and approaches keywords daily rainfall bias correction bayesian model downscaling climate change 1 introduction general circulation models gcms are currently the best tool to quantitatively assess future changes in rainfall patterns in response to the increase in average global temperature however the typical coarse scale spatial resolution of gcms associated with intrinsic complexity in modeling the rainfall process leads to significant systematic biases in simulated rain even when produced by fine scale regional circulation models rcms numerous statistical models have been employed to correct such biases e g berg et al 2012 sachindra et al 2014 cannon et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2015 mehrotra and sharma 2015 um et al 2016 mehrotra et al 2018 smitha et al 2018 when simulated rainfall is produced at coarse scale grids the bias correction procedure is usually accompanied by a downscaling algorithm to carry rainfall to the station scale zhang 2005 or more often at finer resolution grid boxes e g vrac et al 2007 wood et al 2004 a variety of dynamical and statistical models has been employed for downscaling e g yoon et al 2012 zhang et al apr 2012 pierce et al 2013 hwang and graham 2013 glotter et al 2014 bastola and misra 2014 nahar et al 2017 eum and cannon 2017 and comparisons among methods are routinely evaluated e g abatzoglou and brown 2012 gutmann et al 2012 gutmann et al 2014 due to its relative simplicity and ability to downscale gcm rainfall at any desired position together with bias correction statistical models are often preferred for bias correction and downscaling when the goal is to simulate rainfall at specific points usually for climate change impact assessment such as input into hydrological models e g wood et al 2004 in this case the rainfall simulated by the gcm needs to be estimated at the desired points usually a fine resolution grid where no observation exists the gcm rainfall can be first bias corrected and then downscaled hwang and graham 2013 or vice versa abatzoglou and brown 2012 among the bias correction algorithms local intensity scaling loci power transformation pwtr constructed analogs ca and quantile mapping qm and its extensions e g qdm dqm equidistant quantile matching are the most popular e g schmidli et al 2006 leander and buishand 2007 lenderink et al 2007 li et al 2010 cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 li et al 2018 smitha et al 2018 these methods are applied directly for fine scale rainfall simulations from rcms e g laflamme et al 2016 li et al 2017 or associated with statistical methods of spatial disaggregation sd to produce downscaled rainfall among the sd methods one often employs the bias correction and spatial disaggregation bscd algorithm wood et al 2004 and its extensions sdqm sddqm sdqdm etc we refer the reader to the works of abatzoglou and brown 2012 hwang and graham 2013 nahar et al 2017 and eum and cannon 2017 for examples of bscd and related methods a cumbersome of both statistical and dynamical methods of downscaling is much their inability to produce robust statistics at the desired points with the major uncertainties for instance it is not common to express the uncertainty for bilinear interpolation when applying it for spatial disaggregation associated with that a robust method of downscaling at a fine resolution grid scale should be able to reproduce the spatial variability of observed data particularly when simulating daily rainfall as input to hydrological models the spatial resolution of gcms as well as of rcms prevents them from simulating the correct spatial variability of daily rainfall as observed in gauged data even after applying traditional bias correction methods lee et al 2019 here we propose to advance this field by generating over a fine resolution grid all parameters associated with a bias correction algorithm incorporating kriging functions cressie 1993 within a bayesian inference framework gelman et al 2013 in particular we employ the qm algorithm or parametric distribution mapping using a mixture of bernoulli gamma distributions together with spatial disaggregation from the kriging interpolation to simultaneously downscale and correct the bias from rainfall simulated by gcms the advantage of the proposed model is its ability to better consider the uncertainties in the spatial disaggregation parameters i e kriging parameters while seeking to preserve in the simulated rainfall the spatial variability observed in the historical daily rainfall data thus the proposed models are able to downscale and provide bias corrected simulated rainfall from gcms at any specified spatial scale together with the estimates of all parameter uncertainties involved which are poorly discussed in the literature to the best of our knowledge this is the first approach to explore the use of bayesian kriging inference for downscaling of gcm rainfall the model is evaluated using daily rainfall series from several stations in korea and retrospective and future rainfall simulated by the cmip5 hadgem2 ao model after this introduction this study is organized as follows the rainfall data and climate change scenario simulations are presented in section 2 the methodology describing the proposed bayesian kriging model for spatial interpolation as well as the bias correction and downscaling approaches are introduced in section 3 the results are presented in section 4 finally in section 5 we offer a discussion and a summary of this work 2 rainfall data and scenario simulations 2 1 rainfall data daily rainfall series from 59 rainfall gauges located in korea fig 1 are used to evaluate the proposed model the rainfall data are provided by the automatic synoptic observation system asos operated by the korean meteorological administration kma and covers the 1973 2011 historical period 2 2 scenario simulation and downscaling the national institute of meteorological research of korea nimr has selected the met office hadley centre hadgem2 ao gcm model for use in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 for this reason we adopted daily rainfall simulations provided by the hadgem2 ao model to evaluate the ability of the model described in this work to downscale such simulations to a finer grid the horizontal resolution of the hadgem2 ao grid is about 1 87 longitude and 1 25 latitude fig 1 displays the location of the gcm grid points over the domain of this work the reference or historical period of the gcm simulation is from 1960 through 2005 for the future rainfall scenarios we adopted the representative concentration pathways rcp 6 0 scenario with daily rainfall data from 2011 to 2051 the gcm rainfall simulations are downscaled to a finer grid of about 0 25 resolution fig 1 which might be more appropriate for rainfall simulations as input to hydrological models the grid was designed to cover a rectangular region that includes all rainfall gauges as climate models tend to overestimate light rain while moderate and extreme rainfalls are underestimated over south korea lima et al 2016 so et al 2017 we adopted a bias correction algorithm as explained in the next section to correct the quantiles of simulated daily rainfall series for both the reference and future periods 3 methodology fig 2 summarizes the general methodology employed in this work to obtain downscaled bias corrected gcm rainfall simulation at finer grid scales our proposed approach is divided into two phases 1 estimation of the observed rainfall distribution parameters at a finer grid whose scale can be set as needed and 2 downscaling and bias correction of gcm rainfall simulations at the finer grid the major contribution of this work consists in application of a bayesian kriging bk in fig 2 model to interpolate the distribution parameters of observed rainfall data at the specified grid points by doing that we try to better address the parameter uncertainties and spatial variance of the observed rainfall data in our case we adopted the bernoulli gamma distribution for the observed rainfall under a bayesian inference framework hb model in fig 2 this is also an important contribution of this work as it allows proper spatial interpolation of the two parameters of the gamma distribution which are highly correlated in the second phase we fit a bernoulli gamma distribution model b g model in fig 2 to the retrospective gcm rainfall data and apply a quantile mapping approach qm in fig 2 to generate bias corrected gcm rainfall simulations at the finer grid details of each phase are presented in the following sections 3 1 framework of the bayesian kriging model bayesian models have been successfully applied in hydrology studies due to their versatility and powerfulness in dealing with parameter uncertainties and small sample size the framework of bayesian inference in particular hierarchical bayesian models allows inclusion of more information compared with most traditional statistical approaches during the estimation phase which leads to more robust estimators it is not in the scope of this work to explore the literature in bayesian models for which we refer the reader to kwon et al 2008 lima and lall 2010 liang et al 2011 renard 2011 haddad et al 2012 viglione et al 2013 lima et al 2016 and ragno et al 2018 for examples of bayesian models in hydrology to banerjee et al 2004 for theoretical aspects of bayesian kriging models and to sahu and mardia 2005 and verdin et al 2015 for recent applications assume that we have estimates of a given parameter s e g shape parameters of the gamma distribution for n rainfall gauges with coordinates x longitude and y latitude we consider that the spatial distribution of those parameters follows a multivariate normal distribution mvn 1 s mvn μ τ 2 σ where μ denotes the mean vector τ 2 0 controls the overall spatial variability of s and σ is a positive definite matrix of size n the spatial correlation of s is addressed through a parametric formulation for σ 2 σ ij f d ij θ in which d ij is the distance between sites i and j and θ is a set of correlation parameters in our case we adopt the powered exponential family for f d ij θ 3 f d ij ϕ κ exp ϕ d ij κ where ϕ 0 controls how the correlation decays with distance and 0 κ 2 regulates the smoothing degree of s across space for high values of ϕ there is rapid decay in the correlation whereas a slow decay applies for small values of ϕ the parameters expressed in eqs 1 can be estimated using traditional methods in ordinary kriging e g cressie 1993 but here we adopt bayesian inference banerjee et al 2004 gelman et al 2013 which provides an interesting framework to handle the uncertainties involved in estimating such parameters particularly for limited data over the spatial domain hence we need to define the prior distributions for the parameters μ τ 2 ϕ and κ which should express knowledge if any we have about those parameters as we do not know any relevant information about the vector μ we assume independent and weakly informative distributions for each parameter μ i i 1 n 4 μ i 1 it is worth noting that μ i can be constrained to positive values e g when it represents the shape parameter of the gamma distribution in this case eq 4 must be modified accordingly for this work as our parameter s is the shape of the gamma distribution we used the gamma distribution g 0 001 0 001 as a prior for μ i which is mathematically appealing for noninformative priors in the positive values domain gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 for the overall variance parameter τ 2 a common weakly informative conjugate prior distribution gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 is adopted 5 τ 2 inv gamma 0 01 0 01 the prior distribution for ϕ should reflect the expected range of correlations at the minimum and maximum distances d ij to avoid identifiability issues for very high correlations at the maximum distance richardson 1992 for that we assume a minimum correlation of ρ min 0 99 at the minimum distance d min and a maximum correlation of ρ max 0 1 at the maximum distance d max hence we set the prior distribution for ϕ as 6 ϕ u ϕ min ϕ max where u denotes the uniform distribution therefore ϕ min and ϕ max in eq 6 can be determined as follows 7 ϕ min log ρ max d max 8 ϕ max log ρ min d min here d min 0 0003 degrees and d max 6 74 degrees about 600 km which lead to very high ranges of ϕ min and ϕ max for small changes of ρ min and ρ max we also noticed that a high range in eq 6 leads to difficulties in the process described below of parameter estimation as for the smoothing parameter κ we just set κ 1 as recommended in the literature richardson 1992 since we do not have any reliable prior information we also tested a uniform prior in the range 0 2 for κ and observed that the estimation process through monte carlo markov chain simulation see below is extremely slow and hard to achieve under the bayesian framework the joint posterior density of the set of parameters θ μ τ 2 ϕ can be written using the bayes rule as 9 pr θ s l s θ π θ l x l s θ π θ with l s as the marginal likelihood of observations and acting as a normalization constant to ensure that the integral of pr θ s is equal to 1 and π θ is the prior distribution of the parameter set given by eqs 4 6 the joint posterior distribution of the parameters is finally obtained by replacing the appropriate likelihood function l s θ derived from eq 1 and the prior distributions eqs 4 6 into eq 9 however its analytical integration with respect to the set of parameters θ is not tractable and we used the well known markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to sample from it we coded all models in the r platform and used the associated packages sturtz et al 2005 wu et al 2015 and the module geobugs from the free software openbugs for the mcmc sampling scheme the standard code is provided as supplementary material the convergence of the posterior distributions was evaluated visually based on the mixture of 5 chains with 2 000 simulations each and based on the r coefficient as described in gelman et al 2013 3 2 modeling the observed daily rainfall the bayesian kriging model as specified in eq 1 can be applied for spatial interpolation of any variable or parameter in our case we tested it for bias correction and downscaling of daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model specifically we want to use the proposed model to spatially downscale the simulated rainfall to any user specified grid and not only to the station scale where rainfall is observed we also intend to preserve as much as possible the spatial variability observed in the rainfall data we follow the well known quantile mapping approach e g cannon et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2012 piani et al 2010 for bias correction as it adjusts the distribution of the simulated rainfall to resemble that of observed rainfall for downscaling we estimate the distribution parameters at the station scale and use the proposed bayesian kriging model eq 1 to interpolate them at the desired grid points hence we simultaneously correct the gcm bias and spatially downscale the simulations at any grid point we assume that the observed daily rainfall follows a two component mixture of bernoulli and gamma distributions where the bernoulli distribution is used to model the occurrence of rainfall while the gamma distribution is applied to the rainfall amounts this a common approach to model daily rainfall e g gudmundsson et al 2012 thereby after considering the seasonality of rainfall we assume that the daily rainfall y jk for gauge j at month k has the following probability density function 10 g y jk p jk gamma y jk α jk β jk for y jk 0 1 p jk else where α 0 and β 0 are respectively the shape and rate parameters for the gamma distribution and p jk is the probability of rainfall i e pr y jk 0 the set of parameters p α β for all rainfall gauges and calendar months could be easily estimated using traditional maximum likelihood methods mles from that one could potentially use the bayesian kriging model as described in eq 1 for spatial interpolation to estimate the set p α β at any specified location and proceed with the bias correction and downscaling procedures however strong correlations 0 90 appear between the mles of α and β for all months k not shown here and must be taken into account during the spatial interpolation to consider the relation between α and β during the spatial interpolation phase we chose to estimate them for the observed rainfall data also using bayesian inference so that a parametric relation between the two can be established within the inference framework and later used in the spatial interpolation stage as such we first assume independent and weakly informative prior distributions for the shape parameter α 11 α jk gamma 0 001 0 001 whereas for the rate parameter β we assume a parametric relation with α 12 β jk ln a 0 a 1 α jk σ 2 where ln denotes the log normal distribution as β jk must be greater than zero the hyperpriors for the parameters in 12 are set as weakly informative 13 a 0 1 14 a 1 1 15 σ 2 inv gamma 0 001 0 001 estimation of the set of parameters α β a 0 a 1 σ 2 from the observed rainfall data follows the same bayesian procedure and diagnostic check explained in section 3 1 to avoid numerical instabilities in the mcmc procedure for small values of rainfall we assumed a threshold of 1 0 mm i e we considered zero for all values of y jk below this threshold 3 3 spatial interpolation of the mixture of distribution parameters once the shape α jk parameter of the daily rainfall is estimated for all gauges j and months k as well as the parameters a 0 a 1 σ 2 we apply the bayesian kriging model eq 1 to estimate the spatial interpolation parameters μ τ 2 ϕ within the bayesian framework we estimate the posterior predictive distribution of the shape parameter α lk at any new specified location l for the purpose of this work we consider in the subsequent analysis the mean value of α lk obtained from its predictive distribution for a more detailed analysis including future simulation one could use the complete posterior distribution of α lk for the rate parameter β lk at the new locations l we apply the relationship expressed in eq 12 and consider the posterior distributions of a 0 a 1 and σ 2 by doing this we predict α and β at the new locations l by taking into account their relationship again for this work all subsequent analysis are performed considering the mean value of β lk obtained from its posterior distribution since the relation of α jk and p jk is relatively weak particularly for the wet months we apply the bayesian kriging model eq 1 directly on the estimates of p jk based on the frequency of wet days for each month the mean value of p lk obtained from its predictive posterior distribution at the new locations l is used in all subsequent analyses 3 4 modeling the gcm daily rainfall a two component mixture of bernoulli and gamma distributions as showed in eq 10 is also used to model the daily rainfall z rk for the reference and future periods simulated by the gcm model hadgem2 ao model in this case for month k and gcm grid point r for simplicity a standard maximum likelihood method is applied to obtain the estimates of the shape and rate parameters for rainfall 0 the parameter p rk is estimated based on the frequency of rainfall days for the reference period to avoid numerical instabilities during the inference process for small values of rainfall we consider a small threshold 1 0 mm to define the rainy days 3 5 the bias correction and downscaling algorithms we use here the well known quantile mapping approach e g gudmundsson et al 2012 to correct the bias from the gcm simulated rainfall at its grid points r bias correction only as well as to estimate the gcm rainfall at the finer grid points l bias correction downscaling let us consider then f gcm the cumulative distribution fit to the rainfall simulated by the gcm model at grid point r as previously described in the specific case of this work f gcm has parameters α r β r and p r for simplicity we omit the subscript k that indicates the respective month now let us define f krg as the cumulative distribution with the associated parameters α l β l p l at the finer resolution grid point l which is the closest spatial point of the gcm grid point r for a given day and month of the historical record the gcm daily rainfall z r at the grid point r is bias corrected through the following transfer function 16 z r f krg 1 f gcm z r where z r is the bias corrected daily rainfall simulated by the gcm model and f krg 1 is the inverse quantile function inverse cdf obtained in the procedure described in section 3 3 for the l point of the finer grid fig 1 closest to the gcm grid point r for downscaling rainfall i e estimation of the gcm daily rainfall at the finer resolution grid points l we use eq 16 but f gcm z r should be of the gcm grid point r closest to the point l so that we can estimate z l the future rainfall simulated by the gcm model is bias corrected and downscaled similarly as described before the only difference is that z r in eq 16 will represent future values and there is no need to fit any further distributions 4 results 4 1 posterior distribution of kriging model parameters for illustrative purposes the posterior distribution of the bayesian kriging parameters obtained from the spatial distribution of the shape parameter α for january and september is displayed in fig 3 it is interesting to note the change in distributions across the months suggesting adequate choice of seasonally varying parameters the largest values of ϕ for september also indicated that at this month there is a faster decay in the correlation compared with january suggesting that more local regional processes dominate the rainfall in september compared with the rainfall in january the empirical semivariogram cressie 1993 obtained from the estimates of α jk at the station scale hereafter denoted as empirical semivariogram for simplicity is shown in fig 4 for january and september along with the semivariograms calculated using the posterior distributions of the bayesian kriging parameters ϕ and τ 2 we observed that the proposed model could reasonably well reproduce the semivariograms obtained directly from the estimates of α jk particularly when the parameter uncertainties are considered again the range is smaller in september about 2 degrees 200 km showing faster decay in correlation as observed for ϕ in fig 3 the sill is also smaller than that estimated for january similar results were obtained for the remaining months not shown here similarly in fig 5 we show the empirical semivariograms for the probability of rainfall parameter p jk from eq 10 for both months the average semivariograms from the kriging model tend to follow the empirical semivariograms up to about 2 5 of distance about 230 km for larger distances the empirical estimates tend to be larger than those of the average kriging model being even larger than the most extreme curves for january this pattern is not common over the remaining months not shown here and we believe as the semivariance is well captured by the kriging model for the shortest distances that it will not substantially affect the spatial interpolations of the estimates for the finer grid next section 4 2 spatial interpolation of rainfall distribution parameters application of the bayesian kriging model described before for spatial interpolation of the shape α jk parameter is illustrated in fig 6 for january and september and also shows the estimates for the gauged stations used in this work the kriging model clearly reproduces the major patterns of the direct estimates of α jk top row in january the largest values are concentrated in the western region while in september they are displaced to the central area it is also interesting to note that the extreme point in the northeastern part induces a pattern of high values in the top rightmost rows from left to right of the finer grid in fact there is a large region that extends from southwest and southeast up to the extreme point in the northeast that is over the pacific ocean and does not include korea fig 1 as such there is no rainfall gauge station in this area and the values obtained from the kriging extrapolation over it should be considered with caution the predicted variance bottom panel of fig 6 is clearly higher across this region the grid estimates of the rate parameter β jk obtained from eq 12 along with the posterior distributions of a 0 a 1 σ 2 and the estimates of α jk showed in fig 6 bottom row are displayed in fig 7 together with the estimates obtained from the observed values of rainfall top row again the general pattern for both months is well captured by the kriging model the approximate trend is very similar to that observed for the shape parameter fig 6 high values in the western region for january and in the central area for september finally fig 8 shows the spatial interpolation from the bayesian kriging model for the daily probability of rainfall p jk for january and september high values appear in the southwestern and central western regions for january while september shows an increasing gradient from southwest to northeast indicating the regions with high probability of rainfall 4 3 bias correction and downscaling the grid estimates showed in figs 6 8 were used to define the cumulative distributions for bias correction eq 16 and and downscaling of the daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model for the reference period 1960 2005 fig 9 displays the average rainfall obtained from the hadgem2 ao model for its own grid without bias correction as well as for the finer grid after bias correction the average rainfall obtained from the gauge stations also is shown in fig 9 while the changes in rainfall amounts during the months are relatively well capture by the hadgem2 ao model with the largest amounts occurring in september it is hard to evaluate whether the simulated rainfall is well reproducing the observed spatial pattern given that the gcm grid scale is large compared with the domain of observations conversely the simulated rainfall at the finer grid bias corrected downscaled satisfactorily reproduces the rainfall amounts as well as the general spatial variabilities with most large amounts in the northern and southern regions the ability of the hadgem2 ao model to simulate daily rainfall considering the spatial variability observed in historical gauged data is illustrated in fig 10 showing for some months the average semivariances across days for the observed rainfall as well as for the simulated rainfall after bias correction and downscaling although the curves for simulated rainfall do not perfectly follow those of observed rainfall the general pattern and scale which shows large variation across the months are relatively well reproduced by the simulated rainfall 4 4 future simulation to illustrate one of the applications of the model proposed in this work we show in fig 11 the average future rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model scenario rcp 6 period 2011 2051 after bias correction and downscaling at the finer grid in general there is a tendency of increasing rainfall in january and slight reduction in september in addition there is substantial change in spatial patterns large blocks of homogeneous rainfall appear in the grid compared with the simulation for the reference period fig 9 this last finding is suggestive of a higher variance across space in the future period as we can also infer from fig 12 which shows the average semivariance for the observed rainfall during the historical period and for the future gcm simulation for most months there is a clear tendency in the future to increase the semivariance for all distances which is suggestive of increasing spatial variability 5 summary and discussion we proposed a bayesian kriging bk model for spatial interpolation of distribution parameters associated with observed daily rainfall from that we obtained the associated parameters at a user specified grid which can be further employed for bias correction and downscaling of gcm rainfall at the specified spatial resolution the advantage of the proposed model over traditional methods of downscaling including dynamic and statistical ones relies on better treatment of the uncertainties associated with spatial interpolation as well as the attempt to better reproduce in the simulated rainfall the historical spatial variabilities identified in the observed rainfall data both aspects constitute relevant challenges in downscaling procedures e g verdin et al 2015 lee et al 2019 the bk model was tested using daily rainfall obtained from 59 rainfall gauges located in the korean peninsula and retrospective and future daily rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model for downscaling we chose the quantile mapping approach associated with a bernoulli gamma distribution for both observed and modeled daily rainfall while the shape and probability of rainfall parameters were estimated at the fine grid scale using the proposed bk model applied to the estimates at the station scale the rate parameter at the fine grid was estimated under a bayesian inference framework where a parametric relationship with the shape parameter was defined by doing that we ensured that the spatial correlation between the two parameters was maintained in the finer grid the results show that without considering the uncertainties associated with the kriging parameters it is hard to reproduce the exact spatial variability observed for the distribution parameters estimated at the station scale overall the magnitude and spatial variability of all parameters estimated at the station scale were well reproduced at the grid scale for regions of low density of stations the model predicted high variance i e high uncertainty in the estimates the rainfall simulated by the hadgem2 ao model for the retrospective period had a significant bias which was properly corrected using quantile mapping the downscaling algorithm was also able to satisfactorily reproduce the spatial variability observed at the station scale into the grid scale for future rainfall we demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to simulate from the gcm grid scale to the desired scale together with bias correction in the rcp 6 0 scenario from the hadgem2 ao model we noticed a large increase in spatial variability with large clusters of homogeneous rainfall there are no substantial signs of tendencies of increasing or decreasing rainfall to the best of our knowledge this is the first bayesian kriging approach used in the literature for rainfall downscaling at any desired grid scale in a more detailed study of the impacts of climate change on rainfall and streamflow the model proposed here could be fully explored by translating the uncertainties estimated for the kriging parameters into the distribution parameters and consequently into the bias corrected simulated rainfall at the finer grid scale more gcms should also be evaluated as our intention here was more focused on testing the proposed bk model rather than assessing the impacts of climate change on future rainfall in korea the bk model was employed for spatial interpolation of parameters that also were estimated in a bayesian framework but this may not be the case as it could be applied as well for estimates obtained from simpler approaches and other distributions as long as the correlations among the parameters if any are properly considered the bk model could also be complementary to other approaches of climate downscaling such as those using hidden markov models e g hughes et al 1999 robertson et al 2004 and machine learning methods e g vandal et al 2019 pan et al 2019 which may need further models to properly downscale the climate variables at the specified grid a large hierarchical bayesian model that comprises all intermediate models used in this work the distribution of rainfall kriging modeling for spatial variability and the bias correction algorithm could be explored and used to overcome many issues in the traditional approaches of bias correction and downscaling including the best way to deal with parameter uncertainties and use of quantile mapping for bias correction such a model will be a theme of future work credit authorship contribution statement carlos h r lima conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing software

4597,water flows that move slowly in the landscape are not simulated by spatially and physical distributed erosion models and can contribute significantly during rainfall events in the streamflow making model calibration complex the goals of this study were i to assess the relative contribution of subsurface and surface runoff to the streamflow at the outlet and ii to investigate to what extent the presence of runoff other than hortonian overland flow affects erosion model performance the arvorezinha catchment 1 23 km2 southern brazil is characterized by the cultivation of tobacco under minimum cultivation system on shallow soils from october 2011 until october 2013 we set up a complementary monitoring program of water chemistry and samples were collected during rainfall runoff events to analyze dissolved silicon dsi the observed hydrograph was separated into two components using dsi i surface flow and ii groundwater soil water flow the openlisem model was used to assess the impact of different runoff sources and understand the hydrological and erosive process dynamics in the catchment for this a manual calibration procedure was used and repeated for two approaches with and without runoff separation for the six rainfall events evaluated 62 of the hydrograph is formed by groundwater soil water especially in autumn winter and for low medium magnitude events up to qpeak 800 l s 1 the dilution effect was observed during rainfall events when liquid discharge increases dsi concentration and suspended sediment concentration decreases the performance of physics based models in a catchment with very fragile soils and with frequent changes in land use is impacted by runoff separation keywords dissolved silicon erosion modeling sediment yield runoff separation 1 introduction soil erosion is an environmental process that causes significant on site and off site damage boardman et al 2003 borrelli et al 2017 quinton et al 2010 in order to simulate those effects and investigate the consequences of erosion a large variety of models have been developed erosion models vary from lumped statistical models such as the revised universal soil loss equation rusle which simply predicts average annual losses from a plot or hillslope renard et al 1997 2010 to dynamic spatially distributed process based models the latter are capable of simulating sediment mobilization transport and deposition at very fine spatial and temporal scales such as the water erosion prediction project wepp flanagan and nearing 1995 flanagan et al 2007 the limburg soil erosion model openlisem de roo et al 1996 jetten 2002 jetten and de roo 2001 jetten and van den bout 2017 and the multi class sediment transport model mcst fiener et al 2008 these dynamic spatially distributed process based models describe the relevant erosion processes using a so called physically based approach whereby the description of each process is no longer based only on empirical measurements but on the understanding of how these processes operate openlisem model has evolved since its publication in the 90s and since 2011 an open source model has been presented this has allowed improvements in the description of the erosive process insertion of new detachment flow equations insertion of other parameters such as d90 etc and in the dynamics of water flows insertion of flood ground water flow etc jetten and van den bout 2017 conversely even considering the improvements there are limitations in the representation of the erosive process especially when other processes and complexities are involved such as snowmelt starkloff et al 2018 water harvesting techniques grum et al 2017 and cohesive soils de barros et al 2014 process based erosion models should in principle enable better simulations and predict sediment yield and transfer than empirical models especially at the event time scale however several studies have shown that this is not the case the predictive power of process based erosion models is not significantly larger than that of older statistical models such as the universal soil loss equation usle brazier et al 2000 croke and nethery 2006 govers 2011 the reasons why process based models do not have better predictive ability are at least partially understood process based models require a large number of input values merritt et al 2003 which some of them can only be determined with a relatively low degree of accuracy quinton 1997 and these models continue to use empirical equations to simulate some sub processes and are based on empirical coefficients e g rill erodibility this uncertainty is related to the inadequacy of available measurement techniques e g the determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity on relatively small samples and or to the spatial and temporal variability of these values this uncertainty related to inputs and the inadequacy of the appliedequations is directly translated into uncertainty on model outcomes brazier et al 2000 peukert et al 2012 a factor that should be considered in model comparisons is that process based erosion models are necessarily driven by a process based runoff generation model primarily erosion simulation requires the prediction of the spatially and temporally variable amount of water that is flowing over the surface of the landscape during a runoff event most existing erosion models implicitly assume that runoff is generated due to infiltration excess i e hortonian overland flow which is generated when rainfall intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity the wepp model uses the green ampt mein larson gaml approach while the openlisem model makes it possible to simulate overland flow using either the richards equation or the green ampt equation hairsine and rose hairsine and rose 1992 1991 used a modified curve number cn soil conservation service approach to calculate infiltration runoff routine in their model hr soil erosion model van oost et al 2004 the assumption that runoff is generated by infiltration excess is not always valid poesen et al 2003 already noticed that ephemeral gullies under moist conditions may be caused by saturation overland flow van den putte et al 2013 showed that runoff generation on arable lands in belgium could be simulated with acceptable precision using a modified gaml approach during the spring and summer period however this was not the case during autumn and winter when the soil was near saturation under such conditions saturation of the soil profile rather than infiltration excess controls runoff generation and it is evident that a model that does not account for saturation overland flow generation will not be able to accurately describe or predict runoff and erosion cuomo et al 2015 saturation overland flow may be also important on agricultural terraces gallart et al 1994 the problem of runoff generation becomes even more complicated at catchment scale mcglynn et al 2003 at the catchment scale rapid water movement below the surface is often important during rainfall events catchment event runoff may therefore not only be controlled by surface runoff but also by translator flow hewlett and hibbert 1967 renée brooks et al 2010 return flow dunne 1978 and macropore flow mcdonnell et al 1990 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 within the soil several studies godsey et al 2009 martínez carreras et al 2016 zuecco et al 2018 confirmed earlier results from pearce et al 1986 revealing that the runoff leaving a catchment due to a rainfall event often consists of a large fraction of old water that is pushed out of the soil by the fresh rainfall input i e translatory flow the latter then explains why many catchments show near chemostatic behavior i e concentrations of dissolved solids in runoff water are far less dependent on discharge than expected godsey et al 2009 rose et al 2018 the fact that runoff generation also occurs due to other mechanisms besides hortonian overland flow robinet et al 2018 has important implications for testing process based erosion models at catchment scale frequently representative infiltration parameters are derived by model calibration i e by matching the observed and simulated catchment hydrograph halwatura and najim 2013 hessel and van asch 2003 hoshin and schaefli 2007 while this approach is appropriate when catchment runoff is indeed primarily produced by infiltration excess it may lead to large errors in erosion simulation when runoff is mainly generated by other processes in this study we aim to investigate to what extent different mechanisms of runoff generation play a role in the sloping mixed land use landscapes of southern brazil and how this may affect the performance of an erosion model we study runoff and erosion processes in a small agricultural catchment in se brazil that is subject to intense agricultural erosion dissolved si dsi was used to discriminate between surface and subsurface runoff klaus and mcdonnell 2013 next we assess how the performance of a process based erosion model lisem is affected by the variable contribution of different runoff sources at catchment level the objectives of our study were i to assess the sources of catchment runoff and ii to investigate to what extent the presence of runoff other than hortonian overland flow affects erosion model performance 2 methodology 2 1 study area and control factors the experimental catchment of the lajeado ferreira stream is located in arvorezinha brazil and has a drainage area of ca 1 23 km2 the catchment is a typical headwater catchment located on the southern border of the basaltic meridional plateau of brazil fig 1 igneous rocks basalts and rhyodacite characterize the geology and the altitude varies from 580 to 730 m fig 1 the upper third of the catchment has an undulating plateau relief with slopes up to 7 the middle and lower third of the catchment have a much steeper topography with slope gradients often exceeding 15 the fields naturally have a high connectivity with the natural channels as there is no depositional area between the channel and the sloping land moreover riparian areas are not well protected by natural forests facilitating the transfer of water and sediment from the hillslope to the river channel the unpaved roads also play an important role in the water dynamics of the catchment they are directly connected to the catchment drainage network and have an impervious surface therefore they generate large amounts of surface runoff as well as of sediment minella et al 2009 the high connectivity accelerates water and sediment discharge to the river channel opportunities for sediment storage within the catchment are limited the climate is classified as cfb subtropical super humid with no dry season and warm summer according to köppen alvares et al 2013 the average annual rainfall is ca 1938 mm and the erosivity index ei30 is 9344 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 ramon 2017 the rain is well distributed throughout the year however runoff occurs more often during spring due to high rainfall intensities the soil types in the catchment are classified as acrisols cambisols and leptosols according to a detailed soil classification survey 1 5000 that was carried out in accordance to the guidelines of the iuss working group wrb 2006 fig 2 a the acrisols are mainly located in the upper portion of the catchment they are characterized by an abrupt texture change between the a horizon and the argic b horizon which may potentially lead to water stagnation on top of the b horizon the leptosols are found in the lower portion of the catchment where the relief is steep and characterized by the absence of a subsurface horizon where the surface horizon is in direct contact with the rock thus affecting water flux in the deeper layers where leptosols are present there are often coarse materials such as boulders and gravel at the surface cambisols locally appear in areas dominated by acrisols and or leptosols soil drainage is classified as being moderate to good de barros 2012 dalbianco 2013 however on gentle slopes the soil may remain saturated for several days after a rainfall event the spatial and temporal variability of land use and soil management was determined using both satellite images google earth images from 2011 to 2014 and field surveys using a handheld global position system gps device land use in the catchment is dynamic and quite sensitive to the prices of agricultural products tobacco cultivation nicotiana tabacum l has long been the agricultural activity of greatest economic importance in the study site and although it occupied only 14 of the catchment in the 2011 2014 growing season it was still considered an important source of income for the farmers fig 2b an increase in soybean and corn cultivation occurred which covered up to 23 of the total catchment area in 2014 fig 2b reforestation areas with eucalyptus eucalyptus spp have increased since 2008 from 14 4 to 34 8 in 2014 de barros 2016 after 2016 the cultivation of erva mate ilex paraguariensis which is used for the preparation of tea has replaced some old tobacco plantations soil management is characterized by conventional tillage ct and minimum tillage mt for both grain and tobacco in tobacco cultivation farmers build ridges 30 cm high with a 70 cm of distance between them in order to increase aeration in the root zone and facilitate root development the ridge is not built horizontally but with a small lateral slope whose purpose is removing excess water from the crops badly constructed ridges can result in the formation of erosion rills if conventional tillage is used the soil is ploughed which promotes soil aeration but the exposure of bare soil to raindrop impact leads to crust formation and surface runoff generation on the leptosols crust formation is to some extent prevented by the presence of rock fragments 2 2 monitoring of hydrological variables this catchment is being monitored since january 2002 with the aim of assessing the impact of agriculture on soil and water resources a regular and continuous program of hydrological monitoring was established in order to quantify erosion related processes and to identify controlling factors land use and management soil types and climate accumulated rainfall is measured daily by an observer in a rain gauge ville de paris model and used as a reference to adjust the measurements of two pluviographs solar brand installed at different locations of the catchment in march 2014 an optical laser disdrometer was installed ott parsivel2 which was used for the characterization of precipitation and to obtain the of the kinetic energy equation for the location ramon et al 2017 monitoring of water discharge and suspended sediments concentration is performed in the outlet of the catchment fig 3 through a parshall flume with a limnigraph model ott thalimedes and turbidity meter solar model sl 2000 moreover field surveys were conducted to collect samples during storm rainfall for determining the suspended sediment concentration ssc this information was then used for turbidimeter calibration merten et al 2014 samples to determine ssc were collected on a walkway over the streamflow during rainfall events using a usdh 48 sampler integrating vertical variability the interval between collections is defined by visual observation of the variation of the level and the ssc which are different at each event 2 3 water chemistry from october 2011 we set up a complementary monitoring program of water chemistry twenty six water samples were collected during base flow conditions to characterize dsi in groundwater dsi gw at fortnightly or monthly intervals from 07 09 2011 to 07 9 2012 fig 4 sampling during events started on 01 10 2011 and lasted until october 26 2013 six storm events were fully monitored to measure dsi in runoff fig 4 sampling for water chemistry was done manually at varying water levels so that variations in water chemistry during the flood wave could be detected 2 3 1 laboratory analysis si and ssc an aliquot 20 ml of each integral sample sediment water was collected and filtered through a 0 22 µm porosity filter membrane ha in cellulose ester the aliquot that passed through the filter was used for the determination of soluble silicon content through atomic emission spectrometry by an inductively coupled plasma machine icp oes perkin elmer beside this we measured in the samples the elements al b ba be ca cd co cr cu fe k la mg mn na ni p pb sb se sr ti v zn in order to estimate the total si amount asi dsi another aliquot was collected the adopted procedure was the addition of 20 ml of integral sample sediment water in teflon tubing 0 5 ml hcl 1 ml of hno3 subsequently digestion was carried out in a microwave for 9 5 min in an oven temperature of 182 c in such a manner that afterwards a reading of the total si content could be done in the icp oes using 1 ml of the digested extract plus an additional 10 ml of ultrapure milli q water the amount of particulate si was then obtained by subtracting the soluble si content water filtered at 0 22 µm from the total si content si content in water plus sediment suspended sediment concentration was determined by evaporation and or filtration depending on the amount of sediment present in the sample shreve and downs 2005 samples with sediment concentrations of ca 200 ppm were filtered while samples with concentrations of ca 200 ppm were evaporated upon arriving at the laboratory the samples were weighed the samples were then allowed to rest so that the sediment was deposited at the bottom of the container then a 20 ml aliquot was withdrawn from the top of the container for the determination of soluble solids afterwards samples were placed in oven dry at 105 c for approximately two days until total water evaporation occurred and thus remained only the sediment finally mass balancing was done and ssc in g l 1 obtained 2 4 hydrograph separation using dissolved silicon dsi using a single tracer dsi the hydrograph can be separated into two components which we called surface runoff precipitation water directly transferred to the catchment outlet that contains no significant amounts of dsi and groundwater soil water old water or pre event water the method assumes that the streamflow consists of a mixture of two different sources having a different tracer concentration important assumptions are that the tracer is conservative and that the tracer concentration in each of the different flow components is more or less constant in time clymans et al 2013 dsi concentration in surface runoff and in groundwater soil water is indeed significantly different the dsi concentration in rainfall is negligible and consequently dsi concentration in surface runoff is low 1400 µg l 1 in contrast dsi concentration is much higher in groundwater and soil water 11200 µg l 1 this component in enriched in dsi due the longer time of interaction between water and soil or parent rock which causes de desilication of these materials that are rich in silicon guseva et al 2019 dsi can be considered as a semi conservative tracer it is unlikely that significant losses occur during a runoff event e g due to reprecipitation or consumption by diatoms however some dsi may become dissolved in surface runoff over the timescale of an event frings et al 2014 the basic equation for a two component mass balance equation can then be written as follows 1 q stream ds i stream q runoff ds i runoff q gw s w d s i gw s w where qstream is the stream discharge in l s 1 dsistream is the dsi concentration measured in the stream µg l 1 qrunoff is the contribution of the surface flow component l s 1 dsirunoff is the concentration of dissolved silicon in the surface flow µg l 1 qgw ws is the contribution of groundwater soil water l s 1 dsigw sw is the concentration of dissolved silicon in the groundwater soil water of the event in µg l 1 the contribution of groundwater soil water can be calculated from eq 1 where considering the dsi in the runoff component as zero the eq 1 can be rewritten to eq 2 2 q gw s w ds i stream q stream ds i gw s w 2 5 modeling erosion the openlisem model was used to simulated erosion and deposition openlisem 5 97 version 03 04 2020 openlisem is a spatially distributed event based model that allows not only to calculate total surface runoff and sediment export at the catchment outlet but also the spatial distribution of erosion and deposition within the catchment with a high temporal resolution de roo et al 1996 hessel 2002 jetten and de roo 2001 the model is designed to simulate the effects of detailed land use changes or conservation measures on surface runoff flooding and erosion during heavy rainstorms in order to apply the model to the arvorezinha catchment the catchment area was divided into a grid of square cells 5 m resolution for each cell the model simulates surface runoff and erosion processes based on soil topography land use and rainfall data the basic map set required to run the model is composed of the boundary limits of the catchment the location of monitoring points a digital elevation model as well as soil and land use maps from these maps and information collected in the field the input information required by the model is derived the ratio between time δt and space δx resolution that provides stability in the resolution of calculations can be obtained by the courant condition according to this condition the δt must be less than or equal to the division between cell size δx by the speed µ of the kinematic wave we used a spatial and temporal resolution of δx 5 m and δt 20 s 2 5 1 model input parameters the input values required by the lisem model are related to topography the soil surface state and roughness the infiltration process soil detachability and vegetation characteristics jetten 2002 in this study input values used were mostly the same as those used in a previous studies de barros 2016 dalbianco 2013 de barros et al 2014 an overview is given in table 1 and the measurement procedure is described in the next section a new and more detailed dem was composed for this study a topographic survey was carried out using the gnss global navigation satellite system in real time kinematic rtk readings were taken at each point during ca 5 s resulting in a positional accuracy of ca 1 cm in total 10 500 points were surveyed according to the characteristics of the arvorezinha catchment the parameterization of the openlisem model was based on two layers a superficial layer 0 0 0 20 m related to the characteristics of the land use and soil management and a subsoil layer 0 20 1 0 m describing the characteristics of the subsoil the two soil layers describe the differences in the soil properties for the study area therefore infiltration and surface runoff generation were simulated using the two layer version of the green ampt model 2 5 2 measurement of openlisem input parameters considering the importance of some parameters in the calibration procedure the description of how these were obtained is summarized in total 40 points within the catchment were sampled to characterize soil physical parameters ksat total soil porosity and soil water retention curve swrc in each point three undisturbed samples of each layer surface and subsurface layer except for leptosols that was sampled only in the first layer were collected using cylindrical rings the sampling scheme aims to characterize different land use and soil management surface layer and soil type subsurface layer hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil ksat considered the most sensitive parameter in the openlisem model it is directly connected with the infiltration and surface runoff processes for this reason an effort was made to characterize the spatial variability of ksat in the arvorezinha catchment ksat was determined in the laboratory with pre sample preparation and measurement in a constant head permeameter and its quantification was determined from the darcy equation donagema et al 2011 total soil porosity was determined with the same samples from the volume of pores occupied 100 by water when they were saturated in the end different values of ksat and total porosity were assigned according to different land uses and soil type initial soil moisture θi the spatial and temporal variability of the soil moisture before a rain event in the catchment scale is difficult to control considering this limitation we used a method that relates the matric potential and its corresponding soil moisture differently of other authors that used the rawls et al 1983 equation to estimate the matric potential through soil granulometry grum et al 2017 thus the initial moisture and the respective matric potential were adjusted from the swrc according to van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 to determine the swrc the undisturbed samples were saturated during 48 h after that they were placed in a tension table reinert and reichert 2006 and submitted to the tensions of 1 6 and 10 kpa richard chambers were used for the tensions of 33 and 100 kpa black 1995 besides the undisturbed samples disturbed samples were collected and used to determine the corresponding moisture in the very dry end of the water retention curve tensions of 500 1000 and 1500 kpa using a thermocouple psychrometer apparatus dewpoint potential meter wp4 decagon devices 2000 the antecedent soil moisture condition and respectively matric potential before a rain event were estimated by means of accumulated rain in the last five days ppt 5 classifying the soil moisture as i dry soil if ppt 5 36 mm ii soil in the field capacity if ppt 5 36 and 53 mm and iii saturated soil if ppt 5 53 mm usda nrcs 2009 2004 finally having the swrc for each land use and soil management surface layer and soil type subsurface layer it was defined for dry soil condition the matric potential of 500 kpa for soil in the field capacity 10 kpa and for saturated soil 1 kpa soil roughness manning s n was obtained in the literature table 1 and spatialized according to land use and soil management manning s n channel value was obtained in field de oliveira 2010 table 1 soil cohesion coh was obtained in the field using a torvane when the soil was wet immediately after the occurrence of a runoff event measured in a total of 40 points distributed in different land uses and soil managements channel cohesion has been calibrated for each rainfall event median of the texture of the soil d50 was determined in previous studies moro 2011 in the laboratory using the method of the pipette donagema et al 2011 d50 is used to simulate the settling velocity aggregate stability as is used to control the splash erosion it is the median number of the drops needed to decrease the size of the aggregates by half on a sieve based on mccalla 1944 modified by bruce okine and lal 1975 and imeson and vis 1984 eighty aggregates with the same size approximately 4 8 mm were used to measure the as for each land use and soil management and the respectively mean was considered even though these parameters being measured in the field or in laboratory some parameters that describe the processes are influenced by the scale effect for example the ksat that is closely related to the scale that was measured ksat values measured under simulated rainfall condition were closer to those calibrated using green ampt coupled in a physical and distributed based erosion model than those measured in a constant head permeameter risse et al 1994 therefore different methodologies can generate values significantly different for a given parameter that makes necessary to apply correction factors in those that are influenced by scale effect 2 6 calibration approach we calibrated the model using two approaches in the first approach we calibrated the model using the streamflow surface subsurface base flow measured at the catchment outlet in the second approach we first applied flow separation to identify the contribution of overland flow to total catchment surface runoff each event was calibrated separately a manual calibration procedure was used which involves the adjustment of several parameters and this calibration procedure was repeated for both approaches with and without flow separation calibration was performed in two steps 1st calibration of hydrological processes in the first step surface runoff volume qrunoff surface runoff coefficient crunoff peak flow qpeak time until peak qtime and hydrograph shape was calibrated adjusting three parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity the initial soil moisture and manning s n for the slope as described before these parameters were estimated from soil samples collected in the field considering their spatial variability thereafter each parameter has a raster map in which is assigned for each cell a value corresponding to the land use and soil management or according to the soil type for example when the raster map of ksat receives a multiplier factor of 1 4 the ksat values in each pixel increase 40 the best fit for each parameter to simulate the hydrological process was found by trial and error until finding the closest relation between the measured and simulated by the openlisem model for the following variables qrunoff crunoff qpeak qtime and hydrograph shape 2nd calibration of erosion processes after calibration for hydrological processes sediment yield sy the maximum and average suspended sediment concentration sscpeak and sscave respectively and sedimentograph shape were adjusted by modifying soil and channel cohesion as with the hydrological parameters these variables were adjusted by using a constant multiplier factor for all the land uses the best fit for each parameter to simulate the erosion processes was found by trial and error until finding the closest relation between the measured and simulated by the openlisem model for the following variables sy sscave sscpeak and sedimentgraph shape finally when flow separation is used it is necessary to correct the ssc values monitored in the river channel by calculating the proportion of the flow from surface runoff 3 ss c runoff q runoff ss c stream q stream ss c gw s w q gw s w 4 ss c runoff ss c stream q stream q runoff where sscrunoff g l 1 is the suspended sediment concentration in the surface runoff sscstream g l 1 is the suspended sediment concentration in streamflow sscgw sw g l 1 is the suspended sediment concentration in the soil water and groundwater which is assumed to be zero in this study 2 7 efficiency analysis the nash and sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percentage bias pbias were used to assess the quality of the calibration results 5 nse 1 i 2 n em e s 2 i 1 n em e 2 where em is the value of the variable observed in a given time interval es is the value of the variable either calculated or simulated by the model at a given time e represents the average of the values observed during the simulation n is the number of data acquired during the events 6 pbias es e m em 100 pbias is the deviation of simulated values when compared to the observed values the percentage error nse was used to evaluate the shape of the hydrograph and sedimentgraph a value of 1 for nse indicates a perfect fit between the calculated and observed data values above 0 75 are considered very good between 0 65 and 0 75 good and below zero unacceptable moriasi et al 2007 as nse is calculated using absolute values its value is dependent on both the accurate simulation of the hydrograph sedimentgraph shape and the accurate simulation of the total amount of water and sediment that is exported the percent bias assesses whether the calculated data is overestimated or underestimated and was calculated for the following model outputs maximum water discharge during the event total surface runoff runoff coefficient time occurrence of the discharge peak sediment yield maximum ssc and average ssc the model fit is better when the pbias value is closer to zero for the variables associated with runoff values of pbias 10 are considered very good 10 pbias 15 good 15 pbias 25 satisfactory and 25 unsatisfactory whereas for calibration values on erosion variables are 15 very good 15 pbias 30 good 30 pbias 55 satisfactory and 55 unsatisfactory moriasi et al 2007 3 results 3 1 relationship between si and q the dsi concentration is negatively related to discharge suggesting that dilution mechanisms play a key role maher 2011 while the relationship between liquid discharge q and dsi is statistically highly significant r2 0 66 n 46 ρ 0 0001 fig 5 dsi is clearly not inversely proportional to q and dsi rapidly declines up to discharges of ca 100 l s 1 while further discharge increases have only a minor effect on si when analyzing the relationship between dsi and q in a single event it becomes obvious that dsi concentrations decrease considerably during a runoff event fig 6 however the relationship between dsi concentration and discharge is not unique the minimum dsi concentration often occurred significantly later than the discharge peak counter clockwise hysteresis suggesting that water rich in dsi contributed more to the rising stage of the hydrograph in comparison to the falling stage fig 6 table 2 shows results for the six events considering their magnitude low qpeak 300 l s 1 medium 300 l s 1 qpeak 800 l s 1 and high qpeak 800 l s 1 and seasons of the year the magnitude of each event was classified in previous studies in the catchment minella 2007 although only a limited number of events could be analysed our data suggest that during autumn winter when rainfall intensities are lower and soils are wetter the contribution of soil water sw and ground water gw to total catchment runoff is very high ca 80 during spring summer events surface runoff contributes more than during autumn winter when groundwater soil water contributes between 40 and 60 of streamflow 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 hydrological component multiplying factors were applied to ksat θi and manning s n slope values the θi parameter was calibrated using a multiplying factor that varied between 1 6 and 1 7 for different events in both approaches table 3 the manning s n values for the slope were multiplied by a factor of 0 4 and 1 30 for the events 06 07 2012 and 20 09 2013 respectively in the approach with runoff separation in the approach without runoff separation manning s n slope values for the slope were multiplied by a factor of 0 95 and 1 18 for the events 12 03 2013 and 20 09 2013 respectively the manning s n for the channel had a single value since there was no variation during calibrations manning s n channel 0 20 ksat was the parameter to which model output was most sensitive table 3 the calibrated value was significantly lower than the measured value for both approaches table 3 calibration results are shown in fig 7 concerning basic hydrograph characteristics qrunoff crunoff qtime qpeak acceptable calibration was obtained with and without runoff separation according to moriasi et al 2007 table 4 the exception was the event of 20 09 2013 with and without runoff separation which had the worst statistical performance pbias 25 table 4 in general the hydrograph shape could not be satisfactorily simulated with nse values below 0 for most events either with or without runoff separation fig 8 table 4 the six events evaluated in this study were classified as low and medium magnitude a common feature in these events is the presence of more than one smoother peak flows and the model is not able to simulate the observed form grum et al 2017 using the openlisem model also reports that openlisem was unable to consistently simulate small runoff peaks for hydrographs with multiple peaks 3 2 2 erosion component between 2016 and 2017 there were changes in the flow detachment efficiency equations into the model where two other equations were inserted in addition to the previous one equation a y 1 0 0 89 0 59 c o h equation b y 0 79 exp 0 85 c o h equantio c y 1 0 2 0 c o h where y is a dimensionless efficiency factor and coh is soil cohesion equation a is the original equation from the openlisem model equation b from the eurosem model and equation c from the morgan and finney model jetten and van den bout 2017 in this study we used the equation b instead of the one used in previous studies de barros et al 2014 which has substantially modified the calibration of erosion processes for the arvorezinha catchment in the approach with runoff separation coh multiplication factors were needed only for the event of 26 10 2013 with a factor of 0 13 for the approach without runoff separation the coh was multiplied by 0 32 0 16 and 0 19 for the events of 12 03 20 09 and 26 10 2013 respectively channel cohesion was calibrated for all events and approaches according to table 3 calibration results of the erosion component maximum and average suspended sediment concentration and sy are shown in fig 9 two events 12 03 2013 20 09 2013 were unsatisfactorily simulated for sscpeak and sy for the approach with runoff separation table 5 for all other events runoff separation led to significant improvements although the model never succeeded in correctly simulating the sedimentgraph resulting in negative nse values fig 10 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological analysis of the catchment upon analysis of the relationship of dsi and q from the six monitored events it could be noted that the dilution effect is present in the arvorezinha catchment and can play an important role in both catchment hydrology and its sedimentological dynamics the dilution observed during rainfall events shows that the generated hydrograph is dependent on not only surface flow but also subsurface flow the relationship between liquid discharge and concentration of dissolved chemicals makes it possible to further understand the hydrology of the catchment evans and davies 1998 lloyd et al 2016 williams et al 2018 considering that their relation can generate different patterns that are influenced by the climate and topography of the study site maher 2011 the six monitored events indicate that the dynamics of the origin of flows that occur in spring and summer are significantly different from those that occur in autumn and winter due to rainfall pattern the predominant effect or process during autumn and winter events appears to be the piston effect or translation pearce et al 1986 renée brooks et al 2010 translation takes place because precipitation is less intense and lengthy resulting in larger moisture in the soil influenced by the low evaporative demand in this period thus allowing water input and consequently occupation of the porous space however the translation process expels water that has been already stored old water making this water flow towards the river channel the new rainfall event water infiltrates and fills the pores by pushing the old water out then the probability that the soil infiltration capacity is exceeded is simply much smaller because in the autumn and winter the rain intensity is lower and less hortanian overland flow will occur in spring and summer the heavy rains generally do not saturate the soil profile thus part of the water flow runs quickly through the soil surface and probably the infiltrated portion generates a slower subsurface flow which creates a second peak in the hydrograph in this case the greatest contribution of rainwater new water prevails in relation to old water robinet et al 2018 used dsi and δ18o to understand the hydrological processes and pathways in the same catchment with data collection on spring of 2015 according to the authors the most contributing to streamflow during rainfall events in this period were new water or event water corresponding 60 3 11 2 to represent the hortonian mechanism of surface flow generation the green ampt model gm model has been used in physics based models in this model ksat is often used as a calibration parameter which showed the greatest sensitivity in adjusting flow in this study besides the evidence observed in the behavior of ksat values with and without runoff separation one can assume that the significant reduction of ksat values may originate from the non incorporation of other processes that occur on the landscape such as flow formation due to saturated areas and surface sealing formation which reduces infiltration rate and therefore favors surface flow generation stolte et al 1997 zhou et al 2013 cuomo and della sala 2013 evaluating the mechanisms of infiltration of water into the soil and generation of surface runoff showed that the time required for surface runoff and surface runoff to occur are strongly affected by the characteristic water curve initial soil conditions and rainfall intensity many processes occur in the hillslope and river interface which the physics based models do not include in their structure jencso et al 2009 in addition the low values of ksat at the end of the calibration can be explained by the ksat methods which tend to overestimate the values of this parameter different methodologies can be used to measure ksat however they generate significantly different values v 1993 in a study conducted in arvorezinha catchment evaluating the water infiltration values with a mean of 95 mm h 1 were found using double ring infiltrometer dalbianco 2013 while for undisturbed samples collected with cylindrical rings 113 cm3 height 4 cm a mean of 289 mm h 1 was observed dalbianco 2009 the arvorezinha catchment is characterized by its environmental fragility due to the soil types which have an impeditive subsurface layer from 20 cm preventing the continuous flow of water added to the effect of the sloping relief as described in section 2 1 fig 11 de barros et al 2014 the tracer methodology used in this study environment allowed to identify the relative contribution of each flow componentthat form the streamflow during rainfall events the application of process based erosion models from appropriate runoff separation can give more reliable results it should be noted that in this work as in robinet et al 2018 developed in the arvorezinha catchment they were based on a small set of rainfall events despite the clarification obtained in the six monitored events high magnitude events were not included the behavior of these events is highly important due to the increase in frequency and intensity they occur resulting in greater environmental and socio economic damage almagro et al 2017 nearing et al 2005 4 2 implications for erosion models runoff separation by dsi was essential for obtaining the correct estimation of surface runoff volumes which were significantly smaller in relation to the previously estimated ones in this catchment de barros et al 2014 the appropriate runoff separation improved our understanding of the suspended sediment generation and mobilization dynamics the occurrence of dilution effect originated from the presence of different water sources in the streamflow during the rainfall event robinet et al 2018 affects the ssc and sy dynamics hydro sedimentometric monitoring quantifies the sediment concentration at the catchment outlet which is the result of sediment from soil detachment and carried by surface runoff mainly the subsurface and base flow which have considerably low concentrations of suspended sediments on average 20 mg l 1 dilutes the sediment carried by surface runoff erosion processes modeling by the openlisem 2 01 old version is based only on sediment originating from the hillslope disaggregation transported by surface flow consequently high concentrations of suspended sediments are generated by the model differently from what occurs in hydrossedimentological monitoring de barros et al 2014 in this study using version 5 97 it was possible to evaluate which equation of detachment efficiency by runoff would better represent the characteristics of arvorezinha catchment thus using the original equation from eurosem model we reached the statistically acceptable values for pbias without having to change the original values when the runoff was separated table 5 when the runoff was not separated coh values were reduced for three events because the ssc values were low due to the dilution effect other studies applying the openlisem model to soils with higher silt content obtained statistically satisfactory results hessel 2002 hessel and jetten 2007 using equation a fitted for silty soils jetten and van den bout 2017 when the surface runoff was not separated the hydrological dynamic that occurs in the arvorezinha catchment is neglected results improve when runoff separation is applied avoiding the need to change the input parameters related to erosive processes thus runoff separation is important for correct insertion of the surface runoff component as well as insertion of the sediment that has been transported by surface runoff with no dilution effect eq 3 even after runoff separation it remains difficult to calibrate the model for sedimentgraph shape this may be related to the effect of hysteresis observed but not simulated by the model even recent versions such as 5 97 in arvorezinha catchment the peaks of sedimentographs and hydrographs exceptionally occur simultaneously de barros et al 2020 5 conclusion the results of this study reveal an average contribution of 62 of subsurface and base flow to the streamflow during rainfall events in the arvorezinha catchment the contribution of these lower velocity flows has a direct impact on hydrological and sedimentological simulation the use of dissolved silicon to quantify the contribution of surface runoff allowed to improve the simulation of the processes by the model since subsurface runoff is not represented based on this the dynamics of the sediment is reflected at the catchment outlet which impact the modeling of this process by physics based and distributed models as the openlisem model however even considering the dilution effect observed by dsi and correcting the suspended sediment concentration the sedimentgraph shape was not well reproduced although the modeling results in this study were not completely satisfactory they enabled us to understand an important process that occurs at the study site which could be better understood using dsi as tracer of water flows although a great effort was made to characterize the processes other factors did not allow us to obtain good results by modeling the combination of high quality monitoring data and the correct quantification of the process is essential for the physical models to reproduce the process faithfully especially in a catchment that includes such complex processes credit authorship contribution statement cláudia alessandra peixoto de barros conceptualization methodology investigation

4597,water flows that move slowly in the landscape are not simulated by spatially and physical distributed erosion models and can contribute significantly during rainfall events in the streamflow making model calibration complex the goals of this study were i to assess the relative contribution of subsurface and surface runoff to the streamflow at the outlet and ii to investigate to what extent the presence of runoff other than hortonian overland flow affects erosion model performance the arvorezinha catchment 1 23 km2 southern brazil is characterized by the cultivation of tobacco under minimum cultivation system on shallow soils from october 2011 until october 2013 we set up a complementary monitoring program of water chemistry and samples were collected during rainfall runoff events to analyze dissolved silicon dsi the observed hydrograph was separated into two components using dsi i surface flow and ii groundwater soil water flow the openlisem model was used to assess the impact of different runoff sources and understand the hydrological and erosive process dynamics in the catchment for this a manual calibration procedure was used and repeated for two approaches with and without runoff separation for the six rainfall events evaluated 62 of the hydrograph is formed by groundwater soil water especially in autumn winter and for low medium magnitude events up to qpeak 800 l s 1 the dilution effect was observed during rainfall events when liquid discharge increases dsi concentration and suspended sediment concentration decreases the performance of physics based models in a catchment with very fragile soils and with frequent changes in land use is impacted by runoff separation keywords dissolved silicon erosion modeling sediment yield runoff separation 1 introduction soil erosion is an environmental process that causes significant on site and off site damage boardman et al 2003 borrelli et al 2017 quinton et al 2010 in order to simulate those effects and investigate the consequences of erosion a large variety of models have been developed erosion models vary from lumped statistical models such as the revised universal soil loss equation rusle which simply predicts average annual losses from a plot or hillslope renard et al 1997 2010 to dynamic spatially distributed process based models the latter are capable of simulating sediment mobilization transport and deposition at very fine spatial and temporal scales such as the water erosion prediction project wepp flanagan and nearing 1995 flanagan et al 2007 the limburg soil erosion model openlisem de roo et al 1996 jetten 2002 jetten and de roo 2001 jetten and van den bout 2017 and the multi class sediment transport model mcst fiener et al 2008 these dynamic spatially distributed process based models describe the relevant erosion processes using a so called physically based approach whereby the description of each process is no longer based only on empirical measurements but on the understanding of how these processes operate openlisem model has evolved since its publication in the 90s and since 2011 an open source model has been presented this has allowed improvements in the description of the erosive process insertion of new detachment flow equations insertion of other parameters such as d90 etc and in the dynamics of water flows insertion of flood ground water flow etc jetten and van den bout 2017 conversely even considering the improvements there are limitations in the representation of the erosive process especially when other processes and complexities are involved such as snowmelt starkloff et al 2018 water harvesting techniques grum et al 2017 and cohesive soils de barros et al 2014 process based erosion models should in principle enable better simulations and predict sediment yield and transfer than empirical models especially at the event time scale however several studies have shown that this is not the case the predictive power of process based erosion models is not significantly larger than that of older statistical models such as the universal soil loss equation usle brazier et al 2000 croke and nethery 2006 govers 2011 the reasons why process based models do not have better predictive ability are at least partially understood process based models require a large number of input values merritt et al 2003 which some of them can only be determined with a relatively low degree of accuracy quinton 1997 and these models continue to use empirical equations to simulate some sub processes and are based on empirical coefficients e g rill erodibility this uncertainty is related to the inadequacy of available measurement techniques e g the determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity on relatively small samples and or to the spatial and temporal variability of these values this uncertainty related to inputs and the inadequacy of the appliedequations is directly translated into uncertainty on model outcomes brazier et al 2000 peukert et al 2012 a factor that should be considered in model comparisons is that process based erosion models are necessarily driven by a process based runoff generation model primarily erosion simulation requires the prediction of the spatially and temporally variable amount of water that is flowing over the surface of the landscape during a runoff event most existing erosion models implicitly assume that runoff is generated due to infiltration excess i e hortonian overland flow which is generated when rainfall intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity the wepp model uses the green ampt mein larson gaml approach while the openlisem model makes it possible to simulate overland flow using either the richards equation or the green ampt equation hairsine and rose hairsine and rose 1992 1991 used a modified curve number cn soil conservation service approach to calculate infiltration runoff routine in their model hr soil erosion model van oost et al 2004 the assumption that runoff is generated by infiltration excess is not always valid poesen et al 2003 already noticed that ephemeral gullies under moist conditions may be caused by saturation overland flow van den putte et al 2013 showed that runoff generation on arable lands in belgium could be simulated with acceptable precision using a modified gaml approach during the spring and summer period however this was not the case during autumn and winter when the soil was near saturation under such conditions saturation of the soil profile rather than infiltration excess controls runoff generation and it is evident that a model that does not account for saturation overland flow generation will not be able to accurately describe or predict runoff and erosion cuomo et al 2015 saturation overland flow may be also important on agricultural terraces gallart et al 1994 the problem of runoff generation becomes even more complicated at catchment scale mcglynn et al 2003 at the catchment scale rapid water movement below the surface is often important during rainfall events catchment event runoff may therefore not only be controlled by surface runoff but also by translator flow hewlett and hibbert 1967 renée brooks et al 2010 return flow dunne 1978 and macropore flow mcdonnell et al 1990 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 within the soil several studies godsey et al 2009 martínez carreras et al 2016 zuecco et al 2018 confirmed earlier results from pearce et al 1986 revealing that the runoff leaving a catchment due to a rainfall event often consists of a large fraction of old water that is pushed out of the soil by the fresh rainfall input i e translatory flow the latter then explains why many catchments show near chemostatic behavior i e concentrations of dissolved solids in runoff water are far less dependent on discharge than expected godsey et al 2009 rose et al 2018 the fact that runoff generation also occurs due to other mechanisms besides hortonian overland flow robinet et al 2018 has important implications for testing process based erosion models at catchment scale frequently representative infiltration parameters are derived by model calibration i e by matching the observed and simulated catchment hydrograph halwatura and najim 2013 hessel and van asch 2003 hoshin and schaefli 2007 while this approach is appropriate when catchment runoff is indeed primarily produced by infiltration excess it may lead to large errors in erosion simulation when runoff is mainly generated by other processes in this study we aim to investigate to what extent different mechanisms of runoff generation play a role in the sloping mixed land use landscapes of southern brazil and how this may affect the performance of an erosion model we study runoff and erosion processes in a small agricultural catchment in se brazil that is subject to intense agricultural erosion dissolved si dsi was used to discriminate between surface and subsurface runoff klaus and mcdonnell 2013 next we assess how the performance of a process based erosion model lisem is affected by the variable contribution of different runoff sources at catchment level the objectives of our study were i to assess the sources of catchment runoff and ii to investigate to what extent the presence of runoff other than hortonian overland flow affects erosion model performance 2 methodology 2 1 study area and control factors the experimental catchment of the lajeado ferreira stream is located in arvorezinha brazil and has a drainage area of ca 1 23 km2 the catchment is a typical headwater catchment located on the southern border of the basaltic meridional plateau of brazil fig 1 igneous rocks basalts and rhyodacite characterize the geology and the altitude varies from 580 to 730 m fig 1 the upper third of the catchment has an undulating plateau relief with slopes up to 7 the middle and lower third of the catchment have a much steeper topography with slope gradients often exceeding 15 the fields naturally have a high connectivity with the natural channels as there is no depositional area between the channel and the sloping land moreover riparian areas are not well protected by natural forests facilitating the transfer of water and sediment from the hillslope to the river channel the unpaved roads also play an important role in the water dynamics of the catchment they are directly connected to the catchment drainage network and have an impervious surface therefore they generate large amounts of surface runoff as well as of sediment minella et al 2009 the high connectivity accelerates water and sediment discharge to the river channel opportunities for sediment storage within the catchment are limited the climate is classified as cfb subtropical super humid with no dry season and warm summer according to köppen alvares et al 2013 the average annual rainfall is ca 1938 mm and the erosivity index ei30 is 9344 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 ramon 2017 the rain is well distributed throughout the year however runoff occurs more often during spring due to high rainfall intensities the soil types in the catchment are classified as acrisols cambisols and leptosols according to a detailed soil classification survey 1 5000 that was carried out in accordance to the guidelines of the iuss working group wrb 2006 fig 2 a the acrisols are mainly located in the upper portion of the catchment they are characterized by an abrupt texture change between the a horizon and the argic b horizon which may potentially lead to water stagnation on top of the b horizon the leptosols are found in the lower portion of the catchment where the relief is steep and characterized by the absence of a subsurface horizon where the surface horizon is in direct contact with the rock thus affecting water flux in the deeper layers where leptosols are present there are often coarse materials such as boulders and gravel at the surface cambisols locally appear in areas dominated by acrisols and or leptosols soil drainage is classified as being moderate to good de barros 2012 dalbianco 2013 however on gentle slopes the soil may remain saturated for several days after a rainfall event the spatial and temporal variability of land use and soil management was determined using both satellite images google earth images from 2011 to 2014 and field surveys using a handheld global position system gps device land use in the catchment is dynamic and quite sensitive to the prices of agricultural products tobacco cultivation nicotiana tabacum l has long been the agricultural activity of greatest economic importance in the study site and although it occupied only 14 of the catchment in the 2011 2014 growing season it was still considered an important source of income for the farmers fig 2b an increase in soybean and corn cultivation occurred which covered up to 23 of the total catchment area in 2014 fig 2b reforestation areas with eucalyptus eucalyptus spp have increased since 2008 from 14 4 to 34 8 in 2014 de barros 2016 after 2016 the cultivation of erva mate ilex paraguariensis which is used for the preparation of tea has replaced some old tobacco plantations soil management is characterized by conventional tillage ct and minimum tillage mt for both grain and tobacco in tobacco cultivation farmers build ridges 30 cm high with a 70 cm of distance between them in order to increase aeration in the root zone and facilitate root development the ridge is not built horizontally but with a small lateral slope whose purpose is removing excess water from the crops badly constructed ridges can result in the formation of erosion rills if conventional tillage is used the soil is ploughed which promotes soil aeration but the exposure of bare soil to raindrop impact leads to crust formation and surface runoff generation on the leptosols crust formation is to some extent prevented by the presence of rock fragments 2 2 monitoring of hydrological variables this catchment is being monitored since january 2002 with the aim of assessing the impact of agriculture on soil and water resources a regular and continuous program of hydrological monitoring was established in order to quantify erosion related processes and to identify controlling factors land use and management soil types and climate accumulated rainfall is measured daily by an observer in a rain gauge ville de paris model and used as a reference to adjust the measurements of two pluviographs solar brand installed at different locations of the catchment in march 2014 an optical laser disdrometer was installed ott parsivel2 which was used for the characterization of precipitation and to obtain the of the kinetic energy equation for the location ramon et al 2017 monitoring of water discharge and suspended sediments concentration is performed in the outlet of the catchment fig 3 through a parshall flume with a limnigraph model ott thalimedes and turbidity meter solar model sl 2000 moreover field surveys were conducted to collect samples during storm rainfall for determining the suspended sediment concentration ssc this information was then used for turbidimeter calibration merten et al 2014 samples to determine ssc were collected on a walkway over the streamflow during rainfall events using a usdh 48 sampler integrating vertical variability the interval between collections is defined by visual observation of the variation of the level and the ssc which are different at each event 2 3 water chemistry from october 2011 we set up a complementary monitoring program of water chemistry twenty six water samples were collected during base flow conditions to characterize dsi in groundwater dsi gw at fortnightly or monthly intervals from 07 09 2011 to 07 9 2012 fig 4 sampling during events started on 01 10 2011 and lasted until october 26 2013 six storm events were fully monitored to measure dsi in runoff fig 4 sampling for water chemistry was done manually at varying water levels so that variations in water chemistry during the flood wave could be detected 2 3 1 laboratory analysis si and ssc an aliquot 20 ml of each integral sample sediment water was collected and filtered through a 0 22 µm porosity filter membrane ha in cellulose ester the aliquot that passed through the filter was used for the determination of soluble silicon content through atomic emission spectrometry by an inductively coupled plasma machine icp oes perkin elmer beside this we measured in the samples the elements al b ba be ca cd co cr cu fe k la mg mn na ni p pb sb se sr ti v zn in order to estimate the total si amount asi dsi another aliquot was collected the adopted procedure was the addition of 20 ml of integral sample sediment water in teflon tubing 0 5 ml hcl 1 ml of hno3 subsequently digestion was carried out in a microwave for 9 5 min in an oven temperature of 182 c in such a manner that afterwards a reading of the total si content could be done in the icp oes using 1 ml of the digested extract plus an additional 10 ml of ultrapure milli q water the amount of particulate si was then obtained by subtracting the soluble si content water filtered at 0 22 µm from the total si content si content in water plus sediment suspended sediment concentration was determined by evaporation and or filtration depending on the amount of sediment present in the sample shreve and downs 2005 samples with sediment concentrations of ca 200 ppm were filtered while samples with concentrations of ca 200 ppm were evaporated upon arriving at the laboratory the samples were weighed the samples were then allowed to rest so that the sediment was deposited at the bottom of the container then a 20 ml aliquot was withdrawn from the top of the container for the determination of soluble solids afterwards samples were placed in oven dry at 105 c for approximately two days until total water evaporation occurred and thus remained only the sediment finally mass balancing was done and ssc in g l 1 obtained 2 4 hydrograph separation using dissolved silicon dsi using a single tracer dsi the hydrograph can be separated into two components which we called surface runoff precipitation water directly transferred to the catchment outlet that contains no significant amounts of dsi and groundwater soil water old water or pre event water the method assumes that the streamflow consists of a mixture of two different sources having a different tracer concentration important assumptions are that the tracer is conservative and that the tracer concentration in each of the different flow components is more or less constant in time clymans et al 2013 dsi concentration in surface runoff and in groundwater soil water is indeed significantly different the dsi concentration in rainfall is negligible and consequently dsi concentration in surface runoff is low 1400 µg l 1 in contrast dsi concentration is much higher in groundwater and soil water 11200 µg l 1 this component in enriched in dsi due the longer time of interaction between water and soil or parent rock which causes de desilication of these materials that are rich in silicon guseva et al 2019 dsi can be considered as a semi conservative tracer it is unlikely that significant losses occur during a runoff event e g due to reprecipitation or consumption by diatoms however some dsi may become dissolved in surface runoff over the timescale of an event frings et al 2014 the basic equation for a two component mass balance equation can then be written as follows 1 q stream ds i stream q runoff ds i runoff q gw s w d s i gw s w where qstream is the stream discharge in l s 1 dsistream is the dsi concentration measured in the stream µg l 1 qrunoff is the contribution of the surface flow component l s 1 dsirunoff is the concentration of dissolved silicon in the surface flow µg l 1 qgw ws is the contribution of groundwater soil water l s 1 dsigw sw is the concentration of dissolved silicon in the groundwater soil water of the event in µg l 1 the contribution of groundwater soil water can be calculated from eq 1 where considering the dsi in the runoff component as zero the eq 1 can be rewritten to eq 2 2 q gw s w ds i stream q stream ds i gw s w 2 5 modeling erosion the openlisem model was used to simulated erosion and deposition openlisem 5 97 version 03 04 2020 openlisem is a spatially distributed event based model that allows not only to calculate total surface runoff and sediment export at the catchment outlet but also the spatial distribution of erosion and deposition within the catchment with a high temporal resolution de roo et al 1996 hessel 2002 jetten and de roo 2001 the model is designed to simulate the effects of detailed land use changes or conservation measures on surface runoff flooding and erosion during heavy rainstorms in order to apply the model to the arvorezinha catchment the catchment area was divided into a grid of square cells 5 m resolution for each cell the model simulates surface runoff and erosion processes based on soil topography land use and rainfall data the basic map set required to run the model is composed of the boundary limits of the catchment the location of monitoring points a digital elevation model as well as soil and land use maps from these maps and information collected in the field the input information required by the model is derived the ratio between time δt and space δx resolution that provides stability in the resolution of calculations can be obtained by the courant condition according to this condition the δt must be less than or equal to the division between cell size δx by the speed µ of the kinematic wave we used a spatial and temporal resolution of δx 5 m and δt 20 s 2 5 1 model input parameters the input values required by the lisem model are related to topography the soil surface state and roughness the infiltration process soil detachability and vegetation characteristics jetten 2002 in this study input values used were mostly the same as those used in a previous studies de barros 2016 dalbianco 2013 de barros et al 2014 an overview is given in table 1 and the measurement procedure is described in the next section a new and more detailed dem was composed for this study a topographic survey was carried out using the gnss global navigation satellite system in real time kinematic rtk readings were taken at each point during ca 5 s resulting in a positional accuracy of ca 1 cm in total 10 500 points were surveyed according to the characteristics of the arvorezinha catchment the parameterization of the openlisem model was based on two layers a superficial layer 0 0 0 20 m related to the characteristics of the land use and soil management and a subsoil layer 0 20 1 0 m describing the characteristics of the subsoil the two soil layers describe the differences in the soil properties for the study area therefore infiltration and surface runoff generation were simulated using the two layer version of the green ampt model 2 5 2 measurement of openlisem input parameters considering the importance of some parameters in the calibration procedure the description of how these were obtained is summarized in total 40 points within the catchment were sampled to characterize soil physical parameters ksat total soil porosity and soil water retention curve swrc in each point three undisturbed samples of each layer surface and subsurface layer except for leptosols that was sampled only in the first layer were collected using cylindrical rings the sampling scheme aims to characterize different land use and soil management surface layer and soil type subsurface layer hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil ksat considered the most sensitive parameter in the openlisem model it is directly connected with the infiltration and surface runoff processes for this reason an effort was made to characterize the spatial variability of ksat in the arvorezinha catchment ksat was determined in the laboratory with pre sample preparation and measurement in a constant head permeameter and its quantification was determined from the darcy equation donagema et al 2011 total soil porosity was determined with the same samples from the volume of pores occupied 100 by water when they were saturated in the end different values of ksat and total porosity were assigned according to different land uses and soil type initial soil moisture θi the spatial and temporal variability of the soil moisture before a rain event in the catchment scale is difficult to control considering this limitation we used a method that relates the matric potential and its corresponding soil moisture differently of other authors that used the rawls et al 1983 equation to estimate the matric potential through soil granulometry grum et al 2017 thus the initial moisture and the respective matric potential were adjusted from the swrc according to van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 to determine the swrc the undisturbed samples were saturated during 48 h after that they were placed in a tension table reinert and reichert 2006 and submitted to the tensions of 1 6 and 10 kpa richard chambers were used for the tensions of 33 and 100 kpa black 1995 besides the

determined in previous studies moro 2011 in the laboratory using the method of the pipette donagema et al 2011 d50 is used to simulate the settling velocity aggregate stability as is used to control the splash erosion it is the median number of the drops needed to decrease the size of the aggregates by half on a sieve based on mccalla 1944 modified by bruce okine and lal 1975 and imeson and vis 1984 eighty aggregates with the same size approximately 4 8 mm were used to measure the as for each land use and soil management and the respectively mean was considered even though these parameters being measured in the field or in laboratory some parameters that describe the processes are influenced by the scale effect for example the ksat that is closely related to the scale that was measured ksat values measured under simulated rainfall condition were closer to those calibrated using green ampt coupled in a physical and distributed based erosion model than those measured in a constant head permeameter risse et al 1994 therefore different methodologies can generate values significantly different for a given parameter that makes necessary to apply correction factors in those that are influenced by scale effect 2 6 calibration approach we calibrated the model using two approaches in the first approach we calibrated the model using the streamflow surface subsurface base flow measured at the catchment outlet in the second approach we first applied flow separation to identify the contribution of overland flow to total catchment surface runoff each event was calibrated separately a manual calibration procedure was used which involves the adjustment of several parameters and this calibration procedure was repeated for both approaches with and without flow separation calibration was performed in two steps 1st calibration of hydrological processes in the first step surface runoff volume qrunoff surface runoff coefficient crunoff peak flow qpeak time until peak qtime and hydrograph shape was calibrated adjusting three parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity the initial soil moisture and manning s n for the slope as described before these parameters were estimated from soil samples collected in the field considering their spatial variability thereafter each parameter has a raster map in which is assigned for each cell a value corresponding to the land use and soil management or according to the soil type for example when the raster map of ksat receives a multiplier factor of 1 4 the ksat values in each pixel increase 40 the best fit for each parameter to simulate the hydrological process was found by trial and error until finding the closest relation between the measured and simulated by the openlisem model for the following variables qrunoff crunoff qpeak qtime and hydrograph shape 2nd calibration of erosion processes after calibration for hydrological processes sediment yield sy the maximum and average suspended sediment concentration sscpeak and sscave respectively and sedimentograph shape were adjusted by modifying soil and channel cohesion as with the hydrological parameters these variables were adjusted by using a constant multiplier factor for all the land uses the best fit for each parameter to simulate the erosion processes was found by trial and error until finding the closest relation between the measured and simulated by the openlisem model for the following variables sy sscave sscpeak and sedimentgraph shape finally when flow separation is used it is necessary to correct the ssc values monitored in the river channel by calculating the proportion of the flow from surface runoff 3 ss c runoff q runoff ss c stream q stream ss c gw s w q gw s w 4 ss c runoff ss c stream q stream q runoff where sscrunoff g l 1 is the suspended sediment concentration in the surface runoff sscstream g l 1 is the suspended sediment concentration in streamflow sscgw sw g l 1 is the suspended sediment concentration in the soil water and groundwater which is assumed to be zero in this study 2 7 efficiency analysis the nash and sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percentage bias pbias were used to assess the quality of the calibration results 5 nse 1 i 2 n em e s 2 i 1 n em e 2 where em is the value of the variable observed in a given time interval es is the value of the variable either calculated or simulated by the model at a given time e represents the average of the values observed during the simulation n is the number of data acquired during the events 6 pbias es e m em 100 pbias is the deviation of simulated values when compared to the observed values the percentage error nse was used to evaluate the shape of the hydrograph and sedimentgraph a value of 1 for nse indicates a perfect fit between the calculated and observed data values above 0 75 are considered very good between 0 65 and 0 75 good and below zero unacceptable moriasi et al 2007 as nse is calculated using absolute values its value is dependent on both the accurate simulation of the hydrograph sedimentgraph shape and the accurate simulation of the total amount of water and sediment that is exported the percent bias assesses whether the calculated data is overestimated or underestimated and was calculated for the following model outputs maximum water discharge during the event total surface runoff runoff coefficient time occurrence of the discharge peak sediment yield maximum ssc and average ssc the model fit is better when the pbias value is closer to zero for the variables associated with runoff values of pbias 10 are considered very good 10 pbias 15 good 15 pbias 25 satisfactory and 25 unsatisfactory whereas for calibration values on erosion variables are

suggesting that dilution mechanisms play a key role maher 2011 while the relationship between liquid discharge q and dsi is statistically highly significant r2 0 66 n 46 ρ 0 0001 fig 5 dsi is clearly not inversely proportional to q and dsi rapidly declines up to discharges of ca 100 l s 1 while further discharge increases have only a minor effect on si when analyzing the relationship between dsi and q in a single event it becomes obvious that dsi concentrations decrease considerably during a runoff event fig 6 however the relationship between dsi concentration and discharge is not unique the minimum dsi concentration often occurred significantly later than the discharge peak counter clockwise hysteresis suggesting that water rich in dsi contributed more to the rising stage of the hydrograph in comparison to the falling stage fig 6 table 2 shows results for the six events considering their magnitude low qpeak 300 l s 1 medium 300 l s 1 qpeak 800 l s 1 and high qpeak 800 l s 1 and seasons of the year the magnitude of each event was classified in previous studies in the catchment minella 2007 although only a limited number of events could be analysed our data suggest that during autumn winter when rainfall intensities are lower and soils are wetter the contribution of soil water sw and ground water gw to total catchment runoff is very high ca 80 during spring summer events surface runoff contributes more than during autumn winter when groundwater soil water contributes between 40 and 60 of streamflow 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 hydrological component multiplying factors were applied to ksat θi and manning s n slope values the θi parameter was calibrated using a multiplying factor that varied between 1 6 and 1 7 for different events in both approaches table 3 the manning s n values for the slope were multiplied by a factor of 0 4 and 1 30 for the events 06 07 2012 and 20 09 2013 respectively in the approach with runoff separation in the approach without runoff separation manning s n slope values for the slope were multiplied by a factor of 0 95 and 1 18 for the events 12 03 2013 and 20 09 2013 respectively the manning s n for the channel had a single value since there was no variation during calibrations manning s n channel 0 20 ksat was the parameter to which model output was most sensitive table 3 the calibrated value was significantly lower than the measured value for both approaches table 3 calibration results are shown in fig 7 concerning basic hydrograph characteristics qrunoff crunoff qtime qpeak acceptable calibration was obtained with and without runoff separation according to moriasi et al 2007 table 4 the exception was the event of 20 09 2013 with and without runoff separation which had the worst statistical performance pbias 25 table 4 in general the hydrograph shape could not be satisfactorily simulated with nse values below 0 for most events either with or without runoff separation fig 8 table 4 the six events evaluated in this study were classified as low and medium magnitude a common feature in these events is the presence of more than one smoother peak flows and the model is not able to simulate the observed form grum et al 2017 using the openlisem model also reports that openlisem was unable to consistently simulate small runoff peaks for hydrographs with multiple peaks 3 2 2 erosion component between 2016 and 2017 there were changes in the flow detachment efficiency equations into the model where two other equations were inserted in addition to the previous one equation a y 1 0 0 89 0 59 c o h equation b y 0 79 exp 0 85 c o h equantio c y 1 0 2 0 c o h where y is a dimensionless efficiency factor and coh is soil cohesion equation a is the original equation from the openlisem model equation b from the eurosem model and equation c from the morgan and finney model jetten and van den bout 2017 in this study we used the equation b instead of the one used in previous studies de barros et al 2014 which has substantially modified the calibration of erosion processes for the arvorezinha catchment in the approach with runoff separation coh multiplication factors were needed only for the event of 26 10 2013 with a factor of 0 13 for the approach without runoff separation the coh was multiplied by 0 32 0 16 and 0 19 for the events of 12 03 20 09 and 26 10 2013 respectively channel cohesion was calibrated for all events and approaches according to table 3 calibration results of the erosion component maximum and average suspended sediment concentration and sy are shown in fig 9 two events 12 03 2013 20 09 2013 were unsatisfactorily simulated for sscpeak and sy for the approach with runoff separation table 5 for all other events runoff separation led to significant improvements although the model never succeeded in correctly simulating the sedimentgraph resulting in negative nse values fig 10 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological analysis of the catchment upon analysis of the relationship of dsi and q from the six monitored events it could be noted that the dilution effect is present in the arvorezinha catchment and can play an important role in both catchment hydrology and its sedimentological dynamics the dilution observed during rainfall events shows that the generated hydrograph is dependent on not only surface flow but also subsurface flow the relationship between liquid discharge and concentration of dissolved chemicals makes it possible to further understand the hydrology of the catchment evans and davies 1998 lloyd et al 2016 williams et al 2018 considering that their relation can generate different patterns that are influenced by the climate and topography of the study site maher 2011 the six monitored events indicate that the dynamics of the origin of flows that occur in spring and summer are significantly different from those that occur in autumn and winter due to rainfall pattern the predominant effect or process during autumn and winter events appears to be the piston effect or translation pearce et al 1986 renée brooks et al 2010 translation takes place because precipitation is less intense and lengthy resulting in larger moisture in the soil influenced by the low evaporative demand in this period thus allowing water input and consequently occupation of the porous space however the translation process expels water that has been already stored old water making this water flow towards the river channel the new rainfall event water infiltrates and fills the pores by pushing the old water out then the probability that the soil infiltration capacity is exceeded is simply much smaller because in the autumn and winter the rain intensity is lower and less hortanian overland flow will occur in spring and summer the heavy rains generally do not saturate the soil profile thus part of the water flow runs quickly through the soil surface and probably the infiltrated portion generates a slower subsurface flow which creates a second peak in the hydrograph in this case the greatest contribution of rainwater new water prevails in relation to old water robinet et al 2018 used dsi and δ18o to understand the hydrological processes and pathways in the same catchment with data collection on spring of 2015 according to the authors the most contributing to streamflow during rainfall events in this period were new water or event water corresponding 60 3 11 2 to represent the hortonian mechanism of surface flow generation the green ampt model gm model has been used in physics based models in this model ksat is often used as a calibration parameter which showed the greatest sensitivity in adjusting flow in this study besides the evidence observed in the behavior of ksat values with and without runoff separation one can assume that the significant reduction of ksat values may originate from the non incorporation of other processes that occur on the landscape such as flow formation due to saturated areas and surface sealing formation which reduces infiltration rate and therefore favors surface flow generation stolte et al 1997 zhou et al 2013 cuomo and della sala 2013 evaluating the mechanisms of infiltration of water into the soil and generation of surface runoff showed that the time required for surface runoff and surface runoff to occur are strongly affected by the characteristic water curve initial soil conditions and rainfall intensity many processes occur in the hillslope and river interface which the physics based models do not include in their structure jencso et al 2009 in addition the low values of ksat at the end of the calibration can be explained by the ksat methods which tend to overestimate the values of this parameter different methodologies can be used to measure ksat however they generate significantly different values v 1993 in a study conducted in arvorezinha catchment evaluating the water infiltration values with a mean of 95 mm h 1 were found using double ring infiltrometer dalbianco 2013 while for undisturbed samples collected with cylindrical rings 113 cm3 height 4 cm a mean of 289 mm h 1 was observed dalbianco 2009 the arvorezinha catchment is characterized by its environmental fragility due to the soil types which have an impeditive subsurface layer from 20 cm preventing the continuous flow of water added to the effect of the sloping relief as described in section 2 1 fig 11 de barros et al 2014 the tracer methodology used in this study environment allowed to identify the relative contribution of each flow componentthat form the streamflow during rainfall events the application of process based erosion models from appropriate runoff separation can give more reliable results it should be noted that in this work as in robinet et al 2018 developed in the arvorezinha catchment they were based on a small set of rainfall events despite the clarification obtained in the six monitored events high magnitude events were not included the behavior of these events is highly important due to the increase in frequency and intensity they occur resulting in greater environmental and socio economic damage almagro et al 2017 nearing et al 2005 4 2 implications for erosion models runoff separation by dsi was essential for obtaining the correct estimation of surface runoff volumes which were significantly smaller in relation to the previously estimated ones in this catchment de barros et al 2014 the appropriate runoff separation improved our understanding of the suspended sediment generation and mobilization dynamics the occurrence of dilution effect originated from the presence of different water sources in the streamflow during the rainfall event robinet et al 2018 affects the ssc and sy dynamics hydro sedimentometric monitoring quantifies the sediment concentration at the catchment outlet which is the result of sediment from soil detachment and carried by surface runoff mainly the subsurface and base flow which have considerably low concentrations of suspended sediments on average 20 mg l 1 dilutes the sediment carried by surface runoff erosion processes modeling by the openlisem 2 01 old version is based only on sediment originating from the hillslope disaggregation transported by surface flow consequently high concentrations of suspended sediments are generated by the model differently from what occurs in hydrossedimentological monitoring de barros et al 2014 in this study using version 5 97 it was possible to evaluate which equation of detachment efficiency by runoff would better represent the characteristics of arvorezinha catchment thus using the original equation from eurosem model we reached the statistically acceptable values for pbias without having to change the original values when the runoff was separated table 5 when the runoff was not separated coh values were reduced for three events because the ssc values were low due to the dilution effect other studies applying the openlisem model to soils with higher silt content obtained statistically satisfactory results hessel 2002 hessel and jetten 2007 using equation a fitted for silty soils jetten and van den bout 2017 when the surface runoff was not separated the hydrological dynamic that occurs in the arvorezinha catchment is neglected results improve when runoff separation is applied avoiding the need to change the input parameters related to erosive processes thus runoff separation is important for correct insertion of the surface runoff component as well as insertion of the sediment that has been transported by surface runoff with no dilution effect eq 3 even after runoff separation it remains difficult to calibrate the model for sedimentgraph shape this may be related to the effect of hysteresis observed but not simulated by the model even recent versions such as 5 97 in arvorezinha catchment the peaks of sedimentographs and hydrographs exceptionally occur simultaneously de barros et al 2020 5 conclusion the results of this study reveal an average contribution of 62 of subsurface and base flow to the streamflow during rainfall events in the arvorezinha catchment the contribution of these lower velocity flows has a direct impact on hydrological and sedimentological simulation the use of dissolved silicon to quantify the contribution of surface runoff allowed to improve the simulation of the processes by the model since subsurface runoff is not represented based on this the dynamics of the sediment is reflected at the catchment outlet which impact the modeling of this process by physics based and distributed models as the openlisem model however even considering the dilution effect observed by dsi and correcting the suspended sediment concentration the sedimentgraph shape was not well reproduced although the modeling results in this study were not completely satisfactory they enabled us to understand an important process that occurs at the study site which could be better understood using dsi as tracer of water flows although a great effort was made to characterize the processes other factors did not allow us to obtain good results by modeling the combination of high quality monitoring data and the correct quantification of the process is essential for the physical models to reproduce the process faithfully especially in a catchment that includes such complex processes credit authorship contribution statement cláudia alessandra peixoto de barros conceptualization methodology investigation

4598,sustainable urban drainage solutions suds are a diverse set of design options that mitigate floods and improve water quality grass swales are the sole component of suds that transports runoff over long distances to downstream recipients a deeper understanding of the performance of grass swales in different winter conditions is important in order for cities to achieve a greater climate resiliency the goal of this study was to assess the impacts of frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw cycles on the hydrologic performance of grass swales a total of 63 field synthetic runoff experiments were performed in a 5 8 m long section of a grass swale in the urriðaholt neighborhood gardabaer iceland over 18 months a three fold reduction in peak flow attenuation was observed in winter avg 13 compared to summer avg 38 for hydraulic loadings ranging between 19 and 131 cm h the reduction in the performance of the swale was primarily due to frost formation and secondarily due to snow the frequent rainfall snowmelt and rain on snow events elevated the soil water content and rendered the swale media susceptible to frost formation the formation of pore ice within the 5 cm soil horizon led to a considerable reduction in soil porosity which negatively affected the infiltration capacity and shortened runoff lag times snow affected the performance by concentrating the flow in narrow channels which reduced the effective area of infiltration but also led to longer lag times and stored a portion of the runoff water within its pack despite the deterioration in the swale s efficiency in winter infiltration was observed in all synthetic runoff experiments indicating that frost was either porous granular or heterogeneous in nature the swale served its purpose to moderately reduce runoff peaks and volumes especially for small and medium events this research highlights the importance of effectively draining infiltration based systems in cold climates to avoid the adverse effects of low temperatures keywords grass swales suds infiltration into frozen soils rain on snow flow reduction drainage capacity 1 introduction urban densification together with intensifying weather are exerting pressure on the conventional stormwater management systems and thus leading to more frequent and serious urban floods davis et al 2012 dietz and clausen 2008 khan et al 2012 sustainable urban drainage systems suds have been increasingly implemented as a low impact stormwater control measure scm to reduce runoff quantity and improve its quality suds involve a wide range of design options with the goal of disposing stormwater in local waterways and mimicking the natural hydrological cycle vegetated swales are the sole component of suds elements that is intended to convey runoff across a watershed while also performing the traditional functions of infiltrating and storing runoff recharging the water table and trapping and removing sediments and pollutants ahmed et al 2015 gavrić et al 2019 rujner et al 2018 hence swales are paramount in making urban areas more climate resilient the hydrological performance of swales during real and simulated runoff events has been extensively studied in temperate climates e g abu zreig et al 2004 davis et al 2012 deletic and fletcher 2006 garcía serrana et al 2017 liu et al 2016 rujner et al 2018 shafique et al 2018 a swale s hydrological and hydraulic performance is observed through reduced runoff volumes and delayed peak flows the infiltration capacity of swales and their ability to store water are largely dependent on soil physical properties type of soil soil hydraulic conductivity initial moisture content and the area of the vegetated surface a swale s infiltration capacity is also linked to the magnitude and intensity of runoff events davis et al 2012 bed slopes and surface roughness provided by vegetation also affect flow retardation and infiltration monrabal martinez et al 2018 rujner et al 2018 suds water treatment and flood mitigation performance are negatively affected by winter conditions roseen et al 2009 even in highly conductive soils such as sandy loam monrabal martinez et al 2018 paus et al 2015 frost can clog the pores and form ice lenses that impair infiltration in this regard frost type is more important than frost depth muthanna et al 2008 frost type is largely governed by the pre freezing soil water content as saturated soils are more prone to concrete frost formation that blocks infiltration unsaturated or dry soil conditions promote granular and porous frost both of which favor infiltration fach et al 2011 lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 orradottir et al 2008 a good drainage capacity is paramount to avoid high water content buildup which has been shown to enhance volume reduction and prevent frost formation lefevre et al 2009 monrabal martinez et al 2018 muthanna et al 2008 another factor known to promote urban flooding is the presence of snow winter runoff events become more voluminous with the addition of meltwater moghadas et al 2018 valeo and ho 2004 being snow accumulation or snow deposit areas suds are more prone to snowmelt compared to other vegetated urban areas bäckström and viklander 2000 valeo and ho 2004 this is particularly true for swales which are designed as channels or depressions and often located next to roads when subjected to repeated freeze thaw and rain on snow ros cycles icy layers form within the snowpack that prevent infiltration caraco and claytor 1997 and can contribute to instantaneous runoff generation during ros and snowmelt events garvelmann et al 2015 muthanna et al 2008 moreover the lack of a continuous insulating snow cover as common in inland regions renders coastal soils more susceptible to repeated meltwater infiltration and re freezing contributing to impermeable frost formation orradottir et al 2008 the repeated freezing and thawing processes can however alter soil aggregate stability and pore continuity resulting in the creation of preferential flow paths that may promote infiltration flerchinger 2013 paus et al 2015 little research exists on the performance of suds during frost snow and ros in cold maritime climates the most detailed studies on suds winter performance focused on bioretention cells which exhibited anything from complete capture of runoff volumes to impeded infiltration in the presence of surface frost e g paus et al 2015 blecken et al 2007 khan et al 2012 lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 the different responses were attributed to a combination of soil hydraulic conductivity and drainage capacity and the nature of runoff whether it involves ros or snowmelt muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2015 the effects of frost formation soil saturation and more importantly infiltration capacity were not investigated in depth in these studies in addition the number of snowmelt and ros events were too few to clearly distinguish them from pure rainfall events the studied bioretention cells included an underdrain and thick vegetation e g khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2015 which help keep the soil dry prevent frost formation and enhance infiltration this differs from the relatively uniform vegetation cover and dense roots system of grass swales many of which do not include an underdrain results from the bioretention cells may therefore not translate to grass swales particularly the bioretention cells good overall performance in cold climates might be attributed to the fact that they are designed to temporarily pond water woods ballard et al 2015 which ultimately infiltrates the soil through preferential flow paths and macropores despite the frozen filter media khan et al 2012 swales however are designed to convey water and have a much shorter residence time very limited documentation exists on the functioning of grass swales in cold climates especially during frozen conditions and in the presence of snow to the authors knowledge a systematic study of the hydrologic performance of suds during frost snow and more specifically ros has not been conducted ros and intermittent mid winter snowmelt events that have historically been associated with cold maritime climates are now becoming more common and severe in various regions around the globe due to climate change dong and menzel 2020 garvelmann et al 2015 frequent ros and freeze thaw cycles were found to be responsible for 83 of water related insurance claims in the capital of iceland arnardóttir 2020 it is therefore essential to better understand the complex interconnections between soil snow and frost in order to successfully integrate such systems in stormwater management strategies the goal of this study therefore was to assess the performance of grass swales under frost ros and snow conditions 63 synthetic runoff experiments were conducted in a swale segment in a residential neighborhood from march 2019 to august 2020 the tests were conducted during a range of snow frost and low temperatures to allow comparisons between these different conditions 2 methods 2 1 site description urridaholt is the first breeam building research establishment s environmental assessment method certified neighborhood in iceland sited on a hill in the gardabaer municipality in the greater capital area 64 4 18 46 n

infiltrates into roadside swales detention ponds and front lawns from the 10 ha catchment area is conveyed via underdrains and discharged as concentrated flows into a network of swales that lead towards the lake the main swale extends from the top of the hill towards the lake with mild sloping sections separated by check dams to attenuate the flow the swale was constructed in 2009 using local material without specific layering the vegetation cover is 1 to 3 cm tall grass during winter and 5 to 10 cm in summer the 45 cm swale media is comprised of mostly sand mixed with a small portion of gravel and fine sediments table 1 based on three samples from the top 30 cm horizon extracted in accordance with astm d7263 astm 2009 and analyzed in accordance with astm d6913 astm 2017 and usda soil

ranged between 10 and 22 a portable water delivery system consisting of a 1 m3 water tank filled with water from a nearby fire hydrant was designated to feed the swale with simulated runoff inflows water was pumped from the tank into a smaller upstream reservoir equipped with a 45 v notch weir flow rates were regulated by ensuring a constant water level in the delivery tank the overflow from the inflow weir box was distributed evenly over the bottom channel of the swale the overland flow that did not infiltrate runoff was collected using a plastic sheet inserted 20 cm beyond the turf and was directed into the outflow weir box at the end of the swale section the runoff simulations were performed using constant inflow rates of 0 2 l s very low 0 65 1 0 l s low 2 0 l s medium and 4 2 l s high flow for a duration of 20 30 min the experimental runs were timed to target a range of surface and soil conditions table 2 on each day two to three experiments were conducted consecutively with a 30 to 45 minute resting period in between to to allow for all water in the depressions to infiltrate and to limit the duration of the experiment a total of 63 runoff simulations were conducted in the period from march 2019 to august 2020 to capture data for winter the transitional period of thawing during spring and warm summers when swales are biologically active 2 3 data collection long term

study site pre post surface cover conditions in winter snow cover depth and density were measured in the field prior to the experimental runs by extracting three snow cores from the side of the swale

measured manually using a graduated cylinder as well as a stopwatch in case of a calibration error or a sensor malfunction the effective width and depth of surface flow was measured manually at 1 m intervals along the length of the swale segment in the presence of snow the area of snow being wetted was also measured manually at 1 m intervals 2 4 derived data 2 4 1 hydrological performance metrics for each synthetic experiment the volume of total flow the lag time between inflow and outflow and the peak flow reduction were determined from hydrographs as shown on fig 3 a the relative peak flow reduction or flow attenuation was defined as the difference between the steady state inflow and outflow 1 δ q pk r e l q in q out q in the water balance components in the swale and due to the limited duration of the experimental runs can be defined as vin vinf vout the inflow volume includes the melt volume from the snowpack vmelt the total inflow and outflow volumes can be determined by integrating the flow rates and the relative infiltrated volume or volume reduction can be defined as 2 δ v inf r e l v in v out v in the lag time between the inflow and outflow tlag is defined as the difference between the centroids of the two hydrographs as shown in fig 3a viessman and lewis 2002 the fourth and final hydrological performance metric is the ratio of the wetted area to the total swale area in absence of snow the wetted width increases with the increase in inflow rate in winter however snow cover can influence the effective area for infiltration as schematically explained in fig 3 at the beginning of an event fig 3a runoff water wets the snow until it reaches its maximum water holding capacity wetting phase this also marks the start of the process of wetting the soil fig 3b and c afterwards the runoff forms a flow path in the snowpack and the flow is concentrated within the resulting channel until it reaches the outflow end of the swale runoff phase at this time the soil reaches its maximum saturation and steady state conditions prevail fig 3b when the inflow to the swale ceases runoff continues for an average of 10 min at this stage the remaining runoff water exits the swale in the form of outflow and infiltrates the ground and the drainage phase starts drainage is a slower process as can be seen in fig 3b as saturation remains almost unchanged following the end of the experiment for a longer period before drainage commences the fraction of the wetted area or the areal efficiency ae was estimated as the ratio of average overland flow width wflow and total swale width wtotal taken as the width of the bottom channel of the swale 3 ae w flow w total 2 4 2 soil performance metrics the swale was divided volumetrically into 5 sections according to the depth at which each sensor was located with a volume of vi m3 and the total moisture content in the swale at time t vw t m3 was estimated as 4 v w t i 1 5 θ i t v i where θi is the measured water content by sensor i at time t the degree of saturation in the swale at time t ds t was then estimated as the ratio of the total moisture volume in the swale vw at time t and saturated moisture volume vsat as 5 d s t v w t v sat 100 the saturated moisture volume was determined as the sum of the available pore volume in each layer based on the measured porosity furthermore an event maximum surface porosity was estimated as the ratio of the measured maximum water content at the surface during the experiment and the measured porosity in the same layer i e 6 event max surface porosity m a x θ i 1 t porosity measured 100 the drainage capacity dc of the swale was estimated as the reduction in the degree of saturation 24 h after the last event on each experimental day δds24 drainage can take from one to two days depending on the swale s dc a 24 hour drainage period was chosen due to the frequent rain and snowmelt that could lead to the rewetting of the soil before reaching field capacity 2 5 data analyses winter was defined as the five month period when air temperature started to descend below 0 c november and lasted until the end of march spring was defined as the two months of april and may surface conditions during winter and spring were classified into four groups neutral n when neither snow nor frost was present frozen f if frost was detected with hardness test manually before the experimental run when surface or alternatively when soil temperature was below or close to zero and or when volumetric water content at 5 cm or deeper remained constant during the synthetic experiment snow s and snow on frost sof when snow was present at the surface warm conditions w indicated the three summer months june to august during which surface or soil temperature exceeded 10 c the differences between the means of the different surface conditions and seasons for each performance metric were analyzed using analysis of variance anova and multiple comparisons were performed using student s t test statistical analyses were performed using jmp v 14 0 0 the drivers for hydrological and soil performance metrics were quantified with a two step linear regression analysis in the first step the correlation of performance with each external driver i e inflow rate antecedent degree of saturation surface and soil temperature and snow depth was considered the drivers that had the highest correlation and level of significance were determined as primary drivers in the second step a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted first with the primary drivers single and multiple linear regression analyses were performed for the performance metrics using performance indicators such as inflow rate surface and soil temperature degree of saturation and snow depth by adding one indicator at a time to each model for each performance indicator the model with the best coefficient of determination was chosen parameters that did not enhance the model performance were eliminated from the analysis 3 results 3 1 continuous monitoring results the winter and spring 2019 2020 monitoring period was representative of average climatic conditions in reykjavík arnardóttir 2020 1 457 mm of precipitation fell during the six months starting in november 2 intermittent snow cover with 12 snow cycles lasting from 1 to 25 days fig 4 a 3 21 days of sub zero average air temperature the longest cycle lasting for 10 consecutive days fig 4b 4 15 soil freeze thaw cycles the longest period with sub zero soil temperature lasted for 15 consecutive days fig 4c the maximum daily snow depth from reykjavik station no 1 was 12 cm which was approximately half of the range measured in the study swale as the swale can accumulate more snow during this period the soil water content remained relatively constant at field capacity at each depth fig 4d soil infiltration was noted by the momentary increases in water content at all depths during rain ros and synthetic runoff experiments conversely frost formation was reflected by the reduction in the measured soil water content at 5 cm depth corresponding to the phase change from liquid to solid the presence of surface frost was identified when the soil moisture content at 5 cm depth did not reach full saturation during the synthetic experiments and or when soil temperature was below 0 c prior to the experiment the most prolonged period of surface frost lasted from february 9 until march 29 2020 fig 4c and d shaded area the runoff experiments dotted vertical lines fig 4c and d were timed to capture the range of the experimental conditions i e frost and snow 3 2 swale performance indicators the synthetic runoff experiments in the grass swale highlight hydrological impairment in winter especially during frost f and snow on frost sof with the exception of areal efficiency ae all performance metrics were statistically lower in presence of frost than when compared to warm ground conditions table 3 fig 5 peak flow reduction dropped by a factor of 2 1 and 3 5 and volume reduction by a factor of 1 9 and 2 5 during frost in relation to neutral and warm conditions respectively fig 5a and b similarly the outflow lag time tlag representative of swale residence time was 2 1 to 3 6 times lower during frost f this is consistent with the lower infiltration capacity and surface roughness of the grass cover the drainage capacity dc was lowest in the presence of frost sof and to a lesser extent f fig 5e although the average results for frost conditions were similar for the performance metrics tested first two columns table 3 a greater variance was observed during f than sof specifically it should be noted that the maximum drainage capacity during frost matched the maximum during the warm period which suggests that the type of frost or the extent to which the soil was frozen differed considerably a large variance was noted in the experimental runs during snow only conditions s suggesting that not only snow presence but also snow characteristics such as depth and density were influential factors but on average volume reduction was significantly higher in the presence of snow compared to frozen conditions table 3 fig 5b indicating that a portion of the runoff volume was stored in the snowpack and was not released as outflow the lag time was also longer which can be explained by the initial wetting phase being longer in the presence of the snow fig 5c the ae however was on average lower during snow than frost conditions fig 5d consistent with the visual observation of the concentration of surface runoff fig 3c the relative influence of surface versus soil conditions on the four hydrologic performance metrics was assessed by considering relationships with external experimental parameters a single linear regression relationship slr was performed to identify the key external drivers i e inflow rate antecedent moisture content temperature and snow depth followed by a multiple linear regression analysis mlr to assess the relative importance of the top three to four co acting drivers both single and multi regression analyses highlighted the hydraulic loading presented as inflow rate qin and surface temperature as the primary performance drivers for the event based performance metrics followed by initial snow depth table 4 because of the considerable intercorrelation between surface temperature and soil temperature only the parameter with higher correlation was incorporated in the multi regression models the mlr confirmed that higher hydraulic loading reduced the flow attenuation on the one hand while increasing ae on the other hand note signs in table 4 low surface and soil temperatures and high snow depth reduced the performance these three external drivers accounted for 68 and 57 of the natural variance of flow and volume reduction and 51 for ae tlag was largely governed by the inflow rate and snow depth which contributed to delayed outflows surface temperature was not significantly correlated with tlag in the slr but was significant in the overall mlr model the initial degree of saturation was not significant but did enhance the mlr model dc differed vastly from the other performance metrics by being neither affected by surface conditions nor hydraulic loading not shown table 4 instead the degree of saturation 24 h after the event was found to be mostly regulated by the maximum degree of saturation dsmax which was attained during the event as well as the 24 hour average soil temperature after the event these two soil related parameters accounted for 64 of the variance peak flow reduction was a measure of the steady state abstraction due to infiltration during the experiments using the constant flow rates in this study upon reaching steady state infiltration volume becomes independent of inflow rate hence the flow attenuation decreased with the increase in inflow rate this relationship was strongest in neutral winter conditions r2 0 65 p 0 01 fig 6 a in snow conditions the underlying soil was similar in nature to neutral conditions and consequently the relationship was just as strong fig 6b but as snow reduced ae the flow and volume attenuation were lower than in neutral conditions in the presence of frost f and sof the relationship was less strong and more variations in infiltration capacity were observed fig 6c and d left panel in frost only conditions the relationship between inflow rate and ae was stronger than when snow was present on top of frost as expected fig 6c and d right panel in warm conditions however the relationship between inflow rate and flow attenuation broke down fig 6e this suggests that another factor was influencing peak flow reduction i e the initial degree of soil saturation which as previously mentioned did not significantly influence the hydrologic performance metrics over the entire season p 0 05 table 4 nevertheless the antecedent degree of saturation was found to be a major driver explaining the variability in flow attenuation in summer albeit not statistically significant at the 5 level fig 7 in winter the degree of saturation did not exert a significant influence on peak flow reduction 3 3 hydrologic response of the swale no significant correlation was found between hydrological performance of the swale and either snow depth or the initial degree of saturation over the entire study period table 4 however a closer look at specific runoff experiments provides valuable insights into the processes that were not fully explained by statistical significance tests to better understand the relationship between the hydrological response and the initial degree of saturation the hydrographs of two consecutive experiments in summer 2019 were considered fig 8 a and b preceded by an abnormally long dry period of 2 weeks the initial degree of saturation was at an absolute seasonal low 50 prior to the former medium flow experiment the corresponding peak flow and volume reductions were the highest recorded throughout the study period for a medium flow 61 and 75 respectively the initial degree of saturation was much higher in the consecutive experiment 70 a higher outflow rate was observed in the second experiment despite the much lower inflow rate used consequently flow and volume reductions were reduced by a factor of 2 due to the increase in the initial water content fig 8b regression analyses indicated a negative relationship between snow depth and the swale performance metrics table 4 though not statistically significant this confirmed that runoff events became more voluminous with the addition of meltwater but this result is not generalizable as noted from the hydrographs during two runoff experiments with 30 cm thick snow cover fig 8c and d when the soil was frozen and a high inflow rate was used the water was initially stored in the snow to be suddenly released afterwards in a dam burst like manner producing an outflow peak that exceeded the inflow rate however volume reduction was 23 due to the storage of runoff water in the snowpack in contrast when the soil was not frozen and a low inflow rate was used the delay in outflow was 24 min which is the longest tlag observed during the study period the runoff peak did not surpass the inflow rate and the volume reduction was as high as 83 this indicated that the presence of thick snow cover can either accentuate or severely attenuate runoff peaks while providing considerable volume reduction 3 4 soil response during winter runoff events long term measurements of soil and hydrological inputs provide valuable insights into the influential factors that contributed to frost formation the first surface frost occurred after a rainfall event on november 22 fig 4b double dashed line that was followed by a freezing cycle min 8 3 c the second soil frost period occurred in december due to a long period of surface cooling the soil thawed in january during which time the water content at 5 cm repeatedly peaked at 54 corresponding to 99 degree of saturation two synthetic experiments on january 29 and 31 accompanied with subfreezing air temperature min 6 4 c led to frost formation at the 5 cm soil horizon during this period the soil temperature dropped to a minimum of 1 3 c frost was interrupted once again on february 7 as a result of a ros event accompanied by an increase in air temperature max 8 1 c following that a sharp reduction in temperature was recorded min 10 c and with the absence of an insulating snow cover surface water content dropped dramatically to 7 these frost conditions were maintained for almost one and a half months which was reflected in both an uncharacteristically low water content and limited response at 5 cm soil depth during the subsequent runoff events the successive wetting of the soil during this period resulting from the multiple snowmelt events as well as the synthetic runoff experiments led to the extended period of frozen soil which lasted until the end of winter a closer look at the changes in soil saturation and temperature during specific events gives insights into the variations in frost type and infiltration capacity when the soil was partially frozen fig 9 a left panel the water content in the deeper layers responded almost immediately to hydrological inputs while the top layer responded gradually peaking at 14 saturation at the end of the experiment hence pore ice was present in the top 5 cm throughout the experiment while at the same time allowing water to seep to the non frozen ground below moreover infiltrating water melted some of the frost in the topsoil during the experiment this suggests that preferential flow paths and or air filled pores were present within the top frozen layer during the most severe frost event february 17 fig 9a center the deeper layers of the soil also responded to the runoff at the surface however the response was slightly delayed indicative of more resistance to the flow which might have resulted from frost penetration within the 5 15 cm soil horizon and thereafter thawing with the infiltrating water fig 9a and b center it should be noted that the topsoil was frozen throughout the inflow period i e soil saturation remained at 6 in spite of this downward water movement was still observed in the swale media by the end of april fig 9a right the soil returned to neutral conditions as attested by the increase in saturation in the entire soil profile during the experiment on april 30 lastly the seasonal variations in soil porosity of the top layer throughout the study period showed two interrupted periods of low porosity the first of these was during experiments in november and december and the second during experiments in february and march fig 9c afterwards the topsoil s porosity increased from 87 on april 8 to 98 on april 30 when the soil thawed completely this suggested that the swale did not undergo a consistent reduction in infiltration capacity during winter but was subjected to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing as a result of the frequent rainfall events accompanied with an increase in air temperatures 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal swale performance in cold maritime climate the focus of this research was on the winter performance of grass swales which are usually designed to infiltrate and treat small rainfall events and attenuate peak flow from large events woods ballard et al 2015 the 5 8 m long test section of the swale infiltrated on average 46 of the low flow rates 0 65 1 l s during the study period which covered winter spring and summer these low hydraulic loadings constituted almost half of the measured flows naturally entering the suds system the infiltration was on average 7 and 32 for the higher flowrates during winter and summer respectively during extreme frozen conditions a significant reduction in infiltration capacity was observed nevertheless there were no indications that the swale capacity was exceeded overflowing of the side slopes was never observed in the swale and the average flow depth was below 10 cm the winter hydrological performance decline observed in this study was consistent with previous research connecting reduced winter performance with vegetation dormancy and lower temperatures roseen et al 2009 but more importantly this study showed that the winter performance in a cold maritime climate fluctuated on a synoptic basis because of intermittent frost formation at the surface and to a lesser extent frequent snow cycles the results of this study are best compared with suds studies in cold coastal regions experiencing frequent freeze thaw and ros events namely in the prairie environments in canada and in norway khan et al 2012 observed an average peak flow reduction in bioretention cells of 92 for winter events with hydraulic loading of 25 cm h this was attributed to the water eventually infiltrating via preferential flow paths and reaching the underdrain without utilizing the entire media despite the presence of frost at a depth of 15 cm similarly paus et al 2015 found that the total volume reduction achieved by three bioretention cells ranged between 55 and 100 in contrast the average flow attenuation in the swale in this study was only 13 for hydraulic loadings ranging between 19 and 131 cm h this comparison supports the findings of roseen et al 2009 that swales suffer the most noticeable performance decline in winter of suds elements this can be attributed to the shorter retention time in a conveyance based system such as swales compared to retention based systems such as bioretention cells 4 2 the interactions between runoff snow and soil frost muthanna et al 2008 hypothesized that ros played a role in frost formation based on the observation that the infiltrated stormwater refroze following both ros and rainfall events roseen et al 2009 also noted that frost resulting from freeze thaw cycles was common and that soil freezing usually occurred before and after rain and snowmelt events however neither study quantified the effects of the frequent freeze thaw cycles the interactions between snow and frost or their impact on subsequent events in this study however synthetic runoff events were conducted in the presence of snow with the intention to simulate ros events closely spaced water content and temperature measurements at different soil depths allowed for a continuous assessment of soil infiltration and frost formation in grass swales over an entire winter the results clearly demonstrate that intermittent midwinter rain and ros events led to high water contents and promoted frost formation specifically during winter 19 20 three events natural and synthetic initiated separate freezing cycles which reduced soil porosity fig 4c and d the temporal wetting of the soil which in some cases was combined with the removal of the snow cover rendered the soil more susceptible to temperature fluctuations as evidenced in the sharp reduction in soil temperature following these events fig 4c this is a common complication with the implementation of suds in coastal cold regions that experience repeated ros and freeze thaw cycles khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 4 3 key mechanisms affecting winter infiltration the primary mechanism for hydrological performance deterioration was soil frost soil permeability in the presence of frost varied across experiments due to the heterogeneous nature of soils and frost formation as well as the presence of cracks and preferential flow paths resulting from the frequent freeze thaw cycles spatial variability was observed in six single ring infiltration measurements conducted in an adjacent swale zaqout unpublished data on any given day infiltration was impeded in certain locations while it was not affected in other locations the formation of porous or granular frost with loose ice crystals may permit or even enhance infiltration flerchinger 2013 a common factor that influences infiltration is frost depth fach et al 2011 in this study frost was only detected in the topmost layer at 5 cm soil depth fig 4c and d it is not clear how far the frost penetrated between 5 and 15 cm depth soil temperature at 5 cm intervals within the first 20 cm of the profile would have helped clearing this ambiguity on maximum frost depth however an excellent indication of soil infiltration and frost formation throughout the soil matrix was provided by water content probes spaced 10 cm apart see fig 9 and discussion thereof the secondary mechanism that negatively affected winter performance was snow cover snow reduced the swale s surface area by concentrating surface runoff which would have otherwise been more evenly distributed in snow free conditions moreover the added snowmelt led to more voluminous runoff events and reduced water temperature which negatively affects infiltration nevertheless for the least intense runoff experiments low flow snow was also found to enhance the hydrological performance by storing significant amounts of runoff water and by delaying flow peaks this storage function was dependent however on snow properties and the underlying soil conditions water stored in the snowpack was released instantaneously in a dam burst like release of water when thick snow was coupled with the presence of soil frost or dense snow layers such a burst was only observed once in this study making further investigations necessary to verify the results lastly the storage function of the snow becomes less important in longer duration events as all of the snow will melt eventually and add to runoff most of the extreme winter flooding events recorded in reykjavík involved 6 h of rainfall arnardóttir 2020 4 4 the importance of soil drainage in design previous studies have found that initial degree of saturation negatively influences the hydrological performance of suds rujner et al 2018 this relationship was only detected during summer in this study after dry periods lasting for weeks at a time fig 7 degree of saturation is highly linked with dc poorly drained soils tend to maintain a high degree of saturation which in turn reduces their capacity to mitigate subsequent events a dc in the range of only 20 to 26 as in this study might have exacerbated the impacts of winter conditions and promoted frost formation additionally the high water content in the swale also affected the performance during non frozen conditions by reducing the available volume for infiltration at the onset of runoff events this was consistent with the previous findings from studies on infiltration based systems e g lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 and emphasizes the importance of proper soil drainage especially for winter operations we argue that dc is particularly important in a cold maritime climate which frequently experiences precipitation in liquid form as opposed to solely dry snow the combination of liquid inputs and poor dc makes the soils more susceptible to freezing even though air temperatures fluctuate only moderately around zero the minimum daily temperature recorded in reykjavík is 12 c frost events particularly occurred 1 2 days following rainfall simulated runoff and ros events which might not have been a long enough period to properly drain the swale media prior to the onset of freezing air temperatures this was observed in the sharp drops in moisture content and soil temperature at 5 cm depth after the november 22 january 29 and 31 february 11 and 25 march 6 and 11 events fig 4c and d frost formation was confirmed in the runoff experiments following those events and it was reflected in the deterioration in performance indicators to maintain a good soil drainage and reduce the risk of frost formation care must be taken in the design and operation of swales fine textured soils such as clay and silt should be avoided in the filter media due to their low infiltration capacity and high water holding potential dust accumulation might occur when swales are located next to roads or parking lots with heavy traffic especially in cold climates where studded tires that increase road erosion are used extensively barr 2020 filter strips are often used to capture road dust and sediments before entering the swale in this study the swale was adhering to best practices but the swale filtering media laid on hard compacted clay this might explain the low drainage capacity observed throughout the study period 5 conclusions maritime winter climate is both wet and mild with air temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point and precipitation falling as rainfall rain on snow and snow this research assesses the impacts of co acting winter conditions on the hydrological performance of grass swales to that goal 63 synthetic runoff experiments were performed in a grass swale over 18 months the swale hydrological performance was evaluated based on five metrics the relative peak flow reduction the relative infiltrated volume runoff lag time soil drainage capacity and areal efficiency results indicated a significant impairment in the hydrologic performance during winter peak flow attenuation was 13 in winter as compared to 20 40 in spring and summer similarly the relative infiltrated volume was 22 in winter vs 30 60 during the warm season poor flow attenuation was primarily associated with the reduction in soil porosity in the top 5 cm horizon because of the formation of ice lenses however macropores created by vegetation roots biological activity and the frequent freeze thaw cycles allowed for infiltration to the deeper layers of the soil thus no concrete frost fully blocking infiltration was observed during the study period runoff lag times where three times shorter in winter compared to summer reflecting a reduction in surface roughness while the surface frost significantly reduced the overall performance of the swale it did not compromise the swale overall function of attenuating small and medium events snow cover provided both initial storage and resistance to overland flow resulting in longer lag times and high volume reduction during short duration low hydraulic loading events but as an event progressed overland flow formed in a concentrated path within the snowpack effectively reducing the area of infiltration the snow melted and added to the runoff volume in the most severe case the runoff initially stored in a thick snow was released instantaneously similar to a dam burst to the effect that the outflow exceeded inflow the swale hence the combination of sudden snowmelt and low infiltration capacity can generate more intense rain on snow induced runoff events however this condition was observed only once in this study this study provided to the authors best knowledge the first systematic assessment of the relative importance of hydraulic loading surface and soil conditions on the seasonal performance of grassed swales in a cold climate single and multivariate regression analyses highlight that winter peak flow and volume reduction were primarily affected by surface temperature followed by hydraulic loading and to a lesser extent snow depth the moisture content of the underlying soil did not significantly affect the infiltration in winter but played a large role in explaining the variance in summer performance the highest infiltration capacity observed in this study was when the soil was half saturated which occurred in summer following a two week dry period runoff lag times and areal efficiency were primarily affected by inflow rate and secondarily by surface conditions such as snow depth soil drainage capacity was however governed by the 24 hour average swale media temperature following the event and the maximum soil saturation reached during the event in a maritime climate with air temperature oscillating in the order of 15 times around the freezing point during winter precipitation falls often in liquid form frequent rain and rain on snow infiltrates the ground which keeps the soil moist in the absence of an insulating snow cover the soil is more susceptible to freezing frost was observed to form within 1 2 days after runoff events which negatively affected the swale s ability to infiltrate subsequent events this combined with a soil drainage capacity of only 20 26 in 24 h as found in this study kept the soil highly saturated during winter and more susceptible to freezing with rising winter temperatures regions that historically underwent a seasonal frost and snow period may now experience more frequent and intense mid winter rain on snow followed by frost this study confirms that suds may serve as a low impact low cost solution to reduce urban flooding in such cyclic climatic winter conditions a special attention is however required in the design and operation of suds in relation to rain on snow and frost cycles proper soil drainage is instrumental in order to maintain the soil relatively dry and less susceptible to the frequent freezing limiting the presence of fine sediments that decrease infiltration is required both in the filter media during the construction phase and from surface loading during the operation lifetime of swales the reduction in infiltration capacity during winter must also be taken into account when sizing suds therefore incorporating site specific considerations is recommended for the designing of infiltration

4598,sustainable urban drainage solutions suds are a diverse set of design options that mitigate floods and improve water quality grass swales are the sole component of suds that transports runoff over long distances to downstream recipients a deeper understanding of the performance of grass swales in different winter conditions is important in order for cities to achieve a greater climate resiliency the goal of this study was to assess the impacts of frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw cycles on the hydrologic performance of grass swales a total of 63 field synthetic runoff experiments were performed in a 5 8 m long section of a grass swale in the urriðaholt neighborhood gardabaer iceland over 18 months a three fold reduction in peak flow attenuation was observed in winter avg 13 compared to summer avg 38 for hydraulic loadings ranging between 19 and 131 cm h the reduction in the performance of the swale was primarily due to frost formation and secondarily due to snow the frequent rainfall snowmelt and rain on snow events elevated the soil water content and rendered the swale media susceptible to frost formation the formation of pore ice within the 5 cm soil horizon led to a considerable reduction in soil porosity which negatively affected the infiltration capacity and shortened runoff lag times snow affected the performance by concentrating the flow in narrow channels which reduced the effective area of infiltration but also led to longer lag times and stored a portion of the runoff water within its pack despite the deterioration in the swale s efficiency in winter infiltration was observed in all synthetic runoff experiments indicating that frost was either porous granular or heterogeneous in nature the swale served its purpose to moderately reduce runoff peaks and volumes especially for small and medium events this research highlights the importance of effectively draining infiltration based systems in cold climates to avoid the adverse effects of low temperatures keywords grass swales suds infiltration into frozen soils rain on snow flow reduction drainage capacity 1 introduction urban densification together with intensifying weather are exerting pressure on the conventional stormwater management systems and thus leading to more frequent and serious urban floods davis et al 2012 dietz and clausen 2008 khan et al 2012 sustainable urban drainage systems suds have been increasingly implemented as a low impact stormwater control measure scm to reduce runoff quantity and improve its quality suds involve a wide range of design options with the goal of disposing stormwater in local waterways and mimicking the natural hydrological cycle vegetated swales are the sole component of suds elements that is intended to convey runoff across a watershed while also performing the traditional functions of infiltrating and storing runoff recharging the water table and trapping and removing sediments and pollutants ahmed et al 2015 gavrić et al 2019 rujner et al 2018 hence swales are paramount in making urban areas more climate resilient the hydrological performance of swales during real and simulated runoff events has been extensively studied in temperate climates e g abu zreig et al 2004 davis et al 2012 deletic and fletcher 2006 garcía serrana et al 2017 liu et al 2016 rujner et al 2018 shafique et al 2018 a swale s hydrological and hydraulic performance is observed through reduced runoff volumes and delayed peak flows the infiltration capacity of swales and their ability to store water are largely dependent on soil physical properties type of soil soil hydraulic conductivity initial moisture content and the area of the vegetated surface a swale s infiltration capacity is also linked to the magnitude and intensity of runoff events davis et al 2012 bed slopes and surface roughness provided by vegetation also affect flow retardation and infiltration monrabal martinez et al 2018 rujner et al 2018 suds water treatment and flood mitigation performance are negatively affected by winter conditions roseen et al 2009 even in highly conductive soils such as sandy loam monrabal martinez et al 2018 paus et al 2015 frost can clog the pores and form ice lenses that impair infiltration in this regard frost type is more important than frost depth muthanna et al 2008 frost type is largely governed by the pre freezing soil water content as saturated soils are more prone to concrete frost formation that blocks infiltration unsaturated or dry soil conditions promote granular and porous frost both of which favor infiltration fach et al 2011 lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 orradottir et al 2008 a good drainage capacity is paramount to avoid high water content buildup which has been shown to enhance volume reduction and prevent frost formation lefevre et al 2009 monrabal martinez et al 2018 muthanna et al 2008 another factor known to promote urban flooding is the presence of snow winter runoff events become more voluminous with the addition of meltwater moghadas et al 2018 valeo and ho 2004 being snow accumulation or snow deposit areas suds are more prone to snowmelt compared to other vegetated urban areas bäckström and viklander 2000 valeo and ho 2004 this is particularly true for swales which are designed as channels or depressions and often located next to roads when subjected to repeated freeze thaw and rain on snow ros cycles icy layers form within the snowpack that prevent infiltration caraco and claytor 1997 and can contribute to instantaneous runoff generation during ros and snowmelt events garvelmann et al 2015 muthanna et al 2008 moreover the lack of a continuous insulating snow cover as common in inland regions renders coastal soils more susceptible to repeated meltwater infiltration and re freezing contributing to impermeable frost formation orradottir et al 2008 the repeated freezing and thawing processes can however alter soil aggregate stability and pore continuity resulting in the creation of preferential flow paths that may promote infiltration flerchinger 2013 paus et al 2015 little research exists on the performance of suds during frost snow and ros in cold maritime climates the most detailed studies on suds winter performance focused on bioretention cells which exhibited anything from complete capture of runoff volumes to impeded infiltration in the presence of surface frost e g paus et al 2015 blecken et al 2007 khan et al 2012 lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 the different responses were attributed to a combination of soil hydraulic conductivity and drainage capacity and the nature of runoff whether it involves ros or snowmelt muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2015 the effects of frost formation soil saturation and more importantly infiltration capacity were not investigated in depth in these studies in addition the number of snowmelt and ros events were too few to clearly distinguish them from pure rainfall events the studied bioretention cells included an underdrain and thick vegetation e g khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2015 which help keep the soil dry prevent frost formation and enhance infiltration this differs from the relatively uniform vegetation cover and dense roots system of grass swales many of which do not include an underdrain results from the bioretention cells may therefore not translate to grass swales particularly the bioretention cells good overall performance in cold climates might be attributed to the fact that they are designed to temporarily pond water woods ballard et al 2015 which ultimately infiltrates the soil through preferential flow paths and macropores despite the frozen filter media khan et al 2012 swales however are designed to convey water and have a much shorter residence time very limited documentation exists on the functioning of grass swales in cold climates especially during frozen conditions and in the presence of snow to the authors knowledge a systematic study of the hydrologic performance of suds during frost snow and more specifically ros has not been conducted ros and intermittent mid winter snowmelt events that have historically been associated with cold maritime climates are now becoming more common and severe in various regions around the globe due to climate change dong and menzel 2020 garvelmann et al 2015 frequent ros and freeze thaw cycles were found to be responsible for 83 of water related insurance claims in the capital of iceland arnardóttir 2020 it is therefore essential to better understand the complex interconnections between soil snow and frost in order to successfully integrate such systems in stormwater management strategies the goal of this study therefore was to assess the performance of grass swales under frost ros and snow conditions 63 synthetic runoff experiments were conducted in a swale segment in a residential neighborhood from march 2019 to august 2020 the tests were conducted during a range of snow frost and low temperatures to allow comparisons between these different conditions 2 methods 2 1 site description urridaholt is the first breeam building research establishment s environmental assessment method certified neighborhood in iceland sited on a hill in the gardabaer municipality in the greater capital area 64 4 18 46 n 21 54 37 11 w the drainage network was designed to protect the water level and quality in the shallow 13 ha urridavatn lake at the bottom of the catchment fig 1 for that purpose excess runoff that infiltrates into roadside swales detention ponds and front lawns from the 10 ha catchment area is conveyed via underdrains and discharged as concentrated flows into a network of swales that lead towards the lake the main swale extends from the top of the hill towards the lake with mild sloping sections separated by check dams to attenuate the flow the swale was constructed in 2009 using local material without specific layering the vegetation cover is 1 to 3 cm tall grass during winter and 5 to 10 cm in summer the 45 cm swale media is comprised of mostly sand mixed with a small portion of gravel and fine sediments table 1 based on three samples from the top 30 cm horizon extracted in accordance with astm d7263 astm 2009 and analyzed in accordance with astm d6913 astm 2017 and usda soil textural classification usda 1987 three replicas were tested in the laboratory to determine the soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat using a constant head permeability test in accordance with astm d2434 astm 2019 intact soil samples were also collected soil porosity and bulk density were then determined the bed below the 45 cm soil horizon consists of hard compacted clay lying on top of rock 2 2 experimental design synthetic runoff experiments were conducted in a 5 8 m long trapezoidal swale section with an average bed width of 2 m fig 2 and longitudinal slope of 3 3 the side slopes ranged between 10 and 22 a portable water delivery system consisting of a 1 m3 water tank filled with water from a nearby fire hydrant was designated to feed the swale with simulated runoff inflows water was pumped from the tank into a smaller upstream reservoir equipped with a 45 v notch weir flow rates were regulated by ensuring a constant water level in the delivery tank the overflow from the inflow weir box was distributed evenly over the bottom channel of the swale the overland flow that did not infiltrate runoff was collected using a plastic sheet inserted 20 cm beyond the turf and was directed into the outflow weir box at the end of the swale section the runoff simulations were performed using constant inflow rates of 0 2 l s very low 0 65 1 0 l s low 2 0 l s medium and 4 2 l s high flow for a duration of 20 30 min the experimental runs were timed to target a range of surface and soil conditions table 2 on each day two to three experiments were conducted consecutively with a 30 to 45 minute resting period in between to to allow for all water in the depressions to infiltrate and to limit the duration of the experiment a total of 63 runoff simulations were conducted in the period from march 2019 to august 2020 to capture data for winter the transitional period of thawing during spring and warm summers when swales are biologically active 2 3 data collection long term monitoring the swale was equipped with five water content reflectometers that continuously measured volumetric water content and temperature type cs650 campbell scientific inc accuracy 1 caldwell et al 2018 the water content reflectometers were installed at the middle of the lower swale section at depths of 5 15 25 35 and 45 cm placed horizontally from top to bottom the top is located just below the 5 cm thick turf layer fig 2 right readings were logged using a data logger campbell scientific inc every 1 min a soil specific calibration was conducted in the laboratory and a linear user defined calibration equation was derived r2 0 99 ten minute weather air temperature and rainfall data were collected from a weather station erected in february 2019 and operated by the icelandic meteorological office imo on behalf of the gardabaer municipality imo 2020a the station is located approx 70 m downstream from the study swale fig 1 daily snow depth was obtained from the reykjavik no 1 weather station 64 07 648 21 54 166 imo 2020b the station is situated on a hilltop vegetated with grass 52 m a s l at a central location in the city at a distance of approximately 6 km from the study site pre post surface cover conditions in winter snow cover depth and density were measured in the field prior to the experimental runs by extracting three snow cores from the side of the swale or the unused swale section the average and standard deviation of the three measurements were determined the overall accuracy of the snow depth measurements was determined to be 3 16 and for the snow density 1 13 snow height was re estimated at the end of the consecutive experiments if the snow cover was not fully melted during the experiments the presence of frost was investigated based on surface hardness by inserting a blade into the soil and by visually noting the presence of ice crystals in the uppermost 5 cm orradottir et al 2008 surface and water temperature were measured using a handheld thermometer prior to the experimental run hydrological monitoring during experiments the inflow and outflow tanks were instrumented with pressure transducers type solinst 3001 levelogger accuracy 0 05 of full range water level measured at 10 s intervals was then converted into flow rates using the kindsvater shen equation for v notch weirs shen 1981 for the accuracy of the pressure transducer sensors 3 mm and the ranges of water level measurements the overall accuracy of the flow measurements was estimated to be 1 6 for quality purposes inflow and outflow rates were also measured manually using a graduated cylinder as well as a stopwatch in case of a calibration error or a sensor malfunction the effective width and depth of surface flow was measured manually at 1 m intervals along the length of the swale segment in the presence of snow the area of snow being wetted was also measured manually at 1 m intervals 2 4 derived data 2 4 1 hydrological performance metrics for each synthetic experiment the volume of total flow the lag time between inflow and outflow and the peak flow reduction were determined from hydrographs as shown on fig 3 a the relative peak flow reduction or flow attenuation was defined as the difference between the steady state inflow and outflow 1 δ q pk r e l q in q out q in the water balance components in the swale and due to the limited duration of the experimental runs can be defined as vin vinf vout the inflow volume includes the melt volume from the snowpack vmelt the total inflow and outflow volumes can be determined by integrating the flow rates and the relative infiltrated volume or volume reduction can be defined as 2 δ v inf r e l v in v out v in the lag time between the inflow and outflow tlag is defined as the difference between the centroids of the two hydrographs as shown in fig 3a viessman and lewis 2002 the fourth and final hydrological performance metric is the ratio of the wetted area to the total swale area in absence of snow the wetted width increases with the increase in inflow rate in winter however snow cover can influence the effective area for infiltration as schematically explained in fig 3 at the beginning of an event fig 3a runoff water wets the snow until it reaches its maximum water holding capacity wetting phase this also marks the start of the process of wetting the soil fig 3b and c afterwards the runoff forms a flow path in the snowpack and the flow is concentrated within the resulting channel until it reaches the outflow end of the swale runoff phase at this time the soil reaches its maximum saturation and steady state conditions prevail fig 3b when the inflow to the swale ceases runoff continues for an average of 10 min at this stage the remaining runoff water exits the swale in the form of outflow and infiltrates the ground and the drainage phase starts drainage is a slower process as can be seen in fig 3b as saturation remains almost unchanged following the end of the experiment for a longer period before drainage commences the fraction of the wetted area or the areal efficiency ae was estimated as the ratio of average overland flow width wflow and total swale width wtotal taken as the width of the bottom channel of the swale 3 ae w flow w total 2 4 2 soil performance metrics the swale was divided volumetrically into 5 sections according to the depth at which each sensor was located with a volume of vi m3 and the total moisture content in the swale at time t vw t m3 was estimated as 4 v w t i 1 5 θ i t v i where θi is the measured water content by sensor i at time t the degree of saturation in the swale at time t ds t was then estimated as the ratio of the total moisture volume in the swale vw at time t and saturated moisture volume vsat as 5 d s t v w t v sat 100 the saturated moisture volume was determined as the sum of the available pore volume in each layer based on the measured porosity furthermore an event maximum surface porosity was estimated as the ratio of the measured maximum water content at the surface during the experiment and the measured porosity in the same layer i e 6 event max surface porosity m a x θ i 1 t porosity measured 100 the drainage capacity dc of the swale was estimated as the reduction in the degree of saturation 24 h after the last event on each experimental day δds24 drainage can take from one to two days depending on the swale s dc a 24 hour drainage period was chosen due to the frequent rain and snowmelt that could lead to the rewetting of the soil before reaching field capacity 2 5 data analyses winter was defined as the five month period when air temperature started to descend below 0 c november and lasted until the end of march spring was defined as the two months of april and may surface conditions during winter and spring were classified into four groups neutral n when neither snow nor frost was present frozen f if frost was detected with hardness test manually before the experimental run when surface or alternatively when soil temperature was below or close to zero and or when volumetric water content at 5 cm or deeper remained constant during the synthetic experiment snow s and snow on frost sof when snow was present at the surface warm conditions w indicated the three summer months june to august during which surface or soil temperature exceeded 10 c the differences between the means of the different surface conditions and seasons for each performance metric were analyzed using analysis of variance anova and multiple comparisons were performed using student s t test statistical analyses were performed using jmp v 14 0 0 the drivers for hydrological and soil performance metrics were quantified with a two step linear regression analysis in the first step the correlation of performance with each external driver i e inflow rate antecedent degree of saturation surface and soil temperature and snow depth was considered the drivers that had the highest correlation and level of significance were determined as primary drivers in the second step a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted first with the primary drivers single and multiple linear regression analyses were performed for the performance metrics using performance indicators such as inflow rate surface and soil temperature degree of saturation and snow depth by adding one indicator at a time to each model for each performance indicator the model with the best coefficient of determination was chosen parameters that did not enhance the model performance were eliminated from the analysis 3 results 3 1 continuous monitoring results the winter and spring 2019 2020 monitoring period was representative of average climatic conditions in reykjavík arnardóttir 2020 1 457 mm of precipitation fell during the six months starting in november 2 intermittent snow cover with 12 snow cycles lasting from 1 to 25 days fig 4 a 3 21 days of sub zero average air temperature the longest cycle lasting for 10 consecutive days fig 4b 4 15 soil freeze thaw cycles the longest period with sub zero soil temperature lasted for 15 consecutive days fig 4c the maximum daily snow depth from reykjavik station no 1 was 12 cm which was approximately half of the range measured in the study swale as the swale can accumulate more snow during this period the soil water content remained relatively constant at field capacity at each depth fig 4d soil infiltration was noted by the momentary increases in water content at all depths during rain ros and synthetic runoff experiments conversely frost formation was reflected by the reduction in the measured soil water content at 5 cm depth corresponding to the phase change from liquid to solid the presence of surface frost was identified when the soil moisture content at 5 cm depth did not reach full saturation during the synthetic experiments and or when soil temperature was below 0 c prior to the experiment the most prolonged period of surface frost lasted from february 9 until march 29 2020 fig 4c and d shaded area the runoff experiments dotted vertical lines fig 4c and d were timed to capture the range of the experimental conditions i e frost and snow 3 2 swale performance indicators the synthetic runoff experiments in the grass swale highlight hydrological impairment in winter especially during frost f and snow on frost sof with the exception of areal efficiency ae all performance metrics were statistically lower in presence of frost than when compared to warm ground conditions table 3 fig 5 peak flow reduction dropped by a factor of 2 1 and 3 5 and volume reduction by a factor of 1 9 and 2 5 during frost in relation to neutral and warm conditions respectively fig 5a and b similarly the outflow lag time tlag representative of swale residence time was 2 1 to 3 6 times lower during frost f this is consistent with the lower infiltration capacity and surface roughness of the grass cover the drainage capacity dc was lowest in the presence of frost sof and to a lesser extent f fig 5e although the average results for frost conditions were similar for the performance metrics tested first two columns table 3 a greater variance was observed during f than sof specifically it should be noted that the maximum drainage capacity during frost matched the maximum during the warm period which suggests that the type of frost or the extent to which the soil was frozen differed considerably a large variance was noted in the experimental runs during snow only conditions s suggesting that not only snow presence but also snow characteristics such as depth and density were influential factors but on average volume reduction was significantly higher in the presence of snow compared to frozen conditions table 3 fig 5b indicating that a portion of the runoff volume was stored in the snowpack and was not released as outflow the lag time was also longer which can be explained by the initial wetting phase being longer in the presence of the snow fig 5c the ae however was on average lower during snow than frost conditions fig 5d consistent with the visual observation of the concentration of surface runoff fig 3c the relative influence of surface versus soil conditions on the four hydrologic performance metrics was assessed by considering relationships with external experimental parameters a single linear regression relationship slr was performed to identify the key external drivers i e inflow rate antecedent moisture content temperature and snow depth followed by a multiple linear regression analysis mlr to assess the relative importance of the top three to four co acting drivers both single and multi regression analyses highlighted the hydraulic loading presented as inflow rate qin and surface temperature as the primary performance drivers for the event based performance metrics followed by initial snow depth table 4 because of the considerable intercorrelation between surface temperature and soil temperature only the parameter with higher correlation was incorporated in the multi regression models the mlr confirmed that higher hydraulic loading reduced the flow attenuation on the one hand while increasing ae on the other hand note signs in table 4 low surface and soil temperatures and high snow depth reduced the performance these three external drivers accounted for 68 and 57 of the natural variance of flow and volume reduction and 51 for ae tlag was largely governed by the inflow rate and snow depth which contributed to delayed outflows surface temperature was not significantly correlated with tlag in the slr but was significant in the overall mlr model the initial degree of saturation was not significant but did enhance the mlr model dc differed vastly from the other performance metrics by being neither affected by surface conditions nor hydraulic loading not shown table 4 instead the degree of saturation 24 h after the event was found to be mostly regulated by the maximum degree of saturation dsmax which was attained during the event as well as the 24 hour average soil temperature after the event these two soil related parameters accounted for 64 of the variance peak flow reduction was a measure of the steady state abstraction due to infiltration during the experiments using the constant flow rates in this study upon reaching steady state infiltration volume becomes independent of inflow rate hence the flow attenuation decreased with the increase in inflow rate this relationship was strongest in neutral winter conditions r2 0 65 p 0 01 fig 6 a in snow conditions the underlying soil was similar in nature to neutral conditions and consequently the relationship was just as strong fig 6b but as snow reduced ae the flow and volume attenuation were lower than in neutral conditions in the presence of frost f and sof the relationship was less strong and more variations in infiltration capacity were observed fig 6c and d left panel in frost only conditions the relationship between inflow rate and ae was stronger than when snow was present on top of frost as expected fig 6c and d right panel in warm conditions however the relationship between inflow rate and flow attenuation broke down fig 6e this suggests that another factor was influencing peak flow reduction i e the initial degree of soil saturation which as previously mentioned did not significantly influence the hydrologic performance metrics over the entire season p 0 05 table 4 nevertheless the antecedent degree of saturation was found to be a major driver explaining the variability in flow attenuation in summer albeit not statistically significant at the 5 level fig 7 in winter the degree of saturation did not exert a significant influence on peak flow reduction 3 3 hydrologic response of the swale no significant correlation was found between hydrological performance of the swale and either snow depth or the initial degree of saturation over the entire study period table 4 however a closer look at specific runoff experiments provides valuable insights into the processes that were not fully explained by statistical significance tests to better understand the relationship between the hydrological response and the initial degree of saturation the hydrographs of two consecutive experiments in summer 2019 were considered fig 8 a and b preceded by an abnormally long dry period of 2 weeks the initial degree of saturation was at an absolute seasonal low 50 prior to the former medium flow experiment the corresponding peak flow and volume reductions were the highest recorded throughout the study period for a medium flow 61 and 75 respectively the initial degree of saturation was much higher in the consecutive experiment 70 a higher outflow rate was observed in the second experiment despite the much lower inflow rate used consequently flow and volume reductions were reduced by a factor of 2 due to the increase in the initial water content fig 8b regression analyses indicated a negative relationship between snow depth and the swale performance metrics table 4 though not statistically significant this confirmed that runoff events became more voluminous with the addition of meltwater but this result is not generalizable as noted from the hydrographs during two runoff experiments with 30 cm thick snow cover fig 8c and d when the soil was frozen and a high inflow rate was used the water was initially stored in the snow to be suddenly released afterwards in a dam burst like manner producing an outflow peak that exceeded the inflow rate however volume reduction was 23 due to the storage of runoff water in the snowpack in contrast when the soil was not frozen and a low inflow rate was used the delay in outflow was 24 min which is the longest tlag observed during the study period the runoff peak did not surpass the inflow rate and the volume reduction was as high as 83 this indicated that the presence of thick snow cover can either accentuate or severely attenuate runoff peaks while providing considerable volume reduction 3 4 soil response during winter runoff events long term measurements of soil and hydrological inputs provide valuable insights into the influential factors that contributed to frost formation the first surface frost occurred after a rainfall event on november 22 fig 4b double dashed line that was followed by a freezing cycle min 8 3 c the second soil frost period occurred in december due to a long period of surface cooling the soil thawed in january during which time the water content at 5 cm repeatedly peaked at 54 corresponding to 99 degree of saturation two synthetic experiments on january 29 and 31 accompanied with subfreezing air temperature min 6 4 c led to frost formation at the 5 cm soil horizon during this period the soil temperature dropped to a minimum of 1 3 c frost was interrupted once again on february 7 as a result of a ros event accompanied by an increase in air temperature max 8 1 c following that a sharp reduction in temperature was recorded min 10 c and with the absence of an insulating snow cover surface water content dropped dramatically to 7 these frost conditions were maintained for almost one and a half months which was reflected in both an uncharacteristically low water content and limited response at 5 cm soil depth during the subsequent runoff events the successive wetting of the soil during this period resulting from the multiple snowmelt events as well as the synthetic runoff experiments led to the extended period of frozen soil which lasted until the end of winter a closer look at the changes in soil saturation and temperature during specific events gives insights into the variations in frost type and infiltration capacity when the soil was partially frozen fig 9 a left panel the water content in the deeper layers responded almost immediately to hydrological inputs while the top layer responded gradually peaking at 14 saturation at the end of the experiment hence pore ice was present in the top 5 cm throughout the experiment while at the same time allowing water to seep to the non frozen ground below moreover infiltrating water melted some of the frost in the topsoil during the experiment this suggests that preferential flow paths and or air filled pores were present within the top frozen layer during the most severe frost event february 17 fig 9a center the deeper layers of the soil also responded to the runoff at the surface however the response was slightly delayed indicative of more resistance to the flow which might have resulted from frost penetration within the 5 15 cm soil horizon and thereafter thawing with the infiltrating water fig 9a and b center it should be noted that the topsoil was frozen throughout the inflow period i e soil saturation remained at 6 in spite of this downward water movement was still observed in the swale media by the end of april fig 9a right the soil returned to neutral conditions as attested by the increase in saturation in the entire soil profile during the experiment on april 30 lastly the seasonal variations in soil porosity of the top layer throughout the study period showed two interrupted periods of low porosity the first of these was during experiments in november and december and the second during experiments in february and march fig 9c afterwards the topsoil s porosity increased from 87 on april 8 to 98 on april 30 when the soil thawed completely this suggested that the swale did not undergo a consistent reduction in infiltration capacity during winter but was subjected to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing as a result of the frequent rainfall events accompanied with an increase in air temperatures 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal swale performance in cold maritime climate the focus of this research was on the winter performance of grass swales which are usually designed to infiltrate and treat small rainfall events and attenuate peak flow from large events woods ballard et al 2015 the 5 8 m long test section of the swale infiltrated on average 46 of the low flow rates 0 65 1 l s during the study period which covered winter spring and summer these low hydraulic loadings constituted almost half of the measured flows naturally entering the suds system the infiltration was on average 7 and 32 for the higher flowrates during winter and summer respectively during extreme frozen conditions a significant reduction in infiltration capacity was observed nevertheless there were no indications that the swale capacity was exceeded overflowing of the side slopes was never observed in the swale and the average flow depth was below 10 cm the winter hydrological performance decline observed in this study was consistent with previous research connecting reduced winter performance with vegetation dormancy and lower temperatures roseen et al 2009 but more importantly this study showed that the winter performance in a cold maritime climate fluctuated on a synoptic basis because of intermittent frost formation at the surface and to a lesser extent frequent snow cycles the results of this study are best compared with suds studies in cold coastal regions experiencing frequent freeze thaw and ros events namely in the prairie environments in canada and in norway khan et al 2012 observed an average peak flow reduction in bioretention cells of 92 for winter events with hydraulic loading of 25 cm h this was attributed to the water eventually infiltrating via preferential flow paths and reaching the underdrain without utilizing the entire media despite the presence of frost at a depth of 15 cm similarly paus et al 2015 found that the total volume reduction achieved by three bioretention cells ranged between 55 and 100 in contrast the average flow attenuation in the swale in this study was only 13 for hydraulic loadings ranging between 19 and 131 cm h this comparison supports the findings of roseen et al 2009 that swales suffer the most noticeable performance decline in winter of suds elements this can be attributed to the shorter retention time in a conveyance based system such as swales compared to retention based systems such as bioretention cells 4 2 the interactions between runoff snow and soil frost muthanna et al 2008 hypothesized that ros played a role in frost formation based on the observation that the infiltrated stormwater refroze following both ros and rainfall events roseen et al 2009 also noted that frost resulting from freeze thaw cycles was common and that soil freezing usually occurred before and after rain and snowmelt events however neither study quantified the effects of the frequent freeze thaw cycles the interactions between snow and frost or their impact on subsequent events in this study however synthetic runoff events were conducted in the presence of snow with the intention to simulate ros events closely spaced water content and temperature measurements at different soil depths allowed for a continuous assessment of soil infiltration and frost formation in grass swales over an entire winter the results clearly demonstrate that intermittent midwinter rain and ros events led to high water contents and promoted frost formation specifically during winter 19 20 three events natural and synthetic initiated separate freezing cycles which reduced soil porosity fig 4c and d the temporal wetting of the soil which in some cases was combined with the removal of the snow cover rendered the soil more susceptible to temperature fluctuations as evidenced in the sharp reduction in soil temperature following these events fig 4c this is a common complication with the implementation of suds in coastal cold regions that experience repeated ros and freeze thaw cycles khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 4 3 key mechanisms affecting winter infiltration the primary mechanism for hydrological performance deterioration was soil frost soil permeability in the presence of frost varied across experiments due to the heterogeneous nature of soils and frost formation as well as the presence of cracks and preferential flow paths resulting from the frequent freeze thaw cycles spatial variability was observed in six single ring infiltration measurements conducted in an adjacent swale zaqout unpublished data on any given day infiltration was impeded in certain locations while it was not affected in other locations the formation of porous or granular frost with loose ice crystals may permit or even enhance infiltration flerchinger 2013 a common factor that influences infiltration is frost depth fach et al 2011 in this study frost was only detected in the topmost layer at 5 cm soil depth fig 4c and d it is not clear how far the frost penetrated between 5 and 15 cm depth soil temperature at 5 cm intervals within the first 20 cm of the profile would have helped clearing this ambiguity on maximum frost depth however an excellent indication of soil infiltration and frost formation throughout the soil matrix was provided by water content probes spaced 10 cm apart see fig 9 and discussion thereof the secondary mechanism that negatively affected winter performance was snow cover snow reduced the swale s surface area by concentrating surface runoff which would have otherwise been more evenly distributed in snow free conditions moreover the added snowmelt led to more voluminous runoff events and reduced water temperature which negatively affects infiltration nevertheless for the least intense runoff experiments low flow snow was also found to enhance the hydrological performance by storing significant amounts of runoff water and by delaying flow peaks this storage function was dependent however on snow properties and the underlying soil conditions water stored in the snowpack was released instantaneously in a dam burst like release of water when thick snow was coupled with the presence of soil frost or dense snow layers such a burst was only observed once in this study making further investigations necessary to verify the results lastly the storage function of the snow becomes less important in longer duration events as all of the snow will melt eventually and add to runoff most of the extreme winter flooding events recorded in reykjavík involved 6 h of rainfall arnardóttir 2020 4 4 the importance of soil drainage in design previous studies have found that initial degree of saturation negatively influences the hydrological performance of suds rujner et al 2018 this relationship was only detected during summer in this study after dry periods lasting for weeks at a time fig 7 degree of saturation is highly linked with dc poorly drained soils tend to maintain a high degree of saturation which in turn reduces their capacity to mitigate subsequent events a dc in the range of only 20 to 26 as in this study might have exacerbated the impacts of winter conditions and promoted frost formation additionally the high water content in the swale also affected the performance during non frozen conditions by reducing the available volume for infiltration at the onset of runoff events this was consistent with the previous findings from studies on infiltration based systems e g lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 and emphasizes the importance of proper soil drainage especially for winter operations we argue that dc is particularly important in a cold maritime climate which frequently experiences precipitation in liquid form as opposed to solely dry snow the combination of liquid inputs and poor dc makes the soils more susceptible to freezing even though air temperatures fluctuate only moderately around zero the minimum daily temperature recorded in reykjavík is 12 c frost events particularly occurred 1 2 days following rainfall simulated runoff and ros events which might not have been a long enough period to properly drain the swale media prior to the onset of freezing air temperatures this was observed in the sharp drops in moisture content and soil temperature at 5 cm depth after the november 22 january 29 and 31 february 11 and 25 march 6 and 11 events fig 4c and d frost formation was confirmed in the runoff experiments following those events and it was reflected in the deterioration in performance indicators to maintain a good soil drainage and reduce the risk of frost formation care must be taken in the design and operation of swales fine textured soils such as clay and silt should be avoided in the filter media due to their low infiltration capacity and high water holding potential dust accumulation might occur when swales are located next to roads or parking lots with heavy traffic especially in cold climates where studded tires that increase road erosion are used extensively barr 2020 filter strips are often used to capture road dust and sediments before entering the swale in this study the swale was adhering to best practices but the swale filtering media laid on hard compacted clay this might explain the low drainage capacity observed throughout the study period 5 conclusions maritime winter climate is both wet and mild with air temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point and precipitation falling as rainfall rain on snow and snow this research assesses the impacts of co acting winter conditions on the hydrological performance of grass swales to that goal 63 synthetic runoff experiments were performed in a grass swale over 18 months the swale hydrological performance was evaluated based on five metrics the relative peak flow reduction the relative infiltrated volume runoff lag time soil drainage capacity and areal efficiency results indicated a significant impairment in the hydrologic performance during winter peak flow attenuation was 13 in winter as compared to 20 40 in spring and summer similarly the relative infiltrated volume was 22 in winter vs 30 60 during the warm season poor flow attenuation was primarily associated with the reduction in soil porosity in the top 5 cm horizon because of the formation of ice lenses however macropores created by vegetation roots biological activity and the frequent freeze thaw cycles allowed for infiltration to the deeper layers of the soil thus no concrete frost fully blocking infiltration was observed during the study period runoff lag times where three times shorter in winter compared to summer reflecting a reduction in surface roughness while the surface frost significantly reduced the overall performance of the swale it did not compromise the swale overall function of attenuating small and medium events snow cover provided both initial storage and resistance to overland flow resulting in longer lag times and high volume reduction during short duration low hydraulic loading events but as an event progressed overland flow formed in a concentrated path within the snowpack effectively reducing the area of infiltration the snow melted and added to the runoff volume in the most severe case the runoff initially stored in a thick snow was released instantaneously similar to a dam burst to the effect that the outflow exceeded inflow the swale hence the combination of sudden snowmelt and low infiltration capacity can generate more intense rain on snow induced runoff events however this condition was observed only once in this study this study provided to the authors best knowledge the first systematic assessment of the relative importance of hydraulic loading surface and soil conditions on the seasonal performance of grassed swales in a cold climate single and multivariate regression analyses highlight that winter peak flow and volume reduction were primarily affected by surface temperature followed by hydraulic loading and to a lesser extent snow depth the moisture content of the underlying soil did not significantly affect the infiltration in winter but played a large role in explaining the variance in summer performance the highest infiltration capacity observed in this study was when the soil was half saturated which occurred in summer following a two week dry period runoff lag times and areal efficiency were primarily affected by inflow rate and secondarily by surface conditions such as snow depth soil drainage capacity was however governed by the 24 hour average swale media temperature following the event and the maximum soil saturation reached during the event in a maritime climate with air temperature oscillating in the order of 15 times around the freezing point during winter precipitation falls often in liquid form frequent rain and rain on snow infiltrates the ground which keeps the soil moist in the absence of an insulating snow cover the soil is more susceptible to freezing frost was observed to form within 1 2 days after runoff events which negatively affected the swale s ability to infiltrate subsequent events this combined with a soil drainage capacity of only 20 26 in 24 h as found in this study kept the soil highly saturated during winter and more susceptible to freezing with rising winter temperatures regions that historically underwent a seasonal frost and snow period may now experience more frequent and intense mid winter rain on snow followed by frost this study confirms that suds may serve as a low impact low cost solution to reduce urban flooding in such cyclic climatic winter conditions a special attention is however required in the design and operation of suds in relation to rain on snow and frost cycles proper soil drainage is instrumental in order to maintain the soil relatively dry and less susceptible to the frequent freezing limiting the presence of fine sediments that decrease infiltration is required both in the filter media during the construction phase and from surface loading during the operation lifetime of swales the reduction in infiltration capacity during winter must also be taken into account when sizing suds therefore incorporating site specific considerations is recommended for the designing of infiltration

4599,lakes are typical plain reservoirs with many similar functions to valley reservoirs however their flood processes differ significantly due to their specific topography flooding of the dam site the entire reservoir inflow is considered during flood control analysis of valley reservoirs whereas the flood inundation risk of flood detention areas in the lake basin should be considered for lakes therefore more attention should be paid to the flood processes of each sub region here based on the flood processes characteristics of large water carrying lakes a complete framework for establishing design floods for sizeable rivers connected lakes is introduced first multiple copula based joint distribution functions are constructed based on the water system structure of the lake then several confidence intervals are obtained using a methodology that identifies the boundary for multivariate combinations finally through these confidence intervals are used in conjunction with each other the design flood processes for water carrying lake system can be determined the proposed methodology was applied to the hongze lake china the results indicate that this method not only effectively avoids the randomness of the traditional method but also balances the characteristics of the flood process in each sub region with the features of the entire flood process the proposed method has a strong statistical theoretical foundation and expands the applicability of multi variable flood frequency analysis techniques to water conservancy projects keywords flood control design flood copula function water carrying lake plain reservoir hongze lake 1 introduction according to their topography reservoirs are generally classified into three types valley reservoirs plain reservoirs and groundwater reservoirs with most reservoirs in china being valley reservoirs lakes as water storage units are predominantly plain reservoirs especially large water carrying lake plain reservoirs have many similar functions to valley reservoirs for example runoff regulation flood control and water supply however large water carrying lakes and valley reservoirs have the following differences 1 for valley reservoirs flooding of the dam site which is the entire reservoir inflow is generally used as the basis for reservoir flood control analysis in contrast the flood process of large water carrying lakes is complicated with multiple flood sources and the runoff flowing into the lake through multiple rivers and channels simultaneously 2 compared with valley reservoirs large water carrying lakes especially those in the plain areas typically have a large water surface area therefore the runoff generation and confluence processes of the precipitation in the lake are extremely rapid making the flood control more challenging 3 for lakes the flood inundation risk of flood detention areas in the lake basin should typically be considered especially if the standard for utilising flood detention areas is relatively low thus the hydrodynamic models are always used to simulate the flood routing processes in the lake areas whereas most valley reservoirs do not have similar demands hassanzadeh et al 2012 li et al 2015 flood control safety design research for water conservancy projects can be divided into two types those based on risk analysis and those based on flood frequency however due to the difficulty of estimating flood disasters and unifying the measurement of human and environmental losses flood control schemes based on risk analysis are still in the research and development stage for this reason the flood control schemes based on flood frequency are currently widely used in engineering applications the design flood is a crucial input of flood control schemes thus abundant research has been conducted on design floods from initial simple analyses and calculations to more advanced methods guo et al 2016 the expression formulas and calculation methods that describe a flood event according to a certain standard can be approximately divided into two categories 1 those that use the frequency of flood or rainstorm events to express the standard for a design flood ji et al 1984 guo 1990 and 2 those that estimate the probable maximum flood pmf as the design flood standard using the probable maximum precipitation pmp wang 2002 2005 fu et al 2013 although the principles usage scenarios and regions of the two design flood methods are different their basic implementation steps are similar and include sampling selecting frequency distribution functions estimating parameters analysing the regional flood composition and designing flood hydrographs greenwood et al 1979 li 1984 cheng 2000 dai et al 2006 shu and ouarda 2008 xiao et al 2009 yang et al 2009 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 liang et al 2014 hu 2018 in addition to increase the sample size and improve the accuracy of design floods the research on historical and paleo floods is constantly being explored stedinger and cohn 1986 england et al 2003 theoretical research and the practical engineering knowledge have revealed that the characteristic of floods exhibit obvious differences in different periods within a year thus the concern of a seasonal design flood was proposed to alleviate the conflict between flood control and flood benefits singh et al 2005 cunderlik et al 2004 feng et al 2008 since then a complete theoretical framework and sophisticated applicable methods have been established for determining design floods an actual flood process has several characteristics including the flood peak flood volume and flood duration the frequency of those characteristics during the flood process are often different but mutually correlated moreover it is impossible to define the occurrence frequency for an actual flood process because there is no frequency concept for the process itself the style of design flood process is accordance with the actual flood process a spatio temporal continuous process however in contrast to the actual flood process it is always connected with a certain probability of occurrence that is the return period the traditional design flood methods as are mentioned above often use the return period to amplify the typical flood process to obtain the design flood process however these methods ignore the dependence structure between the various characteristics of the flood process this inevitably leads to some limitations in the hydrological mechanism for traditional design flood methods de michele et al 2005 li et al 2014 therefore multivariate frequency analyses are required to study floods due to the dependence among representative variables of the flood hydrograph requena et al 2016 in particular multivariate analyses are essential when flood routing processes significantly attenuate flood peaks such as in dams and flood management in flood prone areas the copula function which has a more flexible structure has previously been employed to estimate design floods because it can be used to construct the joint distribution function with any marginal distribution the introduction of the copula function has led to recent advances in flood design which can be briefly summarized from the following four aspects 1 the copula function which has a more flexible structure can be used to construct the joint distribution function with any marginal distribution consequently the copula function makes it possible to determine design floods that consider multiple variables such as the flood peak and volume feng et al 2009 li et al 2014a 2 based on the joint distribution function of the flood peak and volume although the design values of the bivariate under a certain joint recurrence period can be obtained by solving the joint distribution functions there is an obvious problem that is there is not unique optimal solution therefore choosing scientific and reasonable design values is the key to the successful application of multi variable design flood methods volpi and fiori 2012 gräler et al 2013 requena et al 2013 3 using the copula function to construct a multi variable joint distribution function is the basis of the multi variable design flood method therefore the uncertainty analysis of design floods should be more complicated than the previous single variable analysis of design floods serinaldi 2013 dung et al 2015 4 with intensified human activities and accelerated climate change the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation and extreme drought events has significantly affected the temporal and spatial characteristics of the regional floods the assumption of hydrological process consistency which is the basis of the design flood has therefore been undermined accordingly as such employing the copula function to analyse the non stationary flood frequency has become an indispensable step for flood design yin et al 2018a 2020 at present studies using the copula function to determine multi variable design floods have typically been applied to valley reservoirs from the scale of a single reservoir to cascade reservoir groups lu et al 2012 li et al 2014b undoubtedly compared with the traditional methods the multi variable design flood method can describe the internal laws of flood events more comprehensively by better meeting the requirements of flood control xiong et al 2005 salvadori and de michele 2007 zhang and singh 2007 unfortunately research on plain reservoirs in the form of large water carrying lakes is rare although large water carrying lakes and valley reservoirs have some similar hydraulic characteristics and some flood design methods of valley reservoirs can be directly applied to large water carrying lakes there are notable differences between the flood processes of lakes and reservoirs therefore it is also necessary to determine design floods according to the flood processes characteristics of large water carrying lakes based on the copula function in this study the copula function is used to construct multiple joint distribution functions moreover according to the relationship between the entire flood process of the lake and the flood process of each sub region the probability of multiple flood event combinations is measured using the joint probability density functions pdf accordingly the primary objectives of this research are 1 to determine a reasonable composition of the flood peak and volume given a joint return period 2 to determine a reasonable flood volume allocation scheme for a known total flood volume 3 to determine a reasonable flood peak interval of each sub region once the above two steps are completed 2 study area and data as shown in fig 1 the hongze lake the fourth largest freshwater lake in china with a water surface area of 1 597 km2 is located in the middle and lower reaches of the huaihe river basin the flood control water level and normal water level of hongze lake are 12 5 m and 13 0 m and its storage capacity is 30 4 108 m3 runoff which is generated in the upper and middle reaches of the huaihe river basin flows into the hongze lake to the west and it empties into the yangtze river and the yellow sea respectively after being regulated in the lake for a long time hongze lake has played an important role in the flood control system of the huaihe river basin liu et al 2017 at present there are seven main river channels into hongze lake namely the huaihe river xuhonghe river xu h huaihongxinhe river huai h laosuihe river lao s xinsuihe river xin s xinbianhe river xin b and chihe river the chihe river flows into the huaihe river through the nüshan lake whereas the other rivers directly merge into the hongze lake daily runoff data for inflow into the hongze lake from 1960 2010 were obtained from the huaihe river commission of the ministry of water resources people s republic of china 3 methodology 3 1 theory and basic method of the copula function the copula function is defined as a multi variable distribution function with uniform margins at intervals of 0 1 nelsen 2007 based on sklarʹs theorem sklar 1959 copulas are capable of linking the joint cumulative distribution function cdf to its marginal distribution functions it can be expressed as 1 h x 1 x 2 x n c θ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n 2 c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n n c θ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where h is a joint distribution n is the number of marginal distribution f i x i represents the marginal distribution and cθ is the copula cdf with parameter θ c is the pdf of cθ we selected symmetric archimedean copulas clayton gumbel frank and joe copulas which are widely used in hydrological multivariate frequency analysis because of their simple function structure as the candidate functions luo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 maximum likelihood based methods mls were used for parameter estimation song et al 2012 hofert et al 2012 several common evaluation criteria were used to select the optimal copula functions such as the akaike information criterion aic the bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse genest et al 2009 the evaluation criteria are defined as follows 3 aic 2 k n l n 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 4 bic ln n k n l n 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 where pei is the empirical frequency pi is the theoretical frequency k is the number of joint distribution function parameters and n is the number of samples 3 2 analysing the combination of total peak and volume for the entire flood process as a random hydrological event a flood event is generally composed of multiple elements such as the peak and volume which typically exhibit some correlation the design flood should be representative of the actual characteristics of the flood event consequently multivariate joint analysis is a significant aspect of design flood research 3 2 1 calculating the joint distribution of total peak and volume based on the copula function assuming that the qtotal and wtotal represent the total peak and volume of entire flood process respectively the corresponding design values are qtotal and wtotal and their marginal distributions are fqtotal qtotal and fwtotal wtotal respectively then the joint distribution of qtotal and wtotal can be expressed as 6 f q total w total c θ total f q total q total f w total w total where f qtotal wtotal is the joint distribution of qtotal and wtotal 3 2 2 determining the joint recurrence period of total peak and volume the or and kendall and survival kendall joint recurrence period definition methods are more commonly used in the multi variable joint recurrence period research de michele et al 2005 guo et al 2008 salvadori et al 2011 liu et al 2018 based on the joint distribution function of qtotal and wtotal the or joint recurrence period definition method was selected in this study for its simple structure and partial to safe according to the or joint recurrence period definition the occurrence recurrence period of qtotal and wtotal can be expressed as follows 7 e q total w total e q total q total e w total w total 8 p q total w total p q total q total w total w total 9 t q total w total 1 p q total w total 1 1 f q total w total where p is the occurrence probability of event e and t is the recurrence period of event e 3 2 3 deducing the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination based on the joint distribution function of qtotal and wtotal given a joint recurrence period there are infinite combinations of qtotal and wtotal that could meet the flood control standard however not all the combinations are consistent with the constitutional law of hydrological events only in a particular range are the combinations are reasonable moreover although some combinations are rational the occurrence probability is relatively small such as the combination of a large qtotal and a small wtotal or vice versa therefore it is necessary to deduct the confidence interval of the combinations under a known joint recurrence period volpi and fiori 2012 assuming that the joint recurrence period of qtotal and wtotal is z the wtotal can be described with qtotal based on the joint distribution function of qtotal and wtotal the derivation process is as follows 10 c θ total f q total q total f w total w total 1 1 z 11 f w total w total ξ f q total q total 1 1 z 12 w total f w total 1 f f q total q total 1 1 z where f w total 1 is the inverse function of wtotal and ξ is the function derived from eq 10 based on the concept of identical deformation accordingly the f qtotal wtotal as the pdf of the cdf f qtotal wtotal can be converted into a single valued continuous function of qtotal the hydrograph where the f qtotal wtotal changes with qtotal under the known recurrence period z can be drawn furthermore the area enclosed by the axis of the hydrograph and abscissa is s qtotal according to s qtotal f qtotal wtotal can be normalized to obtain a new density function φq qtotal the derivation process is as follows 13 f q total w total c f q total q total f w total w total f q total q total f w total w total 14 f q total w total c f q total q total ξ f q total q total 1 1 z f q total q total f w total f w total 1 ξ f q total q total 1 1 z 15 s q total 0 f q total w total d q total 16 s q total 0 c f q total q total ξ f q total q total 1 1 z f q total q total f w total f w total 1 ξ f q total q total 1 1 z d q total 17 φ q q total f q total w total s q total where c is the pdf related to the cdf cθtotal fqtotal qtotal fwtotal wtotal fqtotal qtotal and fwtotal wtotal are the pdf of the qtotal and wtotal respectively selecting the appropriate interval qup total qdown total makes the value of integral eq 17 can reach the confidence level α and the corresponding values of wup total and wdown total are calculated by the joint distribution function f qtotal wtotal accordingly finally the boundary points qup total wup total and qdown total wdown total are determined based on the condition that the joint return period is z and the confidence level is α it can be represented by the following mathematical expression q total up q total down φ q q total d q total 1 α 3 3 analysis of the flood volume allocation scheme the design flood regional composition is in essence a total flood volume allocation scheme if the total flood volume is constant an increase in the flood volume in some regions will lead to a decrease in the flood volume in other regions traditional methods for designing flood region composition typically summarize all possible flood combinations based on specific regional composition situations obviously these traditional methods lack a theoretical basis the calculation results often exhibit significant differences and errors are difficult to assess 3 3 1 clustering of rivers based on the runoff correlation analysis the flood process of large scale water carrying lakes is complicated runoff flows into the lake through multiple rivers and channels at the same time during the flood season however if the flood process of each river channel is considered separately it would not only ignore the natural hydrological and hydraulic connections between the rivers but also cause the problems related to excessively high dimensions of the joint distribution function such as inaccurate parameter estimation the poor fitting effect and strong tail dependence requena et al 2016 luo et al 2019 for this reason according to their geography the rivers entering the hongze lake were merged and clustered into sub region according to runoff correlation analysis using the person and spearman methods significantly the regional analysis method in this study is proposed based on river system structure of water carrying lakes and the distribution characteristics of the observing stations the object of this method is river compared with the usual regional analysis chebana and ouarda 2007 requena et al 2016 the statistical theoretical foundation of this method is weaker however the method is simple and convenient and it can take the geography factors and requirements of hydrodynamic model simulation into consideration 3 3 2 calculating the joint distribution of sub region flood volumes based on the copula function assuming that the wi represents the flood volume of each sub region flood process the corresponding design values are indicated by wi whose marginal distributions are fwi wi then the joint distribution of wi can be expressed as 18 f w 1 w 2 w n c θ w f w 1 w 1 f w 2 w 2 f w n w n where f w 1 w 2 wn is the joint distribution of wi and n is the number of sub regions 3 3 3 deducing the 95 confidence interval of the design flood regional composition once the total flood volume and the number of sub regions have been determined there are infinite regional flood allocation schemes however not all the schemes are consistent with the constitutional law of hydrological events chebana and ouarda 2011 salvadori et al 2011 moreover although some schemes are rational their probability of occurrence is relatively small such as the flood volume in the main runoff producing sub region only accounting for a small proportion of the total flood and the flood volume of the secondary runoff producing sub region representing a more significant proportion of the total flood thus to avoid obtaining extreme regional flood allocation schemes it is also necessary to determine the confidence interval of the design flood regional composition li et al 2014b according to the number of sub regions deducing the 95 confidence interval of the design flood regional composition should be performed for two cases that is for a total flood volume of wtotal case ① is the case with two sub regions whose w 1 and w 2 have the following relationship w 1 w 2 w total accordingly the f w 1 w 2 as the pdf of the cdf f qtotal wtotal can be converted into a single valued continuous function of w 1 and the hydrograph of f w 1 w 2 changing with w 1 can be drawn furthermore the area enclosed by the axis of the hydrograph and the abscissa is s w 1 according to s w 1 the f w 1 w 2 can be normalized to obtain a new density function φw w 1 the derivation process is as follows 19 f w 1 w 2 c f w 1 w 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z f w 1 w 1 f w 2 f w 2 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z 20 s w 1 w total 0 c f w 1 w 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z f w 1 w 1 f w 2 f w 2 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z d w 1 21 φ w w 1 f w 1 w 2 s w 1 where c is the pdf related to the cdf cθw fw 1 w 1 fw 2 w 2 and fw 1 w 1 and fw 2 w 2 are the pdf of the w 1 and w 2 respectively selecting the appropriate interval wup 1 wdown 1 makes the value of the integral eq 21 reaches the confidence level α and the corresponding values of wup 2 and wdown 2 are calculated accordingly finally the boundary points wup 1 wup 2 and wdown 1 wdown 2 are determined based on the condition that the confidence level is α it can be represented by the following mathematical expression w 1 up w 2 down φ w w 1 d w 1 1 α in case ② the number of sub regions is greater than two however volume of each sub region still has the following relationship 1 n w i w total although it is difficult to use the above mathematical expressions to describe the relationship between each sub region flood volume a large number of flood allocation schemes can still be randomly generated moreover the occurrence probability of each scheme can be deduced by the joint distribution function of wi consequently the confidence interval of the design flood regional composition can also be determined in practice 3 4 analyzing the reasonable range of each sub region flood peak the entire flood process of hongze lake is composed of the sub region flood processes and the total flood volume is equal to the sum of the sub region flood volumes however due to the difference in runoff propagation time the superposition of sub region flood peaks is not the total flood peak of hongze lake thus to make the characteristics of the flood process in each sub region keep harmony with the features of the entire flood process the reasonable range of each sub region flood peak should be determined using the above methods 3 4 1 drawing the confidence areas of the total flood peak and each sub region flood peaks assuming that the qi represents the flood peak of each sub region flood process respectively the corresponding design values are indicated by qi and their marginal distributions are indicated by fqi qi then the joint distribution of each qi and qtotal can be expressed as 22 f i q i q total c θ i f q i q i f q total q total where fi qi qtotal is the joint distribution of qi and qtotal i 1 2 3 n and n is the number of sub regions given an arbitrary joint return period t all the combinations of q i and qtotal can be described by a recurrence contour curve and the confidence interval with a confidence level of α can also be determined by setting t equal to one two three n years many confidence intervals can be obtained with a certain confidence level using the method described above moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area βi 3 4 2 drawing the confidence areas of each sub region flood peak and volume assuming that the wi represents the flood volume of each sub region flood process respectively the corresponding design values are represented by wi and their marginal distributions are represented by fwi wi then the joint distribution of each qi and wi can be expressed as 23 f i q i w i c θ i f q i q i f w i w i where fi q i wi is the joint distribution of qi and wi i 1 2 3 n and n is the number of sub regions given an arbitrary joint return period t all the combinations of q i and wi can be described by a recurrence contour curve and the confidence interval with a confidence level of α can also be determined by setting t equal to one two three n years the method can obtain many confidence intervals with a certain confidence level by the method described above naturally moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area γ i 3 4 3 estimating the reasonable interval of sub region flood peaks when the qtotal is known according to the joint distribution function of qi and qtotal the qi can be determined under any given joint return period t however not all qi values are within the scope of confidence area βi the interval of qi which in the range of confidence area βi can be expressed as q iup q total q idown q total when wi is known according to the joint distribution function of qi and wi the qi can be determined under any given joint return period t however not all qi values are within the scope of confidence area γ i the interval of qi which in the range of confidence area γ i can be expressed as q iup w i q idown w i in order to maintain the relationship between qtotal and wtotal and ensure that the sub region flood peak design is reasonable the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peak can be expressed as q iup q total q idown q total q iup w i q idown w i according to the presence of empty sets among the intersections the following steps can be divided into two cases case ① if there are no empty sets among all intersections there must be a group of sub region flood peaks which can ensure the relationship between qtotal and wtotal without being destroyed under the corresponding flood volume allocation scheme the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peak is then given by the intersections case ② if some intersections are empty sets there must be no group of sub region flood peaks which can ensure the relationship between qtotal and wtotal without being destroyed under the corresponding flood volume allocation scheme in this case the flood volume allocation scheme should be readjusted based on the interval eq 23 using the above methods section 3 3 the framework for determining the design flood control scheme for a water carrying lake as shown in fig 2 moreover a set of packages of the free software r version 3 5 1 were used in this study such as the copula package vinecopula package lmomco package corrplot package and fitdistrplus package so on 4 results 4 1 total peak and volume combination the design flood period is typically 15 days or 30 days for a large scale reservoir and typically three days or seven days for small and medium sized reservoirs mwrc 2006 the total storage capacity of hongze lake is 13 5 billion m3 therefore it should belong to the first level large scale reservoir therefore setting the design flood period of hongze lake is set to 30 days in this study accordingly the joint distributions which were constructed using the copula function are shown in table 1 and fig 3 the best fitting copula functions for the different joint distributions can be determined based on the evaluation criteria 4 1 1 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination taking a joint return period t of 100 years the contour map and the hydrograph of the change in φq qtotal with qtotal can be drawn the boundary points 253 million m3 13 025 m3 s and 263 million m3 13 025 m3 s are determined for a confidence level α of 0 05 the results are shown in fig 4 4 2 flood volume allocation scheme when the joint return period t is 100 years and the confidence level α is 0 05 the 30 day flood design volume range of hongze lake is 253 million m3 and 263 million m3 respectively 4 2 1 river clustering results as shown in fig 5 a and 5c the runoff correlations between the xi s river lao s river xu h river huai h river and xin b river are strong with most of the correlation coefficients greater than 0 7 according to the spearman test in contrast the runoff correlation between the chihe river and the other rivers is weak e g the correlation coefficient between the chihe river and the xin b river is 0 2 and 0 35 according to the spearman and pearson tests respectively the runoff correlation between the huaihe river and the other rivers is between 0 5 and 0 7 therefore considering their geographic information the xi s river lao s river xu h river huai h river and xin b river are merged into one virtual river and the runoff correlations between this virtual river chihe river and huaihe river are analysed again as there are no apparent runoff correlations between different rivers fig 5b and 5d the rivers entering the hongze lake are merged and clustered into three sub regions virtual river huaihe river and chihe river 4 2 2 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition according to the clustering analysis of rivers entering hongze lake the number of sub regions for design flood is greater than two therefore the 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition is determined using the method described in case ② taking the upper and lower boundary points of the 30 day design flood volume range of hongze lake 1 000 000 sets of flood volume allocation schemes are generated based on the joint distribution function of wi fig 6 a b shows the corresponding isosurface maps the 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition is determined for a confidence level α of 0 05 furthermore the three boundary points representing the maximum flood volume of each sub region are also obtained when the 30 day design flood volume of hongze lake is 263 million m3 the three boundary points are determined as follows boundary point 1 83 88 million m3 172 98 million m3 6 14 million m3 boundary point 2 2 40 million m3 260 44 million m3 0 18 million m3 boundary point 3 34 96 million m3 203 88 million m3 24 16 million m3 when the 30 day design flood volume of hongze lake is 253 million m3 the three boundary points are determined as follows boundary point 1 79 73 million m3 167 21 million m3 6 06 million m3 boundary point 2 2 71 million m3 250 10 million m3 0 20 million m3 boundary point 3 33 41 million m3 196 99 million m3 22 60 million m3 4 3 sub region flood peak reasonable intervals under the condition that the total flood peak and volume of hongze lake and the flood volume allocation scheme are known in order to further improve the credibility and reasonability of the design flood the flood peak reasonable intervals of each sub region should be estimated using the multiple joint distribution functions 4 3 1 confidence areas of the total flood peak and each sub region flood peaks for a confidence level α of 0 05 the 95 confidence intervals of the virtual flood peak and total flood peak are calculated for different joint return periods moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line as shown in fig 7 a the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area β 1 based on the corresponding joint distribution function the confidence areas β 2 and β 3 are obtained by using a similar approach as shown in fig 7c and 7e 4 3 2 the confidence areas of each sub region flood peak and volume for a confidence level α of 0 05 the 95 confidence intervals of the virtual flood peak and volume are calculated for different joint return periods moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line as shown in fig 7b the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area γ 1 based on the corresponding joint distribution function the confidence areas γ 2 and γ 3 are obtained by using a similar approach as shown in fig 7d and 7f 4 3 3 reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks for a total flood volume of 263 million m3 the total flood peak 12 225 m3 s is plotted in fig 7a c and e and the intervals q12225m3 s 1up q12225m3 s 1down q12225m3 s 2up q12225m3 s 2down q12225m3 s 3up q12225m3 s 3down were determined as shown in fig 8 a c and e furthermore according to fig 7b d and f the reasonable intervals of each sub region flood peak are obtained as shown in fig 8b d and f as shown in fig 8a when the total peak of the hongze lake is 12 225 m3 s the flood peak of the virtual river should be between 3 100 m3 s and 6 073 m3 s moreover the interval 3 100 m3 s to 6 073 m3 s is plotted in fig 8b where the overlapping shaded area is the reasonable flood peak area of virtual river according to the fig 8b when the virtual river flood volume is 34 96 million m3 or 83 38 million m3 the corresponding reasonable intervals of the flood peak are 4 782 m3 s 6 073 m3 s or 3 100 m3 s 4 798 m3 s however if the virtual river flood volume is 3 88 million m3 a reasonable value of the flood peak does not exist in addition under the condition that the total flood peak and volume of hognze lake are 12 225 m3 s and 263 million m3 the minimum flood volume which is allocated to the virtual river is 20 85 million m3 similarly according to the fig 8d and 8f the minimum flood volumes which are allocated to the huaihe river and chihe river are 122 59 million m3 and 9 60 million m3 respectively with the constraint condition of each sub region minimum flood volume 1 000 000 sets of flood volume allocation schemes are generated again by repeating the previous steps the final flood volume allocation scheme is obtained similarly when the total flood volume is 253 million m3 the final flood volume allocation scheme is calculated out using the same methods the results are shown in table 2 5 discussion in order to verify the rationality of this method a typical year for the huaihe river basin was selected and the traditional design flood method was used to determine the designed floods with a return period of 100 years for hongze lake 5 1 selecting the typical flood processes during the period from 1949 2019 some catastrophic flood events occurred in the huaihe river basin in 1954 1991 2003 and 2007 these events especially those in 1991 2003 and 2007 were significant disasters for the surrounding areas of hongze lake consequently 1991 2003 and 2007 were selected as typical years the corresponding flood processes are shown in fig 9 5 2 checking the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination with traditional methods the p iii type curve is typically used for hydrologic frequency analysis in china because it fits very well to the frequency distribution of hydrological variables in practice huang et al 2002 for example the huaihe river commission of the ministry of water resources hrc used the p iii type curve to formulate flood control planning for the huaihe basin hrc 2009 the fitting results of the annual maximum flood peak and the 30 day flood volume for the hongze lake using the p iii type curve are shown in fig 10 the design values of the total flood peak and 30 day flood volume for a return period of 100 years in hongze lake are 13 007 54 m3 s and 260 13 million m3 respectively using the same multiple ratio amplifying method the entire designed flood process of hongze lake was calculated two categories of ratios were used in the same multiple ratio amplifying method the designed flood peak to typical year flood peak ratios peak ratios for short and the designed flood volume to typical year flood volume ratios volume ratios for short the corresponding results are shown in fig 11 a 11c and 11e and fig 11b 11d and 11f respectively the following three conclusions are drawn from fig 11 1 all the designed flood processes using the same multiple ratio amplifying methods are in the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume indicating that the design flood method based on the copula function is feasible 2 the range of 95 confidence intervals obtained using the volume ratios is narrower than that were obtained by the peak ratios compare with the flood volume the randomness of the flood peak is more significant 3 the designed flood processes using the same multiple ratio amplifying methods are all in the upper range of the 95 confidence intervals this means that traditional design methods tend to be safe however they can be appropriately optimized to control engineering costs consequently it is necessary to consider the correlations between the various characteristic elements of the flood process so that the designed flood can reflect the natural laws of hydrological events 5 3 comparing the 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition with traditional methods on the basis of a total flood volume of 263 million m3 or 253 million m3 the designed flood region composition of hongze lake was calculated using the typical year method and the same frequency method the corresponding results are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively two cases were used for the same frequency method case ① among the virtual river huaihe river and chihe river only a single river had a flood return period of 100 years namely the single same frequency method fig 13a c and fig 13e g case ② among the virtual river huaihe river and chihe river there are two rivers had a flood return period of 100 years namely the double same frequency method fig 13d and 13 h the following four conclusions are drawn from figs 12 and 13 1 all design flood regional compositions for hongze lake calculated by the typical year method are in the 95 confidence areas of the design flood regional composition 2 all design flood region compositions for hongze lake calculated by the single same frequency method intersect with the corresponding 95 confidence areas of the design flood regional composition 3 all design flood regional compositions for hongze lake calculated by the double same frequency method are in the 95 confidence areas of the design flood regional composition expect the scheme that the return period for both virtual river and huaihe river is 100 years simultaneously 4 the scheme in which a return period of 100 years occurred in three rivers simultaneously is not in the 95 confidence areas of the design flood region composition according to the conclusions 1 and 2 it shows that the design flood regional composition based on the copula function is reasonable according to the conclusions 3 and 4 the total flood volume of hongze lake estimated by the joint distribution function is smaller than that estimated using traditional methods which is consistent with the previous research salvadori and de michele 2004 shi and song 2015 liu et al 2018 5 4 analyzing the rationality of the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks according to the flood volume allocation scheme results we used the same multiple ratio amplifying method to calculate the flood peak of each sub region three tests were conducted to verify the rationality of the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks table 3 according to table 3 the following two conclusions are drawn 1 the virtual river and huaihe river had passed the three tests for 1991 2003 and 2007 years 2 the chihe river only passed the three tests for 2003 years and did not pass the test 1 for 1991 and 2007 years which means that the design flood peak of the chihe river is not in the reasonable flood peak interval for 1991 and 2007 years however it is worth noting that the design flood peak of the chihe river did not deviate substantially from the reasonable flood peak interval the above conclusions indicate that it is feasible to use the multiple joint distribution function to determine the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks however error accumulation and propagation may influence the accuracy of flood peak interval estimation 6 conclusion the flood processes of large water carrying lakes have many flood sources moreover its flood regional composition typically complicated with the characteristics of flood processes differing in various sub regions due to factors such as geography and climate according to the flood process characteristics of large water carrying lakes the copula function was used to construct multiple joint distribution functions then a method was proposed that determines the confidence interval of each sub region flood process based on the entire flood process first the joint distribution function of the total flood peak and volume was used to deduce the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination second the 95 confidence interval of the design flood regional composition was determined by the joint distribution function of the sub region flood volume third the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peak was estimated through the multiple joint distribution functions used in conjunction with each other through trial and error the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 for a given joint recurrence period for the entire flood process of the lake system there are infinite combinations of flood peaks and volumes that could meet the flood control standards however not all the combinations are consistent with the constitutional law of hydrological events the confidence interval must be determined to ensure that the selected combinations are reasonable 2 if the flood volume of the entire flood process is designed there are similarity problems in deducing the design flood regional composition that is the combinations are only reasonable in a particular range employing a clustering method based on runoff correlation analysis with a methodology that identifies the boundary for multivariate combinations can solve these problems 3 furthermore when the total flood allocation scheme has been determined it is impossible to construct the confidence interval of each sub region flood peak however a reasonable range of each sub region flood peak can be determine by the multiple joint distribution functions which be used in conjunction with each other through trial and error 4 the proposed method for determining the design flood for water carrying lakes is feasible and can effectively avoid the randomness and uncertainty of the traditional methods this research can expand the applicability of multi variable flood frequency analysis techniques however the following improvements should be made in future research 1 as error accumulation and propagation and sampling uncertainty may influence the estimation of the designed flood an uncertainty analysis of design floods should be considered in the future studies yin et al 2018b 2 only three sub regions were determined for hongze lake however other large water carrying lakes may have more sub regions which would cause difficulties due to the large amount of calculation 3 the or joint recurrence period definition method was selected in this study however the other types of return period should be considered especially the structural load return period liu et al 2018 4 traditional flood design methods were used for comparison and verification in this study however the designed flood results should be tested using a hydrological and hydrodynamic model in a future work 5 global warming involves complex feedbacks between climate and human activity which changes the environment of floods development in different periods yin et al 2018c jiang et al 2019 this has caused the hydrological sequence to exhibit different trends or increasing variations furthermore the flood regional composition of water carrying lakes is complex additionally as the geographical and climatic conditions vary between sub regions the flood characteristics of each sub region will differ therefore the study of non stationary flood design under changing environments is highly significant for lake scientific management credit authorship contribution statement yun luo conceptualization formal analysis investigation methdology visualization writing original draft zengchuan

4599,lakes are typical plain reservoirs with many similar functions to valley reservoirs however their flood processes differ significantly due to their specific topography flooding of the dam site the entire reservoir inflow is considered during flood control analysis of valley reservoirs whereas the flood inundation risk of flood detention areas in the lake basin should be considered for lakes therefore more attention should be paid to the flood processes of each sub region here based on the flood processes characteristics of large water carrying lakes a complete framework for establishing design floods for sizeable rivers connected lakes is introduced first multiple copula based joint distribution functions are constructed based on the water system structure of the lake then several confidence intervals are obtained using a methodology that identifies the boundary for multivariate combinations finally through these confidence intervals are used in conjunction with each other the design flood processes for water carrying lake system can be determined the proposed methodology was applied to the hongze lake china the results indicate that this method not only effectively avoids the randomness of the traditional method but also balances the characteristics of the flood process in each sub region with the features of the entire flood process the proposed method has a strong statistical theoretical foundation and expands the applicability of multi variable flood frequency analysis techniques to water conservancy projects keywords flood control design flood copula function water carrying lake plain reservoir hongze lake 1 introduction according to their topography reservoirs are generally classified into three types valley reservoirs plain reservoirs and groundwater reservoirs with most reservoirs in china being valley reservoirs lakes as water storage units are predominantly plain reservoirs especially large water carrying lake plain reservoirs have many similar functions to valley reservoirs for example runoff regulation flood control and water supply however large water carrying lakes and valley reservoirs have the following differences 1 for valley reservoirs flooding of the dam site which is the entire reservoir inflow is generally used as the basis for reservoir flood control analysis in contrast the flood process of large water carrying lakes is complicated with multiple flood sources and the runoff flowing into the lake through multiple rivers and channels simultaneously 2 compared with valley reservoirs large water carrying lakes especially those in the plain areas typically have a large water surface area therefore the runoff generation and confluence processes of the precipitation in the lake are extremely rapid making the flood control more challenging 3 for lakes the flood inundation risk of flood detention areas in the lake basin should typically be considered especially if the standard for utilising flood detention areas is relatively low thus the hydrodynamic models are always used to simulate the flood routing processes in the lake areas whereas most valley reservoirs do not have similar demands hassanzadeh et al 2012 li et al 2015 flood control safety design research for water conservancy projects can be divided into two types those based on risk analysis and those based on flood frequency however due to the difficulty of estimating flood disasters and unifying the measurement of human and environmental losses flood control schemes based on risk analysis are still in the research and development stage for this reason the flood control schemes based on flood frequency are currently widely used in engineering applications the design flood is a crucial input of flood control schemes thus abundant research has been conducted on design floods from initial simple analyses and calculations to more advanced methods guo et al 2016 the expression formulas and calculation methods that describe a flood event according to a certain standard can be approximately divided into two categories 1 those that use the frequency of flood or rainstorm events to express the standard for a design flood ji et al 1984 guo 1990 and 2 those that estimate the probable maximum flood pmf as the design flood standard using the probable maximum precipitation pmp wang 2002 2005 fu et al 2013 although the principles usage scenarios and regions of the two design flood methods are different their basic implementation steps are similar and include sampling selecting frequency distribution functions estimating parameters analysing the regional flood composition and designing flood hydrographs greenwood et al 1979 li 1984 cheng 2000 dai et al 2006 shu and ouarda 2008 xiao et al 2009 yang et al 2009 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 liang et al 2014 hu 2018 in addition to increase the sample size and improve the accuracy of design floods the research on historical and paleo floods is constantly being explored stedinger and cohn 1986 england et al 2003 theoretical research and the practical engineering knowledge have revealed that the characteristic of floods exhibit obvious differences in different periods within a year thus the concern of a seasonal design flood was proposed to alleviate the conflict between flood control and flood benefits singh et al 2005 cunderlik et al 2004 feng et al 2008 since then a complete theoretical framework and sophisticated applicable methods have been established for determining design floods an actual flood process has several characteristics including the flood peak flood volume and flood duration the frequency of those characteristics during the flood process are often different but mutually correlated moreover it is impossible to define the occurrence frequency for an actual flood process because there is no frequency concept for the process itself the style of design flood process is accordance with the actual flood process a spatio temporal continuous process however in contrast to the actual flood process it is always connected with a certain probability of occurrence that is the return period the traditional design flood methods as are mentioned above often use the return period to amplify the typical flood process to obtain the design flood process however these methods ignore the dependence structure between the various characteristics of the flood process this inevitably leads to some limitations in the hydrological mechanism for traditional design flood methods de michele et al 2005 li et al 2014 therefore multivariate frequency analyses are required to study floods due to the dependence among representative variables of the flood hydrograph requena et al 2016 in particular multivariate analyses are essential when flood routing processes significantly attenuate flood peaks such as in dams and flood management in flood prone areas the copula function which has a more flexible structure has previously been employed to estimate design floods because it can be used to construct the joint distribution function with any marginal distribution the introduction of the copula function has led to recent advances in flood design which can be briefly summarized from the following four aspects 1 the copula function which has a more flexible structure can be used to construct the joint distribution function with any marginal distribution consequently the copula function makes it possible to determine design floods that consider multiple variables such as the flood peak and volume feng et al 2009 li et al 2014a 2 based on the joint distribution function of the flood peak and volume although the design values of the bivariate under a certain joint recurrence period can be obtained by solving the joint distribution functions there is an obvious problem that is there is not unique optimal solution therefore choosing scientific and reasonable design values is the key to the successful application of multi variable design flood methods volpi and fiori 2012 gräler et al 2013 requena et al 2013 3 using the copula function to construct a multi variable joint distribution function is the basis of the multi variable design flood method therefore the uncertainty analysis of design floods should be more complicated than the previous single variable analysis of design floods serinaldi 2013 dung et al 2015 4 with intensified human activities and accelerated climate change the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation and extreme drought events has significantly affected the temporal and spatial characteristics of the regional floods the assumption of hydrological process consistency which is the basis of the design flood has therefore been undermined accordingly as such employing the copula function to analyse the non stationary flood frequency has become an indispensable step for flood design yin et al 2018a 2020 at present studies using the copula function to determine multi variable design floods have typically been applied to valley reservoirs from the scale of a single reservoir to cascade reservoir groups lu et al 2012 li et al 2014b undoubtedly compared with the traditional methods the multi variable design flood method can describe the internal laws of flood events more comprehensively by better meeting the requirements of flood control xiong et al 2005 salvadori and de michele 2007 zhang and singh 2007 unfortunately research on plain reservoirs in the form of large water carrying lakes is rare although large water carrying lakes and valley reservoirs have some similar hydraulic characteristics and some flood design methods of valley reservoirs can be directly applied to large water carrying lakes there are notable differences between the flood processes of lakes and reservoirs therefore it is also necessary to determine design floods according to the flood processes characteristics of large water carrying lakes based on the copula function in this study the copula function is used to construct multiple joint distribution functions moreover according to the relationship between the entire flood process of the lake and the flood process of each sub region the probability of multiple flood event combinations is measured using the joint probability density functions pdf accordingly the primary objectives of this research are 1 to determine a reasonable composition of the flood peak and volume given a joint return period 2 to determine a reasonable flood volume allocation scheme for a known total flood volume 3 to determine a reasonable flood peak interval of each sub region once the above two steps are completed 2 study area and data as shown in fig 1 the hongze lake the fourth largest freshwater lake in china with a water surface area of 1 597 km2 is located in the middle and lower reaches of the huaihe river basin the flood control water level and normal water level of hongze lake are 12 5 m and 13 0 m and its storage capacity is 30 4 108 m3 runoff which is generated in the upper and middle reaches of the huaihe river basin flows into the hongze lake to the west and it empties into the yangtze river and the yellow sea respectively after being regulated in the lake for a long time hongze lake has played an important role in the flood control system of the huaihe river basin liu et al 2017 at present there are seven main river channels into hongze lake namely the huaihe river xuhonghe river xu h huaihongxinhe river huai h laosuihe river lao s xinsuihe river xin s xinbianhe river xin b and chihe river the chihe river flows into the huaihe river through the nüshan lake whereas the other rivers directly merge into the hongze lake daily runoff data for inflow into the hongze lake from 1960 2010 were obtained from the huaihe river commission of the ministry of water resources people s republic of china 3 methodology 3 1 theory and basic method of the copula function the copula function is defined as a multi variable distribution function with uniform margins at intervals of 0 1 nelsen 2007 based on sklarʹs theorem sklar 1959 copulas are capable of linking the joint cumulative distribution function cdf to its marginal distribution functions it can be expressed as 1 h x 1 x 2 x n c θ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n 2 c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n n c θ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where h is a joint distribution n is the number of marginal distribution f i x i represents the marginal distribution and cθ is the copula cdf with parameter θ c is the pdf of cθ we selected symmetric archimedean copulas clayton gumbel frank and joe copulas which are widely used in hydrological multivariate frequency analysis because of their simple function structure as the candidate functions luo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 maximum likelihood based methods mls were used for parameter estimation song et al 2012 hofert et al 2012 several common evaluation criteria were used to select the optimal copula functions such as the akaike information criterion aic the bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse genest et al 2009 the evaluation criteria are defined as follows 3 aic 2 k n l n 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 4 bic ln n k n l n 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p ei p i 2 where pei is the empirical frequency pi is the theoretical frequency k is the number of joint distribution function parameters and n is the number of samples 3 2 analysing the combination of total peak and volume for the entire flood process as a random hydrological event a flood event is generally composed of multiple elements such as the peak and volume which typically exhibit some correlation the design flood should be representative of the actual characteristics of the flood event consequently multivariate joint analysis is a significant aspect of design flood research 3 2 1 calculating the joint distribution of total peak and volume based on the copula function assuming that the qtotal and wtotal represent the total peak and volume of entire flood process respectively the corresponding design values are qtotal and wtotal and their marginal distributions are fqtotal qtotal and fwtotal wtotal respectively then the joint distribution of qtotal and wtotal can be expressed as 6 f q total w total c θ total f q total q total f w total w total where f qtotal wtotal is the joint distribution of qtotal and wtotal 3 2 2 determining the joint recurrence period of total peak and volume the or and kendall and survival kendall joint recurrence period definition methods are more commonly used in the multi variable joint recurrence period research de michele et al 2005 guo et al 2008 salvadori et al 2011 liu et al 2018 based on the joint distribution function of qtotal and wtotal the or joint recurrence period definition method was selected in this study for its simple structure and partial to safe according to the or joint recurrence period definition the occurrence recurrence period of qtotal and wtotal can be expressed as follows 7 e q total w total e q total q total e w total w total 8 p q total w total p q total q total w total w total 9 t q total w total 1 p q total w total 1 1 f q total w total where p is the occurrence probability of event e and t is the recurrence period of event e 3 2 3 deducing the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination based on the joint distribution function of qtotal and wtotal given a joint recurrence period there are infinite combinations of qtotal and wtotal that could meet the flood control standard however not all the combinations are consistent with the constitutional law of hydrological events only in a particular range are the combinations are reasonable moreover although some combinations are rational the occurrence probability is relatively small such as the combination of a large qtotal and a small wtotal or vice versa therefore it is necessary to deduct the confidence interval of the combinations under a known joint recurrence period volpi and fiori 2012 assuming that the joint recurrence period of qtotal and wtotal is z the wtotal can be described with qtotal based on the joint distribution function of qtotal and wtotal the derivation process is as follows 10 c θ total f q total q total f w total w total 1 1 z 11 f w total w total ξ f q total q total 1 1 z 12 w total f w total 1 f f q total q total 1 1 z where f w total 1 is the inverse function of wtotal and ξ is the function derived from eq 10 based on the concept of identical deformation accordingly the f qtotal wtotal as the pdf of the cdf f qtotal wtotal can be converted into a single valued continuous function of qtotal the hydrograph where the f qtotal wtotal changes with qtotal under the known recurrence period z can be drawn furthermore the area enclosed by the axis of the hydrograph and abscissa is s qtotal according to s qtotal f qtotal wtotal can be normalized to obtain a new density function φq qtotal the derivation process is as follows 13 f q total w total c f q total q total f w total w total f q total q total f w total w total 14 f q total w total c f q total q total ξ f q total q total 1 1 z f q total q total f w total f w total 1 ξ f q total q total 1 1 z 15 s q total 0 f q total w total d q total 16 s q total 0 c f q total q total ξ f q total q total 1 1 z f q total q total f w total f w total 1 ξ f q total q total 1 1 z d q total 17 φ q q total f q total w total s q total where c is the pdf related to the cdf cθtotal fqtotal qtotal fwtotal wtotal fqtotal qtotal and fwtotal wtotal are the pdf of the qtotal and wtotal respectively selecting the appropriate interval qup total qdown total makes the value of integral eq 17 can reach the confidence level α and the corresponding values of wup total and wdown total are calculated by the joint distribution function f qtotal wtotal accordingly finally the boundary points qup total wup total and qdown total wdown total are determined based on the condition that the joint return period is z and the confidence level is α it can be represented by the following mathematical expression q total up q total down φ q q total d q total 1 α 3 3 analysis of the flood volume allocation scheme the design flood regional composition is in essence a total flood volume allocation scheme if the total flood volume is constant an increase in the flood volume in some regions will lead to a decrease in the flood volume in other regions traditional methods for designing flood region composition typically summarize all possible flood combinations based on specific regional composition situations obviously these traditional methods lack a theoretical basis the calculation results often exhibit significant differences and errors are difficult to assess 3 3 1 clustering of rivers based on the runoff correlation analysis the flood process of large scale water carrying lakes is complicated runoff flows into the lake through multiple rivers and channels at the same time during the flood season however if the flood process of each river channel is considered separately it would not only ignore the natural hydrological and hydraulic connections between the rivers but also cause the problems related to excessively high dimensions of the joint distribution function such as inaccurate parameter estimation the poor fitting effect and strong tail dependence requena et al 2016 luo et al 2019 for this reason according to their geography the rivers entering the hongze lake were merged and clustered into sub region according to runoff correlation analysis using the person and spearman methods significantly the regional analysis method in this study is proposed based on river system structure of water carrying lakes and the distribution characteristics of the observing stations the object of this method is river compared with the usual regional analysis chebana and ouarda 2007 requena et al 2016 the statistical theoretical foundation of this method is weaker however the method is simple and convenient and it can take the geography factors and requirements of hydrodynamic model simulation into consideration 3 3 2 calculating the joint distribution of sub region flood volumes based on the copula function assuming that the wi represents the flood volume of each sub region flood process the corresponding design values are indicated by wi whose marginal distributions are fwi wi then the joint distribution of wi can be expressed as 18 f w 1 w 2 w n c θ w f w 1 w 1 f w 2 w 2 f w n w n where f w 1 w 2 wn is the joint distribution of wi and n is the number of sub regions 3 3 3 deducing the 95 confidence interval of the design flood regional composition once the total flood volume and the number of sub regions have been determined there are infinite regional flood allocation schemes however not all the schemes are consistent with the constitutional law of hydrological events chebana and ouarda 2011 salvadori et al 2011 moreover although some schemes are rational their probability of occurrence is relatively small such as the flood volume in the main runoff producing sub region only accounting for a small proportion of the total flood and the flood volume of the secondary runoff producing sub region representing a more significant proportion of the total flood thus to avoid obtaining extreme regional flood allocation schemes it is also necessary to determine the confidence interval of the design flood regional composition li et al 2014b according to the number of sub regions deducing the 95 confidence interval of the design flood regional composition should be performed for two cases that is for a total flood volume of wtotal case ① is the case with two sub regions whose w 1 and w 2 have the following relationship w 1 w 2 w total accordingly the f w 1 w 2 as the pdf of the cdf f qtotal wtotal can be converted into a single valued continuous function of w 1 and the hydrograph of f w 1 w 2 changing with w 1 can be drawn furthermore the area enclosed by the axis of the hydrograph and the abscissa is s w 1 according to s w 1 the f w 1 w 2 can be normalized to obtain a new density function φw w 1 the derivation process is as follows 19 f w 1 w 2 c f w 1 w 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z f w 1 w 1 f w 2 f w 2 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z 20 s w 1 w total 0 c f w 1 w 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z f w 1 w 1 f w 2 f w 2 1 ξ w total w 1 1 1 z d w 1 21 φ w w 1 f w 1 w 2 s w 1 where c is the pdf related to the cdf cθw fw 1 w 1 fw 2 w 2 and fw 1 w 1 and fw 2 w 2 are the pdf of the w 1 and w 2 respectively selecting the appropriate interval wup 1 wdown 1 makes the value of the integral eq 21 reaches the confidence level α and the corresponding values of wup 2 and wdown 2 are calculated accordingly finally the boundary points wup 1 wup 2 and wdown 1 wdown 2 are determined based on the condition that the confidence level is α it can be represented by the following mathematical expression w 1 up w 2 down φ w w 1 d w 1 1 α in case ② the number of sub regions is greater than two however volume of each sub region still has the following relationship 1 n w i w total although it is difficult to use the above mathematical expressions to describe the relationship between each sub region flood volume a large number of flood allocation schemes can still be randomly generated moreover the occurrence probability of each scheme can be deduced by the joint distribution function of wi consequently the confidence interval of the design flood regional composition can also be determined in practice 3 4 analyzing the reasonable range of each sub region flood peak the entire flood process of hongze lake is composed of the sub region flood processes and the total flood volume is equal to the sum of the sub region flood volumes however due to the difference in runoff propagation time the superposition of sub region flood peaks is not the total flood peak of hongze lake thus to make the characteristics of the flood process in each sub region keep harmony with the features of the entire flood process the reasonable range of each sub region flood peak should be determined using the above methods 3 4 1 drawing the confidence areas of the total flood peak and each sub region flood peaks assuming that the qi represents the flood peak of each sub region flood process respectively the corresponding design values are indicated by qi and their marginal distributions are indicated by fqi qi then the joint distribution of each qi and qtotal can be expressed as 22 f i q i q total c θ i f q i q i f q total q total where fi qi qtotal is the joint distribution of qi and qtotal i 1 2 3 n and n is the number of sub regions given an arbitrary joint return period t all the combinations of q i and qtotal can be described by a recurrence contour curve and the confidence interval with a confidence level of α can also be determined by setting t equal to one two three n years many confidence intervals can be obtained with a certain confidence level using the method described above moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area βi 3 4 2 drawing the confidence areas of each sub region flood peak and volume assuming that the wi represents the flood volume of each sub region flood process respectively the corresponding design values are represented by wi and their marginal distributions are represented by fwi wi then the joint distribution of each qi and wi can be expressed as 23 f i q i w i c θ i f q i q i f w i w i where fi q i wi is the joint distribution of qi and wi i 1 2 3 n and n is the number of sub regions given an arbitrary joint return period t all the combinations of q i and wi can be described by a recurrence contour curve and the confidence interval with a confidence level of α can also be determined by setting t equal to one two three n years the method can obtain many confidence intervals with a certain confidence level by the method described above naturally moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area γ i 3 4 3 estimating the reasonable interval of sub region flood peaks when the qtotal is known according to the joint distribution function of qi and qtotal the qi can be determined under any given joint return period t however not all qi values are within the scope of confidence area βi the interval of qi which in the range of confidence area βi can be expressed as q iup q total q idown q total when wi is known according to the joint distribution function of qi and wi the qi can be determined under any given joint return period t however not all qi values are within the scope of confidence area γ i the interval of qi which in the range of confidence area γ i can be expressed as q iup w i q idown w i in order to maintain the relationship between qtotal and wtotal and ensure that the sub region flood peak design is reasonable the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peak can be expressed as q iup q total q idown q total q iup w i q idown w i according to the presence of empty sets among the intersections the following steps can be divided into two cases case ① if there are no empty sets among all intersections there must be a group of sub region flood peaks which can ensure the relationship between qtotal and wtotal without being destroyed under the corresponding flood volume allocation scheme the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peak is then given by the intersections case ② if some intersections are empty sets there must be no group of sub region flood peaks which can ensure the relationship between qtotal and wtotal without being destroyed under the corresponding flood volume allocation scheme in this case the flood volume allocation scheme should be readjusted based on the interval eq 23 using the above methods section 3 3 the framework for determining the design flood control scheme for a water carrying lake as shown in fig 2 moreover a set of packages of the free software r version 3 5 1 were used in this study such as the copula package vinecopula package lmomco package corrplot package and fitdistrplus package so on 4 results 4 1 total peak and volume combination the design flood period is typically 15 days or 30 days for a large scale reservoir and typically three days or seven days for small and medium sized reservoirs mwrc 2006 the total storage capacity of hongze lake is 13 5 billion m3 therefore it should belong to the first level large scale reservoir therefore setting the design flood period of hongze lake is set to 30 days in this study accordingly the joint distributions which were constructed using the copula function are shown in table 1 and fig 3 the best fitting copula functions for the different joint distributions can be determined based on the evaluation criteria 4 1 1 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination taking a joint return period t of 100 years the contour map and the hydrograph of the change in φq qtotal with qtotal can be drawn the boundary points 253 million m3 13 025 m3 s and 263 million m3 13 025 m3 s are determined for a confidence level α of 0 05 the results are shown in fig 4 4 2 flood volume allocation scheme when the joint return period t is 100 years and the confidence level α is 0 05 the 30 day flood design volume range of hongze lake is 253 million m3 and 263 million m3 respectively 4 2 1 river clustering results as shown in fig 5 a and 5c the runoff correlations between the xi s river lao s river xu h river huai h river and xin b river are strong with most of the correlation coefficients greater than 0 7 according to the spearman test in contrast the runoff correlation between the chihe river and the other rivers is weak e g the correlation coefficient between the chihe river and the xin b river is 0 2 and 0 35 according to the spearman and pearson tests respectively the runoff correlation between the huaihe river and the other rivers is between 0 5 and 0 7 therefore considering their geographic information the xi s river lao s river xu h river huai h river and xin b river are merged into one virtual river and the runoff correlations between this virtual river chihe river and huaihe river are analysed again as there are no apparent runoff correlations between different rivers fig 5b and 5d the rivers entering the hongze lake are merged and clustered into three sub regions virtual river huaihe river and chihe river 4 2 2 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition according to the clustering analysis of rivers entering hongze lake the number of sub regions for design flood is greater than two therefore the 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition is determined using the method described in case ② taking the upper and lower boundary points of the 30 day design flood volume range of hongze lake 1 000 000 sets of flood volume allocation schemes are generated based on the joint distribution function of wi fig 6 a b shows the corresponding isosurface maps the 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition is determined for a confidence level α of 0 05 furthermore the three boundary points representing the maximum flood volume of each sub region are also obtained when the 30 day design flood volume of hongze lake is 263 million m3 the three boundary points are determined as follows boundary point 1 83 88 million m3 172 98 million m3 6 14 million m3 boundary point 2 2 40 million m3 260 44 million m3 0 18 million m3 boundary point 3 34 96 million m3 203 88 million m3 24 16 million m3 when the 30 day design flood volume of hongze lake is 253 million m3 the three boundary points are determined as follows boundary point 1 79 73 million m3 167 21 million m3 6 06 million m3 boundary point 2 2 71 million m3 250 10 million m3 0 20 million m3 boundary point 3 33 41 million m3 196 99 million m3 22 60 million m3 4 3 sub region flood peak reasonable intervals under the condition that the total flood peak and volume of hongze lake and the flood volume allocation scheme are known in order to further improve the credibility and reasonability of the design flood the flood peak reasonable intervals of each sub region should be estimated using the multiple joint distribution functions 4 3 1 confidence areas of the total flood peak and each sub region flood peaks for a confidence level α of 0 05 the 95 confidence intervals of the virtual flood peak and total flood peak are calculated for different joint return periods moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line as shown in fig 7 a the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area β 1 based on the corresponding joint distribution function the confidence areas β 2 and β 3 are obtained by using a similar approach as shown in fig 7c and 7e 4 3 2 the confidence areas of each sub region flood peak and volume for a confidence level α of 0 05 the 95 confidence intervals of the virtual flood peak and volume are calculated for different joint return periods moreover the upper boundary points of confidence intervals are connected to form the upper boundary line and the down boundary points of the confidence intervals are connected to form the lower boundary line as shown in fig 7b the area enclosed by the upper and lower boundaries is the confidence area γ 1 based on the corresponding joint distribution function the confidence areas γ 2 and γ 3 are obtained by using a similar approach as shown in fig 7d and 7f 4 3 3 reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks for a total flood volume of 263 million m3 the total flood peak 12 225 m3 s is plotted in fig 7a c and e and the intervals q12225m3 s 1up q12225m3 s 1down q12225m3 s 2up q12225m3 s 2down q12225m3 s 3up q12225m3 s 3down were determined as shown in fig 8 a c and e furthermore according to fig 7b d and f the reasonable intervals of each sub region flood peak are obtained as shown in fig 8b d and f as shown in fig 8a when the total peak of the hongze lake is 12 225 m3 s the flood peak of the virtual river should be between 3 100 m3 s and 6 073 m3 s moreover the interval 3 100 m3 s to 6 073 m3 s is plotted in fig 8b where the overlapping shaded area is the reasonable flood peak area of virtual river according to the fig 8b when the virtual river flood volume is 34 96 million m3 or 83 38 million m3 the corresponding reasonable intervals of the flood peak are 4 782 m3 s 6 073 m3 s or 3 100 m3 s 4 798 m3 s however if the virtual river flood volume is 3 88 million m3 a reasonable value of the flood peak does not exist in addition under the condition that the total flood peak and volume of hognze lake are 12 225 m3 s and 263 million m3 the minimum flood volume which is allocated to the virtual river is 20 85 million m3 similarly according to the fig 8d and 8f the minimum flood volumes which are allocated to the huaihe river and chihe river are 122 59 million m3 and 9 60 million m3 respectively with the constraint condition of each sub region minimum flood volume 1 000 000 sets of flood volume allocation schemes are generated again by repeating the previous steps the final flood volume allocation scheme is obtained similarly when the total flood volume is 253 million m3 the final flood volume allocation scheme is calculated out using the same methods the results are shown in table 2 5 discussion in order to verify the rationality of this method a typical year for the huaihe river basin was selected and the traditional design flood method was used to determine the designed floods with a return period of 100 years for hongze lake 5 1 selecting the typical flood processes during the period from 1949 2019 some catastrophic flood events occurred in the huaihe river basin in 1954 1991 2003 and 2007 these events especially those in 1991 2003 and 2007 were significant disasters for the surrounding areas of hongze lake consequently 1991 2003 and 2007 were selected as typical years the corresponding flood processes are shown in fig 9 5 2 checking the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination with traditional methods the p iii type curve is typically used for hydrologic frequency analysis in china because it fits very well to the frequency distribution of hydrological variables in practice huang et al 2002 for example the huaihe river commission of the ministry of water resources hrc used the p iii type curve to formulate flood control planning for the huaihe basin hrc 2009 the fitting results of the annual maximum flood peak and the 30 day flood volume for the hongze lake using the p iii type curve are shown in fig 10 the design values of the total flood peak and 30 day flood volume for a return period of 100 years in hongze lake are 13 007 54 m3 s and 260 13 million m3 respectively using the same multiple ratio amplifying method the entire designed flood process of hongze lake was calculated two categories of ratios were used in the same multiple ratio amplifying method the designed flood peak to typical year flood peak ratios peak ratios for short and the designed flood volume to typical year flood volume ratios volume ratios for short the corresponding results are shown in fig 11 a 11c and 11e and fig 11b 11d and 11f respectively the following three conclusions are drawn from fig 11 1 all the designed flood processes using the same multiple ratio amplifying methods are in the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume indicating that the design flood method based on the copula function is feasible 2 the range of 95 confidence intervals obtained using the volume ratios is narrower than that were obtained by the peak ratios compare with the flood volume the randomness of the flood peak is more significant 3 the designed flood processes using the same multiple ratio amplifying methods are all in the upper range of the 95 confidence intervals this means that traditional design methods tend to be safe however they can be appropriately optimized to control engineering costs consequently it is necessary to consider the correlations between the various characteristic elements of the flood process so that the designed flood can reflect the natural laws of hydrological events 5 3 comparing the 95 confidence area of the design flood regional composition with traditional methods on the basis of a total flood volume of 263 million m3 or 253 million m3 the designed flood region composition of hongze lake was calculated using the typical year method and the same frequency method the corresponding results are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively two cases were used for the same frequency method case ① among the virtual river huaihe river and chihe river only a single river had a flood return period of 100 years namely the single same frequency method fig 13a c and fig 13e g case ② among the virtual river huaihe river and chihe river there are two rivers had a flood return period of 100 years namely the double same frequency method fig 13d and 13 h the following four conclusions are drawn from figs 12 and 13 1 all design flood regional compositions for hongze lake calculated by the typical year method are in the 95 confidence areas of the design flood regional composition 2 all design flood region compositions for hongze lake calculated by the single same frequency method intersect with the corresponding 95 confidence areas of the design flood regional composition 3 all design flood regional compositions for hongze lake calculated by the double same frequency method are in the 95 confidence areas of the design flood regional composition expect the scheme that the return period for both virtual river and huaihe river is 100 years simultaneously 4 the scheme in which a return period of 100 years occurred in three rivers simultaneously is not in the 95 confidence areas of the design flood region composition according to the conclusions 1 and 2 it shows that the design flood regional composition based on the copula function is reasonable according to the conclusions 3 and 4 the total flood volume of hongze lake estimated by the joint distribution function is smaller than that estimated using traditional methods which is consistent with the previous research salvadori and de michele 2004 shi and song 2015 liu et al 2018 5 4 analyzing the rationality of the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks according to the flood volume allocation scheme results we used the same multiple ratio amplifying method to calculate the flood peak of each sub region three tests were conducted to verify the rationality of the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks table 3 according to table 3 the following two conclusions are drawn 1 the virtual river and huaihe river had passed the three tests for 1991 2003 and 2007 years 2 the chihe river only passed the three tests for 2003 years and did not pass the test 1 for 1991 and 2007 years which means that the design flood peak of the chihe river is not in the reasonable flood peak interval for 1991 and 2007 years however it is worth noting that the design flood peak of the chihe river did not deviate substantially from the reasonable flood peak interval the above conclusions indicate that it is feasible to use the multiple joint distribution function to determine the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peaks however error accumulation and propagation may influence the accuracy of flood peak interval estimation 6 conclusion the flood processes of large water carrying lakes have many flood sources moreover its flood regional composition typically complicated with the characteristics of flood processes differing in various sub regions due to factors such as geography and climate according to the flood process characteristics of large water carrying lakes the copula function was used to construct multiple joint distribution functions then a method was proposed that determines the confidence interval of each sub region flood process based on the entire flood process first the joint distribution function of the total flood peak and volume was used to deduce the 95 confidence interval of the total peak and volume combination second the 95 confidence interval of the design flood regional composition was determined by the joint distribution function of the sub region flood volume third the reasonable interval of the sub region flood peak was estimated through the multiple joint distribution functions used in conjunction with each other through trial and error the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 for a given joint recurrence period for the entire flood process of the lake system there are infinite combinations of flood peaks and volumes that could meet the flood control standards however not all the combinations are consistent with the constitutional law of hydrological events the confidence interval must be determined to ensure that the selected combinations are reasonable 2 if the flood volume of the entire flood process is designed there are similarity problems in deducing the design flood regional composition that is the combinations are only reasonable in a particular range employing a clustering method based on runoff correlation analysis with a methodology that identifies the boundary for multivariate combinations can solve these problems 3 furthermore when the total flood allocation scheme has been determined it is impossible to construct the confidence interval of each sub region flood peak however a reasonable range of each sub region flood peak can be determine by the multiple joint distribution functions which be used in conjunction with each other through trial and error 4 the proposed method for determining the design flood for water carrying lakes is feasible and can effectively avoid the randomness and uncertainty of the traditional methods this research can expand the applicability of multi variable flood frequency analysis techniques however the following improvements should be made in future research 1 as error accumulation and propagation and sampling uncertainty may influence the estimation of the designed flood an uncertainty analysis of design floods should be considered in the future studies yin et al 2018b 2 only three sub regions were determined for hongze lake however other large water carrying lakes may have more sub regions which would cause difficulties due to the large amount of calculation 3 the or joint recurrence period definition method was selected in this study however the other types of return period should be considered especially the structural load return period liu et al 2018 4 traditional flood design methods were used for comparison and verification in this study however the designed flood results should be tested using a hydrological and hydrodynamic model in a future work 5 global warming involves complex feedbacks between climate and human activity which changes the environment of floods development in different periods yin et al 2018c jiang et al 2019 this has caused the hydrological sequence to exhibit different trends or increasing variations furthermore the flood regional composition of water carrying lakes is complex additionally as the geographical and climatic conditions vary between sub regions the flood characteristics of each sub region will differ therefore the study of non stationary flood design under changing environments is highly significant for lake scientific management credit authorship contribution statement yun luo conceptualization formal analysis investigation methdology visualization writing original draft zengchuan
