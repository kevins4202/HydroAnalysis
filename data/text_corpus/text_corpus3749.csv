18745,the alternative disinfectant chloramine can lower the formation of carbonaceous dbps c dbps but promote the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic in this study the combination of thermally activated persulfate pre oxidation and post chloramination ta ps nh2cl was proposed to control the formation and reduce the toxicity of both c dbps and n dbps the formation speciation and toxicity of trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloaldehydes haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and haloacetamides collectively defined as cx3r type dbps under ta ps nh2cl process were compared with processes of chlorination alone cl2 chloramination alone nh2cl and coupled thermally activated persulfate pre oxidation with post chlorination ta ps cl2 results showed that chloramination could reduce formation of c dbps and total organic halogen tox while increase n dbp formation and the introduction of ta ps pretreatment process slightly increased the formation of c dbps and tox but sharply reduced the formation of n dbps with higher toxicity as well as brominated cx3r type dbps that are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues by comprehensive toxicity calculation an outright decline of both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risk of cx3r type dbps was observed during ta ps nh2cl process compared with cl2 nh2cl and ta ps cl2 processes in summary ta ps nh2cl process was a potential effective method for integrally controlling the formation of cx3r type dbps and their toxicity and is suggested to be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide considering bromate caused by ta ps pre oxidation the study may provide a feasible and economical method for dbp control on the background of global warming graphical abstract

drinking water was a major public health triumph of the 20th century richardson 2003 as it can effectively reduce the microbial risk of drinking water by deactivating water borne pathogens sedlak and von gunten 2011 however the reaction between disinfectants and the natural organic matter nom anthropogenic contaminants or halide ions in the source water will produce unintended and undesirable disinfection by products dbps richardson et al 2007 which are associated with unfavorable health effects including cancer induction and adverse pregnancy outcomes plewa and wagner 2015 since 1974 when chloroform cf was discovered bellar et al 1974 and 1979 when united states environmental protection agency epa regulated trihalomethanes thms in drinking water the control of dbps has become a focus and over 700 dbps have been identified so far richardson 2005 richardson et al 2007 onstad et al 2008 pan et al 2016 han et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a dbps can be generally divided into carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as the most prevalent thms haloacetic acids haas and haloaldehydes hals and nitrogenous dbps n dbps typically including haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetamides hams these dbps were identified as cx3r type dbps x h cl br or i due to their similar molecular structure hou et al 2018 yao et al 2018 ding et al 2019 the molecular structures of cx3r type dbps are listed in table s1 toxicological studies showed that the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of n dbps were higher than those of c dbps muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008b and their precursors were increasing in source water due to increase in algal blooms and wastewater discharge shah and mitch 2012 integrally controlling these carbonaceous and nitrogenous cx3r type dbps has become an important topic in guaranteeing the safety of drinking water to minimize the formation of regulated c dbps chloramination was selected to replace chlorination as studies found that typical c dbps such as thms and haas were presented at lower concentrations during chloramination than those during chlorination a study found that treatment works that used chloramination could generally meet the european thm regulatory limit of 100 μg l while it was significantly more difficult when chlorine was used goslan et al 2009 however chloramination could promote the formation of n dbps as chloramine could serve as a nitrogen source for the formation of n dbps yang et al 2010 shah and mitch 2012 chu et al 2016d therefore methods of suppressing the formation of n dbps when chloramination is used to decrease the c dbp formation need to be explored advanced oxidation processes aops have developed a lot in water treatment comninellis et al 2008 sirés et al 2014 loeb et al 2018 and studies found that aops can be used as a pretreatment method to effectively control the formation of n dbps such as hans hams and hnms chu et al 2015 xie et al 2015 because the precursors of n dbps can be destroyed by strongly oxidizing free hydroxyl radicals ho or sulfate radicals so4 buxton et al 1988 andreozzi et al 1999 tan et al 2013 kordkandi and forouzesh 2014 however it has been also reported that both ho and so4 can oxidize organic precursors from high molecular weight mw organics to low mw organics shaw et al 2000 hammes et al 2006 xie et al 2013 resulting in the formation of more thms during subsequent chlorination dotson et al 2010 xie et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to assess the generation of c dbps and n dbps when aop is conducted before chlor am ination so4 has a higher oxidation potential than ho and it is more selective in the oxidation of organic pollutants and can achieve better mineralization anipsitakis et al 2006 criquet and leitner 2009 so4 can be formed when persulfate ps is activated through heating tan et al 2013 deng et al 2013 kordkandi and forouzesh 2014 ps oxidation at atmospheric temperature is usually not effective but increasing the temperature could largely increase the production rate of so4 resulting in an increase in the reaction rate with organic matter huang et al 2002 as previously reported the water temperature was relatively high 40 c during the summer in many tropical and subtropical areas as the water temperature tends to coincide with the regional air temperature livingstone and lotter 1998 schneider and j hook 2010 chu et al 2016a moreover considering that the temperature in summer will become higher under the background of global warming the energy consumption required for thermally activated pretreatment will decrease in the future therefore it was inspired that thermally activated ps ta ps worked as a feasible pretreatment method for water disinfection as it can degrade the precursors of cx3r type dbps as mentioned above so4 may reduce the formation of n dbps but increase the formation of c dbps during subsequent chlorination and chloramination reduces c dbps while increasing the formation of n dbps therefore it could be possible to integrally control these carbonaceous and nitrogenous cx3r type dbps by coupling thermally activated ps pre oxidation with post chloramination the objective of this study was to investigate the integral control of the formation speciation and toxicity of cx3r type dbps thms haas hals hans hnms and hams by comparing the combination of thermally activated ps pre oxidation and post chloramination abbreviated as ta ps nh2cl chlorination alone abbreviated as cl2 chloramination alone abbreviated as nh2cl and the combination of thermally activated ps pre oxidation and post chlorination abbreviated as ta ps cl2 the results in this study are important for optimizing the design of aops based on so4 and disinfection process where precursors for

billerica usa the chlorine solution was prepared by diluting a sodium hypochlorite solution 6 with ultrapure water preformed monochloramine solutions were freshly prepared by slowly adding sodium hypochlorite to a chilled ammonium chloride solution at a hypochlorite to ammonia molar ratio of at least 1 1 3 mitch and sedlak 2002 the concentrations of disinfectant solutions were standardized daily prior to use with a residual chlorine comparator hach pocket colorimeter tm usa all the glassware was soaked with a 10 nitric acid solution rinsed with ultrapure water and finally dried in an oven at 105 c 2 1 2 water sample raw water was collected from the intake of a typical chinese drinking water treatment plant the source water of which was a typical reservoir located in southern china the collected raw water was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter millipore usa to meet the required practical water characteristics before disinfection and then stored at 4 c for less than 3 days until use the water quality characteristics of the raw water included in this study are listed in table s3 the raw water contained 103 μg l 1 3 μm bromide which is an important factor that affects the formation of dbps fabbricino and korshin 2009 wang et al 2018 therefore the formation of brominated cx3r type dbps under the four different processes was also investigated 2 2 experimental procedure the raw water was filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane and then distributed into eight 40 ml amber glass volumetric bottles which were noted as group 1 g1 2 g2 3 g3 and 4 g4 respectively with each group having duplicate bottles g1 and g2 were treated with cl2 and ta ps cl2 while g3 and g4 were treated with nh2cl and ta ps nh2cl respectively to prevent hydrolysis during the experiments the water ph was adjusted to 6 5 0 2 using 2 mm phosphate buffer 2 2 1 ta ps process during the ta ps process 0 05 mm ps was first added into g2 and g4 which were then heated in a water bath at 55 c for 180 min the high temperature was used to activate the ps and produce oxidizing so4 the 0 05 mm ps dosage and 180 min contact time were the optimal conditions verified by our previous study chu et al 2016a 2 2 2 chlor am ination after g2 and g4 were treated by the ta ps process 24 h chlor am ination tests were conducted for all the four groups under headspace free dark conditions in a temperature

japan total organic halogen tox were measured with a tox analyzer multi x 2500 analytic jena germany detailed information on the analytical methods of these dbps and tox were presented elsewhere chu et al 2010 2015 hou et al 2018 ding et al 2018 and are also summarized in the supplementary material and table s4 2 4 bromine substitution the bromine incorporation factor bif indicates the incorporation of bromine ion into organics in this study it was introduced to compare the speciation of brominated cx3r type dbps under four different processes the bif has been used by many researchers to evaluate the bromine substitution of dbps heller grossman et al 1993 hua and reckhow 2012 chu et al 2013 2014 hong et al 2017 li et al 2017 fang et al 2018 petronijević et al 2019 the

presents the formation of typical c dbps thms haas and hals during the cl2 ta ps cl2 nh2cl and ta ps nh2cl processes respectively the higher formation of chlorinated c dbps than brominated c dbps under the four different processes as shown in fig 1 a c can be explained by the application of the chlorine containing disinfectant and low level of bromide in this study hypochlorous acid hclo the crucial component during disinfection oxidized the bromide originally existing in the water sample to form hypobromous acid hbro which then acted in the same manner as hclo and reacted with dom to form brominated dbps nokes et al 1999 farkas et al 2002 although the reaction of hbro with dom was faster than that of hclo with dom zhu and zhang 2016 fewer brominated c dbps were formed than chlorinated c dbps which might be due to relatively low concentration of bromide in this study chlorine containing disinfectant was used resulting in large amount of chlorine existing in the system the dosages of chlorine and chloramine were 20 43 mg l and 10 05 mg l respectively while the bromide was only 103 μg l therefore the formed dbps were largely chlorinated in this study more attention should be paid to the brominated c dbps however as they are much more cytotoxic and genotoxic than chlorinated c dbps richardson et al 2007 the specific brominated dbp speciation under the four different processes will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 among the investigated c dbps the formation of thms was the highest followed by haas and then hals this again demonstrates that thms were the largest class of c dbps while haas and hals ranked the second and third class respectively krasner et al 1989 2006 as shown in fig 1 chlorination produced more chlorinated and brominated thms haas and hals than chloramination which could be explained by the lower oxidative ability of chloramine than that of chlorine this result is consistent with previous studies in which fewer c dbps were found during chloramination diehl et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 goslan et al 2009 when ta ps pretreatment was introduced the formation of chlorinated c dbps slightly increased during the subsequent chlor am ination disinfection during ta ps cl2 process and ta ps nh2cl process chlorinated thms haas and hals increased by 22 4 and 5 respectively during subsequent chlorination and increased by 27 27 and 23 respectively during subsequent chloramination this was likely due to the strongly oxidative so4 produced by the ta ps process which can transform macromolecules into micromolecules that are more easily substituted to form halogenated organics a previous study on thm control found that the toc after pre oxidation was higher than before pre oxidation almost for all fractions but toc with molecular weight over 5000 which was attributed to the transformation of high molecular weight humic and fulvic materials into lower molecular weight materials rice 1980 another study proposed that so4 might degrade tyrosine as one of thm precursors into certain intermediates which were more readily chlorinated to form cf chu et al 2016b the increase in the formation of chlorinated c dbps during the ta ps nh2cl process was smaller than that from the ta ps cl2 process which can be attributed to the weaker oxidative ability of chloramine therefore they are less easily substituted to form organic compounds in comparison of the four processes the ta ps cl2 process formed the most c dbps while the least c dbps were formed during the nh2cl process the ta ps process caused a slight increase in the formation of c dbps during the subsequent chlor am ination process therefore it can be concluded that the nh2cl process can better control c dbps than the cl2 process and the ta ps nh2cl process will contribute to a slight but not significant increase in c dbps 3 2 nitrogenous dbp formation under four different processes fig 2 presents the formation of typical n dbps hans hnms and hams under the cl2 ta ps cl2 nh2cl and ta ps nh2cl processes as was the same case for c dbps fig 2 a c showed that fewer brominated n dbps were formed than chlorinated n dbps under the four different processes fig 2 a c also showed that no matter which type of disinfection the formation of n dbps was as follows hans hnms hams the different concentrations of n dbps could be explained by the different formation potential fp of n dbps for the same precursors a previous study found that most amino acids have a higher han fp than hnm fp according to the chlorination of 20 basic amino acids and han formation was highest from asparaginate wang et al 2006 this is in agreement with the results of our study as shown in fig 2 chloramination produced more chlorinated and brominated n dbps than chlorination with or without ta ps pretreatment and the concentrations of total hans ttan total hnms thnm and total hams tham formed during nh2cl process was almost twice as many as those formed during cl2 process although chlorine has a stronger oxidative ability chloramine may be a source of nitrogen to form n dbps chu et al 2016d yang et al 2012 which could be the reason for the higher amount of n dbps observed during the nh2cl process than the cl2 process fig 2 also presented that with the ta ps pretreatment the formation of n dbps during the subsequent chlor am ination disinfection reduced by 75 95 and the concentrations of some brominated dbps even decreased to below the detection limit it has been demonstrated that the chemical oxidation of organic matter can increase hydrophilicity and convert organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen xie et al 2015 the sharp decrease in n dbp formation caused by ta ps pre oxidation may be attributable to changes in structures of nitrogenous precursors chu et al 2014 2015 2016b taking tcan as an example the combined tyrosine transformed into tcan via the peptide bonds nitrogenous functional groups and so4 produced during the ta ps process could oxidize peptide bonds of the combined tyrosine so ta ps pretreatment prevented the formation of tcan chu et al 2016b therefore it can be concluded that the introduction of the ta ps process is an effective method for controlling the formation of n dbps and the level of n dbp formation during the ta ps cl2 process and the ta ps nh2cl process were almost the same 3 3 tox value under four different processes tox was introduced to measure the total halogenated organic compounds formed during disinfection as chlor am ination disinfection could form dbps other than the investigated cx3r dbps fig 3 shows the tox value under the four different processes regardless of whether ta ps pretreatment was conducted the tox value during chlorination was two to three times higher than that during chloramination this is clearly because that the chlorine dosage added in the experiment during chlorination is higher than that during chloramination and the oxidizing ability of chlorine is also significantly stronger than chloramine deborde and von gunten 2008 fig 3 also presented that the ta ps pretreatment resulted in obvious increase in tox concentration during chlorination but not for that during chloramination the tox values increased by 42 from cl2 process to ta ps cl2 process and by 22 from nh2cl process to ta ps nh2cl process respectively as known dbps were formed by reactions between disinfectants e g chlorine or chloramine and nom generally nom in water samples can be divided into two classes stubborn nom and flexible nom which referred to nom that is weakly reactive and the strongly reactive with disinfectants respectively the reactivity of nom may relate to the complexity of structure and the size of mw and generally the more complex structure and the higher mw of nom the weaker reactive now is chang et al 2000 2001 ribau teixeira et al 2011 zhang et al 2018b it is so difficult for stubborn nom to react with disinfectants to form tox compounds but flexible nom can react with disinfectants flexibly with the introduction of ta ps pretreatment the strongly oxidative so4 destroyed the persistent refractory or macromolecular nom which means that it oxidized a part of stubborn nom into flexible nom resulting in a higher tox value particularly in the ta ps cl2 process fig 3 the ta ps pretreatment process led to a slight increase in the tox concentration during the subsequent chloramination which can be explained by the weaker oxidizing ability of chloramine in summary the concentration of formed tox was lower during chloramination than that during chlorination and the introduction of ta ps pretreatment resulted in a clear increase in tox formation during chlorination and an inconspicuous increase during chloramination this suggests that ta ps nh2cl process is effective and feasible for integrally controlling cx3r type dbps from the aspect of tox 3 4 brominated cx3r type dbp speciation under four different processes the bif and buf values of cx3r type dbps under four different processes are presented in fig 4 the yields of hnms were below the detection limit and are therefore excluded fig 4a showed that the nh2cl process significantly decreased the bif values of all c dbps the bif values of thms haas and hals 0 29 0 08 and 0 03 formed during the nh2cl process were much lower than that 0 47 0 12 and 0 20 formed during the cl2 process among the three types of c dbps the bif value of thms was much higher than that of the others indicating that bromine incorporated into the thms more easily than it did into the others which can be proved by the higher buf value of thms in fig 4b this could be related to different propensities of different classes of dbp precursors to bromine substitution hua et al 2006 hong et al 2017 this result is consistent with higher bromine substitution into cf than tcaa reported in a previous study hua and reckhow 2012 unlike c dbps the bif values of n dbps especially hams were higher during the nh2cl process than those during the cl2 process bond et al 2015 found that chloramines raised bromine substitution into hans and hams which is in accordance with the result above in this study the above results indicate that chloramine disinfection formed brominated n dbps more easily but chlorine disinfection more easily generated brominated c dbps furthermore the higher buf values of c dbps during chlorine disinfection and higher buf values of n dbps during chloramine disinfection respectively fig 4b verified this assumption with the ta ps pretreatment process the bif values for almost all investigated cx3r type dbps exhibited a clear decreasing trend during the subsequent disinfection as shown in fig 4a with the ta ps pretreatment process the bif of hans and hams during the cl2 process and that of all five cx3r type dbps excluding thms during the nh2cl process decreased to 0 indicating that there was no formation of corresponding brominated dbps this suggests that the ta ps pretreatment process can effectively control the formation of brominated dbps fig 4b showed that the buf value of cx3r type dbps excluding thms and hals decreased when ta ps pretreatment process was introduced to further understand the possible reason for this difference the bromide concentration before and after ta ps pretreatment process was measured and was found to decrease to 67 μg l from the initial 103 μg l after the ta ps pretreatment process this indicates that the so4 produced by ta ps pre oxidation oxidized bromide into bromate and less bromide was utilized to form brominated cx3r type dbps fang and shang 2012 chu et al 2016b bromate was measured in the water samples after the ta ps pretreatment data not shown which can indirectly validate this hypothesis however bromate caused by ta ps pretreatment is a potential carcinogen kurokawa et al 1990 notably the bromide concentrations in source waters in the united states and canada range from 24 to 1120 μg l with a median concentration of 100 μg l in which case bromate would beyond the guideline of 10 μg l if ta ps pretreatment is applied pan and zhang 2013 usepa 2006 therefore it is suggested that ta ps pretreatment should be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide the lowest formation of brominated cx3r type dbps during the ta ps nh2cl process indicates that the combination of ta ps pre oxidation and chloramination can effectively control the formation of brominated cx3r type dbps 3 5 comprehensive toxicity of cx3r type dbps under four different processes a comprehensive toxicity assessment for all the investigated cx3r type dbps formed under the four different processes is necessary as toxicity is directly related to human health therefore a cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti are used to evaluate the synthetic toxicity of several dbp species the cti and gti calculation equations have been proposed modified and applied in previous studies plewa et al 2008a 2008b chu et al 2016c zhang et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 yao et al 2018 hu et al 2018 and are shown below in equations 15 and 16 15 cti 1 c 1 2 c x 16 gti 1 genotoxic potency x c x where c1 2 is the concentration of each dbp that induced a cell density of 50 cx is the molar concentration of each dbp m and the genotoxic potency x was defined elsewhere plewa et al 2008b the c1 2 and the genotoxic potency of the investigated cx3r type dbps m 1 and bromate is presented in table s5 cti and gti values under the four processes are shown in fig 5 both the cti and gti are higher during chloramination than those during chlorination which can be explained by the higher formation of n dbps with higher toxicities during chloramination fig 2 the ta ps pre treatment process sharply decreased the cti and gti values during both chlorination and chloramination the cti values were 95 and 99 lower during the ta ps cl2 and ta ps nh2cl processes than those during the cl2 and nh2cl processes this indicates that ta ps pretreatment is helpful to control the toxicity of dbps formed during the subsequent chlor am ination by comparing the toxicity values of the four processes the highest toxicity occurred during chloramination and the lowest toxicity was observed during the ta ps nh2cl process fig s1 briefly compares the total cti and gti of cx3r type dbps plus bromate under the four processes it can be observed that the ta ps pre oxidation decreased the total toxicity even though the toxicity of bromate was also considered and the lowest total toxicity was still observed during the ta ps nh2cl process however a synergistic effect between bromate and organic halo dbps was found to substantially enhance the toxicity of bromate containing water increasing the uncertainty of toxicity han and zhang 2018 therefore it is hard to judge the total toxicity change caused by the ta ps pre oxidation especially for water containing high levels of bromide it is again suggested that ta ps nh2cl process should be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide in which case least toxicity is undoubtedly achieved 4 conclusions the introduction of ta ps pretreatment greatly decreased the formation of n dbps which were more toxic while slightly increased the formation of c dbps and tox during subsequent chloramination the lowest formation of brominated cx3r type dbps was observed during the ta ps nh2cl process indicating that this process can effectively control the formation of brominated dbps with higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogues the less formation of brominated cx3r type dbps was attributed to oxidation of bromide into bromate by ta ps pre oxidation and less bromide was then utilized according to the comprehensive toxicity calculation a clear decrease in both the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risk of cx3r type dbps can be observed during the ta ps nh2cl process compared with cl2 nh2cl and ta ps cl2 processes this study indicates that coupling thermally activated ps pre oxidation and post chloramination is a potentially effective method for integrally controlling carbonaceous and nitrogenous cx3r type dbps and is suggested to be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide considering bromate caused by ta ps pre oxidation the results are significant in terms of dbp control on the background of global warming declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

18745,the alternative disinfectant chloramine can lower the formation of carbonaceous dbps c dbps but promote the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic in this

formation speciation and toxicity of trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloaldehydes haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and haloacetamides collectively defined as cx3r type dbps under ta ps nh2cl process were compared with processes of chlorination alone cl2 chloramination alone nh2cl and coupled thermally activated persulfate pre oxidation with post chlorination ta ps cl2 results showed that chloramination could reduce formation of c dbps and total organic halogen tox while increase n dbp formation and the introduction of ta ps pretreatment process slightly increased the formation of c

dbps c dbps such as the most prevalent thms haloacetic acids haas and haloaldehydes hals and nitrogenous dbps n dbps typically including haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetamides hams these dbps were identified as cx3r type dbps x h cl br or i due to their similar molecular structure hou et al 2018 yao et al 2018 ding et al 2019 the molecular structures of cx3r type dbps are listed in table s1 toxicological studies showed that the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of n dbps were higher than those of c dbps muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008b and their precursors were increasing in source water due to increase in algal blooms and wastewater discharge shah and mitch 2012 integrally controlling these carbonaceous and nitrogenous cx3r type dbps has become an important topic in guaranteeing the safety of drinking water to minimize the formation of regulated c dbps chloramination was selected to replace chlorination as studies found that typical c dbps such as thms and haas were presented at lower concentrations during chloramination than those during chlorination a study found that treatment works that used chloramination could generally meet the european thm regulatory limit of 100 μg l while it was significantly more difficult when chlorine was used goslan et al 2009 however chloramination could promote the formation of n dbps as chloramine could serve as a nitrogen source for the formation of n dbps yang et al 2010 shah and mitch 2012 chu et al 2016d therefore methods of suppressing the formation of n dbps when chloramination is used to decrease the c dbp formation need to be explored advanced oxidation processes aops have developed a lot in water treatment comninellis et al 2008 sirés et al 2014 loeb et al 2018 and studies found that aops can be used as a pretreatment method to effectively control the formation of n dbps such as hans hams and hnms chu et al 2015 xie et al 2015 because the precursors of n dbps can be destroyed by strongly oxidizing free hydroxyl radicals ho or sulfate radicals so4 buxton et al 1988 andreozzi et al 1999 tan et al 2013 kordkandi and forouzesh 2014 however it has been also reported that both ho and so4 can oxidize organic precursors from high molecular weight mw organics to low mw organics shaw et al 2000 hammes et al 2006 xie et al 2013 resulting in the formation of more thms during subsequent chlorination dotson et al 2010 xie et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to assess the generation of c dbps and n dbps when aop is conducted before chlor am ination so4 has a higher oxidation potential than ho and it is more selective in the oxidation of organic pollutants and can achieve better mineralization anipsitakis et al 2006 criquet and leitner 2009 so4 can be formed when persulfate ps is activated through heating tan et al 2013 deng et al 2013 kordkandi and forouzesh 2014 ps oxidation at atmospheric temperature is usually not effective but increasing the temperature could largely increase the production rate of so4 resulting in an increase in the reaction rate with organic matter huang et al 2002 as previously reported the water temperature was relatively high 40 c during the summer in many tropical and subtropical areas as the water temperature tends to coincide with the regional air temperature livingstone and lotter 1998 schneider and j hook 2010 chu et al 2016a moreover considering that the temperature in summer will become higher under the background of global warming the energy consumption required for thermally activated pretreatment will decrease in the future therefore it was inspired that thermally activated ps ta ps worked as a feasible pretreatment method for water disinfection as it can degrade the precursors of cx3r type dbps as mentioned above so4 may reduce the formation of n dbps but increase the formation of c dbps during subsequent chlorination and chloramination reduces c dbps while increasing the formation of n dbps therefore it could be possible to integrally control these carbonaceous and nitrogenous cx3r type dbps by coupling thermally activated ps pre oxidation with post chloramination the objective of this study was to investigate the integral control of the formation speciation and toxicity of cx3r type dbps thms haas hals hans hnms and hams by comparing the combination of thermally activated ps pre oxidation and post chloramination abbreviated as ta ps nh2cl chlorination alone abbreviated as cl2 chloramination alone abbreviated as nh2cl and the combination of thermally activated ps pre oxidation and post chlorination abbreviated as ta ps cl2 the results in this study are important for optimizing the design of aops based on so4 and disinfection process where precursors for cx3r type dbp formation are prevalent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 chemicals three prevalent chlorine and bromine substitutes of c dbps thms haas and hals in drinking water were

billerica usa the chlorine solution was prepared by diluting a sodium hypochlorite solution 6 with ultrapure water preformed monochloramine solutions were freshly prepared by slowly adding sodium hypochlorite to a chilled ammonium chloride solution at a hypochlorite to ammonia molar ratio of at least 1 1 3 mitch and sedlak 2002 the concentrations of disinfectant solutions were standardized daily prior to use with a residual chlorine comparator hach pocket colorimeter tm usa all the glassware was soaked with a 10 nitric acid solution rinsed with ultrapure water and finally dried in an oven at 105 c 2 1 2 water sample raw water was collected from the intake of a typical chinese drinking water treatment plant the source water of which was a typical reservoir located in southern china the collected raw water was filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter millipore usa to meet the required practical water characteristics before disinfection and then stored at 4 c for less than 3 days until use the water quality characteristics of the raw water included in this study are listed in table s3 the raw water contained 103 μg l 1 3 μm bromide which is an important factor that affects the formation of dbps fabbricino and korshin 2009 wang et al 2018 therefore the formation of brominated cx3r type dbps under the four different processes was also investigated 2 2 experimental procedure the raw water was filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane and then distributed into eight 40 ml amber glass volumetric bottles which were noted as group 1 g1 2 g2 3 g3 and 4 g4 respectively with each group having duplicate bottles g1 and g2 were treated with cl2 and ta ps cl2 while g3 and g4 were treated with nh2cl and ta ps nh2cl respectively to prevent hydrolysis during the experiments the water ph was adjusted to 6 5 0 2 using 2 mm phosphate buffer 2 2 1 ta ps process during the ta ps process 0 05 mm ps was first added into g2 and g4 which were then heated in a water bath at 55 c for 180 min the high temperature was used to activate the ps and produce oxidizing so4 the 0 05 mm ps dosage and 180 min contact time were the optimal conditions verified by our previous study chu et al 2016a 2 2 2 chlor am ination after g2 and g4 were treated by the ta ps process 24 h chlor am ination tests were conducted for all the four groups under headspace free dark conditions in a temperature

japan total organic halogen tox were measured with a tox analyzer multi x 2500 analytic jena germany detailed information on the analytical methods of these dbps and tox were presented elsewhere chu et al 2010 2015 hou et al 2018 ding et al 2018 and are also summarized in the supplementary material and table s4 2 4 bromine substitution the bromine incorporation factor bif indicates the incorporation of bromine ion into organics in this study it was introduced to compare the speciation of brominated cx3r type dbps under four different processes the bif has been used by many researchers to evaluate the bromine substitution of dbps heller grossman et al 1993 hua and reckhow 2012 chu et al 2013 2014 hong et al 2017 li et al 2017 fang et al 2018 petronijević et al 2019 the

presents the formation of typical c dbps thms haas and hals during the cl2 ta ps cl2 nh2cl and ta ps nh2cl processes respectively the higher formation of chlorinated c dbps than brominated c dbps under the four different processes as shown in fig 1 a c can be explained by the application of the chlorine containing disinfectant and low level of bromide in this study hypochlorous acid hclo the crucial component during disinfection oxidized the bromide originally existing in the water sample to form hypobromous acid hbro which then acted in the same manner as hclo and reacted with dom to form brominated dbps nokes et al 1999 farkas et al 2002 although the reaction of hbro with dom was faster than that of hclo with dom zhu and zhang 2016 fewer brominated c dbps were formed than chlorinated c dbps which might be due to relatively low concentration of bromide in this study chlorine containing disinfectant was used resulting in large amount of chlorine existing in the system the dosages of chlorine and chloramine were 20 43 mg l and 10 05 mg l respectively while the bromide was only 103 μg l therefore the formed dbps were largely chlorinated in this study more attention should be paid to the brominated c dbps however as they are much more cytotoxic and genotoxic than chlorinated c dbps richardson et al 2007 the specific brominated dbp speciation under the four different processes will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 among the investigated c dbps the formation of thms was the highest followed by haas and then hals this again demonstrates that thms were the largest class of c dbps while haas and hals ranked the second and third class respectively krasner et al 1989 2006 as shown in fig 1 chlorination produced more chlorinated and brominated thms haas and hals than chloramination which could be explained by the lower oxidative ability of chloramine than that of chlorine this result is consistent with previous studies in which fewer c dbps were found during chloramination diehl et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 goslan et al 2009 when ta ps pretreatment was introduced the formation of chlorinated c dbps slightly increased during the subsequent chlor am ination disinfection during ta ps cl2 process and ta ps nh2cl process chlorinated thms haas and hals increased by 22 4 and 5 respectively during subsequent chlorination and increased by 27 27 and 23 respectively during subsequent chloramination this was likely due to the strongly oxidative so4 produced by the ta ps process which can transform macromolecules into micromolecules that are more easily substituted to form halogenated organics a previous study on thm control found that the toc after pre oxidation was higher than before pre oxidation almost for all fractions but toc with molecular weight over 5000 which was attributed to the transformation of high molecular weight humic and fulvic materials into lower molecular weight materials rice 1980 another study proposed that so4 might degrade tyrosine as one of thm precursors into certain intermediates which were more readily chlorinated to form cf chu et al 2016b the increase in the formation of chlorinated c dbps during the ta ps nh2cl process was smaller than that from the ta ps cl2 process which can be attributed to the weaker oxidative ability of chloramine therefore they are less easily substituted to form organic compounds in comparison of the four processes the ta ps cl2 process formed the most c dbps while the least c dbps were formed during the nh2cl process the ta ps process caused a slight increase in the formation of c dbps during the subsequent chlor am ination process therefore it can be concluded that the nh2cl process can better control c dbps than the cl2 process and the ta ps nh2cl process will contribute to a slight but not significant increase in c dbps 3 2 nitrogenous dbp formation under four different processes fig 2 presents the formation of typical n dbps hans hnms and hams under the cl2 ta ps cl2 nh2cl and ta ps nh2cl processes as was the same case for c dbps fig 2 a c showed that fewer brominated n dbps were formed than chlorinated n dbps under the four different processes fig 2 a c also showed that no matter which type of disinfection the formation of n dbps was as follows hans hnms hams the different concentrations of n dbps could be explained by the different formation potential fp of n dbps for the same precursors a previous study found that most amino acids have a higher han fp than hnm fp according to the chlorination of 20 basic amino acids and han formation was highest from asparaginate wang et al 2006 this is in agreement with the results of our study as shown in fig 2 chloramination produced more chlorinated and brominated n dbps than chlorination with or without ta ps pretreatment and the concentrations of total hans ttan total hnms thnm and total hams tham formed during nh2cl process was almost twice as many as those formed during cl2 process although chlorine has a stronger oxidative ability chloramine may be a source of nitrogen to form n dbps chu et al 2016d yang et al 2012 which could be the reason for the higher amount of n dbps observed during the nh2cl process than the cl2 process fig 2 also presented that with the ta ps pretreatment the formation of n dbps during the subsequent chlor am ination disinfection reduced by 75 95 and the concentrations of some brominated dbps even decreased to below the detection limit it has been demonstrated that the chemical oxidation of organic matter can increase hydrophilicity and convert organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen xie et al 2015 the sharp decrease in n dbp formation caused by ta ps pre oxidation may be attributable to changes in structures of nitrogenous precursors chu et al 2014 2015 2016b taking tcan as an example the combined tyrosine transformed into tcan via the peptide bonds nitrogenous functional groups and so4 produced during the ta ps process could oxidize peptide bonds of the combined tyrosine so ta ps pretreatment prevented the formation of tcan chu et al 2016b therefore it can be concluded that the introduction of the ta ps process is an effective method for controlling the formation of n dbps and the level of n dbp formation during the ta ps cl2 process and the ta ps nh2cl process were almost the same 3 3 tox value under four different processes tox was introduced to measure the total halogenated organic compounds formed during disinfection as chlor am ination disinfection could form dbps other than the investigated cx3r dbps fig 3 shows the tox value under the four different processes regardless of whether ta ps pretreatment was conducted the tox value during chlorination was two to three times higher than that during chloramination this is clearly because that the chlorine dosage added in the experiment during chlorination is higher than that during chloramination and the oxidizing ability of chlorine is also significantly stronger than chloramine deborde and von gunten 2008 fig 3 also presented that the ta ps pretreatment resulted in obvious increase in tox concentration during chlorination but not for that during chloramination the tox values increased by 42 from cl2 process to ta ps cl2 process and by 22 from nh2cl process to ta ps nh2cl process respectively as known dbps were formed by reactions between disinfectants e g chlorine or chloramine and nom generally nom in water samples can be divided into two classes stubborn nom and flexible nom which referred to nom that is weakly reactive and the strongly reactive with disinfectants respectively the reactivity of nom may relate to the complexity of structure and the size of mw and generally the more complex structure and the higher mw of nom the weaker reactive now is chang et al 2000 2001 ribau teixeira et al 2011 zhang et al 2018b it is so difficult for stubborn nom to react with disinfectants to form tox compounds but flexible nom can react with disinfectants flexibly with the introduction of ta ps pretreatment the strongly oxidative so4 destroyed the persistent refractory or macromolecular nom which means that it oxidized a part of stubborn nom into flexible nom resulting in a higher tox value particularly in the ta ps cl2 process fig 3 the ta ps pretreatment process led to a slight increase in the tox concentration during the subsequent chloramination which can be explained by the weaker oxidizing ability of chloramine in summary the concentration of formed tox was lower during chloramination than that during chlorination and the introduction of ta ps pretreatment resulted in a clear increase in tox formation during chlorination and an inconspicuous increase during chloramination this suggests that ta ps nh2cl process is effective and feasible for integrally controlling cx3r type dbps from the aspect of tox 3 4 brominated cx3r type dbp speciation under four different processes the bif and buf values of cx3r type dbps under four different processes are presented in fig 4 the yields of hnms were below the detection limit and are therefore excluded fig 4a showed that the nh2cl process significantly decreased the bif values of all c dbps the bif values of thms haas and hals 0 29 0 08 and 0 03 formed during the nh2cl process were much lower than that 0 47 0 12 and 0 20 formed during the cl2 process among the three types of c dbps the bif value of thms was much higher than that of the others indicating that bromine incorporated into the thms more easily than it did into the others which can be proved by the higher buf value of thms in fig 4b this could be related to different propensities of different classes of dbp precursors to bromine substitution hua et al 2006 hong et al 2017 this result is consistent with higher bromine substitution into cf than tcaa reported in a previous study hua and reckhow 2012 unlike c dbps the bif values of n dbps especially hams were higher during the nh2cl process than those during the cl2 process bond et al 2015 found that chloramines raised bromine substitution into hans and hams which is in accordance with the result above in this study the above results indicate that chloramine disinfection formed brominated n dbps more easily but chlorine disinfection more easily generated brominated c dbps furthermore the higher buf values of c dbps during chlorine disinfection and higher buf values of n dbps during chloramine disinfection respectively fig 4b verified this assumption with the ta ps pretreatment process the bif values for almost all investigated cx3r type dbps exhibited a clear decreasing trend during the subsequent disinfection as shown in fig 4a with the ta ps pretreatment process the bif of hans and hams during the cl2 process and that of all five cx3r type dbps excluding thms during the nh2cl process decreased to 0 indicating that there was no formation of corresponding brominated dbps this suggests that the ta ps pretreatment process can effectively control the formation of brominated dbps fig 4b showed that the buf value of cx3r type dbps excluding thms and hals decreased when ta ps pretreatment process was introduced to further understand the possible reason for this difference the bromide concentration before and after ta ps pretreatment process was measured and was found to decrease to 67 μg l from the initial 103 μg l after the ta ps pretreatment process this indicates that the so4 produced by ta ps pre oxidation oxidized bromide into bromate and less bromide was utilized to form brominated cx3r type dbps fang and shang 2012 chu et al 2016b bromate was measured in the water samples after the ta ps pretreatment data not shown which can indirectly validate this hypothesis however bromate caused by ta ps pretreatment is a potential carcinogen kurokawa et al 1990 notably the bromide concentrations in source waters in the united states and canada range from 24 to 1120 μg l with a median concentration of 100 μg l in which case bromate would beyond the guideline of 10 μg l if ta ps pretreatment is applied pan and zhang 2013 usepa 2006 therefore it is suggested that ta ps pretreatment should be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide the lowest formation of brominated cx3r type dbps during the ta ps nh2cl process indicates that the combination of ta ps pre oxidation and chloramination can effectively control the formation of brominated cx3r type dbps 3 5 comprehensive toxicity of cx3r type dbps under four different processes a comprehensive toxicity assessment for all the investigated cx3r type dbps formed under the four different processes is necessary as toxicity is directly related to human health therefore a cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti are used to evaluate the synthetic toxicity of several dbp species the cti and gti calculation equations have been proposed modified and applied in previous studies plewa et al 2008a 2008b chu et al 2016c zhang et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 yao et al 2018 hu et al 2018 and are shown below in equations 15 and 16 15 cti 1 c 1 2 c x 16 gti 1 genotoxic potency x c x where c1 2 is the concentration of each dbp that induced a cell density of 50 cx is the molar concentration of each dbp m and the genotoxic potency x was defined elsewhere plewa et al 2008b the c1 2 and the genotoxic potency of the investigated cx3r type dbps m 1 and bromate is presented in table s5 cti and gti values under the four processes are shown in fig 5 both the cti and gti are higher during chloramination than those during chlorination which can be explained by the higher formation of n dbps with higher toxicities during chloramination fig 2 the ta ps pre treatment process sharply decreased the cti and gti values during both chlorination and chloramination the cti values were 95 and 99 lower during the ta ps cl2 and ta ps nh2cl processes than those during the cl2 and nh2cl processes this indicates that ta ps pretreatment is helpful to control the toxicity of dbps formed during the subsequent chlor am ination by comparing the toxicity values of the four processes the highest toxicity occurred during chloramination and the lowest toxicity was observed during the ta ps nh2cl process fig s1 briefly compares the total cti and gti of cx3r type dbps plus bromate under the four processes it can be observed that the ta ps pre oxidation decreased the total toxicity even though the toxicity of bromate was also considered and the lowest total toxicity was still observed during the ta ps nh2cl process however a synergistic effect between bromate and organic halo dbps was found to substantially enhance the toxicity of bromate containing water increasing the uncertainty of toxicity han and zhang 2018 therefore it is hard to judge the total toxicity change caused by the ta ps pre oxidation especially for water containing high levels of bromide it is again suggested that ta ps nh2cl process should be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide in which case least toxicity is undoubtedly achieved 4 conclusions the introduction of ta ps pretreatment greatly decreased the formation of n dbps which were more toxic while slightly increased the formation of c dbps and tox during subsequent chloramination the lowest formation of brominated cx3r type dbps was observed during the ta ps nh2cl process indicating that this process can effectively control the formation of brominated dbps with higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogues the less formation of brominated cx3r type dbps was attributed to oxidation of bromide into bromate by ta ps pre oxidation and less bromide was then utilized according to the comprehensive toxicity calculation a clear decrease in both the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risk of cx3r type dbps can be observed during the ta ps nh2cl process compared with cl2 nh2cl and ta ps cl2 processes this study indicates that coupling thermally activated ps pre oxidation and post chloramination is a potentially effective method for integrally controlling carbonaceous and nitrogenous cx3r type dbps and is suggested to be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide considering bromate caused by ta ps pre oxidation the results are significant in terms of dbp control on the background of global warming declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

18746,in stream attenuation of dissolved and particulate forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are a crucial ecosystem service especially in watercourses downstream of chemical pollution point sources i e wastewater treatment plants most chemical fate models assume that attenuation is directly proportional to the concentration of available dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses but there are multiple evidences of saturation and even inhibition of attenuation at higher concentrations our current comprehension of nutrient attenuation kinetics in streams remains a limiting factor for the development and calibration of predictive models of the chemical fate of these compounds in rivers thus hindering the development and implementation of more effective regulatory strategies here we assessed the in stream attenuation of dissolved organic carbon inorganic nitrogen nh4 no2 no3 and phosphorus po4 3 compounds at increasing concentrations of these compounds and analyzed the interaction between attenuation kinetics and biofilm structure and function specifically the net balances of these compounds were assessed in artificial streams exposed to eight treatments following the gradient of wwtp contribution to the river flow 0 14 29 43 58 72 86 and 100 of wwtp effluent water results indicate that biological in stream attenuation by a given biofilm of an effluent dominated watercourse might be saturated if exposed for short periods to high nutrient concentrations such as during combined sewer overflow events but that communities can adapt if exposed long enough to high concentrations therefore avoiding or at least minimizing saturation more attention should be therefore given to the management of effluent dominated watercourses as reductions in the temporal variability of the discharged wastewater by wwtp might enhance attenuation and thus reduce water quality issues downstream graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen phosphorous dissolved organic carbon nutrient uptake kinetics 1 introduction one of the most important chemical pollution sources for watercourses are the discharges of wastewater treatment plants wwtp effluents carey and migliaccio 2009 their impact on freshwaters depends on the resulting concentration which is determined by the concentration of contaminants in the effluent and by the dilution factor that is the contribution of wwtp effluent discharge to the river flow the discharge of wwtp effluents in watercourses alters many features of freshwater ecosystems spanning from structural aspects such as biofilm biomass to functional aspects such as river metabolism aristi et al 2015 among the functional aspects the biogeochemical processes dealing with dissolved and particulate forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus deserve special attention as those are responsible for the natural in stream attenuation of these contaminants in watercourses downstream wwtp effluents haggard et al 2001 jarvie et al 2012 attenuation is here understood as the reduction of contaminants along watercourses by processes other than dilution huset et al 2008 specifically attenuation is the net balance between uptake and release of contaminants in a watercourse several modeling studies have predicted the expected concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses using estimates of mass loading from wwtp dilution factors and the in stream attenuation alexander et al 2008 wollheim et al 2008 broadly speaking most of these models assume that attenuation is directly proportional to the concentration of available dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses the linear model which estimates attenuation as the product between concentration and an overall uptake rate coefficient is the most commonly used stream solute workshop 1990 if attenuation is not linear with concentration it may be necessary to use different models such as the monod or michaelis menten formulation which implies saturation of the attenuation at high concentrations alexander et al 2009 arango et al 2008 covino et al 2010 earl et al 2006 kim et al 1990 finally attenuation might not just saturate at high concentrations but it might be inhibited this non linear relationship between concentration and attenuation has been described by the subsidy stress theory aristi et al 2015 niyogi et al 2007 odum et al 1979 however our current comprehension of the in stream attenuation dynamics of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds remains a limiting factor for the development and calibration of predictive models of the chemical fate of these compounds in rivers thus hindering the development and implementation of more effective regulatory strategies rode et al 2010 most studies on nutrient attenuation kinetics are either meta analysis of field observations marcé et al 2018 mulholland et al 2008 webster et al 2003 or short term laboratory studies using single or few compounds house and denison 2002 jahan et al 2008 kim et al 1990 here we assessed the in stream attenuation of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen nh4 no2 no3 and phosphorus po4 3 compounds at increasing concentrations of these compounds specifically the net

according to a recent review the most common contributions of wwtp to rivers discharge in continental u s are between 0 34 and 12 5 25th and 75th percentiles of the analyzed dataset containing ca 14000 sites rice and westerhoff 2017 the use of wwtp effluent water allowed assessing in stream attenuation of selected compounds exposed to a real mixture of contaminants including assimilable and toxic contaminants which might distort the uptake kinetics commonly assessed in laboratory dodds et al 2002 kim et al 1990 or field conditions arango et al 2008 marcé et al 2018 finally biofilm structure and function was assessed by means of a series of variables in order to characterize the relationship between nutrient uptake kinetics and stream biofilm 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was performed in the indoor experimental streams facility of the catalan institute for water research girona eu between january 19th and march 31st 2017 each of the 24 artificial streams was assigned to one of eight treatments 0 14 29 43 58 72 86 and 100 of wwtp effluent water following the gradient of wwtp contribution to the river flow after an acclimation period of 2 weeks treatments were implemented during 5 weeks followed by 3 weeks of recovery when all artificial streams were under the treatment 0 of wwtp effluent water the exposure to treatments lasted for 5 weeks whereas the recovery lasted for 3 weeks therefore allowing the assessment of long term effects of the wwtp effluent water 2 2 experimental conditions each artificial stream consisted of an independent methacrylate channel l w d 200 cm 10 cm 10 cm and a 70 l water tank from which water can be recirculated each artificial stream received a constant flow of 50 ml s 1 and operated as a closed system for 72 h as 100 of the water was renovated every third day mean water velocity was 0 71 cm s 1 and water depth over the plane bed ranged between 3 and 3 5 cm each artificial stream was filled with 5 l of sand extracted from an unpolluted segment of the llémena river sant esteve de llémena girona eu d50 0 74 mm the extracted sand was transported in less than 1 h to the artificial streams and evenly distributed to create a plane bed that facilitated the growth of biofilm once the sand was evenly distributed the sediment depth in the artificial streams ranged between 5 and 5 5 cm which would be representative of a relatively narrow hyporheic zone but approximately corresponded to the average depth of the sediments extracted from the llémena river at complete water saturation the porosity of the sand yielded a water content of 25 of the wet weight water sources for the artificial streams were rainwater filtered through activated carbon filters and wwtp effluent water from the quart wwtp girona eu water from the wwtp effluent was transported in 200 l tanks and transferred to the artificial streams in less than 2 h daily cycles of photosynthetic

every 10 min using 4 quantum sensors located across the whole array of artificial streams sensor li 192sa licor inc lincoln usa air temperature was maintained at 15 c during the acclimation period and 20 c during the exposure and recovery periods at an air humidity of 30 water temperature was recorded every 10 min using vemco minilog tr model amirix systems inc halifax canada temperature data loggers 5 to 35 c 0 2 c overall physico chemical conditions in the artificial streams water velocity temperature and light cycles emulated those of the llémena river during early spring during the acclimation period biofilm was allowed to grow on the artificial streams from the inocula present in the sediments from the llémena river and from that originated from biofilm colonized cobbles from the llémena river left at the upstream end of the artificial streams at the end of the acclimation period the biofilm effective photosynthetic yield yeff was quantified to ensure the homogeneity between the artificial streams before the exposure to the treatments moreover we assessed the similarity of the microbial community structure of the artificial streams and that of the llémena river and the analysis based on operational taxonomic units otus revealed that the community used in these artificial streams contained 92 of the otus present at the llémena river romero et al 2019 thus despite the limitations associated to the use of artificial streams the high similarity with the natural reference site gives reliability to the results presented in this study 2 3 water chemistry dissolved oxygen ph and specific conductivity standardized at 25 c were measured weekly by noon in each artificial stream using wtw weilheim germany hand held probes concentrations of nutrients major anions and cations and total organic matter were measured 24 h after the renewal of the artificial streams water from water collected from the channel outlet water samples were also taken before the water renewal at weeks 3 and 4 during the exposure period and at weeks 1 and 2 during the recovery period water was filtered immediately through 0 2 μm pore size nylon filters whatman kent uk into pre

tnm module shimadzu corporation kyoto japan 2 4 net balances net balances of the assessed compounds were estimated from the concentration difference between the samples collected 24 h after the renewal initial concentration in equation 1 and those collected 72 h after the renewal final concentration in equation 1 the concentration change was transformed to mass change by multiplying by the water volume in the artificial streams 75 l and was then expressed as rate per unit time and space by dividing per the time elapsed between water samples 48 h and the projected sediment surface in the

photosynthesis and thus was used to evaluate the functional changes in the biofilm s algal component timoner et al 2012 for molecular analyses biofilm was collected by washing 1 33 cm2 of sediment

extraction following manufacturer s recommendations fastdna spin kit isolation kit mp biomedicals extracted dna was quality and quantity checked and was used for quantitative pcr qpcr analyses the 16s rrna gene was used as a proxy for total bacteria whereas the psaa and psba encoding the photosystem i apoprotein a1 and the photosystem ii d1 protein respectively were used as a proxy for total phototrophs including algae and cyanobacteria sulphate reducers were tracked using the dsra gene which encodes the subunit a of the dissimilatory sulphite reductase whereas mcra gene encoding the methyl coenzyme a reductase was used as a proxy for methanogens finally the gene encoding the nitrate reductase subunit a narg was used to track nitrate reducers see details at romero et al 2019 2 6 data analysis to determine the shape of the relationship between the estimated net balances and the concentrations a series of models were fitted to the data table 1 fig 1 the linear is the most widely used followed by the monod model monod 1949 which is applicable to non inhibitory substrates and commonly used in water quality modeling mogens et al 2000 furthermore the monod model is equivalent to the renown michaelis menten model michaelis and menten 1913 which is commonly used to explain enzyme kinetics as a function of their substrate finally the haldane model has been used to explain kinetics showing inhibition by substrate at high concentrations haldane 1930 substrate inhibition occurs when concentrations of the substrate itself become inhibitory to the biochemical reaction overall the considered models were selected because encompass the most commonly observed relationships between the net balances and their respective concentrations the r functions lm for the linear equation from the package stats and gnls for all equations except the linear from the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2017 were used to determine the parameters in the kinetic models that best match the experimental data sets once each of the models was run the corresponding aic and rse were computed thus the models could be ranked according to their information and residual values being the lowest the one that better explains the data all analyses were done using r 3 4 3 r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 experimental conditions temperature was held constant during the entire experiment and between the different treatments thus air temperature in the experimental streams facility room averaged 21 0 2 2 c whereas water temperature in the artificial streams averaged 19 8 1 0 c in all treatments par cycles were also steady throughout the experiment as well as the hydraulics environmental conditions dissolved oxygen ph and specific conductivity showed no statistically significant differences between arrays before the onset of the treatments the exposure to the gradient of wwtp effluent water involved differences between treatments in terms of dissolved oxygen and specific conductivity but not in terms of ph table 2 specifically dissolved oxygen increased from the treatment 0 to the treatment 29 means increased from 8 8 to 9 2 mg o2 l 1 and decreased from that point means decreased from 9 2 to 6 9 mg o2 l 1 whereas specific conductivity was directly proportional to the percentage of water from the effluent moment pearson correlation coefficient r2 0 99 p 0 01 increasing from 220 to 1343 μs cm 1 table 2 in contrast there were no differences between treatments during the recovery period table 2 water chemistry was steady throughout the exposure when comparing the data of the artificial streams after each renewal during the exposure the achieved concentrations of the analyzed compounds in the different artificial streams were directly proportional to the percentage of water from the effluent table 3 thus all the analyzed compounds were significantly correlated with the of water from the effluent moment pearson correlation coefficient r2 0 95 p 0 01 3 2 net balances the net balances of the assessed conservative anions cl br so4 2 and cations na k mg2 ca2 showed no statistically significant relationships with their concentrations in all cases pearson moment correlation coefficients with p 0 05 and were therefore excluded from any further analysis nh4 attenuation ranged between 0 and 150 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in the 0 treatment and the highest in the 100 fig 2 a there were no differences in the observed net balances of nh4 between weeks 3 and 4 of exposure except for treatments 86 and 100 which were higher in week 4 in contrast the net balance in weeks 1 and 2 of recovery was 0 and there were no differences between them the best fitting model to the relationship between concentration and net balance of nh4 was the power model in week 3 and the monod in week 4 table 4 although the differences between the goodness of fit of the power monod and linear models were minimal the net balance of nh4 was significantly related with f0 and the abundance of the genes 16s rrna psba psaa mcra and narg fig 3 a table 5 no3 net balance ranged between 0 and 180 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in the 0 treatment and the highest in the 100 fig 2b there were no differences in the observed net balances of no3 between weeks 3 and 4 of exposure except for treatment 100 which was higher in week 4 in contrast the net balance in weeks 1 and 2 of recovery was 0 and there were no differences between them the best fitting model to the relationship between concentration and net balance of no3 was the logistic model in both weeks 3 and 4 table 4 although the differences between the goodness of fit of the power and linear model were minimal no3 net balance was significantly related with the nh4 net balance pearson moment correlation coefficient r2 0 84 p 0 01 n 48 suggesting that the mass decrease of n nh4 was associated with the mass increase of n no3 the net balance of no3 was also significantly related with f0 and the abundance of the genes 16s rrna psba psaa and narg table 5 po4 3 net balance ranged between 0 5 and 1 5 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in the 0 treatment and the highest in the 100 fig 2c the net balance of po4 3 was negative during the exposure and positive during recovery although there were differences between weeks 3 and 4 of exposure as well as between weeks 1 and 2 of recovery in the case of exposure values were higher at week 4 whereas values were higher in week 1 in the case of recovery the best fitting model to the relationship between concentration and net balance of po4 3 was the haldane model in week 3 fig 4 a and the monod model in week 4 fig 4b in both cases the goodness of fit was considerably better than the one obtained by the linear model thus indicating non linearity the net balance of po4 3 was significantly related with f0 and the abundance of the genes 16s rrna psba psaa and narg table 5 doc net balance ranged between 0 and 120 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in the 0 treatment and the highest in the 100 fig 2d net balances were negative during exposure and were close to 0 during recovery and there were no differences between weeks 3 and 4 of exposure or between weeks 1 and 2 of recovery the best fitting model to the relationship between concentration and net balance of doc was the linear model in both weeks 3 and 4 table 4 the net balance of doc was significantly correlated with f0 and with the abundance of the 16s rrna gen fig 3b as well as with psba psaa and narg table 5 4 discussion 4 1 considerations on the followed approach we are well aware that our artificial streams provide a simplified system for regulating certain hydrodynamic parameters a uniform channel can minimize variability in velocity turbulence underflow and dispersion associated with channel complexity however limitations are thereby placed on the applicability of results to natural streams in our case the most relevant limitations were the sediment depth the community complexity and the exposure time the sediment depth ranged between 5 and 5 5 cm therefore limiting the differentiation between the surface and subsurface compartments in terms of redox conditions and this might have hampered the development of anaerobic bacteria the biological community was also certainly simple as we were only able to properly reproduce the natural microbial community but not the higher consumers which might have influenced the uptake kinetics however our results are robust with low variability among replicates and consistent patterns across treatments the range of main nutrient nitrate and phosphate concentrations that we were able to achieve in our treatments span from the less polluted river basins in europe containing 0 02 mg p po4 3 l 1 and 0 8 mg n no3 l 1 to the most polluted european basins containing up to 0 40 mg p po4 3 l 1 and 11 3 mg n no3 l 1 european environment agency 2010 grizzetti et al 2017 the nutrient values at the 100 channels i e at the treatment containing pure wwtp effluent were 10 1 3 5 mg n no3 l 1 0 72 0 16 mg p po4 3 l 1 and 14 3 0 60 mg doc l 1 levels of nutrients and doc in wwtp effluents depend on treatment processes and influent conditions the levels from this study represent overall nutrient concentrations found in wwtp effluents across europe european environment agency 2018 taken together this suggests that our experimental conditions were environmentally relevant and that results might be therefore discussed in a broader context 4 2 nutrient attenuation kinetics in the artificial streams the best fitting models to the relationship concentration and net balance of nh4 were the power and the monod although very similar to the linear indicating no substrate saturation or inhibition at any of the assessed concentrations in contrast many studies have reported the monod model as the best to explain the uptake kinetics of nh4 arango et al 2008 simon et al 2005 in those studies the reported half saturation constants b in table 1 of the monod models were between 0 5 and 19 mg n nh4 l 1 whereas in our case the b value was 930 mg n nh4 l 1 the extremely high b value we report probably reflects the rather linear pattern observed in the artificial streams the best fitting model to the relationship concentration and net balance of no3 was logistic followed by the linear indicating higher sensitivity to changes at intermediate substrate concentrations and a slight substrate saturation at higher concentrations no3 was the only compound with positive net balance values i e concentration increase which were associated with the concentration decreases of nh4 and no2 indicating nitrification as the most likely mechanism behind these patterns nitrification have been reported to account for 3 60 of nh4 uptake with the highest values found in streams with higher no3 concentrations peterson et al 2001 thus the relevance of nitrification in the attenuation of nh4 in effluent dominated watercourses has been reported from field studies such that at the ozark plateau stream where observed nitrification rates were higher than the observed in our artificial streams up to 1290 mg n no3 m 2 h 1 haggard et al 2005 interestingly the overall net balance of dissolved inorganic nitrogen forms nh4 no3 no2 was around 0 in treatments 0 to 29 but steadily increased between treatments 43 and 72 up to 15 mg n l 1 and then decreased to 4 mg n l 1 at treatment 100 thus there was another mechanism at moderate to high percentages of effluent water treatments that was increasing the dissolved inorganic nitrogen we believe that this second mechanism might be mineralization of organic matter i e negative values of the doc net balance regardless of the underlying mechanisms the observed patterns in our artificial streams indicate that effluent dominated watercourses are transformers rather than sinks of inorganic nitrogen as stressed in previous studies haggard et al 2005 merseburger et al 2005 a consequence of these high nitrification rates is to exacerbate downstream dissolved inorganic nitrogen exports bernot and dodds 2005 we expected the net balances of inorganic nitrogen forms to be related with the abundances of the functional genes tied to the nitrogen cycle that is narg from no3 to no2 however no significant relationships were observed with these genes but with the functional genes tied to photosynthetic processes psba and psaa as well as with the relative abundance of bacteria 16s rrna gene this coupling suggests that the mechanisms behind the changes in the assessed inorganic nitrogen forms were biological and that autotrophic organisms were playing an important role in this direction many studies have identified autotrophic organisms as important determinants of nh4 biological demand in streams with non limiting light availability such as in desert webster et al 2003 or prairie dodds et al 2000 environments the observed maximum po4 3 net balance in our artificial streams was in the range of values reported in the literature although it was about a third of the maximum reported values in effluent dominated watercourses house and denison 2002 1997 the best fitting model to the relationship concentration and net balance of po4 3 was the haldane for week 3 and the monod for week 4 indicating substrate inhibition at high concentrations in week 3 and substrate saturation in week 4 specifically the half saturation concentration b in table 1 of the monod model for week 4 was 0 24 mg p po4 3 l 1 the substrate inhibition observed at week 3 was most likely not associated with high concentrations of po4 3 but with high concentrations of other contaminants present in the wwtp effluent in fact the haldane model has been identified as the best model to explain the uptake kinetics of toxic contaminants such as nonylphenol jahan et al 2008 the adaptation of the microbial community to the presence of toxic contaminants is a possible mechanism behind the shift from substrate inhibition to substrate saturation unfortunately we do not have information on microbial community changes over the course of the experiment but only across treatments at the end of the exposure period then there were significant differences between treatments in terms of microbial community composition romero et al 2019 therefore supporting adaptation as the possible mechanism behind the differences between weeks 3 and 4 overall biological processes might be at least partially responsible for the negative net balances of po4 3 although the observed temporal differences also indicate an important role of sorption desorption processes in fact the negative net balances during the exposure period were likely caused by biological uptake and sorption to sediments and biofilm whereas the positive net balances during the recovery period were likely caused by desorption from the sediments and biofilm a similar pattern was reported from a small stream experimentally exposed during 2 weeks to wwtp effluent water as the stream switched from negative mass balances during exposure to positive mass balance during recovery stutter et al 2010 apparently the sorption and desorption processes were determined by the concentration gradient between the water column and the sediment biofilm compartment so that the gradient determined both the direction and the magnitude of the po4 3 flux from to the water column this explanation on the combined effect of biological and physico chemical processes behind the po4 3 net balance is also supported by the poor relationships between the quantified functional genes and the po4 3 net balance and it is expectable for a nutrient with high affinity for surface complexation or adsorption such as po4 3 withers and jarvie 2008 in fact temporary sorption into streambed sediments has been reported to provide an opportunity for biotic and abiotic assimilation so that sorption is both a direct attenuation mechanism as well as an enhancer of the biological mechanism of attenuation the contribution of each attenuation mechanism to the overall po4 3 attenuation has been reported to vary in space and time within the context of a wide range of factors withers and jarvie 2008 the best fitting model to the relationship concentration and net balance of doc was linear indicating neither substrate saturation nor inhibition at any of the assessed concentrations the net balance of doc was directly related with the relative abundance of bacteria indicating that biological mineralization of organic matter was the main mechanism behind the observed pattern 5 conclusions given our results one might think that biological attenuation by a given bacterial community of an effluent dominated watercourse might be saturated but that communities can adapt to increasing substrate availability and therefore avoid or at least minimize saturation at high concentrations this means that a given watercourse would be unable to respond on the short term to concentration increases such as those occurring during combined sewer overflow events or the diurnal variations reflecting patterns in domestic water usage palmer felgate et al 2008 but would be able to respond to long term increases of concentration such as those related with increasing the sewered population in the catchment area withers and jarvie 2008 or with changes in the nutrients wwtp removal efficiency jarvie et al 2012 in this direction some authors have suggested that the reduction in the diurnal variations of the wwtp effluent discharge might enhance the daily attenuation of nutrients gibson and meyer 2007 in fact the bacterial abundance in our artificial streams was directly proportional to the contribution of wwtp effluent water to the artificial streams flow although there were differences in the microbial community structure romero et al 2019 suggesting that adaptation of microbial communities occurred under stable high nutrient loadings from the wwtp which in turn resulted in linear or monod rather than haldane models similarly a study on experimental exposure of a small stream to wwtp effluent reported that increases of 50 of biological p uptake were paralleled by increases of 67 of heterotrophic production stutter et al 2010 it s important to remark that these results imply that monod or even haldane models would better explain nutrient attenuation kinetics during short term concentration changes but that linear models might suffice to explain long term concentration changes to conclude these patterns imply that the ecosystem service of water purification is extremely high in these effluent dominated watercourses and that more attention should be given to their management as any improvement in their hydro geomorphological conditions or an ecosystem based management of the wwtp corominas et al 2013 might further enhance attenuation and thus reduce water quality issues downstream declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

18746,in stream attenuation of dissolved and particulate forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are a crucial ecosystem service especially in watercourses downstream of chemical pollution point sources i e wastewater treatment plants most chemical fate models assume that attenuation is directly proportional to the concentration of available dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses but there are multiple evidences of saturation and even inhibition of attenuation at higher concentrations our current comprehension of nutrient attenuation kinetics in streams remains a limiting factor for the development and calibration of predictive models of the chemical fate of these compounds in rivers thus hindering the development and implementation of more effective regulatory strategies here we assessed the in stream attenuation of dissolved organic carbon inorganic nitrogen nh4 no2 no3 and phosphorus po4 3 compounds at increasing concentrations of these compounds and analyzed the interaction between attenuation kinetics and biofilm structure and function specifically the net balances of these compounds were assessed in artificial streams exposed to eight treatments following the gradient of wwtp contribution to the river flow 0 14 29 43 58 72 86 and 100 of wwtp effluent water results indicate that biological in stream attenuation by a given biofilm of an effluent dominated watercourse might be saturated if exposed for short periods to high nutrient concentrations such as during combined sewer overflow events but that communities can adapt if exposed long enough to high concentrations therefore avoiding or at least minimizing saturation more attention should be therefore given to the management of effluent dominated watercourses as reductions in the temporal variability of the discharged wastewater by wwtp might enhance attenuation and thus reduce water quality issues downstream graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen phosphorous dissolved organic carbon nutrient uptake kinetics 1 introduction one of the most important chemical pollution sources for watercourses are the discharges of wastewater treatment plants wwtp effluents carey and migliaccio 2009 their impact on freshwaters depends on the resulting concentration which is determined by the concentration of contaminants in the effluent and by the dilution factor that is the contribution of wwtp effluent discharge to the river flow the discharge of wwtp effluents in watercourses alters many features of freshwater ecosystems spanning from structural aspects such as biofilm biomass to functional aspects such as river metabolism aristi et al 2015 among the functional aspects the biogeochemical processes dealing with dissolved and particulate forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus deserve special attention as those are responsible for the natural in stream attenuation of these contaminants in watercourses downstream wwtp effluents haggard et al 2001 jarvie et al 2012 attenuation is here understood as the reduction of contaminants along watercourses by processes other than dilution huset et al 2008 specifically attenuation is the net balance between uptake and release of contaminants in a watercourse several modeling studies have predicted the expected concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses using estimates of mass loading from wwtp dilution factors and the in stream attenuation alexander et al 2008 wollheim et al 2008 broadly speaking most of these models assume that attenuation is directly proportional to the concentration of available dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses the linear model which estimates attenuation as the product between concentration and an overall uptake rate coefficient is the most commonly used stream solute workshop 1990 if attenuation is not linear with concentration it may be necessary to use different models such as the monod or michaelis menten formulation which implies saturation of the attenuation at high concentrations alexander et al 2009 arango et al 2008 covino et al 2010 earl et al 2006 kim et al 1990 finally attenuation might not just saturate at high concentrations but it might be inhibited this non linear relationship between concentration and attenuation has been described by the subsidy stress theory aristi et al 2015 niyogi et al 2007 odum et al 1979 however our current comprehension of the in stream attenuation dynamics of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds remains a limiting factor for the development and calibration of predictive models of the chemical fate of these compounds in rivers thus hindering the development and implementation of more effective regulatory strategies rode et al 2010 most studies on nutrient attenuation kinetics are either meta analysis of field observations marcé et al 2018 mulholland et al 2008 webster et al 2003 or short term laboratory studies using single or few compounds house and denison 2002 jahan et al 2008 kim et al 1990 here we assessed the in stream attenuation of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen nh4 no2 no3 and phosphorus po4 3 compounds at increasing concentrations of these compounds specifically the net balances of these compounds were assessed in artificial streams exposed to eight treatments following the gradient of wwtp contribution to the river flow 0 14 29 43 58 72 86 and 100 of wwtp effluent

toxic contaminants which might distort the uptake kinetics commonly assessed in laboratory dodds et al 2002 kim et al 1990 or field conditions arango et al 2008 marcé et al 2018 finally biofilm structure and function was assessed by means of a series of variables in order to characterize the relationship between nutrient uptake kinetics and stream biofilm 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was performed in the indoor experimental streams facility of the catalan institute for water research girona eu between january 19th and march 31st 2017 each of the

period of 2 weeks treatments were implemented during 5 weeks followed by 3 weeks of recovery when all artificial streams were under the treatment 0 of wwtp effluent water the exposure to treatments lasted for 5 weeks whereas the recovery lasted for 3 weeks therefore allowing the assessment of long term effects of the wwtp effluent water 2 2 experimental conditions each artificial stream consisted of an independent methacrylate channel l w d 200 cm 10 cm 10 cm and a 70 l water tank from which water can be recirculated each artificial stream received a constant flow of 50 ml s 1 and operated as a closed system for 72 h as 100 of the water was renovated every third day mean water velocity was 0 71 cm s 1 and water depth over the plane bed ranged between 3 and 3 5 cm each artificial stream was filled with 5 l of sand extracted from an unpolluted segment of the llémena river sant esteve de llémena girona eu d50 0 74 mm the extracted sand was transported in less than 1 h to the artificial streams and evenly distributed to create a plane bed that facilitated the growth of biofilm once the sand was evenly distributed the sediment depth in the artificial streams ranged between 5 and 5 5 cm which would be representative of a relatively narrow hyporheic zone but approximately corresponded to the average depth of the sediments extracted from the llémena river at complete water saturation the porosity of the sand yielded a water content of 25 of the wet weight water sources for the artificial streams were rainwater filtered through activated carbon filters and wwtp effluent water from the quart wwtp girona eu water from the wwtp effluent was transported in 200 l tanks and transferred to the artificial streams in less than 2 h daily cycles of photosynthetic

the llémena river left at the upstream end of the artificial streams at the end of the acclimation period the biofilm effective photosynthetic yield yeff was quantified to ensure the homogeneity between the artificial streams before the exposure to the treatments moreover we assessed the similarity of the microbial community structure of the artificial streams and that of the llémena river and the analysis based on operational taxonomic units otus revealed that the community used in these artificial streams contained 92 of the otus present at the llémena river romero et al 2019 thus

fluorescence f0 and photosynthetic efficiency yeff the f0 was used as an estimation of the relative algal biomass whereas yeff indicates the fraction of light converted into chemical energy during photosynthesis and thus was used to evaluate the functional changes in the biofilm s algal component timoner et al 2012 for molecular analyses biofilm was collected by washing 1 33 cm2 of sediment

methyl coenzyme a reductase was used as a proxy for methanogens finally the gene encoding the nitrate reductase subunit a narg was used to track nitrate reducers see details at romero et al 2019 2 6 data analysis to determine the shape of the relationship between the estimated net balances and the concentrations a series of models were fitted to the data table 1 fig 1 the linear is the most widely used followed by the monod model monod 1949 which is applicable to non inhibitory substrates and commonly used in water quality modeling mogens et al 2000 furthermore the monod model is equivalent to the renown michaelis menten model michaelis and menten 1913 which is commonly used to explain enzyme kinetics as a function of their substrate finally the haldane model has been used to explain kinetics showing inhibition by substrate at high concentrations haldane 1930 substrate inhibition occurs when concentrations of the substrate itself become inhibitory to the biochemical reaction overall the considered models were selected because encompass the most commonly observed relationships between the net balances and their respective concentrations the r functions lm for the linear equation from the package stats and gnls for all equations except the linear from the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2017 were used to determine the parameters in the kinetic models that best match the experimental data sets once each of the models was run the corresponding aic and rse were computed thus the models could be ranked according to their information and residual values being the lowest the one that better explains the data all analyses were done using r 3 4 3 r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 experimental conditions temperature was held constant during the entire experiment and between the different treatments thus air temperature in the experimental streams facility room averaged 21 0 2 2 c whereas water temperature in the artificial streams averaged 19 8 1 0 c in all treatments par cycles were also steady throughout the experiment as well as the hydraulics environmental conditions dissolved oxygen ph and specific conductivity showed no statistically significant differences between arrays before the onset of the treatments the exposure to the gradient of wwtp effluent water involved differences between treatments in terms of dissolved oxygen and specific conductivity but not in terms of ph table 2 specifically dissolved oxygen increased from the treatment 0 to the treatment 29 means increased from 8 8 to 9 2 mg o2 l 1 and decreased from that point means decreased from 9 2 to 6 9 mg o2 l 1 whereas specific conductivity was directly proportional to the percentage of water from the effluent moment pearson correlation coefficient r2 0 99 p 0 01 increasing from 220 to 1343 μs cm 1 table 2 in contrast there were no differences between treatments during the recovery period table 2 water chemistry was steady throughout the exposure when comparing the data of the artificial streams after each renewal during the exposure the achieved concentrations of the analyzed compounds in the different artificial streams were directly proportional to the percentage of water from the effluent table 3 thus all the analyzed compounds were significantly correlated with the of water from the effluent moment pearson correlation coefficient r2 0 95 p 0 01 3 2 net balances the net balances of the assessed conservative anions cl br so4 2 and cations na k mg2 ca2 showed no statistically significant relationships with their concentrations in all cases pearson moment correlation coefficients with p 0 05 and were therefore excluded from any further analysis nh4 attenuation ranged between 0 and 150 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in the 0 treatment and the highest in the 100 fig 2 a there were no differences in the observed net balances of nh4 between weeks 3 and 4 of exposure except for treatments 86 and 100 which were higher in week 4 in contrast the net balance in weeks 1 and 2 of recovery was 0 and there were no differences between them the best fitting model to the relationship between concentration and net balance of nh4 was the power model in week 3 and the monod in week 4 table 4 although the differences between the goodness of fit of the power monod and linear models were minimal the net balance of nh4 was significantly related with f0 and the abundance of the genes 16s rrna psba psaa mcra and narg fig 3 a table 5 no3 net balance ranged between 0 and 180 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in

contrast the net balance in weeks 1 and 2 of recovery was 0 and there were no differences between them the best fitting model to the relationship between concentration and net balance of no3 was the logistic model in both weeks 3 and 4 table 4 although the differences between the goodness of fit of the power and linear model were minimal no3 net balance was significantly related with the nh4 net balance pearson moment correlation coefficient r2 0 84 p 0 01 n 48 suggesting that the mass decrease of n nh4 was associated with the mass increase of n no3 the net balance of no3 was also significantly related with f0 and the abundance of the genes 16s rrna psba psaa and narg table 5 po4 3 net balance ranged between 0 5 and 1 5 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in the 0 treatment and the highest in the 100 fig 2c the net balance of po4 3 was negative during the exposure and positive during recovery although there were differences between weeks 3 and 4 of exposure as well as between weeks 1 and 2 of recovery in the case of exposure values were higher at week 4 whereas values were higher in week 1 in the case of recovery the best fitting model to the relationship between concentration and net balance of po4 3 was the haldane model in week 3 fig 4 a and the monod model in week 4 fig 4b in both cases the goodness of fit was considerably better than the one obtained by the linear model thus indicating non linearity the net balance of po4 3 was significantly related with f0 and the abundance of the genes 16s rrna psba psaa and narg table 5 doc net balance ranged between 0 and 120 mg m 2 h 1 with the lowest values occurring in the 0 treatment and the highest in the 100 fig 2d net balances were negative during exposure and were close to 0 during recovery

linear model in both weeks 3 and 4 table 4 the net balance of doc was significantly correlated with f0 and with the abundance of the 16s rrna gen fig 3b as well as with psba psaa and narg table 5 4 discussion 4 1 considerations on the followed approach we are well aware that our artificial streams provide a simplified system for regulating certain hydrodynamic parameters a uniform channel can minimize variability in velocity turbulence underflow and dispersion associated with channel complexity however limitations are thereby placed on the applicability of results to natural streams in our case the most relevant limitations were the sediment depth the community complexity and the exposure time the sediment depth ranged between 5 and 5 5 cm therefore limiting the differentiation between the surface and subsurface compartments in terms of redox conditions and this might have hampered the development of anaerobic bacteria the biological community was also certainly simple as we were only able to properly reproduce the natural microbial community but not the higher consumers which might have influenced the uptake kinetics however our results are robust with low variability among replicates and consistent patterns across treatments the range of main nutrient nitrate and phosphate concentrations that we were able to achieve in our treatments span from the less polluted river basins in europe containing 0 02 mg p po4 3 l 1 and 0 8 mg n no3 l 1 to the most polluted european basins containing up to 0 40 mg p po4 3 l 1 and 11 3 mg n no3 l 1 european environment agency 2010 grizzetti et al 2017 the nutrient values at the 100 channels i e at the treatment containing pure wwtp effluent were 10 1 3 5 mg n no3 l 1 0 72 0 16 mg p po4 3 l 1 and 14 3 0 60 mg doc l 1 levels of nutrients and doc in wwtp effluents depend on treatment processes and influent conditions the levels from this study represent overall nutrient concentrations found in wwtp effluents across europe european environment agency 2018 taken together this suggests that our experimental conditions were environmentally relevant and that results might be therefore discussed in a broader context 4 2 nutrient attenuation kinetics in the artificial streams the best fitting models to the relationship concentration and net balance of nh4 were the power and the monod although very similar to the linear indicating no substrate saturation or inhibition at any of the assessed concentrations in contrast many studies have reported the monod model as the best to explain the uptake kinetics of nh4 arango et al 2008 simon et al 2005 in those studies the reported half saturation constants b in table 1 of the monod models were between 0 5 and 19 mg n nh4 l 1 whereas in our case the b value was 930 mg n nh4 l 1 the extremely high b value we report probably reflects the rather linear pattern observed in the artificial streams the best fitting model to the relationship concentration and net balance of no3 was logistic followed by the linear indicating higher sensitivity to changes at intermediate substrate concentrations and a slight substrate saturation at higher concentrations no3 was the only compound with positive net balance values i e concentration increase which were associated with the concentration decreases of nh4 and no2 indicating nitrification as the most likely mechanism behind these patterns nitrification have been reported to account for 3 60 of nh4 uptake with the highest values found in streams with higher no3 concentrations peterson et al 2001 thus the relevance of nitrification in the attenuation of nh4 in effluent dominated watercourses has been reported from field studies such that at the ozark plateau stream where observed nitrification rates were higher than the observed in our artificial streams up to 1290 mg n no3 m 2 h 1 haggard et al 2005 interestingly the overall net balance of dissolved inorganic nitrogen forms nh4 no3 no2 was around 0 in treatments 0 to 29 but steadily increased between treatments 43 and 72 up to 15 mg n l 1 and then decreased to 4 mg n l 1 at treatment 100 thus there was another mechanism at moderate to high percentages of effluent water treatments that was increasing the dissolved inorganic nitrogen we believe that this second mechanism might be mineralization of organic matter i e negative values of the doc net balance regardless of the underlying mechanisms the observed patterns in our artificial streams indicate that effluent dominated watercourses are transformers rather than sinks of inorganic nitrogen as stressed in previous studies haggard et al 2005 merseburger et al 2005 a consequence of these high nitrification rates is to exacerbate downstream dissolved inorganic nitrogen exports bernot and dodds 2005 we expected the net balances of inorganic nitrogen forms to be related with the abundances of the functional genes tied to the nitrogen cycle that is narg from no3 to no2 however no significant relationships were observed with these genes but with the functional genes tied to photosynthetic processes psba and psaa as well as with the relative abundance of bacteria 16s rrna gene this coupling suggests that the mechanisms behind the changes in the assessed inorganic nitrogen forms were biological and that autotrophic organisms were playing an important role in this direction many studies have identified autotrophic organisms as important determinants of nh4 biological demand in streams with non limiting light availability such as in desert webster et al 2003 or prairie dodds et al 2000 environments the observed maximum po4 3 net balance in our artificial streams was in the range of values reported in the literature although it was about a third of the maximum reported values in effluent dominated watercourses house and denison 2002 1997 the best fitting model to the relationship concentration and net balance of po4 3 was the haldane for week 3 and the monod for week 4 indicating substrate inhibition at high concentrations in week 3 and substrate saturation in week 4 specifically the half saturation concentration b in table 1 of the monod model for week 4 was 0 24 mg p po4 3 l 1 the substrate inhibition observed at week 3 was most likely not associated with high concentrations of po4 3 but with high concentrations of other contaminants present in the wwtp effluent in fact the haldane model has been identified as the best model to explain the uptake kinetics of toxic contaminants such as nonylphenol jahan et al 2008 the adaptation of the microbial community to the presence of toxic contaminants is a possible mechanism behind the shift from substrate inhibition to substrate saturation unfortunately we do not have information on microbial community changes over the course of the experiment but only across treatments at the end of the exposure period then there were significant differences between treatments in terms of microbial community composition romero et al 2019 therefore supporting adaptation as the possible mechanism behind the differences between weeks 3 and 4 overall biological processes might be at least partially responsible for the negative net balances of po4 3 although the observed temporal differences also indicate an important role of sorption desorption processes in fact the negative net balances during the exposure period were likely caused by biological uptake and sorption to sediments and biofilm whereas the positive net balances during the recovery period were likely caused by desorption from the sediments and biofilm a similar pattern was reported from a small stream experimentally exposed during 2 weeks to wwtp effluent water as the stream switched from negative mass balances during exposure to positive mass balance during recovery stutter et al 2010 apparently the sorption and desorption processes were determined by the concentration gradient between the water column and the sediment biofilm compartment so that the gradient determined both the direction and the magnitude of the po4 3 flux from to the water column this explanation on the combined effect of biological and physico chemical processes behind the po4 3 net balance is also supported by the poor relationships between the quantified functional genes and the po4 3 net balance and it is expectable for a nutrient with high affinity for surface complexation or adsorption such as po4 3 withers and jarvie 2008 in fact temporary sorption into streambed sediments has been reported to provide an opportunity for biotic and abiotic assimilation so that sorption is both a direct attenuation mechanism as well as an enhancer of the biological mechanism of attenuation the contribution of each attenuation mechanism to the overall po4 3 attenuation has been reported to vary in space and time within the context of a wide range of factors withers and jarvie 2008 the best fitting model to the relationship concentration and net balance of doc was linear indicating neither substrate saturation nor inhibition at any of the assessed concentrations the net balance of doc was directly related with the relative abundance of bacteria indicating that biological mineralization of organic matter was the main mechanism behind the observed pattern 5 conclusions given our results one might think that biological attenuation by a given bacterial community of an effluent dominated watercourse might be saturated but that communities can adapt to increasing substrate availability and therefore avoid or at least minimize saturation at high concentrations this means that a given watercourse would be unable to respond on the short term to concentration increases such as those occurring during combined sewer overflow events or the diurnal variations reflecting patterns in domestic water usage palmer felgate et al 2008 but would be able to respond to long term increases of concentration such as those related with increasing the sewered population in the catchment area withers and jarvie 2008 or with changes in the nutrients wwtp removal efficiency jarvie et al 2012 in this direction some authors have suggested that the reduction in the diurnal variations of the wwtp effluent discharge might enhance the daily attenuation of nutrients gibson and meyer 2007 in fact the bacterial abundance in our artificial streams was directly proportional to the contribution of wwtp effluent water to the artificial streams flow although there were differences in the microbial community structure romero et al 2019 suggesting that adaptation of microbial communities occurred under stable high nutrient loadings from the wwtp which in turn resulted in linear or monod rather than haldane models similarly a study on experimental exposure of a small stream to wwtp effluent reported that increases of 50 of biological p uptake were paralleled by increases of 67 of heterotrophic production stutter et al 2010 it s important to remark that these results imply that monod or even haldane models would better explain nutrient attenuation kinetics during short term concentration changes but that linear models might suffice to explain long term concentration changes to conclude these patterns imply that the ecosystem service of water purification is extremely high in these effluent dominated watercourses and that more attention should be given to their management as any improvement in their hydro geomorphological conditions or an ecosystem based management of the wwtp corominas et al 2013 might further enhance attenuation and thus reduce water quality issues downstream declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

18747,the wide application of chlorine disinfectant for drinking water treatment has led to the appearance of chlorine resistant bacteria which pose a severe threat to public health this study was performed to explore the physiological biochemical characteristics and environmental influence ph temperature and turbidity of seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria isolated from drinking water ozone disinfection was used to investigate the inactivation effect of bacteria and spores the dna concentration and cell surface structure variations of typical chlorine resistant spores bacillus cereus spores were also analysed by real time qpcr flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy to determine their inactivation mechanisms the ozone resistance of bacteria aeromonas jandaei vogesella perlucida pelomonas bacillus cereus aeromonas sobria was lower than that of spores bacillus alvei lysinibacillus fusiformis bacillus cereus at an ozone concentration of 1 5 mg l more than 99 9 of bacillus cereus spores were inactivated by increasing ozone concentration and treatment duration moreover the dna content of bacillus cereus spores decreased sharply but approximately 1 4 of the target genes remained the spore structure exhibited shrinkage and folding after ozone treatment both cell structures and gene fragments were damaged by ozone disinfection these results showed that ozone disinfection is a promising method for inactivating chlorine resistant bacteria and spores in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water ozone disinfection chlorine resistant bacteria bacillus cereus spores inactivation mechanism 1 introduction chlorine based disinfectants have been widely utilized for traditional drinking water disinfection against most bacteria viruses and fungi around the world pereira et al 2013 simoes et al 2010 luh and mariñas 2007 however long term application of the chlorination process contributes to the preferential selection of chlorine resistant bacteria which are relatively insensitive to free chlorine in the aquatic environment such as distribution networks lautenschlager et al 2013 the appearance of chlorine resistant bacteria especially common pathogenic spores that exhibit better viability than others after disinfection treatment poses a clear threat to public health li et al 2013 for example aeromonas spp and bacillus cereus are both ubiquitous pathogens of human gastrointestinal disorders aeromonas jandaei is responsible for wound infections and enteritis and aeromonas sobria causes septicaemia stratev 2012 janda 1987 moreover bacillus cereus is generally considered as a cause of food poisoning through the expression of either emetic or diarrheal toxins stelder et al 2017 mckillip 2000 due to the potential risk of chlorine resistant bacteria research on alternative disinfection processes using ozone uv chlorine dioxide or combined processes has become an issue of public concern michael kordatou et al 2018 li et al 2018 gassie and englehardt 2017 bohn et al 2008 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 among these ozonation is typically efficient fast and regarded as a promising disinfection method for drinking water treatment especially for the inactivation of microorganisms for example the exposure of various bacteria pseudomonas fluorescens escherichia coli o157 h7 and leuconostoc mesenteroides to ozone at 2 5 ppm for 40 s caused a 5 6 log decrease in the bacteria count kim and yousef 2000 jamil et al 2017 studied the inactivation process of indicator microorganisms e coli and salmonella in drinking water using ozone treatment reporting a 5 and 6 log removal of salmonella after contact times of 45 s and 60 s respectively at an applied ozone concentration of 2 mg l however e coli was more resistant to ozonation than salmonella during the disinfection process with a mixed culture of the two microbes ozone oxidation reactions are typically divided into a direct molecular ozone reaction and an indirect oh radical reaction from the decomposition of ozone which produces a number of oxidative radicals and subsequently generates the hydroxyl radical von gunten 2003 cho et al 2002 ozone is often applied to drinking water along with chlorine or uv inactivation because of its lack of continuous disinfection ability for example jung et al 2008 investigated the synergistic effects of sequential ozone uv disinfection for the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores inactivation was enhanced by a pre ozonation process which assisted uv irradiation as a secondary disinfectant moreover they found that oh radicals which are induced by ozone decomposition play a significant role in activating the target microbial agent and contributed to 33 of the total log reduction cho et al 2006 observed that the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores was significantly enhanced by a disinfection system consisting of either o3 h2o2 combined or o3 h2o2 followed by free chlorine in 2014 abnormal growth of bacteria colonies was observed along the path of a drinking water treatment plant in southern china which could not be effectively controlled by an increase of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant for this study seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria were isolated from water samples collected in this area among them bacillus sp has strong disinfection resistance due to the presence of spores once these spores erupt and reach a certain abundance in the plant filter pool the total amount of bacteria in the water outlet exceeds the effluent index which poses a potential issue for the microbiological safety and quality of the drinking water therefore in this study we investigated the ability of ozone disinfection alone to inactivate seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria and spores from drinking water we also evaluated the factors influencing ozone disinfection of spores in addition the inactivation mechanisms of bacillus cereus spores were determined by investigating the changes in dna content and spore morphology we aim to reveal a convenient and efficient disinfection process to address the emerging threat to drinking water safety caused by spores 2 material and methods 2 1 water samples filtered water samples were collected from the tube to the clean water reservoir of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in southern china without adding large amounts of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant raw water samples were collected from the water inlet and pre filtered water samples were colleted before the water passed through a v filter these samples were kept at 4 c during storage and shipment and the experiments were conducted within 48 h the treatment process followed at the drinking water treatment plant is depicted in fig s1 the characteristics of raw water were as follows water temperature 25 45 c ph 7 09 turbidity 9 34 ntu cod 3 05 mg l total bacteria count 817 27 cfu ml total e coli 1309 cfu 100

this study seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria were isolated from a municipal drinking water treatment plant in southern china the isolation process employed the gradient dilution coating method first abnormal water samples were collected after culturing with solid nutrient agar at 35 2 0 c for 24 h colonies with different morphologies were picked out for purification of cultures the process was repeated until a pure bacterial strain was obtained isolated bacterial strains were identified as bacillus alvei bacillus cereus aeromonas jandaei aeromonas sobria lysinibacillus fusiformis vogesella perlucida and pelomonas some of these strains have been reported as chlorine resistant bacteria scoaris et al 2008 nam et al 2014 paes et al 2012 roi et al 2015 among the strains bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis were bacillus sp which exhibits spores with strong thermostability and resistance to common disinfectants the 16s rdna gene sequencing data were submitted to ncbi s bankit and the genbank accession numbers were mk432812 mk418684 and mk418685 in addition some experiments considered e coli for contrast which was isolated from municipal sewage in southern china and screened on an iron methylene blue medium 2 2 2 cultivation of bacteria different strains of bacteria were cultured with solid nutrient agar huankai china at 35 2 0 c for 12 24 h pure colonies were washed into test tubes with sterilized phosphate buffer saline pbs solution each sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and subsequently suspended in sterilized pbs solution three times the optical density od of the bacterial suspension was measured at 600 nm to determine the cell density the calibration curve is shown in fig s2 for the optimum concentration range 106 108 colony forming units per millilitre cfu ml excessive concentrations of bacteria were diluted for the following analysis 2 2 3 cultivation and preservation of spores both bacteria and spore states of bacillus sp bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis were used in the following experiments bacillus sp were induced on solid nutrient agar due to the lack of nutrition spores appeared on the surface after a 48 h cultivation process at 35 2 0 c after identification by malachite green the bacteria and spore mixture was prepared as described in section 2 2 2 and stored in phosphate buffer saline pbs at 4 c for 24 h the final spore sample concentrations were 105 106 cfu ml according to microscopic examination bx41 olympus japan and were preserved at 4 c for one month before each experiment the spore suspension was centrifuged and suspended with pbs 2 3 times and then shaken adequately to separate the independent spores 2 2 4 specific chromogenic medium of bacillus cereus among the seven strains of bacteria bacillus cereus can be differentiated using specific chromogenic medium which represents a better alternative than the conventional standard medium fricker et al 2008 peng et al 2001 the modified specific chromogenic medium used in the experiments was hb7021 2 hopebio china on this medium bacillus cereus appears as a large blue green colony surrounded by an opaque ring bacillus thuringiensis appears blue green listeria sp appears as a smaller dark blue colony other bacteria appear yellow or colourless and gram negative bacteria were inhibited within a 12 h culture at 35 c the principle of the chromogenic medium is that the peptone and yeast extract were used as basic nutrients to provide carbon and nitrogen sources and trace elements and the sodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were used as buffers by adding mixed pigments the substrate was hydrolysed and the chromogenic groups were released by the specific reaction with the enzymes related to bacillus cereus which was then visible as green or blue green colonies a rapid process to detect chlorine resistant bacteria in drinking water is described in text s1 2 3 ozone inactivation experiments 2 3 1 ozone generator and inactivation conditions ozone was produced by a horizontal mini type ozone generator guolin china in order to maximize aqueous ozone concentration ozone was continuously aerated into pure cooling water for more than 2 h after measuring the ozone concentration in water the corresponding volume of ozonated water was added to the water sample and the inactivation effect was controlled by sampling at a certain time ozone was rapidly consumed in water in the first few minutes and then much more slowly during the rest of the reaction even if higher ozone concentrations were used ozone consumption could not be prevented fan et al 2013 all experiments were conducted with filtered water samples and exposed to different ozone concentrations at approximately 25 c sodium thiosulfate 1 mol l was used as a terminating agent to avoid residual ozone in samples dong et al 2018 the entire process was operated under closed conditions 2 3 2 determination of ozone concentration ozone concentration was determined by potassium indigo trisulfonate spectrophotometry ozone can oxidize potassium indigo trisulfonate from blue to colourless at ph 2 0 the ozone concentration was calculated using the following formula 1 c o 3 v x a ε d v 0 m 10 3 2 4 a 0 a 1 v x v 0 where c o 3 is the ozone concentration in water mg l a 0 and a 1 represent the absorbance before and after ozone addition v x is the volume of the water sample usually 10 ml v 0 is the volume of the ozone disinfectant usually 0 2 ml m is the ozone molar mass g mol d is the thickness of the cuvette 1 cm and ε is the indigo molar absorptivity 2000 l mol 1 cm 1 2 3 3 determination of inactivation effect the ozone inactivation effect was determined by the dilution method of plate counting samples were diluted to 1 10 1 100 and 1 1000 in sequence each step was repeated three times 0 1 ml of these samples was spread to each plant distributed between each plate and incubated for 24 h clear colonies were counted by the standard plate counting method the colony effective detection range is 30 300 cfu on a petri dish the inactivation efficiency was measured by the logarithmic inactivation rate lg n 0 n t where n 0 and n t represent the number of bacteria before and after inactivation 2 4 cell surface hydrophobicity cell surface hydrophobicity was determined by microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons math briefly 4 ml of bacterial suspension approximately 108 cfu ml was added to the test tube then 1 5 ml of n hexane was added as the organic phase the mixture was shaken violently for 1 min then separated into two phases after 15 min standing at 20 1 c the lower phase was quickly absorbed with sterile disposable needles the absorbance a value was determined by spectrophotometer at 600 nm with pbs as a blank control the analysis was repeated three times for each sample the cell surface hydrophobic rate csh was calculated by the following formula 2 c s h control a 600 nm test a 600 nm control a 600 nm 100 2 5 analytical methods of inactivation mechanisms 2 5 1 fluorescence staining and flow cytometry in this study flow cytometry fcm with fluorescence staining was performed for qualitative dna analysis according to the method in hammes et al 2008 cells in water samples were stained with 10 μl ml sybr green i 1 100 dilution in dmso molecular probes and incubated in the dark for at least 15 min then observed by the flow cytometer facscalibur bd america control groups without fluorescence staining were also prepared the scattering light detectors of fcm are divided into side scatter ssc and forward scatter fsc ssc is more sensitive to the refractivity of the cell cytoplasm and nuclear membrane while fsc is closely related to cell size this study used dot plots of ssc vs fsc to distinguish bacterial cells from the sample background these cells were gated manually using the flowjo software bd america in addition sybr green i has an excitation maxima at 497 nm and an emission maxima at 520 nm however emission can also be detected above 600 nm hammes and egli 2005 therefore fluorescence was collected in the fl2 channel 585 nm we used plots of counts vs fl2 to qualitatively analyse changes in the cell counts before and after inactivation 2 5 2 real time qpcr dna quantitative analysis was determined using real time qpcr ultrasonication was used as the cell disruption method and dna was extracted using a dna kit mp america dna purity was detected by nano drop 2000 shimadzu japan at 260 nm and 280 nm respectively the absorbance value ratio of 260 nm 280 nm was assumed to be 1 8 2 0 the real time qpcr method was slightly modified from that reported previously wehrle et al 2010 each qpcr reaction mixture 20 μl consisted of 2 sg green qpcr mix 10 μl forward primer 10 μm 0 5 μl reverse primer 10 μm 0 5 μl gdna 1 μl and nuclease free water 8 μl the qpcr reaction program was performed under the following steps one cycle at 95 c for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 20 s then subsequent 60 c for 30 s in this study bacillus cereus was used as a case study to detect the dna content in actual water samples the specific primers in the sequence of the standard gene fragment were as follows forward primer 5 ccttcttcaagttcaaatctcg 3 reverse primer 5 gtygtaatgacaggtgatgga 3 where y is t and c the calibration curve between the standard gene fragment concentration and the ct value which is the pcr cycle number when the fluorescence value reaches the threshold and has a linear relationship with the logarithm of the initial template dna content copy μl is shown in fig 1 the formula is ct klog dna c k 2 746 c 38 065 r 2 0 99 combined with the filter membrane method the actual water samples were enriched and quantitatively determined within 1 h then the dna was extracted from the filter membrane and prepared for real time qpcr system detection the linear correlation curve of the dna concentrations ng μ l vs filtered water sample volume is shown in fig 2 the dna concentrations corresponding to different ct values are also included the formulas are y1 0 6984x 5 3105 r 2 0 9997 and y2 0 0157 x 28 668 r 2 0 9916 respectively 2 5 3 scanning electron microscopy the surface structure of the spores was observed by scanning electron microscope sem the spore suspension was filtered by a filter membrane and placed in a test tube for pre treatment briefly the samples were fixed by 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution for 2 h washed with pbs three times dehydrated with different ratios of ethanol pbs for 15 min each time then dried overnight at 40 c for subsequent observation 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorine tolerant bacteria isolated from drinking water treatment plant 3 1 1 physiological and biochemical properties of chlorine tolerant bacteria the seven strains of chlorine tolerant bacteria exhibited different structural features and different physiological and biochemical characteristics a detailed description of the physiological characteristics of the colony morphologies of all strains is listed in table s1 the existence of spores was detected qualitatively and rapidly by microscopic examination bacteria were typically rod shaped or curved and approximately 3 5 μm long whereas the spores were typically approximately 1 2 μ with good refraction and could be dyed by malachite green the microscopic observation results of several strains are shown in fig s3 3 1 2 cell surface hydrophobicity of chlorine tolerant bacterial strains the cell surface hydrophobicity csh of all seven strains of bacteria and spores is shown in table 1 csh is an important physicochemical property that partly characterizes bacteria cell surface nonspecific adsorption to biotic or abiotic surfaces the hydrophobicity of bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis spores was much higher than that of other bacteria the structure of the spore surface exhibited a strong hydrophobic effect this can protect the cell interior from dissolved substances outside in the aqueous phase and may be an important reason for bacteria chlorine tolerance elhariry 2011 reported that the spore hydrophobicity of four bacillus sp including b cereus b coagulans b subtilis and b stearothermophilus was greater than that of their cells this may be due to the difference in bacteria and spore states which lead to alteration of their surface properties driks 2002 suggested that the main function of bacillus subtilis spore coats was protection however in the absence of disinfectants spore coat removal had little effect on spore activity foegeding 1985 observed that bacillus and clostridium species without spore coats were rapidly inactivated and proposed that the spore coat was the primary barrier against ozone inactivation this may result in bacterial tolerance to disinfectants other physiological and biochemical properties were determined by a starch hydrolysis test indole test v p test methyl red test etc table s2 and showed negative and positive control results the seven strains of bacteria were gradually identified and screened by the dichotomy method fig s4 3 2 environmental factors affecting the growth of chlorine resistant bacteria the bacteria concentration of water samples can be characterized by the optical density at 600 nm which revealed the growth process of chlorine resistant bacteria on this basis several environmental factors affecting the growth of bacteria were studied at a concentration of 106 108 cfu ml the absorbance values of seven bacterial strains were measured under different initial ph conditions in a liquid culture medium for 24 h the various bacteria concentrations at different ph values are shown in fig 3 a the optimum ph range for bacteria growth was 6 8 whereas a strong acid base environment was not conducive to the growth of these bacteria the seven strains of bacteria were cultured at 15 40 c and continuously monitored for 34 h in order to determine their optimum growth temperature and their approximate growth curve as shown in fig 3b1 b7 all strains grew slowly at low temperature 15 c and were rapidly cultured in 24 h at 30 c bacillus alvei bacillus cereus aeromonas jandaei and aeromonas sobria acclimatized well to the environment in 10 h and their od values were over 0 2 in the temperature range 25 40 c the adaptation times of the other three strains were longer the ph and temperature experiments indicated that these chlorine tolerant bacterial strains can grow rapidly and effectively in a relatively wide range of culture temperature and ph values which is significant for actual drinking water treatment plant regulations in order to investigate the influence of the turbidity of water samples from the actual drinking water treatment raw water 5 74 ntu raw water diluted four times 3 40 ntu pre filtered water 0 50 ntu and filtered water 0 14 ntu were chosen for the experiments the pasteurization method was carried out to reduce the interference of original bacteria in various water samples properly approximately 105 cfu ml of bacterial samples were added and cultured for more than 24 h the results showed that the quantity of bacteria typically decreased with decreasing water turbidity fig 3c in detail both raw water and diluted raw water promoted bacterial growth which exceeded nearly 1 log however bacteria quantity was reduced in pre filtered water and filtered water samples in pre filtered water samples the decrease of all bacterial strains except bacillus sp typically exceeded 1 log and aeromonas jandaei and aeromonas sobria even exceeded 2 log in filtered water samples the quantity of all bacterial strains was reduced by more than 2 log thus water composition has a substantial influence on bacterial growth with improvement of water quality during the drinking water treatment process bacterial living conditions become harsher resulting in a decrease of bacteria however when disinfection technology is not used a number of bacteria still remain in the water samples which poses the risk of outbreak in actual drinking water plants 3 3 effect of ozone inactivation on chlorine resistant bacteria 3 3 1 effect of ozone inactivation on bacterial strains fig 4 a shows the inactivation rate of all chlorine resistant bacterial strains at 1 5 mg l ozone concentration for 1 min the inactivation rate in decreasing order of five bacteria samples was aeromonas jandaei vogesella perlucida pelomonas bacillus cereus aeromonas sobria the logarithmic inactivation rate of bacillus alvei lysinibacillus fusiformis and bacillus cereus spores reached 2 33 2 10 and 1 97 respectively the inactivation efficiencies due to ozone disinfection of bacteria were approximately 3 log or more which were significantly higher than those of the spores 3 3 2 improved inactivation of bacillus cereus spores by ozone disinfection further experiments were conducted to explore the inactivation rate of spores by increasing the ozone concentration and treatment time bacillus cereus has been widely studied as pathogenic bacteria causing diarrhoea zhu et al 2014 reported that bacillus cereus spores exhibited good chlorine resistance even when a high level of chlorine residual was maintained in the water in this study we chose bacillus cereus spores for the subsequent experiments to determine suitable conditions for spore inactivation by ozone disinfection water samples were treated with ozone concentrations of 1 mg l 2 mg l and 3 mg l for 4 min e coli with exposure to 1 mg l ozone concentration was used as control as shown in fig 4b a similar increasing trend of ozone inactivation was observed for different ozone concentrations with increasing treatment time table 2 shows the inactivation kinetic formulas of bacillus cereus spores the inactivation rate constants are 0 3482 0 3579 and 0 3761 at ozone concentrations of 1 mg l 2 mg l and 3 mg l respectively the inactivation rate of e coli was 4 log in half a minute however the inactivation efficiency of spores reached more than 3 log in only 1 min when the ozone centration was 3 mg l therefore multiple dosages of ozone disinfecting agent might be required to achieve a higher sterilization effect cho et al 2006 investigated the synergistic inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores when ozone was used as the primary disinfectant the inactivation rate was minimally affected by residual chlorine pre treatment and a minimum ct value was observed in order to achieve inactivation of 3 log an aqueous ozone concentration of 4 mg min l was required which is similar to the results in this study devatkal et al 2016 studied the inactivation of bacillus cereus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium by aqueous ozone in pbs solution they found that the inactivation rate of bacillus cereus reached 4 log in the first 2 min with an ozone concentration of 0 5 1 5 mg l which was better than the results of this experiment this was mainly due to the difference of water quality compared with pbs the water samples used in this study had a complex composition and organic disturbance so the inactivation effect was reduced zheng et al 2017 found that the abundance of args antibiotic resistance genes had a high removal efficiency with an ozone concentration of 2 mg l but the removal efficiency was not significantly enhanced by further increasing the ozone concentration gassie and englehardt 2017 reviewed advanced oxidation and disinfection processes such as uv ozone hydrogen peroxide and chlorine according to their disinfection performance ozone was not effective on its own at inactivating bacteriophage ms2 the recommended enteric virus surrogate however fang et al 2014 determined that it is possible to achieve a 4 log reduction with a combined ozone uv process by motivating abundant hydrogen peroxide and free radicals therefore when ozone is used in combination with chlorine disinfection continuous antimicrobial activity can be guaranteed in engineering applications we also detected the inactivation rate of lysinibacillus fusiformis spores under the same ozone disinfection conditions fig s5 and table s3 it showed a trend similar to that of bacillus cereus spores 3 4 mechanisms of bacillus cereus spore inactivation by ozone disinfection 3 4 1 qualitative dna analysis by flow cytometry fcm provides a faster more descriptive and more representative method for cytology research wu et al 2018 van nevel et al 2017 recently fcm has been successfully utilized to determine various aspects of bacillus sp such as endospore germination and structure previously bacillus cereus endospores stained with the fluorescent nucleic acid dyes syto 9 propidium iodide pi hoechst 33342 or hydrolysis of carboxy fluorescein diacetate cfda were analysed using fcm different states of endospores were quantified during its germination and outgrowth process cronin and wilkinson 2007 2008 2010 furthermore j zheng et al 2017 applied fcm to easily and rapidly distinguish two morphological structures of bacillus licheniformis stained by sybr green i in this study sybr green i was used to stain bacillus cereus spores for fcm in fig 5 the lower left corner represents the background of water impurities and spores were positioned using fixed electronic gates in the dot plots the fluorescence peak of the water samples approximately 106 cfu ml concentration was transferred after dyeing the number of cells in the gates was approximately 50 000 representing 30 of all samples which was quantified by calculation however a few spores were not stained with the fluorescent dye due to the thickness of spore coats although the characteristics and numbers of spores are shown their germination state was not determined therefore fcm was only used for qualitative dna analysis fig 5 shows the fcm results of bacillus cereus spores before and after 1 mg l ozone concentration treatment the spore proportion of all cells was substantially reduced from 25 1 to 1 85 after ozone treatment of 2 min yet remained approximately stable between 2 min and 4 min 1 85 and 1 40 respectively as shown in the histograms the spores and impurities could not be clearly separated before staining but exhibited clear fluorescence peaks after staining however after ozone treatment the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly most of which was transferred to the impurities thus after ozone inactivation the amount of dna decreased sharply but some still existed lee et al 2016 observed similar results for e coli after ozone treatment by fcm when the ozone dose was increased intact cells were clearly shifted from their original position towards increased red fluorescence and decreased green fluorescence which reflected an increase of impurities furthermore the fluorescence peak of spores shifted to the left by a certain distance after inactivation this shift might be caused by damage of the cell structural integrity and subsequent staining ramseier et al 2011 wu et al 2018 investigated the ozone inactivation efficiencies of e coli by fcm with sgi pi staining the dot shifted counterclockwise quickly as the green fluorescence intensity was decreased but the red fluorescence intensity was increased which suggested that the e coli membrane is easily destroyed by ozone attack however when using high o3 doses both the red and green fluorescence intensities decreased which indicated severe damage to the entire cells 3 4 2 changes in dna absolute content the real time qpcr method was used to measure the dna absolute content of bacillus cereus spores as shown in fig s6 dna absolute content decreased by 3 4 indicating that most of the dna structure was destroyed and the target gene fragment was no longer available for reaction however approximately 1 4 of the target genes were left after inactivation in our experiment even after exposure to a high ozone dose a few spores remained with strong resistance to membrane damage particle shielding effects have been regarded as a probable method for preventing bacterial inactivation from ozone attack in previous studies zimmermann et al 2011 lee et al 2016 furthermore the amount of decreased genes did not reach 1 log while the inactivation rate reached 2 log with an ozone concentration of 1 mg l although some genetic material remained the cell external structure was destroyed by the ozone resulting in cell apoptosis or dissolution x zheng et al 2017 reported that ozone disinfection had the highest inactivation efficiency regarding the total bacterial count compared with chlorine and ultraviolet in contrast it had the lowest efficiency regarding the removal of antibiotic resistance genes args a possible explanation may be that ozone can oxidize most intracellular and extracellular substances but cannot specifically eliminate dna therefore cellular structural integrity was destroyed and most cell reproduction failed but some gene fragments were preserved 3 4 3 changes in spore morphology dna damage cannot be observed directly but cellular membrane damage was revealed by sem bacillus cereus spores before and after ozone treatment exhibited different shapes fig 6 before inactivation the spore surface was relatively smooth and the stereoscopic structure was visible after ozone inactivation the spores had shrunk and the original structure was seriously damaged ozone preferentially reacts with lipoproteins and polysaccharides on cell membranes resulting in cell membrane structure destruction and subsequent release of intracellular substances von gunten 2003 this is similar to the consequence of protein detection described by gassie and englehardt 2017 increases of extracellular protein mean that the cell structure has been destroyed and intracellular substances have been released into the surroundings liping wang 2017 reported the inactivation effect of b cereus spores treated by high pressure processing hpp and slightly acidic electrolysed water saew where approximately 80 90 of dipicolinic acid dpa was released 4 conclusion the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 the seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria isolated from drinking water grew well in a large range of environmental conditions ph temperature and turbidity representing a potential threat to drinking water safety 2 the chlorine resistant bacteria were more easily inactivated than the spores at low ozone concentrations the inactivation curves of bacillus cereus spores were similar at different concentrations of ozone the inactivation rate reached over 3 log with increasing ozone concentration and treatment time moreover the cell surface hydrophobicity of the spores was much stronger than that of bacteria which may result in spore tolerance to disinfection 3 after ozone inactivation the dna content of bacillus cereus spores decreased sharply but some target gene fragments remained the structure of spores changed dramatically which caused the release of intracellular substances therefore ozone disinfection is effective for chlorine resistant spores as it damages both the cell structure and gene fragments although these are positive steps for controlling the threat of chlorine resistant spores further work on the mechanism of spore formation and its large scale application in drinking water plants would increase the reliability of this approach conflicts of interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection

18747,the wide application of chlorine disinfectant for drinking water treatment has led to the appearance of chlorine resistant bacteria which pose a severe threat to public health this study was performed to explore the physiological biochemical characteristics and environmental influence ph temperature and turbidity of seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria isolated from drinking water ozone disinfection was used to investigate the inactivation effect of bacteria and spores the dna concentration and cell surface structure variations of typical chlorine resistant spores bacillus cereus spores were also analysed by real time qpcr flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy to determine their inactivation mechanisms the ozone resistance of bacteria aeromonas jandaei vogesella perlucida pelomonas bacillus cereus aeromonas sobria was lower than that of spores bacillus alvei lysinibacillus fusiformis bacillus cereus at an ozone concentration of 1 5 mg l more than 99 9 of bacillus cereus spores were inactivated by increasing ozone concentration and treatment duration moreover the dna content of bacillus cereus spores decreased sharply but approximately 1 4 of the target genes remained the spore structure exhibited shrinkage and folding after ozone treatment both cell structures and gene fragments were damaged by ozone disinfection these results showed that ozone disinfection is a promising method for inactivating chlorine resistant bacteria and spores in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water ozone disinfection chlorine resistant bacteria bacillus cereus spores inactivation mechanism 1 introduction chlorine based disinfectants have been widely utilized for traditional drinking water disinfection against most bacteria viruses and fungi around the world pereira et al 2013 simoes et al 2010 luh and mariñas 2007 however long term application of the chlorination process contributes to the preferential selection of chlorine resistant bacteria which are relatively insensitive to free chlorine in the aquatic environment such as distribution networks lautenschlager et al 2013 the appearance of chlorine resistant bacteria especially common pathogenic spores that exhibit better viability than others after disinfection treatment poses a clear threat to public health li et al 2013 for example aeromonas spp and bacillus cereus are both ubiquitous pathogens of human gastrointestinal disorders aeromonas jandaei is responsible for wound infections and enteritis and aeromonas sobria causes septicaemia stratev 2012 janda 1987 moreover bacillus cereus is generally considered as a cause of food poisoning through the expression of either emetic or diarrheal toxins stelder et al 2017 mckillip 2000 due to the potential risk of chlorine resistant bacteria research on alternative disinfection processes using ozone uv chlorine dioxide or combined processes has become an issue of public concern michael kordatou et al 2018 li et al 2018 gassie and englehardt 2017 bohn et al 2008 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 among these ozonation is typically efficient fast and regarded as a promising disinfection method for drinking water treatment especially for the inactivation of microorganisms for example the exposure of various bacteria pseudomonas fluorescens escherichia coli o157 h7 and leuconostoc mesenteroides to ozone at 2 5 ppm for 40 s caused a 5 6 log decrease in the bacteria count kim and yousef 2000 jamil et al 2017 studied the inactivation process of indicator microorganisms e coli and salmonella in drinking water using ozone treatment reporting a 5 and 6 log removal of salmonella after contact times of 45 s and 60 s respectively at an applied ozone concentration of 2 mg l however e coli was more resistant to ozonation than salmonella during the disinfection process with a mixed culture of the two microbes ozone oxidation reactions are typically divided into a direct molecular ozone reaction and an indirect oh radical reaction from the decomposition of ozone which produces a number of oxidative radicals and subsequently generates the hydroxyl radical von gunten 2003 cho et al 2002 ozone is often applied to drinking water along with chlorine or uv inactivation because of its lack of continuous disinfection ability for example jung et al 2008 investigated the synergistic effects of sequential ozone uv disinfection for the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores inactivation was enhanced by a pre ozonation process which assisted uv irradiation as a secondary disinfectant moreover they found that oh radicals which are induced by ozone decomposition play a significant role in activating the target microbial agent and contributed to 33 of the total log reduction cho et al 2006 observed that the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores was significantly enhanced by a disinfection system consisting of either o3 h2o2 combined or o3 h2o2 followed by free chlorine in 2014 abnormal growth of bacteria colonies was observed along the path of a drinking water treatment plant in southern china which could not be effectively controlled by an increase of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant for this study seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria were isolated from water samples collected in this area among them bacillus sp has strong disinfection resistance due to the presence of spores once these spores erupt and reach a certain abundance in the plant filter pool the total amount of bacteria in the water outlet exceeds the effluent index which poses a potential issue for the microbiological safety and quality of the drinking water therefore in this study we investigated the ability of ozone disinfection alone to inactivate seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria and spores from drinking water we also evaluated the factors influencing ozone disinfection of spores in addition the inactivation mechanisms of bacillus cereus spores were determined by investigating the changes in dna content and spore morphology we aim to reveal a convenient and efficient disinfection process to address the emerging threat to drinking water safety caused by spores 2 material and methods 2 1 water samples filtered water samples were collected from the tube to the clean water reservoir of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in southern china without adding large amounts of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant raw water samples were collected from the water inlet and pre filtered water samples were colleted before the water passed through a v filter these samples were kept at 4 c during storage and shipment and the experiments were conducted within 48 h the treatment process followed at the drinking water treatment plant is depicted in fig s1 the characteristics of raw water were as follows water temperature 25 45 c ph 7 09 turbidity 9 34 ntu cod 3 05 mg l total bacteria count 817 27 cfu ml total e coli 1309 cfu 100 ml total thermostable e coli 73 cfu 100 ml and dissolved oxygen 6 60 mg l the characteristics of filtered water were as follows water temperature 25 85 c ph 7 28 turbidity 0 11 ntu cod 1 13 mg l total bacteria count nd refer to not detectable total e coli nd total thermostable e coli nd and dissolved oxygen 7 49 mg l 2 2 cultivation and preservation of bacteria and spores 2 2 1 bacterial strains in this study seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria were isolated from a municipal drinking water treatment plant in southern china the isolation process employed the gradient dilution coating method first abnormal water samples were collected after culturing with solid nutrient agar at 35 2 0 c for 24 h colonies with different morphologies were picked out for purification of cultures the process was repeated until a pure bacterial strain was obtained isolated bacterial strains were identified as bacillus alvei bacillus cereus aeromonas jandaei aeromonas sobria lysinibacillus fusiformis vogesella perlucida and pelomonas some of these strains have been reported as chlorine resistant bacteria scoaris et al 2008 nam et al 2014 paes et al 2012 roi et al 2015 among the strains bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis were bacillus sp which exhibits spores with strong thermostability and resistance to common disinfectants the 16s rdna gene sequencing data were submitted to ncbi s bankit and the genbank accession numbers were mk432812 mk418684 and mk418685 in addition some experiments considered e coli for contrast which was isolated from municipal sewage in southern china and screened on an iron methylene blue medium 2 2 2 cultivation of bacteria different strains of bacteria were cultured with solid nutrient agar huankai china at 35 2 0 c for 12 24 h pure colonies were washed into test tubes with sterilized phosphate buffer saline pbs solution each sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and subsequently suspended in sterilized pbs solution three times the optical density od of the bacterial suspension was measured at 600 nm to determine the cell density the calibration curve is shown in fig s2 for the optimum concentration range 106 108 colony forming units per millilitre cfu ml excessive concentrations of bacteria were diluted for the following analysis 2 2 3 cultivation and preservation of spores both bacteria and spore states of bacillus sp bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis were used in the following experiments bacillus sp were induced on solid nutrient agar due to the lack of nutrition spores appeared on the surface after a 48 h cultivation process at 35 2 0 c after identification by malachite green the bacteria and spore mixture was prepared as described in section 2 2 2 and stored in phosphate buffer saline pbs at 4 c for 24 h the final spore sample concentrations were 105 106 cfu ml according to microscopic examination bx41 olympus japan and were preserved at 4 c for one month before each experiment the spore suspension was centrifuged and suspended with pbs 2 3 times and then shaken adequately to separate the independent spores 2 2 4 specific chromogenic medium of bacillus cereus among the seven strains of bacteria bacillus cereus can be differentiated using specific chromogenic medium which represents a better alternative than the conventional standard medium fricker et al 2008 peng et al 2001 the modified specific chromogenic medium used in the experiments was hb7021 2 hopebio china on this medium bacillus cereus appears as a large blue green colony surrounded by an opaque ring bacillus thuringiensis appears blue green listeria sp appears as a smaller dark blue colony other bacteria appear yellow or colourless and gram negative bacteria were inhibited within a 12 h culture at 35 c the principle of the chromogenic medium is that the peptone and yeast extract were used as basic nutrients to provide carbon and nitrogen sources and trace elements and the sodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were used as buffers by adding mixed pigments the substrate was hydrolysed and the chromogenic groups were released by the specific reaction with the enzymes related to bacillus cereus which was then visible as green or blue green colonies a rapid process to detect chlorine resistant bacteria in drinking water is described in text s1 2 3 ozone inactivation experiments 2 3 1 ozone generator and inactivation conditions ozone was produced by a horizontal mini type ozone generator guolin china in order to maximize aqueous ozone concentration ozone was continuously aerated into pure cooling water for more than 2 h after measuring the ozone concentration in water the corresponding volume of ozonated water was added to the water sample and the inactivation effect was controlled by sampling at a certain time ozone was rapidly consumed in water in the first few minutes and then much more slowly during the rest of the reaction even if higher ozone concentrations were used ozone consumption could not be prevented fan et al 2013 all experiments were conducted with filtered water samples and exposed to different ozone concentrations at approximately 25 c sodium thiosulfate 1 mol l was used as a terminating agent to avoid residual ozone in samples dong et al 2018 the entire process was operated under closed conditions 2 3 2 determination of ozone concentration ozone concentration was determined by potassium indigo trisulfonate spectrophotometry ozone can oxidize potassium indigo trisulfonate from blue to colourless at ph 2 0 the ozone concentration was calculated using the following formula 1 c o 3 v x a ε d v 0 m 10 3 2 4 a 0 a 1 v x v 0 where c o 3 is the ozone concentration in water mg l a 0 and a 1 represent the absorbance before and after ozone addition v x is the volume of the water sample usually 10 ml v 0 is the volume of the ozone disinfectant usually 0 2 ml m is the ozone molar mass g mol d is the thickness of the cuvette 1 cm and ε is the indigo molar absorptivity 2000 l mol 1 cm 1 2 3 3 determination of inactivation effect the ozone inactivation effect was determined by the dilution method of plate counting samples were diluted to 1 10 1 100 and 1 1000 in sequence each step was repeated three times 0 1 ml of these samples was spread to each plant distributed between each plate and incubated for 24 h clear colonies were counted by the standard plate counting method the colony effective detection range is 30 300 cfu on a petri dish the inactivation efficiency was measured by the logarithmic inactivation rate lg n 0 n t where n 0 and n t represent the number of bacteria before and after inactivation 2 4 cell surface hydrophobicity cell surface hydrophobicity was determined by microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons math briefly 4 ml of bacterial suspension approximately 108 cfu ml was added to the test tube then 1 5 ml of n hexane was added as the organic phase the mixture was shaken violently for 1 min then separated into two phases after 15 min standing at 20 1 c the lower phase was quickly absorbed with sterile disposable needles the absorbance a value was determined by spectrophotometer at 600 nm with pbs as a blank control the analysis was repeated three times for each sample the cell surface hydrophobic rate csh was calculated by the following formula 2 c s h control a 600 nm test a 600 nm control a 600 nm 100 2 5 analytical methods of inactivation mechanisms 2 5 1 fluorescence staining and flow cytometry in this study flow cytometry fcm with fluorescence staining was performed for qualitative dna analysis according to the method in hammes et al 2008 cells in water samples were stained with 10 μl ml sybr green i 1 100 dilution in dmso molecular probes and incubated in the dark for at least 15 min then observed by the flow cytometer facscalibur bd america control groups without fluorescence staining were also prepared the scattering light detectors of fcm are divided into side scatter ssc and forward scatter fsc ssc is more sensitive to the refractivity of the cell cytoplasm and nuclear membrane while fsc is closely related to cell size this study used dot plots of ssc vs fsc to distinguish bacterial cells from the sample background these cells were gated manually using the flowjo software bd america in addition sybr green i has an excitation maxima at 497 nm and an emission maxima at 520 nm however emission can also be detected above 600 nm hammes and egli 2005 therefore fluorescence was collected in the fl2 channel 585 nm we used plots of counts vs fl2 to qualitatively analyse changes in the cell counts before and after inactivation 2 5 2 real time qpcr dna quantitative analysis was determined using real time qpcr ultrasonication was used as the cell disruption method and dna was extracted using a dna kit mp america dna purity was detected by nano drop 2000 shimadzu japan at 260 nm and 280 nm respectively the absorbance value ratio of 260 nm 280 nm was assumed to be 1 8 2 0 the real time qpcr method was slightly modified from that reported previously wehrle et al 2010 each qpcr reaction mixture 20 μl consisted of 2 sg green qpcr mix 10 μl forward primer 10 μm 0 5 μl reverse primer 10 μm 0 5 μl gdna 1 μl and nuclease free water 8 μl the qpcr reaction program was performed under the following steps one cycle at 95 c for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 20 s then subsequent 60 c for 30 s in this study bacillus cereus was used as a case study to detect the dna content in actual water samples the specific primers in the sequence of the standard gene fragment were as follows forward primer 5 ccttcttcaagttcaaatctcg 3 reverse primer 5 gtygtaatgacaggtgatgga 3 where y is t and c the calibration curve between the standard gene fragment concentration and the ct value which is the pcr cycle number when the fluorescence value reaches the threshold and has a linear relationship with the logarithm of the initial template dna content copy μl is shown in fig 1 the formula is ct klog dna c k 2 746 c 38 065 r 2 0 99 combined with the filter membrane method the actual water samples were enriched and quantitatively determined within 1 h then the dna was extracted from the filter membrane and prepared for real time qpcr system detection the linear correlation curve of the dna concentrations ng μ l vs filtered water sample volume is shown in fig 2 the dna concentrations corresponding to different ct values are also included the formulas are y1 0 6984x 5 3105 r 2 0 9997 and y2 0 0157 x 28 668 r 2 0 9916 respectively 2 5 3 scanning electron microscopy the surface structure of the spores was observed by scanning electron microscope sem the spore suspension was filtered by a filter membrane and placed in a test tube for pre treatment briefly the samples were fixed by 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution for 2 h washed with pbs three times dehydrated with different ratios of ethanol pbs for 15 min each time then dried overnight at 40 c for subsequent observation 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorine tolerant bacteria isolated from drinking water treatment plant 3 1 1 physiological and biochemical properties of chlorine tolerant bacteria the seven strains of chlorine tolerant bacteria exhibited different structural features and different physiological and biochemical characteristics a detailed description of the physiological characteristics of the colony morphologies of all strains is listed in table s1 the existence of spores was detected qualitatively and rapidly by microscopic examination bacteria were typically rod shaped or curved and approximately 3 5 μm long whereas the spores were typically approximately 1 2 μ with good refraction and could be dyed by malachite green the microscopic observation results of several strains are shown in fig s3 3 1 2 cell surface hydrophobicity of chlorine tolerant bacterial strains the cell surface hydrophobicity csh of all seven strains of bacteria and spores is shown in table 1 csh is an important physicochemical property that partly characterizes bacteria cell surface nonspecific adsorption to biotic or abiotic surfaces the hydrophobicity of bacillus alvei bacillus cereus and lysinibacillus fusiformis spores was much higher than that of other bacteria the structure of the spore surface exhibited a strong hydrophobic effect this can protect the cell interior from dissolved substances outside in the aqueous phase and may be an important reason for bacteria chlorine tolerance elhariry 2011 reported that the spore hydrophobicity of four bacillus sp including b cereus b coagulans b subtilis and b stearothermophilus was greater than that of their cells this may be due to the difference in bacteria and spore states which lead to alteration of their surface properties driks 2002 suggested that the main function of bacillus subtilis spore coats was protection however in the absence of disinfectants spore coat removal had little effect on spore activity foegeding 1985 observed that bacillus and clostridium species without spore coats were rapidly inactivated and proposed that the spore coat was the primary barrier against ozone inactivation this may result in bacterial tolerance to disinfectants other physiological and biochemical properties were determined by a starch hydrolysis test indole test v p test methyl red test etc table s2 and showed negative and positive control results the seven strains of bacteria were gradually identified and screened by the dichotomy method fig s4 3 2 environmental factors affecting the growth of chlorine resistant bacteria the bacteria concentration of water samples can be characterized by the optical density at 600 nm which revealed the growth process of chlorine resistant bacteria on this basis several environmental factors affecting the growth of bacteria were studied at a concentration of 106 108 cfu ml the absorbance values of seven bacterial strains were measured under different initial ph conditions in a liquid culture medium for 24 h the various bacteria concentrations at different ph values are shown in fig 3 a the optimum ph range for bacteria growth was 6 8 whereas a strong acid base environment was not conducive to the growth of these bacteria the seven strains of bacteria were cultured at 15 40 c and continuously monitored for 34 h in order to determine their optimum growth temperature and their approximate growth curve as shown in fig 3b1 b7 all strains grew slowly at low temperature 15 c and were rapidly cultured in 24 h at 30 c bacillus alvei bacillus cereus aeromonas jandaei and aeromonas sobria acclimatized well to the environment in 10 h and their od values were over 0 2 in the temperature range 25 40 c the adaptation times of the other three strains were longer the ph and temperature experiments indicated that these chlorine tolerant bacterial strains can grow rapidly and effectively in a relatively wide range of culture temperature and ph values which is significant for actual drinking water treatment plant regulations in order to investigate the influence of the turbidity of water samples from the actual drinking water treatment raw water 5 74 ntu raw water diluted four times 3 40 ntu pre filtered water 0 50 ntu and filtered water 0 14 ntu were chosen for the experiments the pasteurization method was carried out to reduce the interference of original bacteria in various water samples properly approximately 105 cfu ml of bacterial samples were added and cultured for more than 24 h the results showed that the quantity of bacteria typically decreased with decreasing water turbidity fig 3c in detail both raw water and diluted raw water promoted bacterial growth which exceeded nearly 1 log however bacteria quantity was reduced in pre filtered water and filtered water samples in pre filtered water samples the decrease of all bacterial strains except bacillus sp typically exceeded 1 log and aeromonas jandaei and aeromonas sobria even exceeded 2 log in filtered water samples the quantity of all bacterial strains was reduced by more than 2 log thus water composition has a substantial influence on bacterial growth with improvement of water quality during the drinking water treatment process bacterial living conditions become harsher resulting in a decrease of bacteria however when disinfection technology is not used a number of bacteria still remain in the water samples which poses the risk of outbreak in actual drinking water plants 3 3 effect of ozone inactivation on chlorine resistant bacteria 3 3 1 effect of ozone inactivation on bacterial strains fig 4 a shows the inactivation rate of all chlorine resistant bacterial strains at 1 5 mg l ozone concentration for 1 min the inactivation rate in decreasing order of five bacteria samples was aeromonas jandaei vogesella perlucida pelomonas bacillus cereus aeromonas sobria the logarithmic inactivation rate of bacillus alvei lysinibacillus fusiformis and bacillus cereus spores reached 2 33 2 10 and 1 97 respectively the inactivation efficiencies due to ozone disinfection of bacteria were approximately 3 log or more which were significantly higher than those of the spores 3 3 2 improved inactivation of bacillus cereus spores by ozone disinfection further experiments were conducted to explore the inactivation rate of spores by increasing the ozone concentration and treatment time bacillus cereus has been widely studied as pathogenic bacteria causing diarrhoea zhu et al 2014 reported that bacillus cereus spores exhibited good chlorine resistance even when a high level of chlorine residual was maintained in the water in this study we chose bacillus cereus spores for the subsequent experiments to determine suitable conditions for spore inactivation by ozone disinfection water samples were treated with ozone concentrations of 1 mg l 2 mg l and 3 mg l for 4 min e coli with exposure to 1 mg l ozone concentration was used as control as shown in fig 4b a similar increasing trend of ozone inactivation was observed for different ozone concentrations with increasing treatment time table 2 shows the inactivation kinetic formulas of bacillus cereus spores the inactivation rate constants are 0 3482 0 3579 and 0 3761 at ozone concentrations of 1 mg l 2 mg l and 3 mg l respectively the inactivation rate of e coli was 4 log in half a minute however the inactivation efficiency of spores reached more than 3 log in only 1 min when the ozone centration was 3 mg l therefore multiple dosages of ozone disinfecting agent might be required to achieve a higher sterilization effect cho et al 2006 investigated the synergistic inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores when ozone was used as the primary disinfectant the inactivation rate was minimally affected by residual chlorine pre treatment and a minimum ct value was observed in order to achieve inactivation of 3 log an aqueous ozone concentration of 4 mg min l was required which is similar to the results in this study devatkal et al 2016 studied the inactivation of bacillus cereus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium by aqueous ozone in pbs solution they found that the inactivation rate of bacillus cereus reached 4 log in the first 2 min with an ozone concentration of 0 5 1 5 mg l which was better than the results of this experiment this was mainly due to the difference of water quality compared with pbs the water samples used in this study had a complex composition and organic disturbance so the inactivation effect was reduced zheng et al 2017 found that the abundance of args antibiotic resistance genes had a high removal efficiency with an ozone concentration of 2 mg l but the removal efficiency was not significantly enhanced by further increasing the ozone concentration gassie and englehardt 2017 reviewed advanced oxidation and disinfection processes such as uv ozone hydrogen peroxide and chlorine according to their disinfection performance ozone was not effective on its own at inactivating bacteriophage ms2 the recommended enteric virus surrogate however fang et al 2014 determined that it is possible to achieve a 4 log reduction with a combined ozone uv process by motivating abundant hydrogen peroxide and free radicals therefore when ozone is used in combination with chlorine disinfection continuous antimicrobial activity can be guaranteed in engineering applications we also detected the inactivation rate of lysinibacillus fusiformis spores under the same ozone disinfection conditions fig s5 and table s3 it showed a trend similar to that of bacillus cereus spores 3 4 mechanisms of bacillus cereus spore inactivation by ozone disinfection 3 4 1 qualitative dna analysis by flow cytometry fcm provides a faster more descriptive and more representative method for cytology research wu et al 2018 van nevel et al 2017 recently fcm has been successfully utilized to determine various aspects of bacillus sp such as endospore germination and structure previously bacillus cereus endospores stained with the fluorescent nucleic acid dyes syto 9 propidium iodide pi hoechst 33342 or hydrolysis of carboxy fluorescein diacetate cfda were analysed using fcm different states of endospores were quantified during its germination and outgrowth process cronin and wilkinson 2007 2008 2010 furthermore j zheng et al 2017 applied fcm to easily and rapidly distinguish two morphological structures of bacillus licheniformis stained by sybr green i in this study sybr green i was used to stain bacillus cereus spores for fcm in fig 5 the lower left corner represents the background of water impurities and spores were positioned using fixed electronic gates in the dot plots the fluorescence peak of the water samples approximately 106 cfu ml concentration was transferred after dyeing the number of cells in the gates was approximately 50 000 representing 30 of all samples which was quantified by calculation however a few spores were not stained with the fluorescent dye due to the thickness of spore coats although the characteristics and numbers of spores are shown their germination state was not determined therefore fcm was only used for qualitative dna analysis fig 5 shows the fcm results of bacillus cereus spores before and after 1 mg l ozone concentration treatment the spore proportion of all cells was substantially reduced from 25 1 to 1 85 after ozone treatment of 2 min yet remained approximately stable between 2 min and 4 min 1 85 and 1 40 respectively as shown in the histograms the spores and impurities could not be clearly separated before staining but exhibited clear fluorescence peaks after staining however after ozone treatment the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly most of which was transferred to the impurities thus after ozone inactivation the amount of dna decreased sharply but some still existed lee et al 2016 observed similar results for e coli after ozone treatment by fcm when the ozone dose was increased intact cells were clearly shifted from their original position towards increased red fluorescence and decreased green fluorescence which reflected an increase of impurities furthermore the fluorescence peak of spores shifted to the left by a certain distance after inactivation this shift might be caused by damage of the cell structural integrity and subsequent staining ramseier et al 2011 wu et al 2018 investigated the ozone inactivation efficiencies of e coli by fcm with sgi pi staining the dot shifted counterclockwise quickly as the green fluorescence intensity was decreased but the red fluorescence intensity was increased which suggested that the e coli membrane is easily destroyed by ozone attack however when using high o3 doses both the red and green fluorescence intensities decreased which indicated severe damage to the entire cells 3 4 2 changes in dna absolute content the real time qpcr method was used to measure the dna absolute content of bacillus cereus spores as shown in fig s6 dna absolute content decreased by 3 4 indicating that most of the dna structure was destroyed and the target gene fragment was no longer available for reaction however approximately 1 4 of the target genes were left after inactivation in our experiment even after exposure to a high ozone dose a few spores remained with strong resistance to membrane damage particle shielding effects have been regarded as a probable method for preventing bacterial inactivation from ozone attack in previous studies zimmermann et al 2011 lee et al 2016 furthermore the amount of decreased genes did not reach 1 log while the inactivation rate reached 2 log with an ozone concentration of 1 mg l although some genetic material remained the cell external structure was destroyed by the ozone resulting in cell apoptosis or dissolution x zheng et al 2017 reported that ozone disinfection had the highest inactivation efficiency regarding the total bacterial count compared with chlorine and ultraviolet in contrast it had the lowest efficiency regarding the removal of antibiotic resistance genes args a possible explanation may be that ozone can oxidize most intracellular and extracellular substances but cannot specifically eliminate dna therefore cellular structural integrity was destroyed and most cell reproduction failed but some gene fragments were preserved 3 4 3 changes in spore morphology dna damage cannot be observed directly but cellular membrane damage was revealed by sem bacillus cereus spores before and after ozone treatment exhibited different shapes fig 6 before inactivation the spore surface was relatively smooth and the stereoscopic structure was visible after ozone inactivation the spores had shrunk and the original structure was seriously damaged ozone preferentially reacts with lipoproteins and polysaccharides on cell membranes resulting in cell membrane structure destruction and subsequent release of intracellular substances von gunten 2003 this is similar to the consequence of protein detection described by gassie and englehardt 2017 increases of extracellular protein mean that the cell structure has been destroyed and intracellular substances have been released into the surroundings liping wang 2017 reported the inactivation effect of b cereus spores treated by high pressure processing hpp and slightly acidic electrolysed water saew where approximately 80 90 of dipicolinic acid dpa was released 4 conclusion the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 the seven strains of chlorine resistant bacteria isolated from drinking water grew well in a large range of environmental conditions ph temperature and turbidity representing a potential threat to drinking water safety 2 the chlorine resistant bacteria were more easily inactivated than the spores at low ozone concentrations the inactivation curves of bacillus cereus spores were similar at different concentrations of ozone the inactivation rate reached over 3 log with increasing ozone concentration and treatment time moreover the cell surface hydrophobicity of the spores was much stronger than that of bacteria which may result in spore tolerance to disinfection 3 after ozone inactivation the dna content of bacillus cereus spores decreased sharply but some target gene fragments remained the structure of spores changed dramatically which caused the release of intracellular substances therefore ozone disinfection is effective for chlorine resistant spores as it damages both the cell structure and gene fragments although these are positive steps for controlling the threat of chlorine resistant spores further work on the mechanism of spore formation and its large scale application in drinking water plants would increase the reliability of this approach conflicts of interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection

18748,the application and fate of antibiotics are closely related to human health and the ecological balance which has gradually aroused the widespread global concerns long term antibiotic residues can easily induce antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment although many studies have investigated the metabolic pathways of biosynthesis or degradation of oxytetracycline otc and its influencing factors under laboratory or controlled conditions the understanding of otc degradation pathways and influencing factors in the environment is still poor in the present study the role of pseudomonas t4 in otc biodegradation were investigated with different carbon sources metal ions substrate concentrations temperatures and ph values as well as the temporal changes in the relative abundance of otc args it was found that otc could be degraded by t4 as a sole carbon source comparison with cu2 the addition of fe3 could significantly promote the growth of t4 and then increased the otc degradation percentage to 65 3 the initial concentration of otc temperature and ph had significant impacts on otc degradation at the initial otc concentration of 50 mg l 1 the percentage degradation of otc by t4 could reach 81 0 at the presence of fe3 and at 40 c and ph 7 common tetracycline args were not found during the otc degradation by t4 in the present study the eight main putative otc degradation byproducts were identified by ultra high definition accurate mass quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry qtof ms six different reaction types and seven possible degradation pathways were proposed including enol ketone conversion hydroxylation dehydration deamination demethylation and decarbonylation under optimal conditions the otc degradation percentages by t4 could reach to 88 2 91 6 and 92 0 in pond water fish wastewater and industrial wastewater respectively these results demonstrate the high effectiveness of t4 at the presence of fe3 for the enhanced biodegradation of otc in water environment without resulting in the occurrence of args this has important implications for the removal of otc from aquatic environments by the technology proposed from this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxytetracycline biodegradation antibiotic resistance genes degradation pathways and metabolites 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps a new class of pollutants have received increasing attention in recent years approximately 3 000 types of ppcps are now used in medicines such as painkillers and antibiotics according to the european union eu ternes et al 2004 ye dingyi et al 2006 veterinary antibiotics vas for example are frequently used in aquaculture and poultry farming as growth promoting agents and disease prevention drugs as a result they have gradually entered and accumulated in environments such as water and soils chen et al 2014 kemper 2008 phillips et al 2004 oxytetracycline otc a broad spectrum antibiotic with the formula shown in fig 1 is a common tetracycline antibiotic that is widely used in poultry and animal farms around the world however otc cannot be absorbed well by animals and approximately 90 of antibiotics are released into the environment in the form of their parent or metabolites alcock et al 1999 otc residues have been detected in environments worldwide kumar et al 2005 in the united states the residual amount of otc can reach 0 34 μg l 1 in the surface water liu et al 2016c yang and carlson 2003 otc residues in australian urban water and danish soil can reach 0 35 μg l 1 and 2 5 50 mg kg 1 respectively kong et al 2007 yan et al 2013 it was also found that the concentration of otc residues in a sewage treatment plant in china reached 20 800 mg l 1 with the consumption of otc reaching the high amount of to 1360 t in 2013 zhang et al 2015 long term exposure of microorganisms to antibiotics in the environment even at the low level of 0 34 μg l 1 is likely to induce resistance and resistance genes in surrounding microorganisms zhu et al 2013 an aquatic ecosystem is a complex system composed of organisms living in a given habitat therefore there is no specific provisions and uniform standards worldwide for threshold of antibiotics such as otc in water environment in term of the algae anabaena cylindrical is the most sensitive to otc among all the selected aquatic organisms with the ec50 values of 0 03 mg l 1 and tetraselmis chuii is the most resistant to otc with the ec50 values of 11 18 mg l 1 zhao et al 2013 as has been previously reported in the literature the fish is the most resistant to otc and daphnia has the middle resistance to otc and algae is the most sensitive to otc in water environment now the acceptable otc level especially in aquatic environment is still not set thus it is very important to effectively degrade and remove otc and its derivatives in the environment there are many proposed methods for removal of the residual otc in the environment including advanced oxidation processes activated carbon adsorption low temperature plasma technology membrane bioreactors and biodegradation processes darweesh and ahmed 2017 liu et al 2016b rivera utrilla et al 2018 sahar et al 2011 sokolov and louhikultanen 2018 these processes have played a great role in removing otc residues from environments the biodegradation process approach has gradually attracted more attention due to its simplicity and low cost maki et al 2006 chen et al 2019b fe is not only one of the essential trace metal elements for microbial growth but also an important cofactor of microbial enzyme activity it exists mainly in the form of oxide in the environment fe2o3 is a widely used material and fe3 plays a significant role in promoting microbial fuel cells thus the application of fe3 combined with microorganisms may promote the microbial degradation of antibiotics in addition biodegradation methods for removing antibiotic residues such as otc are difficult to apply widely because of the lack of understanding about whether antibiotic resistance genes and metabolites are introduced into the environment therefore the objectives of the present study are 1 to characterize the positive effect of fe3 on microbial degradation of otc 2 to investigate the dynamic changes of common tetracycline antibiotics resistance genes over time 7 days such as tet a tet m tet o and tet w and 3 to understand the potential metabolites of otc degradation by microorganisms and the associated mechanisms in the presence

otc biodegradation 2 3 1 degradation of otc by t4 bacteria t4 bacteria were isolated from soils contaminated by otc in our laboratory before the experiment the bacteria were identified as pseudomonas via 16s rdna gene sequence analysis meng et al 2018 the colony morphology of t4 is round smooth and opaque milky white colonies with a diameter of 0 2 0 4 cm at 30 c on beef extract peptone medium in three days there were two treatments set up in the experiment including 1 otc only otc was added to the inorganic salt medium and 2 otc t4 both otc and t4 bacteria were added to the inorganic salt medium each treatment was performed in triplicate the 100 ml of inorganic salt medium ism nh4cl 1g nacl 1g k2hpo4 1 5g kh2po4 0 5g mgso4 0 2g distilled water 1l and ph 7 was added to a 250 ml tube which was wrapped by foil to avoid the photodecomposition reaction occurrence of otc and was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min then 1 0 ml of otc water solution with a concentration of 5 mg ml 1 was added to the tube with ism yielding a final otc concentration of 50 mg l 1 after its temperature decreased to room temperature 25 c for otc t4 treatment a total of 1 0 ml of t4 bacteria solution 3 0 108 cfu ml 1 at the logarithmic growth stage was added to the tube all the above operations were carried out in the ultraclean workbench with no microorganisms and darkness conditions all the tubes containing the solution mixture were incubated at 30 c in a constant temperature and light proof shaker with a rotational speed of 150 r min 1 during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 3 2 different carbon sources four types of carbon sources including starch maltose beef extract peptone and yeast extract and inorganic salt liquid medium were used to investigate the efficiency of otc degradation by t4 with different carbon sources each carbon source was replicated 3 times the liquid medium was prepared and sterilized otc t4 were added according to the methods described in 2 3 1 in addition the only otc adding without t4 adding treatment were set for each carbon sources to eliminate the difference in otc spontaneous degradation at different carbon source during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 3 3 different metal ions to investigate the enhanced efficiency of otc degradation by t4 in the presence of common metal ion pairs cu2 and fe3 were selected in the present study two treatments were set 1 otc t4 1 and cu2 0 1 were adding together 2 otc t4 1 and fe3 0 1 were adding together fe3 and cu2 were selected based on the following facts 1 copper is an essential microelement for domestic animals such as pig chicken and cow and is often used as a feed additive to promote domestic animal growth in livestock farm 2 it has been reported that lots of organic compounds including antibiotics can be removed by cu and fe3o4 nanomaterials pham et al 2018a 2018b the liquid medium was prepared and sterilized otc t4 were added according to the methods described in 2 3 1 cu2 and fe3 were added in the form of cuso4 5h2o and fecl3 6h2o respectively during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 4 influencing factor experiments there were three influencing factors substrate concentration temperature and ph there were five different substrate concentrations including 5 10 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 and four different temperatures including 25 30 35 and 40 c in addition seven different ph values were set as 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 four otc systems were set such as otc otc t4 otc t4 fe3 and otc fe3 in the present experiment each factor at each level was performed in triplicate the liquid medium was prepared and sterilized otc t4 and fe3 were added by the same methods described in 2 3 1 during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 5 detection of args related to common tetracycline antibiotics in otc removal solution the args monitoring experiment was conducted by using a real time sampling and detection by real time fluorescent quantitative pcr under optimal degradation conditions common tetracycline antibiotic resistance genes including tet a tet m tet o and tet w were selected for monitoring over 7 days there were two treatments 1 otc and 2 otc t4 1 fe3 0 1 the sampling times were 1 3 5 and 7 days otc t4 and fe3 were added by the same methods described in 2 3 3 2 6 application of t4 in the presence of fe3 in real water matrix there were two treatments including 1 otc t4 1 and 2 otc t4 1 fe3 0 1 in the present experiment three different water matrices were selected such as sewage plant wastewater aquaculture water and pond water the otc concentration was 50 mg l 1 the samples were collected on 3 days after treatment 2 7 statistical analysis spss statistics version 19 software was used for statistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine if treatment means were significantly different and duncan s multiple range tests was performed to determine if the individual means were different from each another mass hunter b 07 00 agilent was used to further determine the otc metabolites under the action of microorganisms chem draw ultra 8 0 was used to visualize molecular structures 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of otc 3 1 1 biodegradation of otc over time as shown in fig 2 the percentage degradation of otc increased with time with a value of nearly 34 1 in the t4 treatment and only 17 4 in the treatment without t4 on day 7 furthermore the residual amount of otc was reduced for all four sampling times i e on day 1 3 5 and 7 the degradation rates with bacteria t4 were 14 3 and 16 7 higher than those withoutt4 for days 5 and 7 respectively in fact the degradation rates with t4 were significantly different from those at the treatment without bacteria on both days 5 and 7 the results indicate that otc could undergo spontaneous degradation reactions but the spontaneous degradation is slow xuan et al 2010 our findings are consistent with previous reports that otc is a special antibiotic that is more difficult than other antibiotics to degrade in the environment pouliquen et al 2007 3 1 2 role of different carbon sources and metal ions in the biodegradation of otc biodegradation is the process of converting organic compounds to a lower complexity or simple inorganic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide co2 nzila 2013 organic pollutants are eliminated by microorganisms mainly through co metabolism as a carbon source co metabolism is a process in which organic compounds are biodegraded in the presence of only primary energy materials the degradation of otc by t4 with different carbon sources namely starch maltose beef extract peptone yeast extract and ism is shown in fig 3 a among the first four carbon sources starch had the best effect on degradation of otc while beef extract peptone the worst effect compared with these carbon sources the percentage degradation was nearly 34 1 in inorganic salts and this weak degradation was most likely caused by hydrolysis in the other carbon sources for 7 days beef extract peptone can provide rich carbon sources nitrogen sources and vitamin c to meet the requirements of microbial growth the t4 competes with the beef extract peptone at a disadvantage which resulted in otc degradation being not effective in the carbon source material solution the experimental results agree with the principle of screening bacteria for pollutant degradation in which antibiotics are consumed by microbes as the only carbon source that is otc was degraded as a carbon source by t4 some similar results have been reported for sphingomonas paucimobilis which could utilize fluoranthene as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth and degraded a variety of high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs ye et al 1996 on the one hand organic pollutants are used as carbon sources to promote the growth of microorganisms which can secrete enzymes to catalyze the biodegradation of otc on the other hand if there is competition between otc and energy substances in the same reaction system microorganisms will preferentially consume the additional carbon sources and pollution is easily produced by the excess energy substances which is not conducive to the reaction metal ions play important roles in microbial growth in this study 0 1 fe3 and 0 1 cu2 were added into the reaction system to promote the biodegradation of otc the results revealed that fe3 can promote the percentage degradation of otc up to 65 3 as shown in fig 3 b the effect of cu2 was not as obvious as that of fe3 and the highest percentage degradation only reached to 34 0 within 7 days the otc degradation rate was slow from day 3 to day 5 after fe3 was added the difference was found for the otc degradation in response to fe3 and cu2 additions on both day 3 and 5 the degradation rate of otc under the addition of fe3 was 30 7 higher than that under the addition of cu2 on day 3 t4 secretes a low molecular weight active polypeptide that chelates the vitro of iron which promotes the growth of t4 ratledge and dover 2000 thus increasing the biodegradation of otc since fe is an essential microelement for organisms the addition of fe3 is conducive to the microbial degradation reaction 3 2 other factors influencing otc biodegradation 3 2 1 effect of substrate concentration on the biodegradation of otc the initial otc concentrations 5 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 significantly affected the degradation of otc by t4 fig 4 the effects of different initial otc concentration on the degradation of otc followed the order of 50 25 10 5 100 mg l 1 the percentage degradation of otc at 50 mg l 1 reached 32 0 when treated with t4 only figs 4 a and 65 5 treated with the combination of t4 and fe3 fig 4 b respectively the od values varied from 0 062 to 0 123 in the presence of t4 and from 0 062 to 0 736 in the presence of t4 and fe3 respectively it indicates that fe3 can promote the growth of t4 then resulting in enhanced biodegradation of otc this could be explained by the fact that low concentrations of otc may provide insufficient energy to maintain microbial metabolism but excessive otc can also inhibit the growth of microorganisms possibly because otc itself is a bactericidal substance or might be toxic to t4 at a high concentration in this study the higher the initial concentration of otc led to the lower the degradation rate of otc this is consistent with the gentamicin biodegradation by fzc3 liu et al 2016a nevertheless some relevant experimental results are contrary to the conclusions of our experiment for example the degradation of cephalexin by pseudomonas was not significantly affected by the increase in the cefalexin concentration lin et al 2015 this indicated that the responses of bacteria depend on the types of the antibiotics 3 2 2 effect of temperature on the biodegradation of otc it has been found that temperature has a significant effect on the degradation of otc in the aquatic environment kummerer 2009b loftin et al 2008 xuan et al 2009 the changes in the degradation rate of otc and the bacterial growth at different temperatures are shown in fig 5 the highest degradation of otc was found at 40 c with the value of 54 8 at the treatment of t4 figs 5a and 80 7 at the treatment of t4 and fe3 fig 5b respectively in short the degradation of otc at different temperatures followed the order of 40 c 35 c 30 c 25 c the bacterial growth increased with increasing temperature at a given temperature the bacterial growth in the treatment of t4 and fe3 was significantly higher than that in the treatment of t4 the results proved that elevated temperatures can promote the degradation of otc in the range of 25 c to 40 c wang and yates 2008 otc was shown to be heat labile by hassani et al mounir et al 2008 antibiotics in the same class have also been reported to show different heat stabilities depending on different matrices and temperature treatments abou raya et al 2013 franje et al 2010 it has also been reported that increasing temperatures increase the rate of otc hydrolysis kummerer 2009a in addition temperature has a great influence on microbial activity it has been reported that microbial activity and temperature are key factors in the degradation of tetracyclines during manure composting wu et al 2011 based on the published information and fig 5 we can deduce that fe3 could promote t4 growth and its activities which then promote the otc biodegradation in addition there is an optimum temperature for the formation of iron carriers few iron carriers are secreted when the temperature is below 25 c but a large number of iron carriers can be produced in the range of 25 40 c therefore with increasing temperature in the range of 25 40 c the ability of t4 bacteria to produce iron carriers is gradually enhanced which is beneficial to the degradation of otc this result coincides with the results for animal manure compost there are some similar reports for composting that increasing the temperature can promote otc degradation which the highest degradation rates occurring at high composting temperatures arikan et al 2007 wang and yates 2008 the above result also conforms to the molecular collision theory that higher temperatures cause more collisions between particles thereby increasing the reaction rate 3 2 3 effect of ph on the biodegradation of otc ph values have a significant influence on the growth and physiological activities of microorganisms as shown in fig 6 a and b the degradation efficiencies at different ph values are showing in the following order ph 7 6 8 9 5 4 3 the percentage degradation values were the highest at ph 7 and reached 54 1 and 81 0 without and with presence of fe3 respectively at ph 3 the two groups had the lowest degradation rates of 14 2 and 27 3 respectively the degradation rates of otc under strongly acidic medium strongly acidic and strongly alkaline conditions were slower than those under neutral conditions it is consistent with the previous reports that otc degradation in neutral solution appeared to be much faster than that in both acidic and alkaline solutions xuan et al 2010 it has been reported that ph can not only affect the form of otc doi and stoskopf 2000 loftin et al 2008 but also affect the growth of t4 bacteria this microorganism can grow under neutral conditions but can t grow well under strongly acidic alkaline conditions these results are consistent with previous reports in which cell growth was depend on the initial ph solieri and giudici 2008 the obviously decreased dissolution capacity of co2 could affect the growth of a strain at a lower ph in culture medium wang et al 2018a furthermore a low ph usually results in a lower level of atp in cells and the inhibition of bacterial growth therefore both the degradation rates of otc and t4 the od600 value of the reaction were low at ph 3 4 and 5 ph and temperature can promote t4 growth and make it more active but can t change the generation of otc metabolites as shown in the c and d of figs 5 6 and table s6 and table s7 3 2 4 effect of edta on the biodegradation of otc as shown in fig 7 otc was degraded by 28 1 and 67 7 at the treatments of otc and otc plus fe3 respectively however with the addition of edta buffer as the extracting agent otc degradation rate decreased to 26 3 this indicates that fe3 could promote otc hydrolysis and then result in the degradation of otc however with the addition of edta buffer solution fe3 and edta maybe form a more stable complex it has been reported that the stability constant of edta and fe3 complex is 25 1 shan et al 2018 it also indicated that the enhanced degradation of otc in the presence of fe3 is mainly attributed to the promotion of t4 growth in addition it is also reported that otc has complexing ability which can react with different metal ions chen et al 2011 3 3 real time monitoring of args during the biodegradation of otc resistance genes are easily produced in environmental media contaminated by otc which destroys the diversity of the biological community the rapid and efficient degradation of otc can effectively reduce the occurrence of resistance genes in the environment four common tetracycline args such as tet m tet a tet o and tet w were not detected table 1 in this study this indicates that args could not be introduced into the environment when t4 was used to degrade otc it is inspiring that this new finding can provide a new way to degrade the antibiotics in short time which may decrease the spreading of args in environments due to the reduced antibiotic stress it has been reported that tet w and tet o were present in treated drinking water and recycled wastewater pruden et al 2006 args of high use tetracycline antibiotics had significantly higher detected resistance gene levels than those of mixed use and no use antibiotics in lagoons although tet m was the most commonly detected gene both in absolute number and after normalization 16s rrna tet o tet q and tet w levels were also high in the mixed and high use lagoons peak et al 2007 some args such as tet m tet o tet q tet w tet c tet h and tet z were detected in groundwater near pig farms over three years koike et al 2007 these results suggest that the potential pathways for the spread of args are widely variable therefore it is vital to find efficient and rapid degradation methods for humans to avoid the spread of args in dual graphene modified bioelectrode microbial fuel cell o d gm be mfc otc could be quickly degraded by the group of microorganisms including moheibacter comamonas pseudomonas dechloromonas nitrospira methylomicrobium pseudorhodoferax thiobacillus mycobacterium but the coding resistance genes of efflux pump ribosome protective protein and modifying or passivating were all found in o gm be chen et al 2019a in the present study otc is rapidly degraded without the application of electrical energy with the merit of the four common resistance genes tet m tet a tet o and tet w being not detected this implies that the new way to eliminate the spreading of the args in the environment may be developed 3 4 the degradation products of otc by t4 with the presence of fe3 otc degradation processes mainly include demethylation dehydration decarbonylation deamination hydroxylation and enol ketone isomerization the first degradation pathway is the hydrolysis of otc because the microbial degradation of otc is completed with a hydration system the hydrolysis reaction of otc will inevitably occur when the bacteria acts on otc the second degradation pathway is biodegradation which is mainly caused by degrading enzymes in t4 bacteria the degradation products analyzed by uplc q tot ms predicted that there were three proposed hydrolysis pathways fig s1 and four biodegradation pathways fig s2 the relative abundance of products was used as a reference because the byproducts lacked standard products and could not be quantitatively analyzed liu et al 2016c as shown in fig s3 a and b mass spectrometry was used to further identify prominent byproducts to derive their evolutionary pathways dehydration mainly occurred on the b and c rings the mass to charge ratios of these rings differed by 18 due to the parent compound at m z 461 to m z 443 on the one hand the methyl of the link on c6 is an electronic group which makes the hydrogen on c5a and the hydroxyl sites of c6 prone to eliminate the reaction and lose a water molecule thus becoming a stable ring structure hasan et al 1985 liu et al 2016c on the other hand there is dehydration in the thermal pyrolysis of enolic acetylacetone choudhury and lin 1990 heat and light both provide energy that causes degradation reactions to occur liu et al 2016b in the presence of microorganisms the microorganisms may also provide energy or specific enzymes to generate dehydration products cazes et al 2014 discovered that immobilized laccase synergistic redox agents can produce dehydrated products of otc decarbonylation occurs in the ring a it has been reported that otc undergoes α cleavage at c1 c12a to become an intermediate in the form of a double radical due to instability the product subsequently loses the carbonyl to form another double radical liu et al 2016c in terms of energy the energy of c1 c12a sp 3 hybrid is lower than that of c1 c2 sp 2 hybrid and cracking of c1 c12a produces double free radical intermediates by co removal and a closed loop operation further induction by hydroxylase causes the hydroxylation of c2 to form m z 451 demethylation occurs in the part of dimethylamine at c4 position from m z 461 to m z 447and m z 433 the secondary mass spectrometry details of m z 437 and 443 are shown in fig s3 a and b respectively ultraviolet irradiation or hydroxyl radicals have been reported to promote demethylation fang et al 2011 khan et al 2014 with the action of microorganisms it is possible to induce hydroxylase to cause demethylation similar report had shown that tetracycline also occurred demethylation in the process of laccase degradation llorca et al 2015 the microbial degradation of otc mainly involves deamination hydroxylation and enol ketone isomerization the isomerization of enol ketone is due to the higher activity and instability of enol type structures which are easy to convert into more stable ketone type structures deamination occurs at the position of the amide group attached to c2 deamination causes the c2 position to connect to the amide group it loses its amino group and becomes a carboxyl group and then react with the hydroxyl group is connected to the c3 position in the process of esterification to produce a derivative of m z 443 maleamate amidase ami plays an important role in the microbial degradation of nicotine by fetor pseudomonas aeruginosa and its role is to degrade maleic acid into maleic acid and ammonia as shown in eq 1 wu et al 2014 image 2 phenol hydroxylase can be identified in the pseudomonas gene organization causing catalytic reactions that hydroxylate some organic substances wang et al 2018b bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases bmms a type of hybrid hydroxylase can hydroxylate a variety of alkanes olefins and aromatic compounds with high regional stereoselectivity sazinsky et al 2004 these two types of enzymes play important roles in the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons arenghi et al 2001 cafaro et al 2004 there were similar reports that pseudomonas has the function of hydroxylation koshimura et al 2010 tamm and gubler 1959 the parent molecule generates m z 433 by decarbonylation and then the hydroxylation of c2 by hydroxylase forms m z 450 the o hydroxylation of c10 obtained m z 467 under the action of phenolic hydroxylase phenol hydroxylase can hydroxylate the ortho position of phenol it was reported that the phenol hydroxylase of pseudomonas stutzeri ox1 was able to hydroxylate ortho hydroxylate phenol and cresol isomers of the corresponding catechols the reaction formula is shown in eq 2 fang et al 2011 the structure of the c12a enol was transformed into a more stable ketone structure c11a was hydroxylated to form m z 483 under the action of hydroxylase image 3 c6 was dehydrated to produce m z 449 dehydrated products and m z 465 was generated under the action of hydroxylase c 11a is easily hydroxylated because the structure of diketone is unstable which is beneficial for generating m z 465 and m z 481 under the action of hydroxyl enzymes pseudomonas can secrete hydrogenase which may generate m z 463 and m z 437 under the action of hydrogenase in addition m z 435 is formed by decarbonylation from m z 463 hydrogenase is a type of metal enzyme in microorganisms the main function of hydrogenase is the reversible catalytic reaction of h2 2h 2e which is closely related to the energy metabolism of microorganisms 3 5 otc degradation by t4 in natural water matrices as shown in fig 8 the percentage degradation of the first three groups in 3 days exceeds 45 0 the percentage degradation of the last three groups which exceeds 88 0 was greater than that of the first three groups as described in 3 1 above otc is a carbon source that supports bacterial growth it is known that the propensity of bacterial cells for attachment is related to nutrient availability and that cell starvation often leads to increased adhesiveness marshall et al 2000 in the different water matrices otc was adsorbed on the surface of t4 bacteria and then being biodegraded t4 bacteria secreted iron carriers which increased the otc degradation rate with the addition of fe3 fe3 is the most important factor to affect the degradation of otc by t4 fe2o3 can be added to control the fe3 concentration in the water environment polluted by otc to enhance the degradation of otc by t4 bacteria these results imply that this method was suitable for the removal of otc pollutants with a high concentration in the waters of this experiment the benefits of using pseudomonas in degrading otc include its high efficiency and low cost and no production and accumulation tet a tet m tet o and tet w in the environment this new finding can also dispel the doubt that antibiotic biodegradable bacteria will cause the spreading of some args in environments when they are applied to degrade antibiotics in addition the degradation rate of otc by t4 is higher than that reported by shao et al 2018 with ochrobactrum sp compared with the results of sun et al 2019 we only gave the facts that otc can be quickly degraded by t4 but did not conversed the biological energy to electric energy we think this gives us inspiration to make our efforts to realize the conversion of biological energy to electric energy in the future research 4 conclusions this study systematically investigated the degradation mechanisms and influencing factors of otc by t4 our results demonstrated that fe3 had a significant positive effect on the biodegradation of otc by t4 with the greatest degradation rate at 50 mg l 1 of otc in this experiment temperature and ph were important factors influencing the biodegradation of otc increasing the temperature can not only promote the growth of t4 and its activity but also facilitate the degradation of otc the increase in temperature helps t4 secrete iron carriers to promote the degradation of otc in addition no resistance genes were detected during the microbial degradation of otc there were six different reaction types and seven possible degradation pathways including enol ketone conversion hydroxylation dehydration deamination demethylation and decarboxylation the degradation rates of otc in different water matrices including sewage aquaculture water and pond water were found all exceeding 88 0 this study indicates that t4 is highly effective for removing otc from contaminated water in the presence of fe3 which provides valuable information on the removal of otc in various aquatic environments 5 declaration of interest statement the authors declared that they have no conflicts of

18748,the application and fate of antibiotics are closely related to human health and the ecological balance which has gradually aroused the widespread global concerns long term antibiotic residues can easily induce antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment although many studies have investigated the metabolic pathways of biosynthesis or degradation of oxytetracycline otc and its influencing factors under laboratory or controlled conditions the understanding of otc degradation pathways and influencing factors in the environment is still poor in the present study the role of pseudomonas t4 in otc biodegradation were investigated with different carbon sources metal ions substrate concentrations temperatures and ph values as well as the temporal changes in the relative abundance of otc args it was found that otc could be degraded by t4 as a sole carbon source comparison with cu2 the addition of fe3 could significantly promote the growth of t4 and then increased the otc degradation percentage to 65 3 the initial concentration of otc temperature and ph had significant impacts on otc degradation at the initial otc concentration of 50 mg l 1 the percentage degradation of otc by t4 could reach 81 0 at the presence of fe3 and at 40 c and ph 7 common tetracycline args were not found during the otc degradation by t4 in the present study the eight main putative otc degradation byproducts were identified by ultra high definition accurate mass quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry qtof ms six different reaction types and seven possible degradation pathways were proposed including enol ketone conversion hydroxylation dehydration deamination demethylation and decarbonylation under optimal conditions the otc degradation percentages by t4 could reach to 88 2 91 6 and 92 0 in pond water fish wastewater and industrial wastewater respectively these results demonstrate the high effectiveness of t4 at the presence of fe3 for the enhanced biodegradation of otc in water environment without resulting in the occurrence of args this has important implications for the removal of otc from aquatic environments by the technology proposed from this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxytetracycline biodegradation antibiotic resistance genes degradation pathways and metabolites 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps a new class of pollutants have received increasing attention in recent years approximately 3 000 types of ppcps are now used in medicines such as painkillers and antibiotics according to the european union eu ternes et al 2004 ye dingyi et al 2006 veterinary antibiotics vas for example are frequently used in aquaculture and poultry farming as growth promoting agents and disease prevention drugs as a result they have gradually entered and accumulated in environments such as water and soils chen et al 2014 kemper 2008 phillips et al 2004 oxytetracycline otc a broad spectrum antibiotic with the formula shown in fig 1 is a common tetracycline antibiotic that is widely used in poultry and animal farms around the world however otc cannot be absorbed well by animals and approximately 90 of antibiotics are released into the environment in the form of their parent or metabolites alcock et al 1999 otc residues have been detected in environments worldwide kumar et al 2005 in the united states the residual amount of otc can reach 0 34 μg l 1 in the surface water liu et al 2016c yang and carlson 2003 otc residues in australian urban water and danish soil can reach 0 35 μg l 1 and 2 5 50 mg kg 1 respectively kong et al 2007 yan et al 2013 it was also found that the concentration of otc residues in a sewage treatment plant in china reached 20 800 mg l 1 with the consumption of otc reaching the high amount of to 1360 t in 2013 zhang et al 2015 long term exposure of microorganisms to antibiotics in the environment even at the low level of 0 34 μg l 1 is likely to induce resistance and resistance genes in surrounding microorganisms zhu et al 2013 an aquatic ecosystem is a complex system composed of organisms living in a given habitat therefore there is no specific provisions and uniform standards worldwide for threshold of antibiotics such as otc in water environment in term of the algae anabaena cylindrical is the most sensitive to otc among all the selected aquatic organisms with the ec50 values of 0 03 mg l 1 and tetraselmis chuii is the most resistant to otc with the ec50 values of 11 18 mg l 1 zhao et al 2013 as has been previously reported in the literature the fish is the most resistant to otc and daphnia has the middle resistance to otc and algae is the most sensitive to otc in water environment now the acceptable otc level especially in aquatic environment is still not set thus it is very important to effectively degrade and remove otc and its derivatives in the environment there are many proposed methods for removal of the residual otc in the environment including advanced oxidation processes activated carbon adsorption low temperature plasma technology membrane bioreactors and biodegradation processes darweesh and ahmed 2017 liu et al 2016b rivera utrilla et al 2018 sahar et al 2011 sokolov and louhikultanen 2018 these processes have played a great role in removing otc residues from environments the biodegradation process approach has gradually attracted more attention due to its simplicity and low cost maki et al 2006 chen et al 2019b fe is not only one of the essential trace metal elements for microbial growth but also an important cofactor of microbial enzyme activity it exists mainly in the form of oxide in the environment fe2o3 is a widely used material and fe3 plays a significant role in promoting microbial fuel cells thus the application of fe3 combined with microorganisms may promote the microbial degradation of antibiotics in addition biodegradation methods for removing antibiotic residues such as otc are difficult to apply widely because of the lack of understanding about whether antibiotic resistance genes and metabolites are introduced into the environment therefore the objectives of the present study are 1 to characterize the positive effect of fe3 on microbial degradation of otc 2 to investigate the dynamic changes of common tetracycline antibiotics resistance genes over time 7 days such as tet a tet m tet o and tet w and 3 to understand the potential metabolites of otc degradation by microorganisms and the associated mechanisms in the presence of fe3 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials oxytetracycline hydrochloride purity 96 otc was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer augsburg germany methanol and acetonitrile acn hplc grade were purchased

the qtof scan data were analyzed using agilent masshunter b 07 00 workstation software the degradation percentage d of otc was calculated according to the following equation d c0 ct c0 100 where c0 is the initial concentration of otc and ct is the concentration of otc at time t 2 2 2 bacterial concentration determination bacterial concentration changes were monitored using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 600 nm and presented as od value 2 2 3 determination of args by real time fluorescent quantitative pcr real time fluorescent quantitative pcr qpcr was used to determine the

otc biodegradation 2 3 1 degradation of otc by t4 bacteria t4 bacteria were isolated from soils contaminated by otc in our laboratory before the experiment the bacteria were identified as pseudomonas via 16s rdna gene sequence analysis meng et al 2018 the colony morphology of t4 is round smooth and opaque milky white colonies with a diameter of 0 2 0 4 cm at 30 c on beef extract peptone medium in three days there were two treatments set up in the experiment including 1 otc only otc was added to the inorganic salt medium and 2 otc t4 both otc and t4 bacteria were added to the inorganic salt medium each treatment was performed in triplicate the 100 ml of inorganic salt medium ism nh4cl 1g nacl 1g k2hpo4 1 5g kh2po4 0 5g mgso4 0 2g distilled water 1l and ph 7 was added to a 250 ml tube which was wrapped by foil to avoid the photodecomposition reaction occurrence of otc and was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min then 1 0 ml of otc water solution with a concentration of 5 mg ml 1 was added to the tube with ism yielding a final otc concentration of 50 mg l 1 after its temperature decreased to room temperature 25 c for otc t4 treatment a total of 1 0 ml of t4 bacteria solution 3 0 108 cfu ml 1 at the logarithmic growth stage was added to the tube all the above operations were carried out in the ultraclean workbench with no microorganisms and darkness conditions all the tubes containing the solution mixture were incubated at 30 c in a constant temperature and light proof shaker with a rotational speed of 150 r min 1 during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 3 2 different carbon sources four types of carbon sources including starch maltose beef extract peptone and yeast extract and inorganic salt liquid medium were used to investigate the efficiency of otc degradation by t4 with different carbon sources each carbon source was replicated 3 times the liquid medium was prepared and sterilized otc t4 were added according to the methods described in 2 3 1 in addition the only otc adding without t4 adding treatment were set for each carbon sources to eliminate the difference in otc spontaneous degradation at different carbon source during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 3 3 different metal ions to investigate the enhanced efficiency of otc degradation by t4 in the presence of common metal ion pairs cu2 and fe3 were selected in the present study two treatments were set 1 otc t4 1 and cu2 0 1 were adding together 2 otc t4 1 and fe3 0 1 were adding together fe3 and cu2 were selected based on the following facts 1 copper is an essential microelement for domestic animals such as pig chicken and cow and is often used as a feed additive to promote domestic animal growth in livestock farm 2 it has been reported that lots of organic compounds including antibiotics can be removed by cu and fe3o4 nanomaterials pham et al 2018a 2018b the liquid medium was prepared and sterilized otc t4 were added according to the methods described in 2 3 1 cu2 and fe3 were added in the form of cuso4 5h2o and fecl3 6h2o respectively during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 4 influencing factor experiments there were three influencing factors substrate concentration temperature and ph there were five different substrate concentrations including 5 10 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 and four different temperatures including 25 30 35 and 40 c in addition seven different ph values were set as 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 four otc systems were set such as otc otc t4 otc t4 fe3 and otc fe3 in the present experiment each factor at each level was performed in triplicate the liquid medium was prepared and sterilized otc t4 and fe3 were added by the same methods described in 2 3 1 during the incubation period the samples were taken on 0 1 3 5 and 7 days after treatment and 5 0 ml of liquid mixture was sampled each time 2 5 detection of args related to common tetracycline antibiotics in otc removal solution the args monitoring experiment was conducted by using a real time sampling and detection by real time fluorescent quantitative pcr under optimal degradation conditions common tetracycline antibiotic resistance genes including tet a tet m tet o and tet w were selected for monitoring over 7 days there were two treatments 1 otc and 2 otc t4 1 fe3 0 1 the sampling times were 1 3 5 and 7 days otc t4 and fe3 were added by the same methods described in 2 3 3 2 6 application of t4 in the presence of fe3 in real water matrix there were two treatments including 1 otc t4 1 and 2 otc t4 1 fe3 0 1 in the present experiment three different water matrices were selected such as sewage plant wastewater aquaculture water and pond water the otc concentration was 50 mg l 1 the samples were collected on 3 days after treatment 2 7 statistical analysis spss statistics version 19 software was used for statistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine if treatment means were significantly different and duncan s multiple range tests was performed to determine if the individual means were different from each another mass hunter b 07 00 agilent was used to further determine the otc metabolites under the action of microorganisms chem draw ultra 8 0 was used to visualize molecular structures 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of otc 3 1 1 biodegradation of otc over time as shown in fig 2 the percentage degradation of otc increased with time with a value of nearly 34 1 in the t4 treatment and only 17 4 in the treatment without t4 on day 7 furthermore the residual amount of otc was reduced for all four sampling times i e on day 1 3 5 and 7 the degradation rates with bacteria t4 were 14 3 and 16 7 higher than those withoutt4 for days 5 and 7 respectively in fact the degradation rates with t4 were significantly different from those at the treatment without bacteria on both days 5 and 7 the results indicate that otc could undergo spontaneous degradation reactions but the spontaneous degradation is slow xuan et al 2010 our findings are consistent with previous reports that otc is a special antibiotic that is more difficult than other antibiotics to degrade in the environment pouliquen et al 2007 3 1 2 role of different carbon sources and metal ions in the biodegradation of otc biodegradation is the process of converting organic compounds to a lower complexity or simple inorganic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide co2 nzila 2013 organic pollutants are eliminated by microorganisms mainly through co metabolism as a carbon source co metabolism is a process in which organic compounds are biodegraded in the presence of only primary energy materials the degradation of otc by t4 with different carbon sources namely starch maltose beef extract peptone yeast extract and ism is shown in fig 3 a among the first four carbon sources starch had the best effect on degradation of otc while beef extract peptone the worst effect compared with these carbon sources the percentage degradation was nearly 34 1 in inorganic salts and this weak degradation was most likely caused by hydrolysis in the other carbon sources for 7 days beef extract peptone can provide rich carbon sources nitrogen sources and vitamin c to meet the requirements of microbial growth the t4 competes with the beef extract peptone at a disadvantage which resulted in otc degradation being not effective in the carbon source material solution the experimental results agree with the principle of screening bacteria for pollutant degradation in which antibiotics are consumed by microbes as the only carbon source that is otc was degraded as a carbon source by t4 some similar results have been reported for sphingomonas paucimobilis which could utilize fluoranthene as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth and degraded a variety of high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs ye et al 1996 on the one hand organic pollutants are used as carbon sources to promote the growth of microorganisms which can secrete enzymes to catalyze the biodegradation of otc on the other hand if there is competition between otc and energy substances in the same reaction system microorganisms will preferentially consume the additional carbon sources and pollution is easily produced by the excess energy substances which is not conducive to the reaction metal ions play important roles in microbial growth in this study 0 1 fe3 and 0 1 cu2 were added into the reaction system to promote the biodegradation of otc the results revealed that fe3 can promote the percentage degradation of otc up to 65 3 as shown in fig 3 b the effect of cu2 was not as obvious as that of fe3 and the highest percentage degradation only reached to 34 0 within 7 days the otc degradation rate was slow from day 3 to day 5 after fe3 was added the difference was found for the otc degradation in response to fe3 and cu2 additions on both day 3 and 5 the degradation rate of otc under the addition of fe3 was 30 7 higher than that under the addition of cu2 on day 3 t4 secretes a low molecular weight active polypeptide that chelates the vitro of iron which promotes the growth of t4 ratledge and dover 2000 thus increasing the biodegradation of otc since fe is an essential microelement for organisms the addition of fe3 is conducive to the microbial degradation reaction 3 2 other factors influencing otc biodegradation 3 2 1 effect of substrate concentration on the biodegradation of otc the initial otc concentrations 5 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 significantly affected the degradation of otc by t4 fig 4 the effects of different initial otc concentration on the degradation of otc followed the order of 50 25 10 5 100 mg l 1 the percentage degradation of otc at 50 mg l 1 reached 32 0 when treated with t4 only figs 4 a and 65 5 treated with the combination of t4 and fe3 fig 4 b respectively the od values varied from 0 062 to 0 123 in the presence of t4 and from 0 062 to 0 736 in the presence of t4 and fe3 respectively it indicates that fe3 can promote the growth of t4 then resulting in enhanced biodegradation of otc this could be explained by the fact that low concentrations of otc may provide insufficient energy to maintain microbial metabolism but excessive otc can also inhibit the growth of microorganisms possibly because otc itself is a bactericidal substance or might be toxic to t4 at a high concentration in this study the higher the initial concentration of otc led to the lower the degradation rate of otc this is consistent with the gentamicin biodegradation by fzc3 liu et al 2016a nevertheless some relevant experimental results are contrary to the conclusions of our experiment for example the degradation of cephalexin by pseudomonas was not significantly affected by the increase in the cefalexin concentration lin et al 2015 this indicated that the responses of bacteria depend on the types of the antibiotics 3 2 2 effect of temperature on the biodegradation of otc it has been found that temperature has a significant effect on the degradation of otc in the aquatic environment kummerer 2009b loftin et al 2008 xuan et al 2009 the changes in the degradation rate of otc and the bacterial growth at different temperatures are shown in fig 5 the highest degradation of otc was found at 40 c with the value of 54 8 at the treatment of t4 figs 5a and 80 7 at the treatment of t4 and fe3 fig 5b respectively in short the degradation of otc at different temperatures followed the order of 40 c 35 c 30 c 25 c the bacterial growth increased with increasing temperature at a given temperature the bacterial growth in the treatment of t4 and fe3 was significantly higher than that in the treatment of t4 the results proved that elevated temperatures can promote the degradation of otc in the range of 25 c to 40 c wang and yates 2008 otc was shown to be heat labile by hassani et al mounir et al 2008 antibiotics in the same class have also been reported to show different heat stabilities depending on different matrices and temperature treatments abou raya et al 2013 franje et al 2010 it has also been reported that increasing temperatures increase the rate of otc hydrolysis kummerer 2009a in addition temperature has a great influence on microbial activity it has been reported that microbial activity and temperature are key factors in the degradation of tetracyclines during manure composting wu et al 2011 based on the published information and fig 5 we can deduce that fe3 could promote t4 growth and its activities which then promote the otc biodegradation in addition there is an optimum temperature for the formation of iron carriers few iron carriers are secreted when the temperature is below 25 c but a large number of iron carriers can be produced in the range of 25 40 c therefore with increasing temperature in the range of 25 40 c the ability of t4 bacteria to produce iron carriers is gradually enhanced which is beneficial to the degradation of otc this result coincides with the results for animal manure compost there are some similar reports for composting that increasing the temperature can promote otc degradation which the highest degradation rates occurring at high composting temperatures arikan et al 2007 wang and yates 2008 the above result also conforms to the molecular collision theory that higher temperatures cause more collisions between particles thereby increasing the reaction rate 3 2 3 effect of ph on the biodegradation of otc ph values have a significant influence on the growth and physiological activities of microorganisms as shown in fig 6 a and b the degradation efficiencies at different ph values are showing in the following order ph 7 6 8 9 5 4 3 the percentage degradation values were the highest at ph 7 and reached 54 1 and 81 0 without and with presence of fe3 respectively at ph 3 the two groups had the lowest degradation rates of 14 2 and 27 3 respectively the degradation rates of otc under strongly acidic medium strongly acidic and strongly alkaline conditions were slower than those under neutral conditions it is consistent with the previous reports that otc degradation in neutral solution appeared to be much faster than that in both acidic and alkaline solutions xuan et al 2010 it has been reported that ph can not only affect the form of otc doi and stoskopf 2000 loftin et al 2008 but also affect the growth of t4 bacteria this microorganism can grow under neutral conditions but can t grow well under strongly acidic alkaline conditions these results are consistent with previous reports in which cell growth was depend on the initial ph solieri and giudici 2008 the obviously decreased dissolution capacity of co2 could affect the growth of a strain at a lower ph in culture medium wang et al 2018a furthermore a low ph usually results in a lower level of atp in cells and the inhibition of bacterial growth therefore both the degradation rates of otc and t4 the od600 value of the reaction were low at ph 3 4 and 5 ph and temperature can promote t4 growth and make it more active but can t change the generation of otc metabolites as shown in the c and d of figs 5 6 and table s6 and table s7 3 2 4 effect of edta on the biodegradation of otc as shown in fig 7 otc was degraded by 28 1 and 67 7 at the treatments of otc and otc plus fe3 respectively however with the addition of edta buffer as the extracting agent otc degradation rate decreased to 26 3 this indicates that fe3 could promote otc hydrolysis and then result in the degradation of otc however with the addition of edta buffer solution fe3 and edta maybe form a more stable complex it has been reported that the stability constant of edta and fe3 complex is 25 1 shan et al 2018 it also indicated that the enhanced degradation of otc in the presence of fe3 is mainly attributed to the promotion of t4 growth in addition it is also reported that otc has complexing ability which can react with different metal ions chen et al 2011 3 3 real time monitoring of args during the biodegradation of otc resistance genes are easily produced in environmental media contaminated by otc which destroys the diversity of the biological community the rapid and efficient degradation of otc can effectively reduce the occurrence of resistance genes in the environment four common tetracycline args such as tet m tet a tet o and tet w were not detected table 1 in this study this indicates that args could not be introduced into the environment when t4 was used to degrade otc it is inspiring that this new finding can provide a new way to degrade the antibiotics in short time which may decrease the spreading of args in environments due to the reduced antibiotic stress it has been reported that tet w and tet o were present in treated drinking water and recycled wastewater pruden et al 2006 args of high use tetracycline antibiotics had significantly higher detected resistance gene levels than those of mixed use and no use antibiotics in lagoons although tet m was the most commonly detected gene both in absolute number and after normalization 16s rrna tet o tet q and tet w levels were also high in the mixed and high use lagoons peak et al 2007 some args such as tet m tet o tet q tet w tet c tet h and tet z were detected in groundwater near pig farms over three years koike et al 2007 these results suggest that the potential pathways for the spread of args are widely variable therefore it is vital to find efficient and rapid degradation methods for humans to avoid the spread of args in dual graphene modified bioelectrode microbial fuel cell o d gm be mfc otc could be quickly degraded by the group of microorganisms including moheibacter comamonas pseudomonas dechloromonas nitrospira methylomicrobium pseudorhodoferax thiobacillus mycobacterium but the coding resistance genes of efflux pump ribosome protective protein and modifying or passivating were all found in o gm be chen et al 2019a in the present study otc is rapidly degraded without the application of electrical energy with the merit of the four common resistance genes tet m tet a tet o and tet w being not detected this implies that the new way to eliminate the spreading of the args in the environment may be developed 3 4 the degradation products of otc by t4 with the presence of fe3 otc degradation processes mainly include demethylation dehydration decarbonylation deamination hydroxylation and enol ketone isomerization the first degradation pathway is the hydrolysis of otc because the microbial degradation of otc is completed with a hydration system the hydrolysis reaction of otc will inevitably occur when the bacteria acts on otc the second degradation pathway is biodegradation which is mainly caused by degrading enzymes in t4 bacteria the degradation products analyzed by uplc q tot ms predicted that there were three proposed hydrolysis pathways fig s1 and four biodegradation pathways fig s2 the relative abundance of products was used as a reference because the byproducts lacked standard products and could not be quantitatively analyzed liu et al 2016c as shown in fig s3 a and b mass spectrometry was used to further identify prominent byproducts to derive their evolutionary pathways dehydration mainly occurred on the b and c rings the mass to charge ratios of these rings differed by 18 due to the parent compound at m z 461 to m z 443 on the one hand the methyl of the link on c6 is an electronic group which makes the hydrogen on c5a and the hydroxyl sites of c6 prone to eliminate the reaction and lose a water molecule thus becoming a stable ring structure hasan et al 1985 liu et al 2016c on the other hand there is dehydration in the thermal pyrolysis of enolic acetylacetone choudhury and lin 1990 heat and light both provide energy that causes degradation reactions to occur liu et al 2016b in the presence of microorganisms the microorganisms may also provide energy or specific enzymes to generate dehydration products cazes et al 2014 discovered that immobilized laccase synergistic redox agents can produce dehydrated products of otc decarbonylation occurs in the ring a it has been reported that otc undergoes α cleavage at c1 c12a to become an intermediate in the form of a double radical due to instability the product subsequently loses the carbonyl to form another double radical liu et al 2016c in terms of energy the energy of c1 c12a sp 3 hybrid is lower than that of c1 c2 sp 2 hybrid and cracking of c1 c12a produces double free radical intermediates by co removal and a closed loop operation further induction by hydroxylase causes the hydroxylation of c2 to form m z 451 demethylation occurs in the part of dimethylamine at c4 position from m z 461 to m z 447and m z 433 the secondary mass spectrometry details of m z 437 and 443 are shown in fig s3 a and b respectively ultraviolet irradiation or hydroxyl radicals have been reported to promote demethylation fang et al 2011 khan et al 2014 with the action of microorganisms it is possible to induce hydroxylase to cause demethylation similar report had shown that tetracycline also occurred demethylation in the process of laccase degradation llorca et al 2015 the microbial degradation of otc mainly involves deamination hydroxylation and enol ketone isomerization the isomerization of enol ketone is due to the higher activity and instability of enol type structures which are easy to convert into more stable ketone type structures deamination occurs at the position of the amide group attached to c2 deamination causes the c2 position to connect to the amide group it loses its amino group and becomes a carboxyl group and then react with the hydroxyl group is connected to the c3 position in the process of esterification to produce a derivative of m z 443 maleamate amidase ami plays an important role in the microbial degradation of nicotine by fetor pseudomonas aeruginosa and its role is to degrade maleic acid into maleic acid and ammonia as shown in eq 1 wu et al 2014 image 2 phenol hydroxylase can be identified in the pseudomonas gene organization causing catalytic reactions that hydroxylate some organic substances wang et al 2018b bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases bmms a type of hybrid hydroxylase can hydroxylate a variety of alkanes olefins and aromatic compounds with high regional stereoselectivity sazinsky et al 2004 these two types of enzymes play important roles in the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons arenghi et al 2001 cafaro et al 2004 there were similar reports that pseudomonas has the function of hydroxylation koshimura et al 2010 tamm and gubler 1959 the parent molecule generates m z 433 by decarbonylation and then the hydroxylation of c2 by hydroxylase forms m z 450 the o hydroxylation of c10 obtained m z 467 under the action of phenolic hydroxylase phenol hydroxylase can hydroxylate the ortho position of phenol it was reported that the phenol hydroxylase of pseudomonas stutzeri ox1 was able to hydroxylate ortho hydroxylate phenol and cresol isomers of the corresponding catechols the reaction formula is shown in eq 2 fang et al 2011 the structure of the c12a enol was transformed into a more stable ketone structure c11a was hydroxylated to form m z 483 under the action of hydroxylase image 3 c6 was dehydrated to produce m z 449 dehydrated products and m z 465 was generated under the action of hydroxylase c 11a is easily hydroxylated because the structure of diketone is unstable which is beneficial for generating m z 465 and m z 481 under the action of hydroxyl enzymes pseudomonas can secrete hydrogenase which may generate m z 463 and m z 437 under the action of hydrogenase in addition m z 435 is formed by decarbonylation from m z 463 hydrogenase is a type of metal enzyme in microorganisms the main function of hydrogenase is the reversible catalytic reaction of h2 2h 2e which is closely related to the energy metabolism of microorganisms 3 5 otc degradation by t4 in natural water matrices as shown in fig 8 the percentage degradation of the first three groups in 3 days exceeds 45 0 the percentage degradation of the last three groups which exceeds 88 0 was greater than that of the first three groups as described in 3 1 above otc is a carbon source that supports bacterial growth it is known that the propensity of bacterial cells for attachment is related to nutrient availability and that cell starvation often leads to increased adhesiveness marshall et al 2000 in the different water matrices otc was adsorbed on the surface of t4 bacteria and then being biodegraded t4 bacteria secreted iron carriers which increased the otc degradation rate with the addition of fe3 fe3 is the most important factor to affect the degradation of otc by t4 fe2o3 can be added to control the fe3 concentration in the water environment polluted by otc to enhance the degradation of otc by t4 bacteria these results imply that this method was suitable for the removal of otc pollutants with a high concentration in the waters of this experiment the benefits of using pseudomonas in degrading otc include its high efficiency and low cost and no production and accumulation tet a tet m tet o and tet w in the environment this new finding can also dispel the doubt that antibiotic biodegradable bacteria will cause the spreading of some args in environments when they are applied to degrade antibiotics in addition the degradation rate of otc by t4 is higher than that reported by shao et al 2018 with ochrobactrum sp compared with the results of sun et al 2019 we only gave the facts that otc can be quickly degraded by t4 but did not conversed the biological energy to electric energy we think this gives us inspiration to make our efforts to realize the conversion of biological energy to electric energy in the future research 4 conclusions this study systematically investigated the degradation mechanisms and influencing factors of otc by t4 our results demonstrated that fe3 had a significant positive effect on the biodegradation of otc by t4 with the greatest degradation rate at 50 mg l 1 of otc in this experiment temperature and ph were important factors influencing the biodegradation of otc increasing the temperature can not only promote the growth of t4 and its activity but also facilitate the degradation of otc the increase in temperature helps t4 secrete iron carriers to promote the degradation of otc in addition no resistance genes were detected during the microbial degradation of otc there were six different reaction types and seven possible degradation pathways including enol ketone conversion hydroxylation dehydration deamination demethylation and decarboxylation the degradation rates of otc in different water matrices including sewage aquaculture water and pond water were found all exceeding 88 0 this study indicates that t4 is highly effective for removing otc from contaminated water in the presence of fe3 which provides valuable information on the removal of otc in various aquatic environments 5 declaration of interest statement the authors declared that they have no conflicts of

18749,contamination of water by fecal matter and potential human enteric pathogens is a serious health concern microbiological water quality has been assessed by conventional culture based methods of fecal indicator bacteria fib recently molecular techniques for fib have been introduced as alternative tools for rapid detection however such molecular techniques require a modern laboratory setting expensive equipment and skilled personnel in this study we developed a simple and rapid dna extraction method based on a syringe filter without any specialized equipment furthermore loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp pcr for fecal indicator bacteria fib i e e coli and e faecalis was carried out using the dna extracts from the syringe filter based dna extraction method the efficiency of the extracted dna from the syringe filter based method was comparable to the results of the commercial kit method we also tested fresh and marine water collected directly from different locations in singapore that were spiked with e coli or e faecalis the lamp assays combined with our dna extraction method showed higher sensitivity and more tolerance to pcr inhibitors than that of conventional pcr methods we further developed a portable lamp device to conduct isothermal pcr reactions for rapid on site measurement of fib as the color changes in the end point of the lamp reaction can be observed with the naked eye the portable lamp device was easily operated and quick obtaining results in 30 min the simple portable and user friendly platform can be used as an initial screening for the rapid detection of the presence fib in lower resource settings in conclusion the portable lamp device coupled with a syringe filter based dna extraction method enables us to detect the presence of fib for assessing microbial water quality within 1 h without any sophisticated laboratory equipment or highly trained personnel graphical abstract image 1 keywords loop mediated isothermal amplification fecal indicator bacteria portable lamp device simple dna extraction method 1 introduction rapid and in situ monitoring of waterborne pathogens is important in protecting the public s health from the danger of fecal contamination in water due to the cost and difficulty of counting a diverse type of pathogens fecal indicator bacteria fib have been used as proxies for the presence and concentration of fecal contamination and its associated pathogens culture based fib requiring overnight incubation prevents same day water quality determination but the implementation of dna based methods like the polymerase chain reaction pcr provides much faster detection of the target dna of fib in water bae and wuertz 2009 harwood et al 2014 haugland et al 2014 however modern laboratory expensive equipment and skilled personnel are necessary for rapid molecular detection of fib in water using this method recently an isothermal nucleic acid amplification called the loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp assay has been introduced as a novel detection technique this technique is known for its simplicity sensitivity and speed martzy et al 2017 compared to pcr and quantitative pcr the lamp assay s advantage is that it can be completed in a short time and with limited resources the lamp reaction is done with a bst dna polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of 4 or 6 primers targeting 6 or 8 distinct regions on the target dna sequence and it is conducted under isothermal conditions ranging from 60 c to 65 c iwamoto et al 2003 nagamine et al 2002 tomlinson et al 2010 an additional advantage of lamp is that it is tolerant to common pcr inhibitors also lamp products can easily be detected by the naked eye or by adding a variety of dna intercalating dyes e g sybr green i syto calcein hydroxyl naphthol blue hnb to the tube allowing researchers to observe the color change of the solution ball et al 2016 goto et al 2009 iwamoto et al 2003 tomita et al 2008 while current pcr techniques have been widely employed for detecting and quantifying various types of microorganisms they are often impracticable for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib in water since molecular detection of fib requires sample collection and dna extraction prior to pcr reactions molecular testing of fib is generally conducted in an advanced laboratory thus there are considerable time intervals between sampling and transporting the sample to a laboratory which causes delays in determining the microbial water quality marx 2015 therefore evolving simple rapid and in situ sample preparations for sampling and dna extraction and developing an affordable and portable lamp device is crucial for implementing pcr techniques that would allow for in situ and rapid monitoring of fib in water also a portable lamp device is vital to perform molecular detection of fib after dna are extracted on site this device allows for fast analysis and a quick response to be taken if fecal contamination has happened a simple dna extraction of bacteria from water has been demonstrated using a sterile syringe filter with enzyme treatment for cell lysis backflush for unwanted cell debris removal and magnetic beads for dna purification kesberg and schleheck 2013 however this dna extraction turnaround time of 4 h is not ideal for rapidly detecting fib in water hence new and portable lamp devices are necessary for pcr amplification and analysis to become possible allowing for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib in water instead of commercially available dna kits we optimized a simple and rapid dna extraction method using a syringe filter without any additional instruments also a low cost portable lamp device was developed to facilitate the use of the simple dna extraction method coupled with the lamp assay in the field thus the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the performance of dna extraction using a syringe filter based dna extraction method as compared with a commercial dna extraction kit 2 to validate the feasibility of a lamp assay coupled with a syringe filter based dna extraction and 3 to develop a portable lamp device for lamp assays to detect fib in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and culture conditions escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis were used as model microorganisms to

sample from inhibition by the thermocouple and cross contamination and to isolate each sample the 5 μl droplets were placed into the oil in the chamber using a pipette the temperature of the floor surface in the chamber was monitored every 0 25 s in real time by a type k thermocouple labfacility uk the isothermal condition was controlled through the arduino software using the heater the fan and the thermocouple the heat sink was used to reduce the temperature variation rate the lamp assays were performed at 65 c for 30 m 3 results 3 1 overview of the syringe filter based approach for in situ dna isolation to develop a simple and rapid dna extraction that does not require costly laboratory equipment we optimized a protocol for recovering bacterial dna from water filters kesberg and schleheck 2013 a sterile syringe filter was used for rapid cell lysis and dna capture from pure cultures of e coli and e faecalis and environmental water samples the syringe filter based approach for in situ dna isolation is portable simple inexpensive and easily manageable previously kesberg and schleheck s method required lab equipment such as a water bath a shaking table and a vortex machine and it had a turnaround time of 4 h 2 h hands on time which renders it unsuitable for rapid and in situ microbial water quality monitoring in the field to make the method suitable for field based testing we developed a simplified dna extraction method which reduced the hands on time to 30 min and it does not require any laboratory equipment while there is a 170 min incubation and water bath in kesberg and schleheck s method our method was modified to 5 min of shaking the sample manually in every step of dna extraction procedure to provide the physical force to increase enzymatic interaction and to form the bio affinity between the magnetic beads and the dna fig 1 the efficiency of our syringe filter based dna extraction method was compared with the results of the commercial kit method the spiking experiment using e coli and e faecalis demonstrated that the syringe filter dna extraction method was feasible for field application as shown in fig 2 the syringe filter based dna method and the commercial kit genejet kit method had similar results when measuring dna concentrations we further evaluated the performance of our dna extraction method for freshwater and marine water samples in parallel with a commercial dna extraction kit powerwater kit before conducting the pcr and lamp reactions the concentration of fib from the water samples reservoir and coastline were measured using the mpn methods of the colilert 18 and enterolert in table 2 the colilert 18 results for the e coli cells were negative 0 mpn 100 ml in all freshwater and marine water samples table 2 in addition the amplification of the uida gene of e coli was not observed in the pcr and lamp reactions in both the reservoir and coastline samples fig 3 the freshwater samples showed that the reservoir 2 sample was positive for enterococcus at 24 mpn 100 ml while the reservoir had a relatively low concentration of 3 mpn 100 ml however two coastline water samples had no detection of enterococcus similarly the positive pcr band and color change of enterococcus in the pcr and lamp were observed for the freshwater sample but the amplification of enterococcus 23 rrna gene failed in the marine water samples supplementary fig s1 as e coli was absent in all water samples and enterococcus was only present in the reservoir samples in table 2 the positive results of lamp and pcr results are consistent with the presence of enterococcus from mpn analyses also the results of the pcr and lamp assays showed no difference between the results of the syringe filter based method and the commercial kit suggesting that the syringe filter based dna extraction method showed potential for rapid and reliable dna extraction for pcr and lamp testing in water 3 2 evaluation of the syringe filter based dna extraction method with pcr and lamp to validate the syringe filter based dna extraction method environmental water samples spiked with e coli and e faecalis were evaluated in parallel by a commercial dna extraction kit filtered sterile fresh and marine water samples were spiked with pure cultures of e coli and e faecalis in the range of approximately 107 cfu ml we further evaluated the efficacy of the dna extraction using serially diluted water samples from 107 cfu ml to 1 cfu ml fig 3 the lamp pcr confirmed that the syringe filter based method successfully extracted dna up to 102 cfu ml of e coli and e faecalis respectively for the e coli samples 2 out 3 samples were positive in 10 cfu ml suggesting that dna extraction efficiency of gram positive bacteria was low due to cell walls with thick layers of peptidoglycan also the10 fold serial dilutions of genomic dna of the e coli and e faecalis were used to estimate the dna extraction efficacy by a conventional pcr using two outer lamp primers f3 and b3 to supplementary fig s2 both the commercial kit and the syringe filter based method were able to detect up to 100 pg of diluent dna of e coli and e faecalis showing that the sensitivity of the syringe filter based method was comparable to the sensitivity of the commercial kit supplementary fig s2 in addition there were no differences between the observed patterns of the reservoir and coastline samples most importantly this filter based dna extraction method achieved a high quality of dna extraction with speed and simplicity without any specialized equipment such as a centrifuge or vortex also lamp assays were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the dna extraction using serially diluted genomic dna of e coli and e faecalis ranging from 10 ng to 1 pg the results of the lamp assays showed the color change in the reaction tubes and positive bands in the 1 5 agarose gel electrophoresis figs 4 and 5 the negative controls were tested in parallel with every reaction the color change was not observed on negative controls as shown in figs 4 and 5 the ladder like lamp products were clearly observed in both extraction methods by visual assessment using agarose gel electrophoresis no bands were observed when the sample had less than 10 pg dna indicating that the performances of the two dna extraction methods the syringe filter based and the commercial kit methods were similar in addition the color changing results were also consistent with gel electrophoresis this again shows that the filter based dna extraction method was equivalent to the commercial dna extraction kit as the amplification results were comparable to those observed when an identical amount of the dna sample from the commercial dna extraction kit was added to the lamp assays this experiment confirmed that the results of the lamp assay were again comparable to those of the conventional pcr but the sensitivity of the lamp assay was 10 times higher 3 3 pcr inhibitor and removal of pcr inhibitors the presence of pcr inhibitors from the environmental water samples was assessed using the dilution of samples and adding bsa bovine serum albumin the pcr and qpcr analyses were carried out with undiluted and diluted extracts no positive bands were obtained in e coli when the dna samples were directly used without dilution supplementary fig s3 however the effect of the inhibitor could be eliminated with appropriate dilution supplementary fig s3 on the other hand e faecalis cells were detected in both undiluted and diluted extracts and showed similar bands patterns on gel electrophoresis although a slight intensity difference was observed in the reservoir 1 sample supplementary fig s4 we also observed that the addition of extra bsa more efficiently reduced pcr inhibition than using the dilution method supplementary figs s3 and s4 these results showed that diluting the samples and adding bsa helps to reduce the inhibitor concentration and enhances pcr efficiency supplementary figs s2 and s4 furthermore the qpcr results showed a tendency similar to that of the gel electrophoresis where the effect of the pcr inhibition could be reduced in diluted dna samples supplementary fig s5 3 4 lamp assays on the portable lamp device in this study a portable lamp device was developed for the rapid assessment of the presence of e coli and e faecalis in environmental water samples as shown in fig 6 a the measured temperature of the portable lamp device was 64 43 0 98 c for the lamp reaction achieving an isothermal temperature of 65 c which is comparable temperature maintenance to a commercial thermal cycler fig 6b also the isothermal temperature of the lamp pcr mixture was not affected by the external environment due to the controlled heater and the fan maintaining at a constant temperature inside the oil chamber the pcr temperature in the device was continuously monitored as shown in fig 6b the maximum diameter of the droplets inside the oil chamber was about 6 18 mm considering the internal area 25 5 25 5 mm2 of the chamber and the droplet size nine droplets syringe filter based method commercial kit and control were successfully amplified in a single chip without any interference or any mixing of droplets the lamp reactions with spiking cultures of e coli and e faecalis to the fresh and marine water samples were conducted with the portable lamp device as shown in fig 6c as the color changes in end point of the assay can be observed with the naked eye the portable lamp device was easily operated and the result was obtained within 30 min the images from the portable lamp device were taken using a general smartphone vky l29 huawei camera without any external components as seen in fig 6c the color changes from pink to yellow were clearly observed in the dna from the syringe filter based and commercial kit methods for both e coli or e faecalis the consistent results were observed three times in trials additionally our syringe filter based dna extraction method worked equally well using a portable lamp device that allows for in situ monitoring of fib that takes 1 h from sampling and dna extraction to the lamp reaction 4 discussion the rapid and in situ monitoring of fib is the most in demand program of surface water quality monitoring in this study we demonstrated simple and rapid dna extraction methods on a portable and inexpensive pcr platform using this approach fib can be monitored within 1 h traditionally molecular techniques such as pcr and qpcr provide faster results and are considered as alternative methods to culture based methods to measure enterococcus and e coli in surface water however the implementation of the molecular techniques at the point of use will be a challenge because these methods require high end instruments trained personnel to perform sampling and the dna extractions and pcr reactions to be done in a modern laboratory setting these requirements greatly restrain water quality managers and stakeholders from applying pcr methods for in situ and real time monitoring of fib in resource limited settings however our simple filter based dna extraction method allows for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib in water without any costly equipment and with a little training filtering planktonic microbial biomass coupled with dna extraction on the filter is a key step for many molecular approaches that study the microbial diversity of aquatic environments somerville et al 1989 previously filter based dna extraction methods successfully recovered a sufficient amount of high molecular weight dna from water samples kesberg and schleheck 2013 kim and morrison 2009 although rapid and economic in house dna extraction methods have been reported kesberg and schleheck 2013 kim and morrison 2009 the yield and or purity of the samples could often be compromised fm 2001 sambrook j 2001 many commercially available dna extraction kits have good yield and high purity but those dna extraction kits are time consuming and require instruments such as a centrifuge a heat incubation and a vortex also the yield and purity of dna the hands on time and the cost should be considered when implementing rapid pcr detection in the field in this study cell lysis and purifying genomic dna using dna binding magnetic beads enhanced dna purity with less hands on time and reagents necessary without the use of any laboratory equipment magnetic beads are particularly efficient at isolating genomic dna with high throughput and in a reduced amount of time h lindstrom et al 2009 doing nucleic acid separation using magnetic particles has numerous advantages including directly isolating dna from raw samples he et al 2014 a high efficiency for large scale purification i et al 2001 m et al 2006 a low risk of cross contamination without using a centrifuge a high throughput which saves both time and money shana et al 2012 and it does not require any toxic chemicals caldarelli stefano et al 1999 applying a magnetic field with a permanent magnet ensures a simple and rapid method to separate the magnetic particles after binding and eluting the dna this ensures a higher quality of dna compared to centrifugation which may degrade the dna because of the shear force generated berensmeier 2006 it is easy to use rapid reliable field portable deployable and can be easily performed with a high quality dna yield without using any specialized equipment this study was focused on developing a simple low cost and rapid nucleic acid extraction method which is obviously ideal for field research where there are limited resources and unpredictable conditions however it is important to consider a sample matrix when extracting dna from water samples the high level of solid materials in a water sample e g sludge sediments and humic substance could prevent the syringe filter based dna extraction method from obtaining a high quality dna yield because of clogged pores on the filter pcr inhibitors remaining in the extracted dna could affect the sensitivity of the pcr or even lead to false negative results the pcr process could have been inhibited by impurities such as protein contamination and or the presence of leftover magnetic beads jiang et al 2005 kesberg and schleheck 2013 in the present study the addition of bsa and the dilution of the genomic dna alleviated pcr inhibition during pcr and qpcr however the lamp reaction was not affected by the presence of the pcr inhibitors because the dna polymerase in the lamp is more tolerant to pcr inhibitors than other polymerases such as taq martzy et al 2017 a simple and rapid detection method would also enable monitoring of a microbial community in the water in real time which allows for fast analysis and rapid response to be taken if there is contamination therefore our simple dna extraction method coupled with the lamp assay could be made applicable in the field with limited resources and in various conditions the lamp was used to evaluate the performance of the syringe filter based and commercial dna extraction methods the results of the lamp techniques for e coli and e faecalis spiked fresh and marine water samples had a comparable sensitivity in both dna extraction methods interestingly the lamp assays were able to detect 10 pg of dna while the conventional pcr was 100 pg figs 4 and 5 the sensitivity of the lamp was 10 times higher than the conventional pcr in this study because lamp has been shown to have a higher sensitivity and amplification efficiency as compared to a conventional pcr mori and notomi 2009 tanner and evans 2014 also the lamp assays have been known to be more specific due to binding primers at six distinct regions on the target dna goto et al 2009 notomi et al 2000 in this study the lamp provides a rapid dna detection within 30 min while the conventional pcr requires 90 min to complete dna amplification furthermore the lamp assay has a visual end result that allows for instant identification of the target dna whereas the conventional pcr requires further analysis using gel electrophoresis to determine the presence of a pcr amplicon in addition the lamp amplifies dna with high specificity and effectiveness and rapid under isothermal conditions mori and notomi 2009 notomi et al 2000 with the portable lamp device a simple visualization of the lamp reaction was carried out allowing for potential on site measurement since vast amounts of dna products are generated during a pcr reaction there is a risk of carryover contamination when opening the centrifuge tube to visualize the traditional lamp reaction martzy et al 2017 however in this study the lamp reaction in the oil chamber of the portable device and the immediate visualization of the lamp reaction was not compromised by any carryover contamination in addition the portable lamp device requires relatively small volume 5 μl of total reaction volume while other tube based lamp reactions need 25 50 μl of total volume setting a reduction in the reagent volume used in each reaction in the portable lamp device can substantially reduce the cost of lamp pcr developing rapid and reliable technologies for real time and in situ monitoring of microbial water quality is crucial to prevent or investigate the transmission of waterborne pathogens also the early detection of fib in environmental water samples is important to prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms in environments in this study we have developed a portable lamp device for simple and rapid onsite detection of fib in water samples from aquatic environments our simple and rapid dna extraction method combined with the portable platform makes it feasible for fib detection within 1 h in resource limited areas 5 conclusions the syringe filter based dna extraction procedure provides a simple and rapid for filtration of water samples and subsequently dna extraction without any laboratory equipment it could be applicable for microbial detection in a low resource setting while rapid detection of microorganisms is critical for assessing microbial quality of water the lamp assays of e coli and enterococcus in combination with the syringe filter based dna extraction method showed rapid detection of the presence of fecal indicator bacteria with higher sensitivity and more tolerance to the pcr inhibitors than conventional pcr methods however further developments are necessary for quantification of fecal indicator bacteria using isothermal pcr methods e g digital lamp pcr or mpn lamp pcr we have demonstrated the lamp pcr reaction using the portable pcr device for water quality monitoring and displayed the results by color changes it provides a platform of sample to answer results in less than 30 min the workflow including water sampling dna extraction and a lamp pcr reaction can be completed within 1 h our study demonstrates that mobile lamp pcr approaches allow scientists to track specific genetic material in their samples as they hunt for pathogens affecting dynamic ecosystem or analyze rapidly changing microbial water quality the portable pcr device for the lamp fib assays has a great potential to be combined with a lab on a chip system for quantification e g digital pcr and smartphone for monitoring color changes this would allow the full mobile pcr system to be a user friendly platform with easily sharing results our simple and rapid workflow could provide not only scientific communities but also citizen science to test water quality with a little training and simple equipment potentially anyone from the public can generate data that provide insight into the health of local water environment their engagement would enhance their awareness of water quality declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18749,contamination of water by fecal matter and potential human enteric pathogens is a serious health concern microbiological water quality has been assessed by conventional culture based methods of fecal indicator bacteria fib recently molecular techniques for fib have been introduced as alternative tools for rapid detection however such molecular techniques require a modern laboratory setting expensive equipment and skilled personnel in this study we developed a simple and rapid dna extraction method based on a syringe filter without any specialized equipment furthermore loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp pcr for fecal indicator bacteria fib i e e coli and e faecalis was carried out using the dna extracts from the syringe filter based dna extraction method the efficiency of the extracted dna from the syringe filter based method was comparable to the results of the commercial kit method we also tested fresh and marine water collected directly from different locations in singapore that were spiked with e coli or e faecalis the lamp assays combined with our dna extraction method showed higher sensitivity and more tolerance to pcr inhibitors than that of conventional pcr methods we further developed a portable lamp device to conduct isothermal pcr reactions for rapid on site measurement of fib as the color changes in the end point of the lamp reaction can be observed with the naked eye the portable lamp device was easily operated and quick obtaining results in 30 min the simple portable and user friendly platform can be used as an initial screening for the rapid detection of the presence fib in lower resource settings in conclusion the portable lamp device coupled with a syringe filter based dna extraction method enables us to detect the presence of fib for assessing microbial water quality within 1 h without any sophisticated laboratory equipment or highly trained personnel graphical abstract image 1 keywords loop mediated isothermal amplification fecal indicator bacteria portable lamp device simple dna extraction method 1 introduction rapid and in situ monitoring of waterborne pathogens is important in protecting the public s health from the danger of fecal contamination in water due to the cost and difficulty of counting a diverse type of pathogens fecal indicator bacteria fib have been used as proxies for the presence and concentration of fecal contamination and its associated pathogens culture based fib requiring overnight incubation prevents same day water quality determination but the implementation of dna based methods like the polymerase chain reaction pcr provides much faster detection of the target dna of fib in water bae and wuertz 2009 harwood et al 2014 haugland et al 2014 however modern laboratory expensive equipment and skilled personnel are necessary for rapid molecular detection of fib in water using this method recently an isothermal nucleic acid amplification called the loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp assay has been introduced as a novel detection technique this technique is known for its simplicity sensitivity and speed martzy et al 2017 compared to pcr and quantitative pcr the lamp assay s advantage is that it can be completed in a short time and with limited resources the lamp reaction is done with a bst dna polymerase with strand displacement activity and a set of 4 or 6 primers targeting 6 or 8 distinct regions on the target dna sequence and it is conducted under isothermal conditions ranging from 60 c to 65 c iwamoto et al 2003 nagamine et al 2002 tomlinson et al 2010 an additional advantage of lamp is that it is tolerant to common pcr inhibitors also lamp products can easily be detected by the naked eye or by adding a variety of dna intercalating dyes e g sybr green i syto calcein hydroxyl naphthol blue hnb to the tube allowing researchers to observe the color change of the solution ball et al 2016 goto et al 2009 iwamoto et al 2003 tomita et al 2008 while current pcr techniques have been widely employed for detecting and quantifying various types of microorganisms they are often impracticable for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib in water since molecular detection of fib requires sample collection and dna extraction prior to pcr reactions molecular testing of fib is generally conducted in an advanced laboratory thus there are considerable time intervals between sampling and transporting the sample to a laboratory which causes delays in determining the microbial water quality marx 2015 therefore evolving simple rapid and in situ sample preparations for sampling and dna extraction and developing an affordable and portable lamp device is crucial for implementing pcr techniques that would allow for in situ and rapid monitoring of fib in water also a portable lamp device is vital to perform molecular detection of fib after dna are extracted on site this device allows for fast analysis and a quick response to be taken if fecal contamination has happened a simple dna extraction of bacteria from water has been demonstrated using a sterile syringe filter with enzyme treatment for cell lysis backflush for unwanted cell debris removal and magnetic beads for dna purification kesberg and schleheck 2013 however this dna extraction turnaround time of 4 h is not ideal for rapidly detecting fib in water hence new and portable lamp devices are necessary for pcr amplification and analysis to become possible allowing for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib in water instead of commercially available dna kits we optimized a simple and rapid dna extraction method using a syringe filter without any additional instruments also a low cost portable lamp device was developed to facilitate the use of the simple dna extraction method coupled with the lamp assay in the field thus the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the performance of dna extraction using a syringe filter based dna extraction method as compared with a commercial dna extraction kit 2 to validate the feasibility of a lamp assay coupled with a syringe filter based dna extraction and 3 to develop a portable lamp device for lamp assays to detect fib in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and culture conditions escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis were used as model microorganisms to

15 h mm3 volume the chamber was fabricated to make a reaction plate and it was filled with 2 ml mineral oil sigma aldrich usa to prevent the sample from evaporating during the reactions to protect the sample from inhibition by the thermocouple and cross contamination and to isolate each sample the 5 μl droplets were placed into the oil in the chamber using a pipette the temperature of the floor surface in the chamber was monitored every 0 25 s in real time by a type k thermocouple labfacility uk the isothermal condition was controlled through the arduino software using the heater the fan and the thermocouple the heat sink was used to reduce the temperature variation rate the lamp assays were performed at 65 c for 30 m 3 results 3 1 overview of the syringe filter based approach for in situ dna isolation to develop a simple and rapid dna extraction that does not require costly laboratory equipment we optimized a protocol for recovering bacterial dna from water filters kesberg and schleheck 2013 a sterile syringe filter was used for rapid cell lysis and dna capture from pure cultures of e coli and e faecalis and environmental water samples the syringe filter based approach for in situ dna isolation is portable simple inexpensive and easily manageable previously kesberg and schleheck s method required lab equipment such as a water bath a shaking table and a vortex machine and it had a turnaround time of 4 h 2 h hands on time which renders it unsuitable for rapid and in situ microbial water quality monitoring in the field to make the method suitable for field based testing we developed a simplified dna extraction method which reduced the hands on time to 30 min and it does not require any laboratory equipment while there is a 170 min incubation and water bath in kesberg and schleheck s method our method was modified to 5 min of shaking the sample manually in every step of dna extraction procedure to provide the physical force to increase enzymatic interaction and to form the bio affinity between the magnetic beads and the dna fig 1 the efficiency of our syringe filter based dna extraction method was compared with the results of the commercial kit method the spiking experiment using e coli and e faecalis demonstrated that the syringe filter dna extraction method was feasible for field application as shown in fig 2 the syringe filter based dna method and the commercial kit genejet kit method had similar results when measuring dna concentrations we further evaluated the performance of our dna extraction method for freshwater and marine water samples in parallel with a commercial dna extraction kit powerwater kit before conducting the pcr and lamp reactions the concentration of fib from the water samples reservoir and coastline were measured using the mpn methods of the colilert 18 and enterolert in table 2 the colilert 18 results for the e coli cells were negative 0 mpn 100 ml in all freshwater and marine water samples table 2 in addition the amplification of the uida gene of e coli was not observed in the pcr and lamp reactions in both the reservoir and coastline samples fig 3 the freshwater samples showed that the reservoir 2 sample was positive for enterococcus at 24 mpn 100 ml while the reservoir had a relatively low concentration of 3 mpn 100 ml however two coastline water samples had no detection of enterococcus similarly the positive pcr band and color change of enterococcus in the pcr and lamp were observed for the freshwater sample but the amplification of enterococcus 23 rrna gene failed in the marine water samples supplementary fig s1 as e coli was absent in all water samples and enterococcus was only present in the reservoir samples in table 2 the positive results of lamp and pcr results are consistent with the presence of enterococcus from mpn analyses also the results of the pcr and lamp assays showed no difference between the results of the syringe filter based method and the commercial kit suggesting that the syringe filter based dna extraction method showed potential for rapid and reliable dna extraction for pcr and lamp testing in water 3 2 evaluation of the syringe filter based dna extraction method with pcr and lamp to validate the syringe filter based dna extraction method environmental water samples spiked with e coli and e faecalis were evaluated in parallel by a commercial dna extraction kit filtered sterile fresh and marine water samples were spiked with pure cultures of e coli and e faecalis in the range of approximately 107 cfu ml we further evaluated the efficacy of the dna extraction using serially diluted water samples from 107 cfu ml to 1 cfu ml fig 3 the lamp pcr confirmed that the syringe filter based method successfully extracted dna up to 102 cfu ml of e coli and e faecalis respectively for the e coli samples 2 out 3 samples were positive in 10 cfu ml suggesting that dna extraction efficiency of gram positive bacteria was low due to cell walls with thick layers of peptidoglycan also the10 fold serial dilutions of genomic dna of the e coli and e faecalis were used to estimate the dna extraction efficacy by a conventional pcr using two outer lamp primers f3 and b3 to supplementary fig s2 both the commercial kit and the syringe filter based method were able to detect up to 100 pg of diluent dna of e coli and e faecalis showing that the sensitivity of the syringe filter based method was comparable to the sensitivity of the commercial kit supplementary fig s2 in addition there were no differences between the observed patterns of the reservoir and coastline samples most importantly this filter based dna extraction method achieved a high quality of dna extraction with speed and simplicity without any specialized equipment such as a centrifuge or vortex also lamp assays were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the dna extraction using serially diluted genomic dna of e coli and e faecalis ranging from 10 ng to 1 pg the results of the lamp assays showed the color change in the reaction tubes and positive bands in the 1 5 agarose gel electrophoresis figs 4 and 5 the negative controls were tested in parallel with every reaction the color change was not observed on negative controls as shown in figs 4 and 5 the ladder like lamp products were clearly observed in both extraction methods by visual assessment using agarose gel electrophoresis no bands were observed when the sample had less than 10 pg dna indicating that the performances of the two dna extraction methods the syringe filter based and the commercial kit methods were similar in addition the color changing results were also consistent with gel electrophoresis this again shows that the filter based dna extraction method was equivalent to the commercial dna extraction kit as the amplification results were comparable to those observed when an identical amount of the dna sample from the commercial dna extraction kit was added to the lamp assays this experiment confirmed that the results of the lamp assay were again comparable to those of the conventional pcr but the sensitivity of the lamp assay was 10 times higher 3 3 pcr inhibitor and removal of pcr inhibitors the presence of pcr inhibitors from the environmental water samples was assessed using the dilution of samples and adding bsa bovine serum albumin the pcr and qpcr analyses were carried out with undiluted and diluted extracts no positive bands were obtained in e coli when the dna samples were directly used without dilution supplementary fig s3 however the effect of the inhibitor could be eliminated with appropriate dilution supplementary fig s3 on the other hand e faecalis cells were detected in both undiluted and diluted extracts and showed similar bands patterns on gel electrophoresis although a slight intensity difference was observed in the reservoir 1 sample supplementary fig s4 we also observed that the addition of extra bsa more efficiently reduced pcr inhibition than using the dilution method supplementary figs s3 and s4 these results showed that diluting the samples and adding bsa helps to reduce the inhibitor concentration and enhances pcr efficiency supplementary figs s2 and s4 furthermore the qpcr results showed a tendency similar to that of the gel electrophoresis where the effect of the pcr inhibition could be reduced in diluted dna samples supplementary fig s5 3 4 lamp assays on the portable lamp device in this study a portable lamp device was developed for the rapid assessment of the presence of e coli and e faecalis in environmental water samples as shown in fig 6 a the measured temperature of the portable lamp device was 64 43 0 98 c for the lamp reaction achieving an isothermal temperature of 65 c which is comparable temperature maintenance to a commercial thermal cycler fig 6b also the isothermal temperature of the lamp pcr mixture was not affected by the external environment due to the controlled heater and the fan maintaining at a constant temperature inside the oil chamber the pcr temperature in the device was continuously monitored as shown in fig 6b the maximum diameter of the droplets inside the oil chamber was about 6 18 mm considering the internal area 25 5 25 5 mm2 of the chamber and the droplet size nine droplets syringe filter based method commercial kit and control were successfully amplified in a single chip without any interference or any mixing of droplets the lamp reactions with spiking cultures of e coli and e faecalis to the fresh and marine water samples were conducted with the portable lamp device as shown in fig 6c as the color changes in end point of the assay can be observed with the naked eye the portable lamp device was easily operated and the result was obtained within 30 min the images from the portable lamp device were taken using a general smartphone vky l29 huawei camera without any external components as seen in fig 6c the color changes from pink to yellow were clearly observed in the dna from the syringe filter based and commercial kit methods for both e coli or e faecalis the consistent results were observed three times in trials additionally our syringe filter based dna extraction method worked equally well using a portable lamp device that allows for in situ monitoring of fib that takes 1 h from sampling and dna extraction to the lamp reaction 4 discussion the rapid and in situ monitoring of fib is the most in demand program of surface water quality monitoring in this study we demonstrated simple and rapid dna extraction methods on a portable and inexpensive pcr platform using this approach fib can be monitored within 1 h traditionally molecular techniques such as pcr and qpcr provide faster results and are considered as alternative methods to culture based methods to measure enterococcus and e coli in surface water however the implementation of the molecular techniques at the point of use will be a challenge because these methods require high end instruments trained personnel to perform sampling and the dna extractions and pcr reactions to be done in a modern laboratory setting these requirements greatly restrain water quality managers and stakeholders from applying pcr methods for in situ and real time monitoring of fib in resource limited settings however our simple filter based dna extraction method allows for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib in water without any costly equipment and with a little training filtering planktonic microbial biomass coupled with dna extraction on the filter is a key step for many molecular approaches that study the microbial diversity of aquatic environments somerville et al 1989 previously filter based dna extraction methods successfully recovered a sufficient amount of high molecular weight dna from water samples kesberg and schleheck 2013 kim and morrison 2009 although rapid and economic in house dna extraction methods have been reported kesberg and schleheck 2013 kim and morrison 2009 the yield and or purity of the samples could often be compromised fm 2001 sambrook j 2001 many commercially available dna extraction kits have good yield and high purity but those dna extraction kits are time consuming and require instruments such as a centrifuge a heat incubation and a vortex also the yield and purity of dna the hands on time and the cost should be considered when implementing rapid pcr detection in the field in this study cell lysis and purifying genomic dna using dna binding magnetic beads enhanced dna purity with less hands on time and reagents necessary without the use of any laboratory equipment magnetic beads are particularly efficient at isolating genomic dna with high throughput and in a reduced amount of time h lindstrom et al 2009 doing nucleic acid separation using magnetic particles has numerous advantages including directly isolating dna from raw samples he et al 2014 a high efficiency for large scale purification i et al 2001 m et al 2006 a low risk of cross contamination without using a centrifuge a high throughput which saves both time and money shana et al 2012 and it does not require any toxic chemicals caldarelli stefano et al 1999 applying a magnetic field with a permanent magnet ensures a simple and rapid method to separate the magnetic particles after binding and eluting the dna this ensures a higher quality of dna compared to centrifugation which may degrade the dna because of the shear force generated berensmeier 2006 it is easy to use rapid reliable field portable deployable and can be easily performed with a high quality dna yield without using any specialized equipment this study was focused on developing a simple low cost and rapid nucleic acid extraction method which is obviously ideal for field research where there are limited resources and unpredictable conditions however it is important to consider a sample matrix when extracting dna from water samples the high level of solid materials in a water sample e g sludge sediments and humic substance could prevent the syringe filter based dna extraction method from obtaining a high quality dna yield because of clogged pores on the filter pcr inhibitors remaining in the extracted dna could affect the sensitivity of the pcr or even lead to false negative results the pcr process could have been inhibited by impurities such as protein contamination and or the presence of leftover magnetic beads jiang et al 2005 kesberg and schleheck 2013 in the present study the addition of bsa and the dilution of the genomic dna alleviated pcr inhibition during pcr and qpcr however the lamp reaction was not affected by the presence of the pcr inhibitors because the dna polymerase in the lamp is more tolerant to pcr inhibitors than other polymerases such as taq martzy et al 2017 a simple and rapid detection method would also enable monitoring of a microbial community in the water in real time which allows for fast analysis and rapid response to be taken if there is contamination therefore our simple dna extraction method coupled with the lamp assay could be made applicable in the field with limited resources and in various conditions the lamp was used to evaluate the performance of the syringe filter based and commercial dna extraction methods the results of the lamp techniques for e coli and e faecalis spiked fresh and marine water samples had a comparable sensitivity in both dna extraction methods interestingly the lamp assays were able to detect 10 pg of dna while the conventional pcr was 100 pg figs 4 and 5 the sensitivity of the lamp was 10 times higher than the conventional pcr in this study because lamp has been shown to have a higher sensitivity and amplification efficiency as compared to a conventional pcr mori and notomi 2009 tanner and evans 2014 also the lamp assays have been known to be more specific due to binding primers at six distinct regions on the target dna goto et al 2009 notomi et al 2000 in this study the lamp provides a rapid dna detection within 30 min while the conventional pcr requires 90 min to complete dna amplification furthermore the lamp assay has a visual end result that allows for instant identification of the target dna whereas the conventional pcr requires further analysis using gel electrophoresis to determine the presence of a pcr amplicon in addition the lamp amplifies dna with high specificity and effectiveness and rapid under isothermal conditions mori and notomi 2009 notomi et al 2000 with the portable lamp device a simple visualization of the lamp reaction was carried out allowing for potential on site measurement since vast amounts of dna products are generated during a pcr reaction there is a risk of carryover contamination when opening the centrifuge tube to visualize the traditional lamp reaction martzy et al 2017 however in this study the lamp reaction in the oil chamber of the portable device and the immediate visualization of the lamp reaction was not compromised by any carryover contamination in addition the portable lamp device requires relatively small volume 5 μl of total reaction volume while other tube based lamp reactions need 25 50 μl of total volume setting a reduction in the reagent volume used in each reaction in the portable lamp device can substantially reduce the cost of lamp pcr developing rapid and reliable technologies for real time and in situ monitoring of microbial water quality is crucial to prevent or investigate the transmission of waterborne pathogens also the early detection of fib in environmental water samples is important to prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms in environments in this study we have developed a portable lamp device for simple and rapid onsite detection of fib in water samples from aquatic environments our simple and rapid dna extraction method combined with the portable platform makes it feasible for fib detection within 1 h in resource limited areas 5 conclusions the syringe filter based dna extraction procedure provides a simple and rapid for filtration of water samples and subsequently dna extraction without any laboratory equipment it could be applicable for microbial detection in a low resource setting while rapid detection of microorganisms is critical for assessing microbial quality of water the lamp assays of e coli and enterococcus in combination with the syringe filter based dna extraction method showed rapid detection of the presence of fecal indicator bacteria with higher sensitivity and more tolerance to the pcr inhibitors than conventional pcr methods however further developments are necessary for quantification of fecal indicator bacteria using isothermal pcr methods e g digital lamp pcr or mpn lamp pcr we have demonstrated the lamp pcr reaction using the portable pcr device for water quality monitoring and displayed the results by color changes it provides a platform of sample to answer results in less than 30 min the workflow including water sampling dna extraction and a lamp pcr reaction can be completed within 1 h our study demonstrates that mobile lamp pcr approaches allow scientists to track specific genetic material in their samples as they hunt for pathogens affecting dynamic ecosystem or analyze rapidly changing microbial water quality the portable pcr device for the lamp fib assays has a great potential to be combined with a lab on a chip system for quantification e g digital pcr and smartphone for monitoring color changes this would allow the full mobile pcr system to be a user friendly platform with easily sharing results our simple and rapid workflow could provide not only scientific communities but also citizen science to test water quality with a little training and simple equipment potentially anyone from the public can generate data that provide insight into the health of local water environment their engagement would enhance their awareness of water quality declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
