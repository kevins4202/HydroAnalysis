12090,the iju atuwara river is an important component of the owo river catchment orc which supports the livelihood of millions of people in lagos and ogun states of southwestern nigeria however rapid urbanisation and numerous anthropogenic activities have caused significant changes in the natural flow regime of the river resulting in serious bank erosion in many riparian areas accelerated bank erosion has been attributed to the combined effects of seepage erosion and fluvial undercutting of the bank toe due to the hydraulic stress of the river on the bank this research therefore investigated the combined effects of seepage erosion riparian vegetation root cohesion tension crack and land use land cover lulc change on the stability of riverbanks on the iju river nigeria multi temporal lulc datasets acquired from remotely sensed landsat images of 1999 2009 and 2019 were used to map lulc changes in the orc laboratory tests were conducted to determine the geotechnical properties of the riverbanks followed by bank stability analysis and evaluation of the erosion potential of the riverbanks using the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem and bank erosion hazard index behi respectively the bstem results indicate that the factor of safety f s decreased with an increase in seepage undercutting distance d u irrespective of the bank angle the correlation of f s with root cohesion c r and depth of tension crack z c shows that f s was positively correlated with c r but decreased with an increase in z c lulc change results show that the natural flow regimes of rivers within the orc have been adversely affected by the combined decrease in vegetation and wetlands with a corresponding increase in the spatial extents of the built up area and cultivated land open spaces these research findings are essential for the development of a watershed scale natural disaster management framework for the southwest ecoregion of nigeria graphical abstract image 1 keywords riverbank erosion tension cracks channel instability seepage undercutting land use land cover change 1 introduction riverbank erosion and the delivery of eroded sediments to rivers have significantly contributed to changes in the hydrologic response of many watersheds these hydrogeomorphic processes have caused numerous environmental problems including water quality impairments and loss of aquatic habitats a significant volume of literature exists that links riverbank erosion and sediment loading to rivers to the combined effects of land use change and climate variability rinaldi 2003 verstraeten and prosser 2008 kummu et al 2008 several anthropogenic activities have led to a disruption of the natural flow regimes of rivers leading to spatiotemporal changes in the fluvial system including runoff and sediment yield lane et al 2007 these human induced activities coupled with an increasing trend in hydroclimatic inputs have triggered numerous geoenvironmental and socioeconomic challenges such as loss of arable land flood inundation and sedimentation hazards destruction of riparian ecosystems and damage to earth embankments kondolf et al 2018 vietz et al 2018 consequently many riverbank stabilisation techniques and watershed management practices have been proposed by various researchers and hydraulic engineers for the mitigation of disasters caused by bank instabilities and channel incisions in rapidly evolving fluvial systems rosgen 1996 rinaldi and darby 2007 darby et al 2007 fox et al 2007a grove et al 2013 fox and felice 2014 klavon et al 2017 however there is sparse research to date on riverbank erosion processes and channel adjustments in many watersheds of southern nigeria in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia and africa accelerated riverbank erosion has been linked to an increase in anthropogenic stresses caused by rapid changes in agricultural and riparian land uses abam 1993 mango et al 2011 yao et al 2011 abate et al 2015 dewan et al 2017 nawfee et al 2018 these anthropogenic stresses may remain unabated given that the world s urban population has been estimated to grow by 2 5 billion people by 2050 with asia and africa projected to contribute 90 of the urban growth united nations 2015 therefore the conversion of forests to urban areas leads to an increase in surface runoff which significantly contributes to riverbank erosion and other hydrological hazards such as flooding surface water pollution and rainfall induced slope failures similarly numerous cases of riverbank retreat and coastal erosion have been attributed to several factors such as indiscriminate abstraction of groundwater destruction of riparian forest buffers zaimes and schultz 2015 yu et al 2020 construction and removal of dams pizzuto and o neal 2009 and unsustainable gravel and sand mining jordan et al 2019 hackney et al 2020 riverbank erosion primarily occurs through the combined process of fluvial undercutting of the bank toe and mass failure of the bank under gravitational forces thorne and abt 1993 simon et al 2000 these interconnected phenomena have been found to occur through the combination of three dominant mechanisms i seepage undercutting of the bank toe by the exfiltration of water from the bank ii fluvial entrainment of soil particles from the riverbank by flowing water caused by hydraulic forces that remove the erodible bank material and iii gravity driven bank failure or mass wasting of all or part of the riverbank due to a decrease in the shear strength of the bank material clark and wynn 2007 langendoen and simon 2008 nardi et al 2012 many documented cases of riverbank failures have reported an increase in the frequency of bank incisions and channel width adjustments during the falling limb of river hydrographs rinaldi et al 2004 wilson et al 2007 these phenomena have been linked to the complex relationships between subsurface flow groundwater table river stage and pore water pressure langendoen and simon 2008 noted that the stability of riverbanks depends on the combined influence of pore water pressure riparian vegetation hydrostatic pressure exerted by the river on the bank geometrical and lithological properties of the bank and the geotechnical characteristics of the bank material transient changes in pore water pressures during the rising and falling limbs of river hydrographs play a significant role in determining the stability of riverbanks during low river stage conditions the stability of riverbanks depends mostly on matric suction however an increase in the river stage leads to the development of positive pore water pressure and subsequent failure of the bank due to the reduction of the shear strength of the soil this in concert with seepage gradient forces and seepage erosion acts interdependently to cause instabilities in riverbanks for instance rinaldi and casagli 1999 investigated the influence of negative pore water pressures on the stability of streambanks along the sieve river italy by monitoring transient changes in pore water pressure and matric suction over a 16 month period their results revealed that the factor of safety increased with a decrease in negative pore water pressures during the rising limb of the river hydrograph however during the recession limb of the hydrograph the factor of safety decreased to a minimum while negative pore water pressures increased to values lower than the ambient values before the flow cycle seepage has been widely documented in the literature for its role in the modification of the natural environment such as in the retreat of riverbanks hagerty 1991 duval and hill 2006 midgley et al 2013 hillslope processes chu agor et al 2008 fox and wilson 2010 gullying wilson 2011 faulkner 2013 and failure of natural dams okeke and wang 2016a 2016b numerous attempts have been made to distinguish seepage erosion from other forms of subsurface erosion such as piping heave and sapping in riverbanks and hillslopes seepage erosion is usually associated with the development of perched water tables above water restricting zones or between horizons with differing hydraulic conductivities this erosion process occurs when subsurface flow interflow to streams leads to particle mobilisation once seepage velocity exceeds the critical shear stress wilson et al 2007 and fox and wilson 2010 defined sapping as bank collapse induced by seepage erosion due to the exfiltration of water from the bank which usually leads to the development of cavities on the bank face similarly seepage undercutting of riverbanks and soil slopes occur when water exfiltrates from the bank and leads to the sloughing and transport of liquefied materials which results in the gradual undercutting of the soil slope or bank face okeke and wang 2016a 2016b this failure mechanism has been attributed to the development of seepage gradient forces as expressed by 1 s f ρ g h y where sf seepage force per unit volume of soil ρ fluid density g acceleration due to gravity and h y hydraulic gradient iverson and major 1986 ghiassian and ghareh 2008 fox and wilson 2010 several studies have been done on the contribution of seepage erosion and seepage undercutting mechanisms to riverbank failure and channel width adjustments simon and collison 2001 fox et al 2006 2007a 2007b 2007c wilson et al 2007 combined in situ measurements and lysimeter experiments in an attempt to evaluate seepage flow rates and sediment concentrations along the banks of a deeply incised stream in mississippi usa the authors reported that seepage flow rates varied from 4 to 931 ld 1 while sediment concentrations varied from 0 4 to 660 gl 1 chu agor et al 2008 reported two characteristic mechanisms of seepage contributions to hillslope processes 1 tension or pop out failures and 2 seepage erosion bank undercutting and sloughing of the destabilised materials the former occurs when the seepage force exceeds the shear strength of the soil while the latter occurs when the resisting force of the soil becomes higher than the seepage force gradient midgley et al 2013 investigated the influence of seepage erosion on streambank failure by conducting in situ constant head experiments using a system of tensiometers and monitoring wells the authors reported that the progression of bank retreat was occasionally restricted by mass failure triggered by seepage undercutting this adds extra support to the bank thereby limiting further failure they concluded that the continuation of seepage erosion and bank undercutting depends on the rate of seepage flow and fluvial erosion there has been considerable debate on the reliability of results obtained from field in situ and laboratory flume scale measurement of the hydraulic properties of riverbanks due to the challenges associated with 1 accurate determination of seepage flow rates and sediment concentrations 2 simulation of seepage undercutting mechanisms and 3 some unavoidable scaling issues hence many riverbank stability assessment tools have been developed for the reach scale assessment of riverbank erosion potentials thorne and abt 1993 eaton 2006 sutarto et al 2014 the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem and the bank erosion hazard index behi have been widely used to evaluate the stability and erosion potential of riverbanks in many alluvial channels for instance cancienne et al 2008 utilised the bstem to investigate the stability of root reinforced streambanks subjected to seepage undercutting their results suggest that the sensitivity of the bstem to root cohesion was far lesser than that of water table elevation lindow et al 2009 combined lysimeter experiments and bstem to investigate the stability of layered streambanks subjected to seepage erosion and bank undercutting the authors stressed the inability of the bstem to predict seepage induced failure of streambanks however they found that seepage gradient forces triggered pop out failures and instability of the layered banks macfall et al 2014 evaluated the susceptibility of riverbanks to erosion using the rosgen s behi protocol their results found that the sites with the highest erosion potential generally had low riparian slopes similarly hecker et al 2019 utilised the behi method to investigate the influence of plant communities on the stability of streambanks in north dakota usa the authors found that sites that were dominated by facultative wetland plant communities had lower bank height ratio values and lower behi scores while sites with higher behi values unstable channels were characterised by early successional obligate species therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 utilise the bstem to evaluate the stability and failure mechanisms of the iju river banks by considering seasonal variations in river stage 2 examine the influence of depths of tension cracks and root cohesion on the stability of the banks and 3 assess the erosion potential of the riverbanks using the behi protocol furthermore gis and remote sensing techniques were used to investigate the impacts of lulc change on the hydrologic response of the orc over a 20 year period 1999 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the iju river 6 40 56 n 3 8 46 e is located in ado odo ota local government area of ogun state southwestern nigeria the river also known as river atuwara and other adjourning streams make up small tributaries that feed into the 71 2 km long owo river which flows southward and empties into the ologe lagoon in lagos state fig 1 the iju river is an important component of the orc the entire catchment which occupies a total area of about 1024 12 km2 falls within the humid tropical climate zone with a mean annual rainfall of about 1800 mm the study area including the orc has a dense vegetation cover typical of savannah woodland with a dendritic drainage pattern that trends southward towards the south atlantic ocean fig 2 a over the past three decades many cases of human induced modification of the natural flow regimes of streams and rivers have been recorded in the orc the rapid increase in the population of lagos and ogun states of southwestern nigeria has led to a series of alterations in the natural hydrologic disturbance regimes and sediment transport dynamics thereby modifying the timing and sequence of sediment loading into the rivers and causes a disruption of the entire fluvial system ebisemiju 1994 adegun et al 2015 these problems have been exacerbated by poor land use practices irrigation overdrafting of groundwater urbanisation and industrialisation especially in agbara ota alimosho and other cities within the catchment area as a consequence many cases of hydrological disasters are witnessed in these riparian areas and other parts of southern nigeria due to overbank flood events that accentuate riverbank erosion and stream channel instabilities okeke et al 2019 okeke and ede 2019 furthermore stream river impairments abound in these areas as a result of the high volumes of watershed sediment yields that increase water quality problems and alter aquatic habitats wynn 2006 emenike et al 2020 the environmental challenges posed by these recurring natural phenomena are enormous and several millions of us dollars have been spent by the local state and federal government agencies on riverbank stabilisation and other hydrological disasters world bank 2011 geologically the study area is entirely underlain by oligocene to recent coastal plain sands which is the youngest sedimentary unit in the stratigraphic sequence of the eastern dahomey basin the fluvial system of the study area is characterised by gently undulating lowlands with an elevation that ranges from 0 to 139 m and stream channels which are characterised by stable and unstable banks with heights that vary from 1 2 to 2 3 m fig 2b along river courses the bank sediments are predominated by coarse poorly sorted sands with clay lenses and occasional beds while the coastal areas are primarily comprised of unconsolidated clayey sands the iju river is a third order stream which displays a low sinuosity index s i 1 2 with channel width that varies from 14 to 18 m and a mean bed slope of 0 0003 bed sediments are predominantly composed of fine to very fine grained sand with occasional deposits of well consolidated cohesive sediments active seepage erosion cavities tension cracks and overhanging cliffs which represent visible indications of bank retreat were observed at several locations along the river channel 2 2 field survey and geotechnical characterisation of the riverbanks field investigations were undertaken from april 2017 to january 2019 primarily during the dry and rainy seasons a survey datasheet developed by simon and downs 1995 and modified by heeren et al 2012 was used to record the field data the survey was conducted on the left and right banks of the river channel to determine the inherent factors contributing to bank instabilities and channel width adjustments along the river channel geometrical and geomorphological characteristics of the riverbanks such as bank face length bank height maximum bankfull depth bank angle depth of tension cracks and root depth were measured at more than fifteen locations along the river channel primarily at locations where active bank erosion processes have been observed table 1 also vegetation density and surface protection were determined by visual estimation following the method proposed by rosgen 2001 a global positioning system gps model no 0100097000 garmin etrex 10 was used to determine the geographical location of the bank sites while a portable depth sounder speedtech depthmate hondex ps 7 including a canoe 50 m measuring tape and several 3 m steel telescopic ranging poles were used to determine the geometrical characteristics of the river channel the bank angle was measured with a digital inclinometer all the measurements were repeated at quarterly intervals in all the study sites to obtain the cross profile of the river and to determine transient changes in the morphodynamics of the river undisturbed soil cores were obtained from thirteen representative locations six on the right bank and seven on the left bank using standard u4 sampling tubes along with disturbed soil samples the soil samples were collected from the bank top at depths ranging from 0 5 to 2 m and the bank face at approximately 0 3 m above the river stage similarly thirteen disturbed soil samples were collected from the same location on the bank top and bank face to evaluate changes in the geotechnical properties of the bank materials the soil samples were secured in air tight containers before they were transported to the laboratory to ensure that the ambient physical conditions of the soils remained the same prior to the tests the soil samples were subjected to a range of laboratory tests including particle size analysis atterberg limits unconsolidated undrained triaxial test and phase relationship tests bulk density dry density void ratio and effective porosity a combination of the sieve and hydrometer methods were used to determine the grain size distribution curves of the soil samples in accordance with astm d6913 2017 and astm d7928 17 2017 standards respectively atterberg limit test was conducted as per astm d4318 17e1 2017 while unconsolidated undrained triaxial tests were performed to determine the undrained shear strength properties of the bank materials following astm d2850 15 2015 standards 2 3 bank stability and toe erosion model bstem the bstem was used to evaluate the stability of the riverbanks and to determine the rate and volume of sediment eroded from the bank toe under differing geotechnical and hydraulic conditions simon et al 2000 2011 klavon et al 2017 the bstem was developed by usda ars national sedimentation laboratory oxford mississippi usa as an effective mechanistic tool for evaluating riverbank erosion processes and channel width adjustments the current version of the bstem version 5 4 is capable of evaluating both the geotechnical and hydraulic fluvial forces that control riverbank stability by considering several factors including the river current dynamics bank geometry soil properties and groundwater conditions hence the model is divided into two different submodels bank stability segment and toe erosion segment simon et al 2011 the model calculates factor of safety f s as the ratio of the resisting force to the driving force by integrating three limit equilibrium method models horizontal layers vertical slices and cantilever failures the model classifies banks with f s values of 1 0 1 25 as conditionally stable and less than 1 0 as unstable while banks with f s values greater than 1 25 are classified as stable using the mohr coulomb equation the resisting force can be expressed as 2 s r c σ μ w tan ϕ where s r shear strength of the soil kpa c effective cohesion kpa σ normal stress kpa μ w pore water pressure kpa and ϕ effective friction angle degrees furthermore by considering the role of matric suction negative pore water pressure in increasing the stability of riverbanks in ambient conditions the bstem represents the shear strength of the soil using the modified mohr coulomb equation as proposed by fredlund et al 1978 3 s r c σ μ a tan ϕ μ a μ w tan ϕ b where μ a pore air pressure kpa μ a μ w matric suction kpa σ μ a net normal stress on the failure plane at failure and ϕ b angle indicating the increase in shear strength relative to matric suction degrees the stability of the riverbanks at different locations was analysed using field measured geometrical characteristics of the banks and the geotechnical properties of the bank materials as determined from laboratory tests the stability analysis was carried out by considering the effects of water surface elevation river stage bank angle depth of tension crack lateral distance of seepage undercutting and effect of bank vegetation root cohesion riparian forest buffers increase the stability of riverbanks via root reinforcement a term which is used to describe the process that increases the shear strength of riverbank materials due to the anchoring of plant roots into the soil micheli and kirchner 2002 krzeminska et al 2019 by attributing the enhanced shear strength of the root reinforced soil to an increase in apparent cohesion of the soil eq 2 can be expressed as abernethy and rutherfurd 2000 4 s s r c c r σ μ w tan ϕ where s s r shear strength of the soil root matrix and c r apparent cohesion provided by plant roots typical values of c r have been found to vary from 1 0 to 94 3 kpa chok et al 2015 therefore the f s of root reinforced riverbanks and natural slopes can be determined by incorporating the estimated c r value into traditional slope stability analysis methods as given by styczen and morgan 1995 5 f s c c r γ z γ w h v w c o s 2 α t sin θ tan ϕ t cos θ γ z w sin α d cos α where γ w unit weight of water 9 8 kn m3 γ unit weight of soil kn m3 z vertical thickness of soil above

slope kn m it has been established that more than 50 of riparian tree roots are found within the top 0 3 0 5 m layers of the soil therefore this research investigated the influence of riparian vegetation on the stability of the riverbanks by using the root reinforcement submodel riproot in the bstem this was achieved by using the c r values obtained from the default parameters in the bstem and by assuming that the riparian area is dominated by wet meadow vegetation with uniform plant age and total coverage of 3 years and 100 respectively wet meadow vegetation was selected because of its close similarity with the riparian wetland however the dominant plant species in the area are invasive grasses e g echinochloa stagnina oryza barthii and vetivera nigritana which cover up to 95 of the riparian vegetation while a few clusters of bamboo trees bambusa vulgaris make up the remaining 5 of the riparian vegetation furthermore given that the maximum rooting depth of the major plant species within the riparian wetland was 0 25 m the stability analysis was performed by considering three different rooting depths and their corresponding c r values 0 m bare soil no vegetation cover c r 0 kpa 0 3 m 3 40 kpa and 0 5 m 3 63 kpa the gradient of the channel bed used in the bstem analysis was set at 0 0003 based on the measured values of channel gradients that varied from 0 00025 to 0 0004 while the analysis was conducted under maximum flow duration of three 3 time steps with a complete time step representing a flow duration of 24 h 2 4 bank erosion hazard index behi the erosion potential of the riverbanks was evaluated using the behi method which utilises the geomorphic characteristics of riverbanks and other key metrics to characterise the erosion potential of the banks the behi protocol was developed by dave rosgen of wildland hydrology inc usa as one of the several alternative geomorphic assessment methods used for the assessment of riverbank erosion and channel width adjustments rosgen 1997 2001 this empirically derived predictive model has been used to investigate the potential stability of streambanks in many catchments jennings and harman 2001 van eps et al 2004 ulrich and nieber 2008 heeren et al 2012 macfall et al 2014 the behi method which is more reliable for predicting the erosion potential of lower order rivers integrates five key riverbank metrics based on the geometrical and geomorphological characteristics of riverbanks bank height ratio root depth ratio root density bank angle degrees and surface protection table 2 bank height ratio and root depth ratio are the ratios of the bank height and mean plant root to the bankfull depth and bank height respectively root density is the percentage of the riverbank surface that is covered by plant roots while surface protection is the percentage of the riverbank that is covered by plant roots woody debris boulders rocky materials and artificial structures such as riprap and revetments the components of the riverbank metrics were obtained by direct measurement of the bank height bank angle maximum bankfull depth and root depth and visual estimation of vegetation density and surface protection the behi protocol assigns point values which correspond to the five key riverbank metrics and thus provide an overall behi rating that describes the susceptibility of the riverbank to erosion rosgen 2001 a detailed description of the methods used for determining the geometrical characteristics of the riverbanks has been presented in subsection 2 2 of this paper vegetation density at each study site was estimated using a 1 m 1 m quadrat over a 3 m line transect while bank angle α was measured with a digital inclinometer however observational errors were minimised by comparing the α values obtained with a digital inclinometer with the values determined using the method adopted by heeren et al 2012 6 α sin 1 b h b f l where b h bank height m and b f l bank face length m fig 3 a bankfull depth at each study site was carefully identified using various bankfull indicators such as characteristic floodplain features active and abandoned floodplains type and location of vegetation with respect to the river stage and textural variation of the bank material however the accuracy of the behi results was improved by using bankfull depth values determined immediately after rainfall events and during the peak stages of storm hydrographs fig 3b the various bank metrics determined from the field monitoring and surveys were recorded in a behi evaluation datasheet similar to the type used by newton and drenten 2015 2 5 land use land cover lulc change analysis 2 5 1 data acquisition and preparation landsat 5 and 7 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 oli tm path 191 and row 055 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used for the lulc classification table 3 the satellite data covering the study area were acquired in 1999 2009 and 2019 from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov the landsat tm imageries were obtained at level 1 tp and thus indicate that they have been radiometrically calibrated and orthorectified furthermore an advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m was acquired in 2019 from the usgs cf fig 2b ancillary data included topographic maps ground truth data for the lulc classes and aerial imagery of the iju river sub catchment and the entire orc the ground truth data were collected with a handheld gps garmin etrex 10 while the topographic maps of the study area were obtained from the federal surveys of nigeria the topographic maps were geo referenced and digitised using the on screen method in arcgis 10 7 2 5 2 image pre processing lulc classification and accuracy assessment satellite image processing such as geo referencing mosaicking cloud and cloud shadow detection and sub setting of the images based on the area of interest was carried using arcgis 10 7 software atmospheric corrections were carried out on the remotely sensed data using the dark object subtraction dos method while radiometric corrections were performed by converting the digital numbers dns to top of atmosphere reflectance furthermore geometric corrections were also performed by identifying some significant ground control points gcps in the image using a 3d polynomial function which corrects for local distortions at the gcp the root mean square error rmse values obtained from all the georectifications were smaller than half of a pixel the enhanced landsat images were resampled using the nearest neighbour algorithm to ensure that the pixel values remain unchanged supervised classification was then used to classify the lulc of the study area by utilising the maximum likelihood classification mlc tool the mlc algorithm is one of the most widely used supervised classification methods for lulc analysis otukei and blaschke 2010 rawat and kumar 2015 the catchment area was categorised into five main lulc classes built up area cultivated land open spaces thick vegetation light vegetation and wetlands the classification was performed with the aid of digitised topographic maps of the study area and ground reference data from gps devices and google earth pro application during the analysis about 120 training sites 24 for each of the five lulc classes were selected from each image to ensure adequate representation of all the spectral classes composing each lulc class in the statistics algorithm the accuracy assessment of the three classified lulc maps was statistically evaluated using the error matrix by comparing the reference data with the classification result shalaby and tateishi 2007 thereafter kappa test was carried out to assess the degree of accuracy of the classification results 3 results 3 1 geometrical and geomorphological characteristics of the riverbanks fig 4 a shows the three dominant groups of riverbanks along the river channel the classification was done based on the lithology and material composition of the riverbanks as follows 1 group 1 are composite banks which comprise a basal layer of very resistant stiff clay with occasional gravel and an upper layer of silty clay 2 group 2 banks are wholly homogeneous and are primarily made up of fine to medium grained silty sand and organic debris and 3 group 3 banks are characterised by upper alternating layers of silt and clay and a basal layer of very resistant stiff clay group 1 banks are the most prevalent geomorphological features on the left side of the river channel and are sparsely observed on the right they are characterised by high values of bank height and bank angle with near vertical bank faces that were attributed to the cohesive nature of their materials group 2 banks are limited to the fluvial plains on the right bank of the river which present very low values of bank height and bank angle and owe their origin to many cycles of overbank flooding and sedimentation group 3 banks abound on both sides of the river channel and are characteristically distinguished by the presence of many seepage erosion cavities tension cracks and overhanging cliffs fig 4b and c shows the geometrical characteristics of the riverbanks the result indicates that the bank heights were higher on the left side of the river channel than on the right with a mean bank height of 1 84 and 1 48 m respectively similarly the maximum and minimum values of bank face length on both sides of the river were 2 31 and 1 49 m for the left bank and 1 90 and 1 18 m for the right bank the mean bank height ratios for the left and right banks of the river channel were 0 66 and 0 54 respectively table 1 analysis of the dominant bank angles in all the study sites indicates that about 23 of the bank angles falls within the range of 86 90 while only 10 falls in the range of 66 70 the left and right banks of the river channel shows an average bank angle of 87 and 75 respectively the steep nature of the bank slopes and the high values of the bank height relative to the mean river stage can be related to the relatively high shear strength properties of the riverbanks the dominant processes contributing to riverbank retreat on the iju river can be divided into four categories 1 planar slab type failure 2 pop out failure 3 alcove type failure and 4 cantilever failure planar and alcove type failures dominate the left bank of the river and constitute up to 70 of all failures on the river channel these failure mechanisms have been related to seepage and fluvial undercutting of the bank toe which reduce the stability of the bank and result in the development of vertical tension cracks and very steep surfaces thorne and tovey 1981 thorne and abt 1993 cantilever failures were markedly distinguished by the presence of many overhanging cliffs with deep tension cracks fig 5 pop out failures abound in group 1 and 3 riverbanks and occur as a result of concentrated seepage flow in the highly conductive layers of the composite banks chu agor et al 2008 alcove type failures were generally characterised by the failure of relatively small material from the middle section of the riverbanks instabilities originating from alcove and pop out failures have been related to high seepage gradient forces that result in the saturation of the bank face due to the reduction of the shear strength of the soil and thus leads to the formation of seepage cavities dapporto et al 2001 2003 fig 6 3 2 geotechnical characteristics of the riverbanks the results of the geotechnical tests are summarised in table 4 based on the result of the grain size distributions analysis the bank materials can be classified as inorganic clay silty clay and silty sand following the unified soil classification system uscs grain size distribution analysis shows that towards the lower reaches of the river the bank materials changed from highly consolidated silty clay to poorly consolidated inorganic silt and fine sand ija 2 series especially on the right bank of the river fig 7 majority of the soil samples collected from the left bank of the river were classified as inorganic clay of high plasticity ch while the soils dominating the right bank of the river were classified as inorganic clay and silty clay of low to medium plasticity cl excluding the ija 2 series which are essentially non plastic silty sand sm the average clay silt and sand contents of the soil samples were 19 3 17 and 68 5 respectively the liquid limit ll plastic limit pl and plasticity index pi of the soil samples had average values of 39 15 and 24 respectively bulk density had minimum and maximum values of 1 78 and 1 96 mg m3 respectively results of the unconsolidated undrained triaxial compression tests indicate that the effective cohesion c of the bank materials varied from 15 to 19 kpa except for the ija 2 series which are mostly noncohesive sediments furthermore the effective friction angle φ of the overbank floodplain deposits ija 2 series varied from 33 to 34 while φ obtained from the remaining bank sites varied from 20 to 26 3 3 riverbank stability analysis a series of iterative modelling using the bstem version 5 4 was performed by considering a five layer bank with an average height of 1 5 m fig 8 the simulations were conducted by assuming two water surface elevations river stages of 0 5 and 1 2 m which were set to represent the average water surface elevations for the dry and rainy wet seasons respectively results obtained from the simulations performed with a river stage of 0 5 m for the first time step of 24 h indicate that f s values were above 1 8 stable but had a negative correlation with the bank angle table 5 however the f s of the banks decreased to a mean value of 1 39 during the second time step results obtained with a river stage of 1 2 m during the first time step show that f s increased from 2 59 to 2 80 as bank angle decreased from 90 to 70 the results generally show that the banks simulated with a higher river stage condition had higher initial f s values than those simulated under a lower river stage condition and thus indicate the influence of hydrostatic pressure of the river on the stability of the riverbanks however during the second and third time steps majority of the initially stable banks f s 2 0 became conditionally stable and unstable due to fluvial undercutting of the bank toe as a result of an increase in the average boundary shear stress exerted by the river on the bank dapporto et al 2003 simon et al 2011 to simulate the influences of tension cracks and root cohesion c r on the stability of the riverbanks tension crack depths z c of 0 2 0 6 m and c r of 0 3 4 and 3 63 kpa were incorporated into the bank stability and root reinforcement riproot submodels and simulated with river stages of 0 5 and 1 2 m respectively the results show that the predicted f s decreased with an increase in z c but increased with an increase in c r irrespective of the river stage table 5 some researchers have reported similar results in their study of the effects of root cohesion on the stability of riverbanks and soil slopes abernethy and rutherfurd 2000 easson and yarbrough 2002 simon and collison 2002 it is noteworthy to mention that during the first time step no further decrease in the predicted f s was observed beyond a z c of 0 4 m for the simulations performed with a river stage of 1 2 m however the predicted f s of the riverbanks transitioned from stable to conditionally stable and unstable as the simulated flow event changed from step 1 to step 2 fig 9 shows the relationships between f s and seepage undercutting distance d u for the riverbank with two different bank angles 70 and 90 and river stages of 0 5 and 1 2 m respectively the results show that f s decreased with an increase in d u irrespective of the river stage furthermore when the river stage was at 0 5 m the stability of the banks increased with a decrease in bank angle interestingly for the 90 bank simulated with a river stage of 1 2 m the f s decreased from 2 59 to 1 59 as d u increased from 0 to 0 3 m however under the same d u and river stage the f s of the 70 bank decreased from 2 80 to 1 86 it is noteworthy to mention that the observed decrease in f s with respect to d u for the analysis conducted with a river stage of 1 2 m was essentially due to fluvial undercutting of the bank toe because the river stage was higher than the location of the seepage cavity on the bank face some researchers e g lindow et al 2009 have also reported the inability of simulating seepage induced failure of layered streambanks using the bstem the combination of bstem results and data obtained from repeated cross profiling indicate that the mechanisms contributing to seasonal variations in the stability of the riverbanks can be divided into two episodes i episode i low river stage conditions and ii episode ii high river stage conditions during the dry season episode i the mean boundary shear stress is usually low due to the recession of the river hydrograph bank failures mostly occur during accelerated drawdown conditions as seepage gradient forces act in combination with pore water pressures to trigger mass wasting of all or parts of the bank furthermore the falling limb of the river hydrograph induces seepage erosion which emerges from the bank face through many seepage cavities cf fig 6a this exfiltration process triggers mass outwash of the fluidised bank sediments and at the same time destabilises the bank by reducing the shear strength of the soil leading to the gradual retreat of the riverbank okeke et al 2014 episode ii represents all bank processes that commonly occur during the rising limb and peak stage of the storm hydrograph wet season while it has been reported that during high river stage conditions the stability of riverbanks increases due to the influence of the confining pressure of the water on the bank however field evidence from this research indicates that many bank instabilities were triggered by fluvial undercutting of the bank toe due to the hydraulic stress exerted by the river current on the bank during the wet season the erosion of the riverbanks was found to occur in two ways 1 fluvial erosion of the original material supporting the bank toe and 2 active undermining of the basal section of the bank by the combined effects of flow stress and pore water pressures while the bstem results presented very high values of f s during the initial stages of episode ii further analysis of the bank stability shows that the banks became unstable after several time steps this agrees with the observations made from the field where significant bank instabilities occurred during high river stage conditions which usually last for about six months april october cf fig 6b 3 4 evaluation of erosion potential of the riverbanks to provide a detailed insight into the stability of the banks a quantitative assessment was carried out using a fluvial geomorphic approach behi which evaluates and predicts the erosion potential of riverbanks using five key bank metrics a summary of the behi analysis carried out on the left and right banks of the river is given in table 6 the results indicate that virtually all the study sites on the right bank of the river had moderate behi values with an average total index of 26 in contrast the study sites on the left bank of the river showed high erosion potential with an average total index of 33 the average bank height ratios determined from the left and right banks of the river channel were 0 74 and 0 46 respectively an analysis of the riverbanks with respect to behi revealed a negative relationship between the channel width and the bank height the result showed that behi and bank height decreased for every increase in channel width analysis of geometrical data collected from april 2017 to january 2019 indicates that the left bank of the river has an average bank erosion rate of 0 15 m yr similarly the relatively small root depth ratios displayed by the banks especially on the left bank of the river demonstrate the high susceptibility of the riverbank to erosion given that the majority of the banks had sparse vegetation cover with a maximum root depth of 0 25 m similar results have been reported by abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 hubble et al 2010 and micheli and kirchner 2002 who investigated the effects of riparian tree roots and root density on the stability of riverbanks overall the absence of any form of surface protection coupled with active undercutting of the bank toe and the lack of secondary reinforcement in the form of vegetation root cohesion all contributed to the high susceptibility of the riverbanks to fluvial erosion 3 5 lulc maps and accuracy assessment typical lulc classification maps of the study area for the years 1999 2009 and 2019 are shown in fig 10 while the classification results for the reference years are summarised in table 7 results of the accuracy assessment of the lulc classification reveal overall classification accuracies of 89 98 92 97 and 90 08 for 1999 2009 and 2019 respectively similarly kappa statistics were 0 89 0 92 and 0 89 for 1999 2009 and 2019 respectively analysis of the spatial distribution of the lulc classes shows that in 1999 thick vegetation was prevalent in the northwestern parts of the orc wetlands dominated the southern part while light vegetation and built up area dominated the eastern part of the orc fig 10a however in 2009 the northern and southern parts of the orc were dominated by wetlands while thick vegetation coalesced to the center with a corresponding increase in the total area of built up spaces fig 10b in 2019 the central and western parts of the orc witnessed a significant increase in the built up area due to an increase in urban growth with a major spread in the eastern part of the region fig 10c in contrast the areas covered by thick vegetation and wetlands decreased considerably at the expense of the rapidly expanding urban areas fig 11 shows the magnitude of change in the five lulc classes during the two periods hereinafter referred to as period 1 and period 2 for 1999 2009 and 2009 2019 respectively comparison of the two periods indicates that vegetation was the most adversely affected lulc class in the orc cf table 7 during the two periods the total area covered by thick vegetation significantly decreased by 117 46 and 107 47 km2 which represents a percentage decrease of 11 59 and 10 60 respectively light vegetation also decreased by 26 92 km2 2 66 and 3 52 km2 0 35 during period 1 and period 2 respectively it is noteworthy to mention that the area covered by the built up spaces increased by 61 66 and 85 62 km2 representing a percentage increase of 6 08 and 8 45 during period 1 and period 2 respectively similarly the area covered by cultivated land open spaces increased by 19 50 km2 1 92 and 71 27 km2 7 03 during period 1 and period 2 respectively in contrast the area covered by wetlands increased by 63 22 km2 6 24 during period 1 and subsequently decreased by 45 91 km2 4 53 during period 2 from the results of the lulc classification analysis it was observed that changes in land use and land cover have adversely affected the hydrologic response of the catchment the rapid increase in built up areas and cultivated land open spaces and subsequent decrease in riparian vegetation and wetlands were attributed to the burgeoning human population which had a negative impact on the natural hydrologic disturbance regimes of streams and rivers within the orc consequently the rate of riverbank erosion and sediment loading into the surrounding streams and rivers have increased as a direct consequence of reduced forest buffers within the riparian areas hagerty et al 1981 winterbottom and gilvear 2000 rhoades et al 2009 while these natural processes have triggered several flood disasters in the riparian areas it is expected that the socioeconomic effects of riverbank erosion will continue to rise until a sustainable watershed management strategy is adopted to mitigate the disasters zaman 1989 hossain 1993 4 discussion 4 1 seepage undercutting and tension crack contributions to riverbank erosion quantifying the contributions of seepage erosion to riverbank failure has been a challenging task to geomorphologists and hydraulic engineers mainly due to certain hydroclimatic and geoenvironmental factors in addition to some challenges posed by the lack of precision instruments and access to remote areas consequently seepage erosion is often neglected in the stability analysis of riverbanks due to its complex relationship with other bank erosion mechanisms such as fluvial erosion and mass failure which occur as a result of a decrease in the shear strength of the bank material some researchers have successfully used field in situ methods and lysimeter experiments to quantify seepage erosion rates in deeply incised streambanks in the usa fox et al 2006 2007a wilson et al 2007 lindow et al 2009 midgley et al 2013 however the variability of the results obtained from both methods has called for a more accurate way of predicting the stability of riparian slopes subjected to seepage erosion chu agor et al 2008 reported that seepage induced failure of riverbanks and hillslopes occurs through the following interconnected processes 1 increase in pore water pressure 2 evolution of seepage gradient forces and 3 seepage particle mobilisation and undercutting the first and second mechanisms have been extensively studied by simon and collison 2001 and rinaldi et al 2004 in cohesive streambanks and layered banks while the third mechanism bank toe erosion by seepage undercutting has been observed in laboratory scale lysimeter experiments where the increase in d u leads to bank instability due to a decrease in f s wilson et al 2007 fox and felice 2014 results of the stability analysis performed with various values of d u 0 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m and bank angles 70 and 90 revealed a significant decrease in f s as d u increased from 0 to 0 3 m irrespective of bank angle and river stage cf fig 9 similar trends in f s have been reported by fox et al 2007c wilson et al 2007 and cancienne et al 2008 by simulating seepage undercutting failure of streambanks using the bstem and slope w models therefore this research demonstrates the significant dependence of f s on d u bank angle bank stratification river stage and hydraulics root cohesion and other prevailing geotechnical and geoenvironmental conditions on the stability of riparian slopes the high f s values obtained under a high river stage of 1 2 m rainy season flow elevation relative to the values obtained when the river stage was at 0 5 m dry season flow elevation were attributed to the increased confining pressure of the river on the bank which brought additional stabilising force on the bank cf fig 9b however at higher flow durations f s rapidly decreased by more than 50 causing the banks to become unstable and conditionally stable and thus demonstrates that the instability of the riverbanks was triggered by fluvial undercutting of the bank toe due to the increased hydraulic stress of the river on the banks cf fig 6b this process has been attributed to an increase in the hydraulic radius r h of the river channel especially from sand mining activities in the area which lead to channel incisions and bed degradation that increase the mean boundary shear stress τ 0 as expressed by the equation simon et al 2000 7 τ 0 γ w r h s 0 where s 0 channel bed slope m m similarly the complex relationship between f s z c and bank angle α demonstrates that the riverbanks retreat by two main interrelated mechanisms 1 fluvial erosion and seepage undercutting of the bank toe which oversteepens the bank face and results in the evolution of tension cracks on the bank top cf figs 5 and 6b and 2 planar slab type and or cantilever failure of the oversteepened bank due to an increase in z c that leads to a corresponding decrease in f s thorne and abt 1993 simon et al 2000 4 2 effect of riparian vegetation on the stability of the riverbanks riparian zones play a significant role in the morphodynamics of streams and river channels and provide stable environments that support both aquatic and terrestrial biota the stability of many streams and river channels has been attributed to the type and magnitude of vegetation in the riparian zone this is because root density and root tensile strength improve the overall shear strength of soil by providing additional shear resistance via root reinforcement avril and barten 2007 used the dynamic equilibrium concept to describe the intricate relationship between riparian vegetation channel geometry flow regime sediment loading large woody debris geology and shear strength of the riverbank material this research shows that the increase in f s with respect to c r is directly attributed to the positive influence of riparian vegetation in the mitigation of bank erosion and stream channel adjustments cf table 5 furthermore the inverse relationship between f s and bank angle at constant c r further demonstrates that riparian vegetation with deep root system has a higher potential to increase the stability of riverbanks the observed increase in f s due to the influence of root reinforcement has been reported in recent research carried out with the bstem see cancienne et al 2008 krzeminska et al 2019 yu et al 2020 this research is limited by the fact that the root tensile strength t r and other characteristics of roots of different plant species e g root diameter and root area ratio within the riparian area were not determined in situ or in the laboratory as normally done using traditional testing devices abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 simon and collison 2002 yu et al 2020 hence the c r values used in the stability analysis were obtained from the default parameters in the bstem by comparing the vegetation in the riparian wetland to wet meadow vegetation with uniform plant age and coverage of 3 years and 100 respectively these assumptions may give a slight margin of error in the predicted f s because plant species and root diameter have a significant influence on the tensile strength of roots notwithstanding our findings suggest that the major factors that contribute to accelerated bank erosion on the river channel are agricultural intensification and rapid urbanisation that lead to the removal of the initial riparian forest buffers thereby increasing surface runoff and sediment yield to the river channels these complex processes lead to channel incisions and accelerated bank erosion due to the aggradation of the channels and formation of channel bars 4 3 impact of lulc change on the hydrologic response of the owo river catchment land use activities including urbanisation deforestation unsustainable agricultural practices and other anthropogenic disturbances have adversely affected a large portion of the earth s land surface more than three decades of intensive research has indicated that lulc change dynamics have contributed to a decrease in the global ecosystem health foley et al 2005 zhao et al 2006 the environmental impacts of lulc change are higher in asia and africa than in other regions due to the rapid growth in urban population that leads to increased anthropogenic stresses priess et al 2011 abdullah et al 2019 consequently many hydrological hazards including soil and gully erosion riverbank instabilities floods siltation and surface water pollution occur in these regions as a direct consequence of land use intensification the hydrologic response of many watersheds to lulc change impacts involves a complex process that requires a good knowledge of rainfall runoff relationships according to avril and barten 2007 stream channels exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium therefore any alteration in the prevailing natural flow regimes of rivers within a catchment may lead to accelerated bank erosion channel width adjustments and channel planform evolution until the prevailing condition or dynamic equilibrium is restored midha and mathur 2014 as stated in section 3 5 of this paper the hydrologic response of the orc has been extensively modified by land use intensification based on the results of the lulc analysis of the catchment furthermore the lulc classification results of the orc suggest that urbanisation was the major land use class that caused significant changes in the morphological characteristics of the river channels during the 20 year period 1999 2019 the rapid expansion of urban centers around agbara alimosho sango ota and other counties within the orc has resulted in a drastic conversion of the landscape in the western parts of the catchment from rural peri rural to peri urban land use the study area is bordered on the south and east by lagos one of the largest and fastest growing cities in the world which has a growth rate of 4 44 and urban population density of 14 469 residents per square kilometer consequently the rapid expansion of the urban centers during the 20 year period has increased runoff coefficient runoff ratio and peak discharge from stormflow and thus contributes to serious bank erosion and channel width adjustments the influence of urbanisation on the natural hydrologic disturbance regimes of rivers within the orc could be related to a theoretical cycle proposed by wolman 1967 the cycle describes the process of urbanisation in a representative watershed and its effects on the river channel using three phases fig 12 phase 1 represents a river channel which is initially in dynamic equilibrium within a watershed that is dominated by forests or characterised by agricultural landscape phase 2 represents a period of intensive construction activities that lead to the exposure of the bare land to erosion and phase 3 represents a final stage in which the watershed is essentially dominated by urban landscape with a significantly high percentage area of impervious surfaces comparison made between figs 10 and 12 demonstrates that during the 20 year period the dynamic changes in lulc within the orc have adversely affected the characteristics of the river channels and the natural hydrologic regimes of rivers within the catchment cf fig 10c these changes occur as a result of the expansion of the built up area and unsustainable agricultural practices that lead to high sediment yield to the river channels which subsequently result in channel constrictions bank erosion and flooding midha and mathur 2014 furthermore the construction and removal of dams in addition to sand and gravel mining are other major anthropogenic activities which have been attributed to serious bank erosion on many inland rivers and streams tiegs and pohl 2005 jordan et al 2019 hackney et al 2020 while there is no historical record of dam construction or removal on the river channels numerous subsistence sand mining and occasional dredging of the riverbeds have caused serious hydraulic consequences on the morphodynamics of rivers within the orc consequently severe bank instabilities occur as a result of a decrease in hydraulic roughness which results in an increase in flow depth and hydraulic radius that increases discharge flow velocity and bed shear stress 5 conclusions the iju river and other stream courses within the orc have experienced alterations in their natural hydrologic disturbance regimes and sediment transport dynamics brought about by numerous anthropogenic changes such as urbanisation agricultural intensification artisanal sand mining and occasional dredging of the riverbeds these anthropogenic disturbances have led to an increase in the rate of sediment loading into the rivers which lead to accelerated bank erosion that is often occasioned by seepage undercutting and fluvial erosion of the bank during high and low river stages in this paper a comprehensive research on the contributions of seepage erosion to seasonal variations in riverbank stability was conducted with the objectives of evaluating 1 the influence of seepage undercutting distance depth of tension crack and root cohesion on the stability of the riparian slopes and 2 the erosion potential of the riverbanks using the behi protocol detailed geomorphological and geotechnical properties of the riverbanks were determined through repeated measurement of the bank profiles followed by bank stability analysis using the bstem by considering two river stages and different bank angles furthermore the impacts of lulc change on the hydrology of the catchment were assessed by comparing the lulc maps of 1999 2009 and 2019 the conclusions drawn from this study can be summarised as follows 1 repeated field surveys and data acquisitions were used to classify the riverbanks into three dominant groups composite homogeneous and layered banks based on their lithological and sedimentological characteristics numerous seepage erosion cavities within the composite and layered banks were attributed to the different lithological characteristics of the bank materials which gave rise to the marked differences in the hydraulic conductivity of the composite and layered bank materials 2 planar slab type and alcove type failures constitute the dominant mechanisms of riverbank erosion on the iju river and comprise more than 70 of all bank failures on the river channel pop out failures dominated the composite and layered banks and typically occurred during the recession limb of the river hydrograph as water exfiltrates from the bank through the highly conductive layers cantilever failures were distinguished by the preponderance of many overhanging cliffs and tension cracks with depths ranging from 0 15 to 0 2 m 3 the f s of the banks decreased with an increase in the depth of the tension cracks z c but increased as root cohesion increased from 3 40 to 3 63 kpa however at a higher river stage further increase in z c beyond 0 4 m did not cause any significant reduction in f s of the riverbanks 4 f s of the riverbanks decreased with an increase in seepage undercutting distance d u and bank angle α irrespective of the river stage high values of f s were obtained when the river stage was at 1 2 m suggesting the influence of confining pressure of the water on the stability of the banks however the banks became unstable as f s decreased to less than 1 0 due to the destabilisation of the unprotected bank toe by the hydraulic shear stress of the river this occurs in addition to the reduction of matric suction as the soil transitions from partial to fully saturated conditions 5 about 90 of the riparian slope dominating the left bank of the river had an average behi value of 33 while the right bank had an average behi value of 26 these results are in agreement with the f s obtained using the bstem and from geometrical analysis of the riparian slope furthermore the high rate of bank retreat observed on the left side of the river channel has been attributed to its mean bank angle of 87 and the marked differences in the hydraulic conductivities of the stratified beds coupled with the absence of toe protection structures and vegetation cover 6 this research showed that significant changes in lulc occurred in the orc during the 20 year period 1999 2019 the most adversely affected lulc class in the orc was thick vegetation which decreased by 117 46 km2 and 107 47 km2 during the periods 1999 2009 and 2009 2019 respectively in contrast the built up area increased by 61 66 and 85 62 km2 during the two periods the temporal dynamics of lulc change in the orc during the 20 year period revealed that rapid urbanisation and anthropogenic disturbances caused significant alterations in the prevailing natural hydrologic regimes of rivers within the catchment which led to accelerated bank erosion and channel planform changes this research also showed the positive influence of plant roots on the stability of the riverbanks therefore further research is needed to determine the plant species in the catchment that would produce the optimum root cohesion

12090,the iju atuwara river is an important component of the owo river catchment orc which supports the livelihood of millions of people in lagos and ogun states of southwestern nigeria however rapid urbanisation and numerous anthropogenic activities have caused significant changes in the natural flow regime of the river resulting in serious bank erosion in many riparian areas accelerated bank erosion has been attributed to the combined effects of seepage erosion and fluvial undercutting of the bank toe due to the hydraulic stress of the river on the bank this research therefore investigated the combined effects of seepage erosion riparian vegetation root cohesion tension crack and land use land cover lulc change on the stability of riverbanks on the iju river nigeria multi temporal lulc datasets acquired from remotely sensed landsat images of 1999 2009 and 2019 were used to map lulc changes in the orc laboratory tests were conducted to determine the geotechnical properties of the riverbanks followed by bank stability analysis and evaluation of the erosion potential of the riverbanks using the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem and bank erosion hazard index behi respectively the bstem results indicate that the factor of safety f s decreased with an increase in seepage undercutting distance d u irrespective of the bank angle the correlation of f s with root cohesion c r and depth of tension crack z c shows that f s was positively correlated with c r but decreased with an increase in z c lulc change results show that the natural flow regimes of rivers within the orc have been adversely affected by the combined decrease in vegetation and wetlands with a corresponding increase in the spatial extents of the built up area and cultivated land open spaces these research findings are essential for the development of a watershed scale natural disaster management framework for the southwest ecoregion of nigeria graphical abstract image 1 keywords riverbank erosion tension cracks channel instability seepage undercutting land use land cover change 1 introduction riverbank erosion and the delivery of eroded sediments to rivers have significantly contributed to changes in the hydrologic response of many watersheds these hydrogeomorphic processes have caused numerous environmental problems including water quality impairments and loss of aquatic habitats a significant volume of literature exists that links riverbank erosion and sediment loading to rivers to the combined effects of land use change and climate variability rinaldi 2003 verstraeten and prosser 2008 kummu et al 2008 several anthropogenic activities have led to a disruption of the natural flow regimes of rivers leading to spatiotemporal changes in the fluvial system including runoff and sediment yield lane et al 2007 these human induced activities coupled with an increasing trend in hydroclimatic inputs have triggered numerous geoenvironmental and socioeconomic challenges such as loss of arable land flood inundation and sedimentation hazards destruction of riparian ecosystems and damage to earth embankments kondolf et al 2018 vietz et al 2018 consequently many riverbank stabilisation techniques and watershed management practices have been proposed by various researchers and hydraulic engineers for the mitigation of disasters caused by bank instabilities and channel incisions in rapidly evolving fluvial systems rosgen 1996 rinaldi and darby 2007 darby et al 2007 fox et al 2007a grove et al 2013 fox and felice 2014 klavon et al 2017 however there is sparse research to date on riverbank erosion processes and channel adjustments in many watersheds of southern nigeria in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia and africa accelerated riverbank erosion has been linked to an increase in anthropogenic stresses caused by rapid changes in agricultural and riparian land uses abam 1993 mango et al 2011 yao et al 2011 abate et al 2015 dewan et al 2017 nawfee et al 2018 these anthropogenic stresses may remain unabated given that the world s urban population has been estimated to grow by 2 5 billion people by 2050 with asia and africa projected to contribute 90 of the urban growth united nations 2015 therefore the conversion of forests to urban areas leads to an increase in surface runoff which significantly contributes to riverbank erosion and other hydrological hazards such as flooding surface water pollution and rainfall induced slope failures similarly numerous cases of riverbank retreat and coastal erosion have been attributed to several factors such as indiscriminate abstraction of groundwater destruction of riparian forest buffers zaimes and schultz 2015 yu et al 2020 construction and removal of dams pizzuto and o neal 2009 and unsustainable gravel and sand mining jordan et al 2019 hackney et al 2020 riverbank erosion primarily occurs through the combined process of fluvial undercutting of the bank toe and mass failure of the bank under gravitational forces thorne and abt 1993 simon et al 2000 these interconnected phenomena have been found to occur through the combination of three dominant mechanisms i seepage undercutting of the bank toe by the exfiltration of water from the bank ii fluvial entrainment of soil particles from the riverbank by flowing water caused by hydraulic forces that remove the erodible bank material and iii gravity driven bank failure or mass wasting of all or part of the riverbank due to a decrease in the shear strength of the bank material clark and wynn 2007 langendoen and simon 2008 nardi et al 2012 many documented cases of riverbank failures have reported an increase in the frequency of bank incisions and channel width adjustments during the falling limb of river hydrographs rinaldi et al 2004 wilson et al 2007 these phenomena have been linked to the complex relationships between subsurface flow groundwater table river stage and pore water pressure langendoen and simon 2008 noted that the stability of riverbanks depends on the combined influence of pore water pressure riparian vegetation hydrostatic pressure exerted by the river on the bank geometrical and lithological properties of the bank and the geotechnical characteristics of the bank material transient changes in pore water pressures during the rising and falling limbs of river hydrographs play a significant role in determining the stability of riverbanks during low river stage conditions the stability of riverbanks depends mostly on matric suction however an increase in the river stage leads to the development of positive pore water pressure and subsequent failure of the bank due to the reduction of the shear strength of the soil this in concert with seepage gradient forces and seepage erosion acts interdependently to cause instabilities in riverbanks for instance rinaldi and casagli 1999 investigated the influence of negative pore water pressures on the stability of streambanks along the sieve river italy by monitoring transient changes in pore water pressure and matric suction over a 16 month period their results revealed that the factor of safety increased with a decrease in negative pore water pressures during the rising limb of the river hydrograph however during the recession limb of the hydrograph the factor of safety decreased to a minimum while negative pore water pressures increased to values lower than the ambient values before the flow cycle seepage has been widely documented in the literature for its role in the modification of the natural environment such as in the retreat of riverbanks hagerty 1991 duval and hill 2006 midgley et al 2013 hillslope processes chu agor et al 2008 fox and wilson 2010 gullying wilson 2011 faulkner 2013 and failure of natural dams okeke and wang 2016a 2016b numerous attempts have been made to distinguish seepage erosion from other forms of subsurface erosion such as piping heave and sapping in riverbanks and hillslopes seepage erosion is usually associated with the development of perched water tables above water restricting zones or between horizons with differing hydraulic conductivities this erosion process occurs when subsurface flow interflow to streams leads to particle mobilisation once seepage velocity exceeds the critical shear stress wilson et al 2007 and fox and wilson 2010 defined sapping as bank collapse induced by seepage erosion due to the exfiltration of water from the bank which usually leads to the development of cavities on the bank face similarly seepage undercutting of riverbanks and soil slopes occur when water exfiltrates from the bank and leads to the sloughing and transport of liquefied materials which results in the gradual undercutting of the soil slope or bank face okeke and wang 2016a 2016b this failure mechanism has been attributed to the development of seepage gradient forces as expressed by 1 s f ρ g h y where sf seepage force per unit volume of soil ρ fluid density g acceleration due to gravity and h y hydraulic gradient iverson and major 1986 ghiassian and ghareh 2008 fox and wilson 2010 several studies have been done on the contribution of seepage erosion and seepage undercutting mechanisms to riverbank failure and channel width adjustments simon and collison 2001 fox et al 2006 2007a 2007b 2007c wilson et al 2007 combined in situ measurements and lysimeter experiments in an attempt to evaluate seepage flow rates and sediment concentrations along the banks of a deeply incised stream in mississippi usa the authors reported that seepage flow rates varied from 4 to 931 ld 1 while sediment concentrations varied from 0 4 to 660 gl 1 chu agor et al 2008 reported two characteristic mechanisms of seepage contributions to hillslope processes 1 tension or pop out failures and 2 seepage erosion bank undercutting and sloughing of the destabilised materials the former occurs when the seepage force exceeds the shear strength of the soil while the latter occurs when the resisting force of the soil becomes higher than the seepage force gradient midgley et al 2013 investigated the influence of seepage erosion on streambank failure by conducting in situ constant head experiments using a system of tensiometers and monitoring wells the authors reported that the progression of bank retreat was occasionally restricted by mass failure triggered by seepage undercutting this adds extra support to the bank thereby limiting further failure they concluded that the continuation of seepage erosion and bank undercutting depends on the rate of seepage flow and fluvial erosion there has been considerable debate on the reliability of results obtained from field in situ and laboratory flume scale measurement of the hydraulic properties of riverbanks due to the challenges associated with 1 accurate determination of seepage flow rates and sediment concentrations 2 simulation of seepage undercutting mechanisms and 3 some unavoidable scaling issues hence many riverbank stability assessment tools have been developed for the reach scale assessment of riverbank erosion potentials thorne and abt 1993 eaton 2006 sutarto et al 2014 the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem and the bank erosion hazard index behi have been widely used to evaluate the stability and erosion potential of riverbanks in many alluvial channels for instance cancienne et al 2008 utilised the bstem to investigate the stability of root reinforced streambanks subjected to seepage undercutting their results suggest that the sensitivity of the bstem to root cohesion was far lesser than that of water table elevation lindow et al 2009 combined lysimeter experiments and bstem to investigate the stability of layered streambanks subjected to seepage erosion and bank undercutting the authors stressed the inability of the bstem to predict seepage induced failure of streambanks however they found that seepage gradient forces triggered pop out failures and instability of the layered banks macfall et al 2014 evaluated the susceptibility of riverbanks to erosion using the rosgen s behi protocol their results found that the sites with the highest erosion potential generally had low riparian slopes similarly hecker et al 2019 utilised the behi method to investigate the influence of plant communities on the stability of streambanks in north dakota usa the authors found that sites that were dominated by facultative wetland plant communities had lower bank height ratio values and lower behi scores while sites with higher behi values unstable channels were characterised by early successional obligate species therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 utilise the bstem to evaluate the stability and failure mechanisms of the iju river banks by considering seasonal variations in river stage 2 examine the influence of depths of tension cracks and root cohesion on the stability of the banks and 3 assess the erosion potential of the riverbanks using the behi protocol furthermore gis and remote sensing techniques were used to investigate the impacts of lulc change on the hydrologic response of the orc over a 20 year period 1999 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the iju river 6 40 56 n 3 8 46 e is located in ado odo ota local government area of ogun state southwestern nigeria the river also known as river atuwara and other adjourning streams make up small tributaries that feed into the 71 2 km long owo river which flows southward and empties into the ologe lagoon in lagos state fig 1 the iju river is an important component of the orc the entire catchment which occupies a total area of about 1024 12 km2 falls within the humid tropical climate zone with a mean annual rainfall of about 1800 mm the study area including the orc has a dense vegetation cover typical of savannah woodland with a dendritic drainage pattern that trends southward towards the south atlantic ocean fig 2 a over the past three decades many cases of human induced modification of the natural flow regimes of streams and rivers have been recorded in the orc the rapid increase in the population of lagos and ogun states of southwestern nigeria has led to a series of alterations in the natural hydrologic disturbance regimes and sediment transport dynamics thereby modifying the timing and sequence of sediment loading into the rivers and causes a disruption of the entire fluvial system ebisemiju 1994 adegun et al 2015 these problems have been exacerbated by poor land use practices irrigation overdrafting of groundwater urbanisation and industrialisation especially in agbara ota alimosho and other cities within the catchment area as a consequence many cases of hydrological disasters are witnessed in these riparian areas and other parts of southern nigeria due to overbank flood events that accentuate riverbank erosion and stream channel instabilities okeke et al 2019 okeke and ede 2019 furthermore stream river impairments abound in these areas as a result of the high volumes of watershed sediment yields that increase water quality problems and alter aquatic habitats wynn 2006 emenike et al 2020 the environmental challenges posed by these recurring natural phenomena are enormous and several millions of us dollars have been spent by the local state and federal government agencies on riverbank stabilisation and other hydrological disasters world bank 2011 geologically the study area is entirely underlain by oligocene to recent coastal plain sands which is the youngest sedimentary unit in the stratigraphic sequence of the eastern dahomey basin the fluvial system of the study area is characterised by gently undulating lowlands with an elevation that ranges from 0 to 139 m and stream channels which are characterised by stable and unstable banks with heights that vary from 1 2 to 2 3 m fig 2b along river courses the bank sediments are predominated by coarse poorly sorted sands with clay lenses and occasional beds while the coastal areas are primarily comprised of unconsolidated clayey sands the iju river is a third order stream which displays a low sinuosity index s i 1 2 with channel width that varies from 14 to 18 m and a mean bed slope of 0 0003 bed sediments are predominantly composed of fine to very fine grained sand with occasional deposits of well consolidated cohesive sediments active seepage erosion cavities tension cracks and overhanging cliffs which represent visible indications of bank retreat were observed at several locations along the river channel 2 2 field survey and geotechnical characterisation of the riverbanks field investigations were undertaken from april 2017 to january 2019 primarily during the dry and rainy seasons a survey datasheet developed by simon and downs 1995 and modified by heeren et al 2012 was used to record the field data the survey was conducted on the left and right banks of the river channel to determine the inherent factors contributing to bank instabilities and channel width adjustments along the river channel geometrical and geomorphological characteristics of the riverbanks such as bank face length bank height maximum bankfull depth bank angle depth of tension cracks and root depth were measured at more than fifteen locations along the river channel primarily at locations where active bank erosion processes have been observed table 1 also vegetation density and surface protection were determined by visual estimation following the method proposed by rosgen 2001 a global positioning system gps model no 0100097000 garmin etrex 10 was used to determine the geographical location of the bank sites while a portable depth sounder speedtech depthmate hondex ps 7 including a canoe 50 m measuring tape and several 3 m steel telescopic ranging poles were used to determine the geometrical characteristics of the river channel the bank angle was measured with a digital inclinometer all the measurements were repeated at quarterly intervals in all the study sites to obtain the cross profile of the river and to determine transient changes in the morphodynamics of the river undisturbed soil cores were obtained from thirteen representative locations six on the right bank and seven on the left bank using standard u4 sampling tubes along with disturbed soil samples the soil samples were collected from the bank top at depths ranging from 0 5 to 2 m and the bank face at approximately 0 3 m above the river stage similarly thirteen disturbed soil samples were collected from the same location on the bank top and bank face to evaluate changes in the geotechnical properties of the bank materials the soil samples were secured in air tight containers before they were transported to the laboratory to ensure that the ambient physical conditions of the soils remained the same prior to the tests the soil samples were subjected to a range of laboratory tests including particle size analysis atterberg limits unconsolidated undrained triaxial test and phase relationship tests bulk density dry density void ratio and effective porosity a combination of the sieve and hydrometer methods were used to determine the grain size distribution curves of the soil samples in accordance with astm d6913 2017 and astm d7928 17 2017 standards respectively atterberg limit test was conducted as per astm d4318 17e1 2017 while unconsolidated undrained triaxial tests were performed to determine the undrained shear strength properties of the bank materials following astm d2850 15 2015 standards 2 3 bank stability and toe erosion model bstem the bstem was used to evaluate the stability of the riverbanks and to determine the rate and volume of sediment eroded from the bank toe under differing geotechnical and hydraulic conditions simon et al 2000 2011 klavon et al 2017 the bstem was developed by usda ars national sedimentation laboratory oxford mississippi usa as an effective mechanistic tool for evaluating riverbank erosion processes and channel width adjustments the current version of the bstem version 5 4 is capable of evaluating both the geotechnical and hydraulic fluvial forces that control riverbank stability by considering several factors including the river current dynamics bank geometry soil properties and groundwater conditions hence the model is divided into two different submodels bank stability segment and toe erosion segment simon et al 2011 the model calculates factor of safety f s as the ratio of the resisting force to the driving force by integrating three limit equilibrium method models horizontal layers vertical slices and cantilever failures the model classifies banks with f s values of 1 0 1 25 as conditionally stable and less than 1 0 as unstable while banks with f s values greater than 1 25 are classified as stable using the mohr coulomb equation the resisting force can be expressed as 2 s r c σ μ w tan ϕ where s r shear strength of the soil kpa c effective cohesion kpa σ normal stress kpa μ w pore water pressure kpa and ϕ effective friction angle degrees furthermore by considering the role of matric suction negative pore water pressure in increasing the stability of riverbanks in ambient conditions the bstem represents the shear strength of the soil using the modified mohr coulomb equation as proposed by fredlund et al 1978 3 s r c σ μ a tan ϕ μ a μ w tan ϕ b where μ a pore air pressure kpa μ a μ w matric suction kpa σ μ a net normal stress on the failure plane at failure and ϕ b angle indicating the increase in shear strength relative to matric suction degrees the stability of the riverbanks at different locations was analysed using field measured geometrical characteristics of the banks and the geotechnical properties of the bank materials as determined from laboratory tests the stability analysis was carried out by considering the effects of water surface elevation river stage bank angle depth of tension crack lateral distance of seepage undercutting and effect of bank vegetation root cohesion riparian forest buffers increase the stability of riverbanks via root reinforcement a term which is used to describe the process that increases the shear strength of riverbank materials due to the anchoring of plant roots into the soil micheli and kirchner 2002 krzeminska et al 2019 by attributing the enhanced shear strength of the root reinforced soil to an increase in apparent cohesion of the soil eq 2 can be expressed as abernethy and rutherfurd 2000 4 s s r c c r σ μ w tan ϕ where s s r shear strength of the soil root matrix and c r apparent cohesion provided by plant roots typical values of c r have been found to vary from 1 0 to 94 3 kpa chok et al 2015 therefore the f s of root reinforced riverbanks and natural slopes can be determined by incorporating the estimated c r value into traditional slope stability analysis methods as given by styczen and morgan 1995 5 f s c c r γ z γ w h v w c o s 2 α t sin θ tan ϕ t cos θ γ z w sin α d cos α where γ w unit weight of water 9 8 kn m3 γ unit weight of soil kn m3 z vertical thickness of soil above

slope kn m it has been established that more than 50 of riparian tree roots are found within the top 0 3 0 5 m layers of the soil therefore this research investigated the influence of riparian vegetation on the stability of the riverbanks by using the root reinforcement submodel riproot in the bstem this was achieved by using the c r values obtained from the default parameters in the bstem and by assuming that the riparian area is dominated by wet meadow vegetation with uniform plant age and total coverage of 3 years and 100 respectively wet meadow vegetation was selected because of its close similarity with the riparian wetland however the dominant plant species in the area are invasive grasses e g echinochloa stagnina oryza barthii and vetivera nigritana which cover up to 95 of the riparian vegetation while a few clusters of bamboo trees bambusa vulgaris make up the remaining 5 of the riparian vegetation furthermore given that the maximum rooting depth of the major plant species within the riparian wetland was 0 25 m the stability analysis was performed by considering three different rooting depths and their corresponding c r values 0 m bare soil no vegetation cover c r 0 kpa 0 3 m 3 40 kpa and 0 5 m 3 63 kpa the gradient of the channel bed used in the bstem analysis was set at 0 0003 based on the measured values of channel gradients that varied from 0 00025 to 0 0004 while the analysis was conducted under maximum flow duration of three 3 time steps with a complete time step representing a flow duration of 24 h 2 4 bank erosion hazard index behi the erosion potential of the riverbanks was evaluated using the behi method which utilises the geomorphic characteristics of riverbanks and other key metrics to characterise the erosion potential of the banks the behi protocol was developed by dave rosgen of wildland hydrology inc usa as one of the several alternative geomorphic assessment methods used for the assessment of riverbank erosion and channel width adjustments rosgen 1997 2001 this empirically derived predictive model has been used to investigate the potential stability of streambanks in many catchments jennings and harman 2001 van eps et al 2004 ulrich and nieber 2008 heeren et al 2012 macfall et al 2014 the behi method which is more reliable for predicting the erosion potential of lower order rivers integrates five key riverbank metrics based on the geometrical and geomorphological characteristics of riverbanks bank height ratio root depth ratio root density bank angle degrees and surface protection table 2 bank height ratio and root depth ratio are the ratios of the bank height and mean plant root to the bankfull depth and bank height respectively root density is the percentage of the riverbank surface that is covered by plant roots while surface protection is the percentage of the riverbank that is covered by plant roots woody debris boulders rocky materials and artificial structures such as riprap and revetments the components of the riverbank metrics were obtained by direct measurement of the bank height bank angle maximum bankfull depth and root depth and visual estimation of vegetation density and surface protection the behi protocol assigns point values which correspond to the five key riverbank metrics and thus provide an overall behi rating that describes the susceptibility of the riverbank to erosion rosgen 2001 a detailed description of the methods used for determining the geometrical characteristics of the riverbanks has been presented in subsection 2 2 of this paper vegetation density at each study site was estimated using a 1 m 1 m quadrat over a 3 m line transect while bank angle α was measured with a digital inclinometer however observational errors were minimised by comparing the α values obtained with a digital inclinometer with the values determined using the method adopted by heeren et al 2012 6 α sin 1 b h b f l where b h bank height m and b f l bank face length m fig 3 a bankfull depth at each study site was carefully identified using various bankfull indicators such as characteristic floodplain features active and abandoned floodplains type and location of vegetation with respect to the river stage and textural variation of the bank material however the accuracy of the behi results was improved by using bankfull depth values determined immediately after rainfall events and during the peak stages of storm hydrographs fig 3b the various bank metrics determined from the field monitoring and surveys were recorded in a behi evaluation datasheet similar to the type used by newton and drenten 2015 2 5 land use land cover lulc change analysis 2 5 1 data acquisition and preparation landsat 5 and 7 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 oli tm path 191 and row 055 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used for the lulc classification table 3 the satellite data covering the study area were acquired in 1999 2009 and 2019 from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov the landsat tm imageries were obtained at level 1 tp and thus indicate that they have been radiometrically calibrated and orthorectified furthermore an advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m was acquired in 2019 from the usgs cf fig 2b ancillary data included topographic maps ground truth data for the lulc classes and aerial imagery of the iju river sub catchment and the entire orc the ground truth data were collected with a handheld gps garmin etrex 10 while the topographic maps of the study area were obtained from the federal surveys of nigeria the topographic maps were geo referenced and digitised using the on screen method in arcgis 10 7 2 5 2 image pre processing lulc classification and accuracy assessment satellite image processing such as geo referencing mosaicking cloud and cloud shadow detection and sub setting of the images based on the area of interest was carried using arcgis 10 7 software atmospheric corrections were carried out on the remotely sensed data using the dark object subtraction dos method while radiometric corrections were performed by converting the digital numbers dns to top of atmosphere reflectance furthermore geometric corrections were also performed by identifying some significant ground control points gcps in the image using a 3d polynomial function which corrects for local distortions at the gcp the root mean square error rmse values obtained from all the georectifications were smaller than half of a pixel the enhanced landsat images were resampled using the nearest neighbour algorithm to ensure that the pixel values remain unchanged supervised classification was then used to classify the lulc of the study area by utilising the maximum likelihood classification mlc tool the mlc algorithm is one of the most widely used supervised classification methods for lulc analysis otukei and blaschke 2010 rawat and kumar 2015 the catchment area was categorised into five main lulc classes built up area cultivated land open spaces thick vegetation light vegetation and wetlands the classification was performed with the aid of digitised topographic maps of the study area and ground reference data from gps devices and google earth pro application during the analysis about 120 training sites 24 for each of the five lulc classes were selected from each image to ensure adequate representation of all the spectral classes composing each lulc class in the statistics algorithm the accuracy assessment of the three classified lulc maps was statistically evaluated using the error matrix by comparing the reference data with the classification result shalaby and tateishi 2007 thereafter kappa test was carried out to assess the degree of accuracy of the classification results 3 results 3 1 geometrical and geomorphological characteristics of the riverbanks fig 4 a shows the three dominant groups of riverbanks along the river channel the classification was done based on the lithology and material composition of the riverbanks as follows 1 group 1 are composite banks which comprise a basal layer of very resistant stiff clay with occasional gravel and an upper layer of silty clay 2 group 2 banks are wholly homogeneous and are primarily made up of fine to medium grained silty sand and organic debris and 3 group 3 banks are characterised by upper alternating layers of silt and clay and a basal layer of very resistant stiff clay group 1 banks are the most prevalent geomorphological features on the left side of the river channel and are sparsely observed on the right they are characterised by high values of bank height and bank angle with near vertical bank faces that were attributed to the cohesive nature of their materials group 2 banks are limited to the fluvial plains on the right bank of the river which present very low values of bank height and bank angle and owe their origin to many cycles of overbank flooding and sedimentation group 3 banks abound on both sides of the river channel and are characteristically distinguished by the presence of many seepage erosion cavities tension cracks and overhanging cliffs fig 4b and c shows the geometrical characteristics of the riverbanks the result indicates that the bank heights were higher on the left side of the river channel than on the right with a mean bank height of 1 84 and 1 48 m respectively similarly the maximum and minimum values of bank face length on both sides of the river were 2 31 and 1 49 m for the left bank and 1 90 and 1 18 m for the right bank the mean bank height ratios for the left and right banks of the river channel were 0 66 and 0 54 respectively table 1 analysis of the dominant bank angles in all the study sites indicates that about 23 of the bank angles falls within the range of 86 90 while only 10 falls in the range of 66 70 the left and right banks of the river channel shows an average bank angle of 87 and 75 respectively the steep nature of the bank slopes and the high values of the bank height relative to the mean river stage can be related to the relatively high shear strength properties of the riverbanks the dominant processes contributing to riverbank retreat on the iju river can be divided into four categories 1 planar slab type failure 2 pop out failure 3 alcove type failure and 4 cantilever failure planar and alcove type failures dominate the left bank of the river and constitute up to 70 of all failures on the river channel these failure mechanisms have been related to seepage and fluvial undercutting of the bank toe which reduce the stability of the bank and result in the development of vertical tension cracks and very steep surfaces thorne and tovey 1981 thorne and abt 1993 cantilever failures were markedly distinguished by the presence of many overhanging cliffs with deep tension cracks fig 5 pop out failures abound in group 1 and 3 riverbanks and occur as a result of concentrated seepage flow in the highly conductive layers of the composite banks chu agor et al 2008 alcove type failures were generally characterised by the failure of relatively small material from the middle section of the riverbanks instabilities originating from alcove and pop out failures have been related to high seepage gradient forces that result in the saturation of the bank face due to the reduction of the shear strength of the soil and thus leads to the formation of seepage cavities dapporto et al 2001 2003 fig 6 3 2 geotechnical characteristics of the riverbanks the results of the geotechnical tests are summarised in table 4 based on the result of the grain size distributions analysis the bank materials can be classified as inorganic clay silty clay and silty sand following the unified soil classification system uscs grain size distribution analysis shows that towards the lower reaches of the river the bank materials changed from highly consolidated silty clay to poorly consolidated inorganic silt and fine sand ija 2 series especially on the right bank of the river fig 7 majority of the soil samples collected from the left bank of the river were classified as inorganic clay of high plasticity ch while the soils dominating the right bank of the river were classified as inorganic clay and silty clay of low to medium plasticity cl excluding the ija 2 series which are essentially non plastic silty sand sm the average clay silt and sand contents of the soil samples were 19 3 17 and 68 5 respectively the liquid limit ll plastic limit pl and plasticity index pi of the soil samples had average values of 39 15 and 24 respectively bulk density had minimum and maximum values of 1 78 and 1 96 mg m3 respectively results of the unconsolidated undrained triaxial compression tests indicate that the effective cohesion c of the bank materials varied from 15 to 19 kpa except for the ija 2 series which are mostly noncohesive sediments furthermore the effective friction angle φ of the overbank floodplain deposits ija 2 series varied from 33 to 34 while φ obtained from the remaining bank sites varied from 20 to 26 3 3 riverbank stability analysis a series of iterative modelling using the bstem version 5 4 was performed by considering a five layer bank with an average height of 1 5 m fig 8 the simulations were conducted by assuming two water surface elevations river stages of 0 5 and 1 2 m which were set to represent the average water surface elevations for the dry and rainy wet seasons respectively results obtained from the simulations performed with a river stage of 0 5 m for the first time step of 24 h indicate that f s values were above 1 8 stable but had a negative correlation with the bank angle table 5 however the f s of the banks decreased to a mean value of 1 39 during the second time step results obtained with a river stage of 1 2 m during the first time step show that f s increased from 2 59 to 2 80 as bank angle decreased from 90 to 70 the results generally show that the banks simulated with a higher river stage condition had higher initial f s values than those simulated under a lower river stage condition and thus indicate the influence of hydrostatic pressure of the river on the stability of the riverbanks however during the second and third time steps majority of the initially stable banks f s 2 0 became conditionally stable and unstable due to fluvial undercutting of the bank toe as a result of an increase in the average boundary shear stress exerted by the river on the bank dapporto et al 2003 simon et al 2011 to simulate the influences of tension cracks and root cohesion c r on the stability of the riverbanks tension crack depths z c of 0 2 0 6 m and c r of 0 3 4 and 3 63 kpa were incorporated into the bank stability and root reinforcement riproot submodels and simulated with river stages of 0 5 and 1 2 m respectively the results show that the predicted f s decreased with an increase in z c but increased with an increase in c r irrespective of the river stage table 5 some researchers have reported similar results in their study of the effects of root cohesion on the stability of riverbanks and soil slopes abernethy and rutherfurd 2000 easson and yarbrough 2002 simon and collison 2002 it is noteworthy to mention that during the first time step no further decrease in the predicted f s was observed beyond a z c of 0 4 m for the simulations performed with a river stage of 1 2 m however the predicted f s of the riverbanks transitioned from stable to conditionally stable and unstable as the simulated flow event changed from step 1 to step 2 fig 9 shows the relationships between f s and seepage undercutting distance d u for the riverbank with two different bank angles 70 and 90 and river stages of 0 5 and 1 2 m respectively the results show that f s decreased with an increase in d u irrespective of the river stage furthermore when the river stage was at 0 5 m the stability of the banks increased with a decrease in bank angle interestingly for the 90 bank simulated with a river stage of 1 2 m the f s decreased from 2 59 to 1 59 as d u increased from 0 to 0 3 m however under the same d u and river stage the f s of the 70 bank decreased from 2 80 to 1 86 it is noteworthy to mention that the observed decrease in f s with respect to d u for the analysis conducted with a river stage of 1 2 m was essentially due to fluvial undercutting of the bank toe because the river stage was higher than the location of the seepage cavity on the bank face some researchers e g lindow et al 2009 have also reported the inability of simulating seepage induced failure of layered streambanks using the bstem the combination of bstem results and data obtained from repeated cross profiling indicate that the mechanisms contributing to seasonal variations in the stability of the riverbanks can be divided into two episodes i episode i low river stage conditions and ii episode ii high river stage conditions during the dry season episode i the mean boundary shear stress is usually low due to the recession of the river hydrograph bank failures mostly occur during accelerated drawdown conditions as seepage gradient forces act in combination with pore water pressures to trigger mass wasting of all or parts of the bank furthermore the falling limb of the river hydrograph induces seepage erosion which emerges from the bank face through many seepage cavities cf fig 6a this exfiltration process triggers mass outwash of the fluidised bank sediments and at the same time destabilises the bank by reducing the shear strength of the soil leading to the gradual retreat of the riverbank okeke et al 2014 episode ii represents all bank processes that commonly occur during the rising limb and peak stage of the storm hydrograph wet season while it has been reported that during high river stage conditions the stability of riverbanks increases due to the influence of the confining pressure of the water on the bank however field evidence from this research indicates that many bank instabilities were triggered by fluvial undercutting of the bank toe due to the hydraulic stress exerted by the river current on the bank during the wet season the erosion of the riverbanks was found to occur in two ways 1 fluvial erosion of the original material supporting the bank toe and 2 active undermining of the basal section of the bank by the combined effects of flow stress and pore water pressures while the bstem results presented very high values of f s during the initial stages of episode ii further analysis of the bank stability shows that the banks became unstable after several time steps this agrees with the observations made from the field where significant bank instabilities occurred during high river stage conditions which usually last for about six months april october cf fig 6b 3 4 evaluation of erosion potential of the riverbanks to provide a detailed insight into the stability of the banks a quantitative assessment was carried out using a fluvial geomorphic approach behi which evaluates and predicts the erosion potential of riverbanks using five key bank metrics a summary of the behi analysis carried out on the left and right banks of the river is given in table 6 the results indicate that virtually all the study sites on the right bank of the river had moderate behi values with an average total index of 26 in contrast the study sites on the left bank of the river showed high erosion potential with an average total index of 33 the average bank height ratios determined from the left and right banks of the river channel were 0 74 and 0 46 respectively an analysis of the riverbanks with respect to behi revealed a negative relationship between the channel width and the bank height the result showed that behi and bank height decreased for every increase in channel width analysis of geometrical data collected from april 2017 to january 2019 indicates that the left bank of the river has an average bank erosion rate of 0 15 m yr similarly the relatively small root depth ratios displayed by the banks especially on the left bank of the river demonstrate the high susceptibility of the riverbank to erosion given that the majority of the banks had sparse vegetation cover with a maximum root depth of 0 25 m similar results have been reported by abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 hubble et al 2010 and micheli and kirchner 2002 who investigated the effects of riparian tree roots and root density on the stability of riverbanks overall the absence of any form of surface protection coupled with active undercutting of the bank toe and the lack of secondary reinforcement in the form of vegetation root cohesion all contributed to the high susceptibility of the riverbanks to fluvial erosion 3 5 lulc maps and accuracy assessment typical lulc classification maps of the study area for the years 1999 2009 and 2019 are shown in fig 10 while the classification results for the reference years are summarised in table 7 results of the accuracy assessment of the lulc classification reveal overall classification accuracies of 89 98 92 97 and 90 08 for 1999 2009 and 2019 respectively similarly kappa statistics were 0 89 0 92 and 0 89 for 1999 2009 and 2019 respectively analysis of the spatial distribution of the lulc classes shows that in 1999 thick vegetation was prevalent in the northwestern parts of the orc wetlands dominated the southern part while light vegetation and built up area dominated the eastern part of the orc fig 10a however in 2009 the northern and southern parts of the orc were dominated by wetlands while thick vegetation coalesced to the center with a corresponding increase in the total area of built up spaces fig 10b in 2019 the central and western parts of the orc witnessed a significant increase in the built up area due to an increase in urban growth with a major spread in the eastern part of the region fig 10c in contrast the areas covered by thick vegetation and wetlands decreased considerably at the expense of the rapidly expanding urban areas fig 11 shows the magnitude of change in the five lulc classes during the two periods hereinafter referred to as period 1 and period 2 for 1999 2009 and 2009 2019 respectively comparison of the two periods indicates that vegetation was the most adversely affected lulc class in the orc cf table 7 during the two periods the total area covered by thick vegetation significantly decreased by 117 46 and 107 47 km2 which represents a percentage decrease of 11 59 and 10 60 respectively light vegetation also decreased by 26 92 km2 2 66 and 3 52 km2 0 35 during period 1 and period 2 respectively it is noteworthy to mention that the area covered by the built up spaces increased by 61 66 and 85 62 km2 representing a percentage increase of 6 08 and 8 45 during period 1 and period 2 respectively similarly the area covered by cultivated land open spaces increased by 19 50 km2 1 92 and 71 27 km2 7 03 during period 1 and period 2 respectively in contrast the area covered by wetlands increased by 63 22 km2 6 24 during period 1 and subsequently decreased by 45 91 km2 4 53 during period 2 from the results of the lulc classification analysis it was observed that changes in land use and land cover have adversely affected the hydrologic response of the catchment the rapid increase in built up areas and cultivated land open spaces and subsequent decrease in riparian vegetation and wetlands were attributed to the burgeoning human population which had a negative impact on the natural hydrologic disturbance regimes of streams and rivers within the orc consequently the rate of riverbank erosion and sediment loading into the surrounding streams and rivers have increased as a direct consequence of reduced forest buffers within the riparian areas hagerty et al 1981 winterbottom and gilvear 2000 rhoades et al 2009 while these natural processes have triggered several flood disasters in the riparian areas it is expected that the socioeconomic effects of riverbank erosion will continue to rise until a sustainable watershed management strategy is adopted to mitigate the disasters zaman 1989 hossain 1993 4 discussion 4 1 seepage undercutting and tension crack contributions to riverbank erosion quantifying the contributions of seepage erosion to riverbank failure has been a challenging task to geomorphologists and hydraulic engineers mainly due to certain hydroclimatic and geoenvironmental factors in addition to some challenges posed by the lack of precision instruments and access to remote areas consequently seepage erosion is often neglected in the stability analysis of riverbanks due to its complex relationship with other bank erosion mechanisms such as fluvial erosion and mass failure which occur as a result of a decrease in the shear strength of the bank material some researchers have successfully used field in situ methods and lysimeter experiments to quantify seepage erosion rates in deeply incised streambanks in the usa fox et al 2006 2007a wilson et al 2007 lindow et al 2009 midgley et al 2013 however the variability of the results obtained from both methods has called for a more accurate way of predicting the stability of riparian slopes subjected to seepage erosion chu agor et al 2008 reported that seepage induced failure of riverbanks and hillslopes occurs through the following interconnected processes 1 increase in pore water pressure 2 evolution of seepage gradient forces and 3 seepage particle mobilisation and undercutting the first and second mechanisms have been extensively studied by simon and collison 2001 and rinaldi et al 2004 in cohesive streambanks and layered banks while the third mechanism bank toe erosion by seepage undercutting has been observed in laboratory scale lysimeter experiments where the increase in d u leads to bank instability due to a decrease in f s wilson et al 2007 fox and felice 2014 results of the stability analysis performed with various values of d u 0 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m and bank angles 70 and 90 revealed a significant decrease in f s as d u increased from 0 to 0 3 m irrespective of bank angle and river stage cf fig 9 similar trends in f s have been reported by fox et al 2007c wilson et al 2007 and cancienne et al 2008 by simulating seepage undercutting failure of streambanks using the bstem and slope w models therefore this research demonstrates the significant dependence of f s on d u bank angle bank stratification river stage and hydraulics root cohesion and other prevailing geotechnical and geoenvironmental conditions on the stability of riparian slopes the high f s values obtained under a high river stage of 1 2 m rainy season flow elevation relative to the values obtained when the river stage was at 0 5 m dry season flow elevation were attributed to the increased confining pressure of the river on the bank which brought additional stabilising force on the bank cf fig 9b however at higher flow durations f s rapidly decreased by more than 50 causing the banks to become unstable and conditionally stable and thus demonstrates that the instability of the riverbanks was triggered by fluvial undercutting of the bank toe due to the increased hydraulic stress of the river on the banks cf fig 6b this process has been attributed to an increase in the hydraulic radius r h of the river channel especially from sand mining activities in the area which lead to channel incisions and bed degradation that increase the mean boundary shear stress τ 0 as expressed by the equation simon et al 2000 7 τ 0 γ w r h s 0 where s 0 channel bed slope m m similarly the complex relationship between f s z c and bank angle α demonstrates that the riverbanks retreat by two main interrelated mechanisms 1 fluvial erosion and seepage undercutting of the bank toe which oversteepens the bank face and results in the evolution of tension cracks on the bank top cf figs 5 and 6b and 2 planar slab type and or cantilever failure of the oversteepened bank due to an increase in z c that leads to a corresponding decrease in f s thorne and abt 1993 simon et al 2000 4 2 effect of riparian vegetation on the stability of the riverbanks riparian zones play a significant role in the morphodynamics of streams and river channels and provide stable environments that support both aquatic and terrestrial biota the stability of many streams and river channels has been attributed to the type and magnitude of vegetation in the riparian zone this is because root density and root tensile strength improve the overall shear strength of soil by providing additional shear resistance via root reinforcement avril and barten 2007 used the dynamic equilibrium concept to describe the intricate relationship between riparian vegetation channel geometry flow regime sediment loading large woody debris geology and shear strength of the riverbank material this research shows that the increase in f s with respect to c r is directly attributed to the positive influence of riparian vegetation in the mitigation of bank erosion and stream channel adjustments cf table 5 furthermore the inverse relationship between f s and bank angle at constant c r further demonstrates that riparian vegetation with deep root system has a higher potential to increase the stability of riverbanks the observed increase in f s due to the influence of root reinforcement has been reported in recent research carried out with the bstem see cancienne et al 2008 krzeminska et al 2019 yu et al 2020 this research is limited by the fact that the root tensile strength t r and other characteristics of roots of different plant species e g root diameter and root area ratio within the riparian area were not determined in situ or in the laboratory as normally done using traditional testing devices abernethy and rutherfurd 2001 simon and collison 2002 yu et al 2020 hence the c r values used in the stability analysis were obtained from the default parameters in the bstem by comparing the vegetation in the riparian wetland to wet meadow vegetation with uniform plant age and coverage of 3 years and 100 respectively these assumptions may give a slight margin of error in the predicted f s because plant species and root diameter have a significant influence on the tensile strength of roots notwithstanding our findings suggest that the major factors that contribute to accelerated bank erosion on the river channel are agricultural intensification and rapid urbanisation that lead to the removal of the initial riparian forest buffers thereby increasing surface runoff and sediment yield to the river channels these complex processes lead to channel incisions and accelerated bank erosion due to the aggradation of the channels and formation of channel bars 4 3 impact of lulc change on the hydrologic response of the owo river catchment land use activities including urbanisation deforestation unsustainable agricultural practices and other anthropogenic disturbances have adversely affected a large portion of the earth s land surface more than three decades of intensive research has indicated that lulc change dynamics have contributed to a decrease in the global ecosystem health foley et al 2005 zhao et al 2006 the environmental impacts of lulc change are higher in asia and africa than in other regions due to the rapid growth in urban population that leads to increased anthropogenic stresses priess et al 2011 abdullah et al 2019 consequently many hydrological hazards including soil and gully erosion riverbank instabilities floods siltation and surface water pollution occur in these regions as a direct consequence of land use intensification the hydrologic response of many watersheds to lulc change impacts involves a complex process that requires a good knowledge of rainfall runoff relationships according to avril and barten 2007 stream channels exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium therefore any alteration in the prevailing natural flow regimes of rivers within a catchment may lead to accelerated bank erosion channel width adjustments and channel planform evolution until the prevailing condition or dynamic equilibrium is restored midha and mathur 2014 as stated in section 3 5 of this paper the hydrologic response of the orc has been extensively modified by land use intensification based on the results of the lulc analysis of the catchment furthermore the lulc classification results of the orc suggest that urbanisation was the major land use class that caused significant changes in the morphological characteristics of the river channels during the 20 year period 1999 2019 the rapid expansion of urban centers around agbara alimosho sango ota and other counties within the orc has resulted in a drastic conversion of the landscape in the western parts of the catchment from rural peri rural to peri urban land use the study area is bordered on the south and east by lagos one of the largest and fastest growing cities in the world which has a growth rate of 4 44 and urban population density of 14 469 residents per square kilometer consequently the rapid expansion of the urban centers during the 20 year period has increased runoff coefficient runoff ratio and peak discharge from stormflow and thus contributes to serious bank erosion and channel width adjustments the influence of urbanisation on the natural hydrologic disturbance regimes of rivers within the orc could be related to a theoretical cycle proposed by wolman 1967 the cycle describes the process of urbanisation in a representative watershed and its effects on the river channel using three phases fig 12 phase 1 represents a river channel which is initially in dynamic equilibrium within a watershed that is dominated by forests or characterised by agricultural landscape phase 2 represents a period of intensive construction activities that lead to the exposure of the bare land to erosion and phase 3 represents a final stage in which the watershed is essentially dominated by urban landscape with a significantly high percentage area of impervious surfaces comparison made between figs 10 and 12 demonstrates that during the 20 year period the dynamic changes in lulc within the orc have adversely affected the characteristics of the river channels and the natural hydrologic regimes of rivers within the catchment cf fig 10c these changes occur as a result of the expansion of the built up area and unsustainable agricultural practices that lead to high sediment yield to the river channels which subsequently result in channel constrictions bank erosion and flooding midha and mathur 2014 furthermore the construction and removal of dams in addition to sand and gravel mining are other major anthropogenic activities which have been attributed to serious bank erosion on many inland rivers and streams tiegs and pohl 2005 jordan et al 2019 hackney et al 2020 while there is no historical record of dam construction or removal on the river channels numerous subsistence sand mining and occasional dredging of the riverbeds have caused serious hydraulic consequences on the morphodynamics of rivers within the orc consequently severe bank instabilities occur as a result of a decrease in hydraulic roughness which results in an increase in flow depth and hydraulic radius that increases discharge flow velocity and bed shear stress 5 conclusions the iju river and other stream courses within the orc have experienced alterations in their natural hydrologic disturbance regimes and sediment transport dynamics brought about by numerous anthropogenic changes such as urbanisation agricultural intensification artisanal sand mining and occasional dredging of the riverbeds these anthropogenic disturbances have led to an increase in the rate of sediment loading into the rivers which lead to accelerated bank erosion that is often occasioned by seepage undercutting and fluvial erosion of the bank during high and low river stages in this paper a comprehensive research on the contributions of seepage erosion to seasonal variations in riverbank stability was conducted with the objectives of evaluating 1 the influence of seepage undercutting distance depth of tension crack and root cohesion on the stability of the riparian slopes and 2 the erosion potential of the riverbanks using the behi protocol detailed geomorphological and geotechnical properties of the riverbanks were determined through repeated measurement of the bank profiles followed by bank stability analysis using the bstem by considering two river stages and different bank angles furthermore the impacts of lulc change on the hydrology of the catchment were assessed by comparing the lulc maps of 1999 2009 and 2019 the conclusions drawn from this study can be summarised as follows 1 repeated field surveys and data acquisitions were used to classify the riverbanks into three dominant groups composite homogeneous and layered banks based on their lithological and sedimentological characteristics numerous seepage erosion cavities within the composite and layered banks were attributed to the different lithological characteristics of the bank materials which gave rise to the marked differences in the hydraulic conductivity of the composite and layered bank materials 2 planar slab type and alcove type failures constitute the dominant mechanisms of riverbank erosion on the iju river and comprise more than 70 of all bank failures on the river channel pop out failures dominated the composite and layered banks and typically occurred during the recession limb of the river hydrograph as water exfiltrates from the bank through the highly conductive layers cantilever failures were distinguished by the preponderance of many overhanging cliffs and tension cracks with depths ranging from 0 15 to 0 2 m 3 the f s of the banks decreased with an increase in the depth of the tension cracks z c but increased as root cohesion increased from 3 40 to 3 63 kpa however at a higher river stage further increase in z c beyond 0 4 m did not cause any significant reduction in f s of the riverbanks 4 f s of the riverbanks decreased with an increase in seepage undercutting distance d u and bank angle α irrespective of the river stage high values of f s were obtained when the river stage was at 1 2 m suggesting the influence of confining pressure of the water on the stability of the banks however the banks became unstable as f s decreased to less than 1 0 due to the destabilisation of the unprotected bank toe by the hydraulic shear stress of the river this occurs in addition to the reduction of matric suction as the soil transitions from partial to fully saturated conditions 5 about 90 of the riparian slope dominating the left bank of the river had an average behi value of 33 while the right bank had an average behi value of 26 these results are in agreement with the f s obtained using the bstem and from geometrical analysis of the riparian slope furthermore the high rate of bank retreat observed on the left side of the river channel has been attributed to its mean bank angle of 87 and the marked differences in the hydraulic conductivities of the stratified beds coupled with the absence of toe protection structures and vegetation cover 6 this research showed that significant changes in lulc occurred in the orc during the 20 year period 1999 2019 the most adversely affected lulc class in the orc was thick vegetation which decreased by 117 46 km2 and 107 47 km2 during the periods 1999 2009 and 2009 2019 respectively in contrast the built up area increased by 61 66 and 85 62 km2 during the two periods the temporal dynamics of lulc change in the orc during the 20 year period revealed that rapid urbanisation and anthropogenic disturbances caused significant alterations in the prevailing natural hydrologic regimes of rivers within the catchment which led to accelerated bank erosion and channel planform changes this research also showed the positive influence of plant roots on the stability of the riverbanks therefore further research is needed to determine the plant species in the catchment that would produce the optimum root cohesion

12091,the utilization of geochemistry has a substantial significance for inferring the subsurface conditions by analyzing the chemistry of the surface manifestations or released fluids that convey the signature of the profound geothermal assets this contextual investigation plans to define and evaluate hydrogeochemistry according to main ion composition relating to the year of 2010 2014 for buraimi al zaroub aquifer system graphical illustrations were carried out to facilitate a precise elucidation of an extensive variety of well chemistry data sets in piper diagram water types of the aquifer

triangular form and it was quite obvious that chemical progress of the ground waters is governed by simple crustal dissolution processes at temperature below 50 c lastly a further step for irrigation well water quality was touched upon herein this to further depict water characteristic in the whole aquifer system on al zaroub buraimi findings and results depend on the chemical as well as hydrochemichal composition of buraimi groundwater buraimi groundwater is fresh water almost all water samples met the necessary criteria to be used as drinking and irrigation water graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater aquifer hydrogeochemistry 1 introduction agriculture is a prominent field in the economic development of a nation advancement of agriculture is a key component and henceforth irrigation is essential to enhance the agrarian economy buraimi district has not substantial irrigation dams the populace opt for groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes as a result of vulnerability of water supply accessibility since the conjunctive utilization of groundwater and surface water would eliminate water deficiency endeavors are dedicated to finding the potential zones of groundwater nevertheless the quality of groundwater in the area ought to get a bit of consideration these infrequent examinations on groundwater characteristics and its effect on crop yields and human wellness are fundamental as outlined by rao 2002 interrelated hydrogeochemical procedures ought to be assessed preceding the control enhancement of water quality and ought to recommend alternative water supply strategies the current investigation thus concentrate on the hydrogeochemical processes in buraimi governorate sultanate of oman al zaroub study area around buraimi governorate includes 21 wells spread on two zones high spring and low spring with productivity achieving 16 000 m3 day the study zone lies between the latitude 24 15 03 n and longitude 55 47 35 e and

the hydrogeochemical history the conceivable source for the chemical components in the study zone and to give a concept regarding the development of water chemistry within al zaroub wells system in the current study of buraimi wells water water hydrochemistry and characteristics were utilized to identify the origin and the source of groundwaters piper schoeller ternary giggenbach and durov charts comparison with the previous literature along with physical and chemical parameters of the groundwater were applied to decide the conceivable source for chemical constituents of groundwaters physical and chemical parameters were likewise used to assess the appropriateness of waters for domestic and agriculture purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 oman geography oman located at the southeast corner of the arabian plate is being pushed slowly northward as the red sea grows wider oman is fairly quiescent tectonically during the cretaceous period oman was located adjacent to a subduction zone and a portion of the upper mantle along with overlying seafloor volcanic rocks were thrust over the continental crust this obducted sequence of ultramafic to mafic rocks is the semail ophiolitecomplex the ophiolite is locally rich in copper and chromite orebodies the interior plains of oman are of young sedimentary rocks wadi gravels dune sands and salt flats possibility of geogenic control on the groundwater quality in the studied aquifer besides few anthropogenic interfaces beneath them is a several kilometre thick stack of older sedimentary rocks that host the country s hydrocarbon resources ancient salt which comes to the surface in several salt domes such as qarat kibrit plays an important role in forming many of these oil and gas accumulations hughes clarke 1990

et al 2019 2 3 saturation of calcium carbonate the thermodynamic model applied in this investigation has been detailed by back 1961 the chemical equations involved are back 1963 and mesdaghinia et al 2015 by making temperature corrections an ion activity product k iap for caco3 can be calculated from the activities of the calcium and carbonate ions determined from the above equations and compared with the equilibrium constant kcalcite the equilibrium constants used in these calculations are given in table 1 for values below 10 c and above 35 c see back 1961 plate 1 2 4 classification of the hydrochemical data to be able to sort out groundwater samples into groups graphical and statistical methods were used scatter schoeller piper durov giggenbach wilcox as well as langeleir ludwig diagrams come with aquachem version 2014 2 2 5 accuracy of analysis in this study the electrical balance error computed by phreeqc was utilized and assessment of data was with respect to a 5 criteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 classification of groundwater the levels of dissolved ions in groundwater samples are normally ruled by lithology velocity and quality of groundwater flow nature of geochemical reactions solubility of salts and human routines rao 2002 in order to distinguish the regional groundwater type a schoeller diagram is presented in fig 2 the major water types can to some extent be identified as mg hco3 and na cl as a result of semi logarithmic arrangement if a straight line joining two points of two ions in a sample of water is parallel to another straight line joining two points of the same two ions in a second sample of water the ratio of the ions in the two analysis is equal from fig 2 groundwater samples belong to similar water groups following the same pattern in the diagram except for ub15 where concentrations of mg and cl are slightly higher than the other well waters and ub24 where na concentration is lesser then the other well waters table 2 the schoeller diagram can be adapted that it may be utilized to determine the degree of saturation of calcium carbonate in groundwater the investigation of water types may help to decipher the genesis of the groundwater along its flow path this is not an easy task since most of the wells sampled are not located along the groundwater flow lines fig 1 the nomenclature of water types is based on the concept of index ions being ions which constitute at least 20 mmol eq of the cation or anion total 100 for each and are given in order of decreasing concentration fresh groundwater derived from rainwater usually is of the ca hco3 type in the presence of higher concentrations of sodium e g in coastal zones this type develops towards na hco3 water via intermediate ca na hco3 and na ca hco3 with increasing salinity the final water type is na cl hydrochemical facies term is a function of solution kinetics rock water interactions geology and contamination sources utilized to characterize the amounts of water that alter in their chemical composition an agreeable method to compare and classify types of water based on ionic composition is suggested by piper 1944 through scheming the chemical data on a trilinear diagram fig 3 buraimi ground waters are mainly located in two major zones d and e and one minor zones b which means that they are initial earth alkaline water with increased portions of alkalis according to furtak and langguth 1967 and eraifej 2006 this water type is divided into two zones which are 1 d with prevailing bicarbonates 2 e with prevailing sulfate and chloride second samples are normal earth alkaline water with prevailing bicarbonate and sulfate or chloride from fig 3 it is noticeable that the chemistry of some al zaroub wells have changed from zone d to zone e which is caused by a slight increase of mg cl and so4 and the decrease of ca and hco3 the groundwater have shifted from zone b to zone d and e to become normal earth alkaline water with prevailing bicarbonate as well as sulfate and chlorides respectively which is caused mainly by the slight decrease of na and k the rest of the samples showed the same water type mg hco3 cl from the plot alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 exceed the alkalis na and k and weak acids hco3 and co3 2 dominate strong acids cl and so4 2 hence alkaline earths dominate bicarbonate indicating exchange of na ion with alkaline earths resulting in base exchanged hardened water rao 2002 in the groundwater the concentration of mg2 is more than that of ca2 table 3 as the solubility of caco3 is much lower less than that of mgco3 the calcium appears to have precipitated as caco3 resulting in decline of ca2 values the evaporation also results in the precipitation of caco3 leading to the formation of kankar caco3 rao 2002 as in the study area the data are being presented using durov diagram fig 4 which illustrates some geochemical processes which might affect the water genesis table of water classification and geochemical processes in lloyd and heathcote 1985 shows the classification of the groundwater the samples are mainly located in two zones 2 and 5 and according to lloyd and heathcote 1985 1 zone 2 waters are dominated by ca and hco3 ions with presumed association to dolomite if the mg is significant however an important exchange is presumed if the na is significant in the sample 2 zone 5 water with no dominate anion or cation which indicates water exhibiting simple dissolution or mixing 3 2 identification of hydrochemical processes reactions between groundwater and aquifer minerals have a significant role on water quality which are also useful to understand the genesis of groundwater srinivasamoorthy and gopinath 2014 the hydrogeochemical data are used to identify the hydrogeochemical processes operating in the aquifer region of study area few of the possible identified processes are explained below the ratio of ca2 mg2 has been utilized to determine the sources of calcium and magnesium ions into the groundwater environment mayo and loucks 1995 if the ca2 mg2 ratio 1 shows dissolution of dolomite and 2 reflects an effect of silicate minerals that contributes calcium and magnesium to the groundwater katz and coplen 1997 all the samples 100 fall below 1 ratio line indicating precipitation of ca2 as caco3 which results in a decline of ca2 values or ion exchange process the exchange of ion between ground water and the environment through residence or travel step can be confirmed using an index of base exchange schoeller 1967 known as chloro alkaline indices cai while k and na in water an exchange with mg2 or ca2 in weathered materials is highly expected a base exchange is then confirmed by a positive index value though low saltwater with negative value demonstrates chloro alkaline disequilibrium known as cation anion exchange reaction during this process the innkeeper rocks are the essential origin of dissolved solids in groundwater gallardo and tase 2007 the cai point out 100 of samples favor base exchange hardened waters hence all the collected water samples have higher alkaline earth than hco3 indicating base exchange hardened water el alfy and abdalla 2019 however major ion chemistry utilization to identify rock mineralogy might be beneficial but must be practiced attentively mineral precipitation ion exchange and evaporation can modify chemical composition consequently the usage of ionic ratios in water is conceivably indicating the minerals of source rock types hounslow 1995 and kalpana and elango 2013 for this objective the concentrations of the various constituents are converted to meq l 1 to be able to combine the diverse ions in a chemically substantial approach in this study most of the ion ratios have been calculated to determine the dominant sources carbonate or silicate rocks of major ions ca2 mg2 vs na k is plotted which shows buraimi groundwater chemistry is predominantly controlled by carbonate lithology fig 5 the plot for ca2 mg2 vs hco3 shows the entire of data plot fig 6 a fall above the 1 1 line suggesting an excess of alkaline earth elements ca2 mg2 over hco3 reflecting extra sources of ca2 and especially mg2 ions balanced by cl and so4 2 and or supplied by silicate weathering zhang and huang 1995 if some representations noted below 1 1 line that would probably suggest the reaction of the feldspar minerals with carbonic acid in the presence of water which releases hco3 lakshmanan and kannan 2003 the concentration of carbonates is caused by the co2 present in the soil zone formed from the weathering of parent materials the weathering is caused by alternate wet and dry conditions but in this case the arid climate of buraimi area doesn t often permit the combination of co2 with rainwater to form carbonates the hco3 may also be derived from the dissolution of silicate minerals orthoclase plagioclase hornblende diopside hypersthenes olivine and biotite of country rocks of the area by the carbonic acid a general reaction for the weathering of silicate rocks with carbonic acid is as follows rao 2002 cations silicates h2co3 h4sio4 hco3 cations solid products mostly clays the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 is used to determine the ion exchange processes fig 6b if ion exchange is preeminent the points move to left because of an excess of hco3 so4 2 fisher and mullican 1997 if reverse ion exchange is the mechanism the point s move to the right as a result to excess of ca2 mg2 over hco3 so4 2 a total of 80 of groundwater samples falls left to the 1 1 line indicating reverse ion exchange mechanism and 20 of samples falls right to the 1 1 line indicating ion exchange process preeminence the points approaching the 1 1 line advocate ions from weathering of silicates datta and tyagi 1996 a charge balance will occur between the ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 if they are derived from basic dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum sami 1992 fisher and mullican 1997 razowska jaworek 2014 generally values close to unity between ca mg indicate dissolution of dolomite but ca mg ratios suggest that the dissolution of carbonate rocks except dolomite in the aquifer materials from the catchment area so4 ca ratio shows that gypsum dissolution is not 100 a primary source of sulfate in buraimi ground water so4 ca is 1 for more than 85 of the samples the na cl ratio has been utilized to determine the sources of salinity in groundwater environment fig 7 na cl molar ratio almost equal to 1 is mostly associated to rainwater or halite dissolution whereas 1 is normally understood as reflecting na released from silicate weathering due to water rock interaction via reaction meybeck 1987 and stallard and edmond 1983 2naalsi3o8 9h2 2h2co3 ai2si2o5 oh 4 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 fisher and mullican 1997 and ratio 1 reflects impact or presence of additional sources fig 7 presents a na cl molar ratio lesser than 1 as a result of the dominance of cl ions chloride ions are present in the groundwater as sodium chloride chloride load surpassing sodium may be a result of the base exchange phenomena or a result of pollution by anthropogenic activities jia and o connor 2019 jones and vengosh 1999 probability of chloride bearing minerals like sodalite and chlorapatite srinivasamoorthy and gopinath 2014 hence chloride in groundwater is essentially due to base exchange of na for ca2 and especially mg2 or because of agricultural return flow because agricultural return flow water is defined by higher ratios of so4 2 cl 0 05 associated to the application of gypsum fertilizers vengosh and gill 2002 except for 5 well water samples ub11 ub15 ub16 ub17 ub19 where so4 2 cl is 0 05 the na k plotted against cl so4 2 shows fig 8 majority of buraimi groundwater samples plots above 1 1 line indicating the dominance of cl and so4 2 if no known geological source for chloride and sulfate is observed sources for both these ions might probably be derived from agricultural activities like application of fertilizers rajmohan and elango 2006 heavy use of fertilizers results in high values of cl no3 so4 2 and k pawar and shaikh 1995 which not 100 highly evident from the groundwater chemistry of the study area if samples were mapped out near or below the 1 1 line it would have represented mineral dissolution as the mechanism governing the major ion chemistry variation of cl and so4 2 along the groundwater flow path may be because of the long history of evaporation sarin and krishnaswami 1989 the plot of na k versus sum of cations fig 9 a points out that groundwater in the study area has a superior ratio of cations via silicate weathering and alkaline saline soils and residence time partly further the scheme of ca2 mg2 versus total cations fig 9b almost falls below the 1 1 trend reflect an increasing contribution of na and k as tds increases the increase in alkalies also contributes to greater cl so4 2 fig 8 indicating its sources from soils as na2so4 and k2so4 rao 2002 higher na in groundwater over k table 4 is attributed to the greater resistance of k to weathering singh and hasnain 1999 and its fixation in the formation of clay minerals the dominance of na an index of weathering suggests that the ions result from silicate weathering and or dissolution of soil salt rao 2002 3 3 irrigation water quality wells water for irrigation incorporates substantial chemical components traced from natural environment and human activity that possibly lower crop yield and decline soil fertility jalali 2009 irrigation water applied to the soil inserts salts to the root zone plant roots consume a small amount of salt from the soil solution likewise water evaporates from the surface of the soil but salts stay in the mechanism engenders a substantial amassing of salts in the root zone harming the plants in a way that salinity hazard is produced water deficiency and toxicity jalali 2011 besides these irrigated agricultural crops need very good quality water thus to deal with such complications it is fundamental to have accurate information respecting the quality of irrigation water and its effect on soils and crops thus an attempt has been produced in the current study to demarcate the quality of irrigation water from the plot of conductivity versus groundwater elevation profile we can examine conductivity changes with elevation that can be related to changes in lithology water saturation and water quality to get a generalized conductivity profile for the entire survey area we extracted conductivity values averaged all values for a given interval of time and plotted the averages with elevation fig 11a average apparent conductivities declining downward with groundwater elevation in the upper 411 518 m asl suggesting that either bedrock is shallower than expected over much of the study area or that the conductivity was not accurately measured below the conductive zone at and below the water table decreasing from relatively moderate value of 877 μs cm in the upper 411 m asl to the lowest average values of 240 μs cm at elevation of 518 m asl most likely electric potential distribution in a conductive liquid is directly analogous to groundwater elevation for comparable elevation ranges the average conductivity profile calculated from the buraimi groundwater analysis data is similar to those that fit the groundwater hardness and alkalinity analysis data fig 10 b and c respectively all of the profiles calculated for buraimi well samples hardness and alkalinity data show decline in their concentrations with elevations within 411 518 m asl 3 3 1 magnesium ratio mr the ca2 and mg2 ions preserve a phase of equilibrium in most groundwater srinivasamoorthy and gopinath 2014 in equilibrium mg2 in water alters the soil to alkaline which decreases the crop yield kumar and kumari 2007 the determination of magnesium impact in irrigated water is articulated as the magnesium ratio mr table 5 paliwal 1972 developed an index for calculating the magnesium hazard mr is calculated using the formula m r m g 2 100 m g 2 c a 2 the mr values range from 5 4 to 10 8 mg l according to mr ratio groundwater in al zaroub aquifer is suitable for irrigation purpose 3 3 2 total hardness the permanent and temporary water hardness is result due to the precipitation of ca2 and mg2 ions permanent hardness is due to ca2 and mg2 ions that get removed by ion exchange mechanisms temporary hardness is principally caused by calcium carbonate in water that gets removed during heating hardness of water narrows its utilization for industrial functions causing scaling of pots boilers and irrigation pipes in some studies a significant correlation was observed between hardness and heart diseases in contrast a number of epidemiological studies suggest that water hardness protects against diseases who 2010 the total hardness th expressed in mg l is determined by todd 1980 as todd 1980 th mg l 2 497 ca2 4 115 mg2 the most desirable limit for th is 80 100 mg caco3 l freeze and cherry 1979 the th ranges from 9 to 341 3 mg l tending to hard water category high concentrations of hardness above 150 mg l will build up on contact surfaces plug pipes and irrigation lines and damage water heaters 3 3 3 residual sodium carbonate rsc just after the total carbonate amount surpasses the level of calcium and magnesium water quality most likely declines once the residual carbonate grows upscale carbonates associate with magnesium and calcium and produce a solid material a growth in sar as well as sodium percentage is highly anticipated sarikhani and dehnavi 2015 the quantity of bicarbonate and carbonate over the quantity of magnesium and calcium in water impacts the suitability of groundwater for irrigation functions an overabundance of sodium bicarbonate and carbonate affects the physical properties of soil in fact dissolution of organics in soil will occur and allow a black stain on surface while drying kumar and kumari 2007 eaton 1950 suggested that residual sodium carbonate rsc defined by the formula rsc co3 hco3 ca2 mg2 is a good index of the sodicity hazard of an irrigation water where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l modification of rsc by soil applied with gypsum may permit use of waters with rsc values beyond the safe level sarikhani and dehnavi 2015 rsc ranges from 10 43 to 0 34 meq l from the values no groundwater samples of the study area were found to be unsuitable for irrigation purposes 3 3 3 sodium percentage na sodium is one of the major ions utilized to classify irrigation water for the sake of its reaction with soil that lowers its permeability percentage of na is largely utilized for assessing the suitability of water for irrigation functions wilcox 1955 na is expressed as percent sodium or soluble sodium percentage na the na are calculated using the formula n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 k n a 100 where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the classification of samples is shown in table 5 as per the wilcox 1955 classification 62 of groundwater represent the excellent category and 38 represent good category in general higher na observed indicate the dominance of ion exchange and weathering from lithological units of the study area 3 3 4 sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium adsorption ratio known as alkali hazard or sodium content is imperative to conclude the amount of water utilized for irrigation goals growth in salinity lessens plants osmotic activity and prohibits water from extending to plants branches and leaves which leads to lower productivity marghade and malpe 2011 moreover irrigation water with immense na content and small ca2 content facilitates ion exchange by saturation of na ruins the soil structure by dispersion of clay particles todd 1980 leading to lesser production because of difficulty in cultivation rao 2006 the sar is figured out by richards 1954 using the formula hem 1991 as s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 concentrations expressed in meq l the sar values range from 0 074 to 1 25 if sar is higher it would indicate precipitation induced dissolution and leaching of salts ali 2019 the analytical data plotted on the us salinity diagram ussl 1954 point out fig 10 all groundwater samples in buraimi zone cluster in c2s1 indicate medium salinity and low sodium water which can be used for irrigation in almost all types of soil with almost no danger of exchangeable sodium kumar and kumari 2007 representations in the c3s1 and especially c4s1 category would indicate water suitable for plants having good salt tolerance but unsuitable for irrigation in soils with restricted drainage mohan and singh 2000 3 3 5 permeability index pi sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate in soil impact its permeability which also affects the irrigation water quality on long term use doneen 1964 has expand a principle for assessing the suitability of water for irrigation based on pi calculated by using the formula p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 where ions are represented in meq l pi ranging from 20 09 to 65 55 meq l according to pi values the specimen of groundwater take place in class i for the two seasons which points out the fact that water is moderate to good for irrigation functions arumugam and elangovan 2009 3 3 6 kelly s index ki kelly s index is used for the classification of water for irrigation purposes a ki 1 shows an excess of sodium and ki 2 indicates its deficit in waters kelly 1940 the waters with low ki 1 are suitable for irrigation while those with greater ratio are unsuitable sundaray and nayak 2009 ki is calculated by the formula where ions are expressed in meq l ki ranges between 0 0 and 1 02 a total of 100 of samples represent its suitability 3 4 recommendations strategies below are prescribed to improve the suitability of buraimi ground waters for both domestic and agriculture purposes and also to ameliorate the suitability of these wells for further research approaches utilization of water softener so as to lessen the water hardness in some of the groundwater wells blending of ground waters that have a high ec values with other freshwater resources as a way to be utilized for drinking purposes construction of storage facilities to protect water against contamination activities 4 conclusions this study endeavors to ascertain origin and type of buraimi groundwater the profundity and nature of fluid circulation conceivable source for the chemical constituents the appropriateness of groundwater for domestic and agriculture purposes and possible direct utilizations of buraimi groundwater this exploration assesses the quality of various groundwater wells for the chemical and hydrogeological conditions findings and results depend on the chemical as well as hydrochemichal composition of buraimi groundwater buraimi groundwater is fresh water almost all water samples met the necessary criteria to be used as drinking water chemically waters are categorized as earth alkaline water with increased portions of alkalis the low salinity waters are with prevailing bicarbonates and the ones that have higher salinity are with prevailing sulfate and chloride groundwater is overpowered by ca2 and hco3 ions with assumed relationship to dolomite if mg is noteworthy nevertheless a significant exchange is presumed if the na is substantial in the sample the recognition of water rock equilibrium demonstrates simple rock dissolution actually the chemical advancement of ground waters is governed by simple crustal dissolution processes at temperature below 50 c which might indicate geogenic dominance the cai point out 100 of samples favor base exchange hardened waters subsequently all the gathered water samples have higher alkaline earth than hco3 indicating based exchange hardened water chloride content surpassing sodium in buraimi groundwater might be due to the base exchange phenomena the study area groundwater has a greater ratio of cations via silicate weathering and alkaline saline soils and residence time the suitability of buraimi groundwater for irrigation purposes was additionally examined all groundwater samples in buraimi zone cluster in c2s1 indicate medium salinity and low sodium water which can be utilized for irrigation in mostly all kinds of soil with almost no troublesome situation of exchangeable sodium the studied waters show a negative residual sodium carbonate rsc meaning the sodium build up is unlikely to happen since sufficient calcium and magnesium are in excess of what can be precipitated as carbonates when the waters are applied to the soils groundwater conductivity changes with groundwater elevation and that can be related to changes in lithology water saturation and water quality declaration of competing interest none 
12091,the utilization of geochemistry has a substantial significance for inferring the subsurface conditions by analyzing the chemistry of the surface manifestations or released fluids that convey the signature of the profound geothermal assets this contextual investigation plans to define and evaluate hydrogeochemistry according to main ion composition relating to the year of 2010 2014 for buraimi al zaroub aquifer system graphical illustrations were carried out to facilitate a precise elucidation of an extensive variety of well chemistry data sets in piper diagram water types of the aquifer

set is clustered into magnesium dominate zone the schoeller chart depicts higher amounts of mg hco3 and na cl composition of the wells in durov diagram the information set was projected to a triangular form and it was quite obvious that chemical progress of the ground waters is governed by simple crustal dissolution processes at temperature below 50 c lastly a further step for irrigation well water quality was touched upon herein this to further depict water characteristic in the whole aquifer system on al zaroub buraimi findings and results depend on the chemical as well as hydrochemichal composition of buraimi groundwater buraimi groundwater is fresh water almost all water samples met the necessary criteria to be used as drinking and irrigation water graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater aquifer hydrogeochemistry 1 introduction agriculture is a prominent field in the economic development of a nation advancement of agriculture is a key component and henceforth irrigation is essential to enhance the agrarian economy buraimi district has not substantial irrigation dams the populace opt for groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes as a result of vulnerability of water supply accessibility since the conjunctive utilization of groundwater and surface water would eliminate water deficiency endeavors are dedicated to finding the potential zones of groundwater nevertheless the quality of groundwater in the area ought to get a bit of consideration these infrequent examinations on groundwater characteristics and its effect on crop yields and human wellness are fundamental as outlined by rao 2002 interrelated hydrogeochemical procedures ought to be assessed preceding the control enhancement of water quality and ought to recommend alternative water supply strategies the current investigation thus concentrate on the hydrogeochemical processes in buraimi governorate sultanate of oman al zaroub study area around buraimi governorate includes 21 wells spread on two zones high spring and low spring with productivity achieving 16 000 m3 day the study zone lies between the latitude 24 15 03 n and longitude 55 47 35 e and covering an area of 120 km2 the study region falls in the north west district of sultanate of oman the normal yearly precipitation is around 36 mm and its climate is basically arid the aquifer is revived by direct infiltration of precipitation that the primary source of groundwater recharge the normal average yearly temperature ranges from 20 c to 50 c the present study may aid to figure out the hydrogeochemical history the conceivable source for the chemical components in the study zone and to give a concept regarding the development of water chemistry within al zaroub wells system in the current study of buraimi wells water water hydrochemistry and characteristics were utilized to identify the origin and the source of groundwaters piper schoeller ternary giggenbach and durov charts comparison with the previous literature along with physical and chemical parameters of the groundwater were applied to decide the conceivable source for chemical constituents of groundwaters physical and chemical parameters were likewise used to assess the appropriateness of waters for domestic and agriculture purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 oman geography oman located at the southeast corner of the arabian plate is being pushed slowly northward as the red sea grows wider oman is fairly quiescent tectonically during the cretaceous period oman was located adjacent to a subduction zone and a portion of the upper mantle along with overlying seafloor volcanic rocks were thrust over the continental crust this obducted sequence of ultramafic to mafic rocks is the semail ophiolitecomplex the ophiolite is locally rich in copper and chromite orebodies the interior plains of oman are of young sedimentary rocks wadi gravels dune sands and salt flats possibility of geogenic control on the groundwater quality in the studied aquifer besides few anthropogenic interfaces beneath them is a several kilometre thick stack of older sedimentary rocks that host the country s hydrocarbon resources ancient salt which comes to the surface in several salt domes such as qarat kibrit plays an important role in forming many of these oil and gas accumulations hughes clarke 1990 the main reliable source of water is internal groundwater apart from some significant wadis like dayqah and quriyat that have an average flow of 60 million m3 year or halfayn which covers a catchment area of 4 373 km2 ministry of regional municipalities environment and water resources 2005 in nearly all wadis surface water runoff only occurs for some hours or up to a few days after a storm in the form of rapidly rising and falling flood flows since the infiltration capacity of coarse alluvium and fissured rock is high groundwater can be recharged quite easily ministry of regional municipalities environment and water resources 2005 water resources in oman 2 2 sampling buraimi groundwater several groundwater samples were collected pre and post monsoon season respectively fig 1

groundwater samples are shown in table 2 groundwater samples from 21 bore wells of the unconfined aquifer were collected in duplicate in new pre cleaned polypropylene bottles 450 ml capacity daily between 8 a m and 11 a m to collect water samples 3 min of drilling water from bore well is necessary to remove stagnant groundwater color taste odor temperature are the tree physical parameters measured and recorded in situ ec using conductivity meter and ph using ph meter groundwater samples collected were colorless and odorless all samples were stored at 4 c until laboratory analysis qadir et al 2019 2 3 saturation of calcium carbonate the thermodynamic model applied in this investigation has been detailed by back 1961 the chemical equations involved are back 1963 and mesdaghinia et al 2015 by making temperature corrections an ion activity product k iap for caco3 can be calculated from the activities of the calcium and carbonate ions determined from the above equations and compared with the equilibrium constant kcalcite the equilibrium constants used in these calculations are given in table 1 for values below 10 c and above 35 c see back 1961 plate 1 2 4 classification of the hydrochemical data to be able to sort out groundwater samples into groups graphical and statistical methods were used scatter schoeller piper durov giggenbach wilcox as well as langeleir ludwig diagrams come with aquachem version 2014 2 2 5 accuracy of analysis in this study the electrical balance error computed by phreeqc was utilized and assessment of data was with respect to a 5 criteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 classification of groundwater the levels of dissolved ions in groundwater samples are normally ruled by lithology velocity and quality of groundwater flow nature of geochemical reactions solubility of salts and human routines rao 2002 in order to distinguish the regional groundwater type a schoeller diagram is presented in fig 2 the major water types can to some extent be identified as mg hco3 and na cl as a result of semi logarithmic arrangement if a straight line joining two points of two ions in a sample of water is parallel to another straight line joining two points of the same two ions in a second sample of water the ratio of the ions in the two analysis is equal from fig 2 groundwater samples belong to similar water groups following the same pattern in the diagram except for ub15 where concentrations of mg and cl are slightly higher than the other well waters and ub24 where na concentration is lesser then the other well waters table 2 the schoeller diagram can be adapted that it may be utilized to determine the degree of saturation of calcium carbonate in groundwater the investigation of water types may help to decipher the genesis of the groundwater along its flow path this is not an easy task since most of the wells sampled are not located along the groundwater flow lines fig 1 the nomenclature of water types is based on the concept of index ions being ions which constitute at least 20 mmol eq of the cation or anion total 100 for each and are given in order of decreasing concentration fresh groundwater derived from rainwater usually is of the ca hco3 type in the presence of higher concentrations of sodium e g in coastal zones this type develops towards na hco3 water via intermediate ca na hco3 and na ca hco3 with increasing salinity the final water type is na cl hydrochemical facies term is a function of solution kinetics rock water interactions geology and contamination sources utilized to characterize the amounts of water that alter in their chemical composition an agreeable method to compare and classify types of water based on ionic composition is suggested by piper 1944 through scheming the chemical data on a trilinear diagram fig 3 buraimi ground waters are mainly located in two major zones d and e and one minor zones b which means that they are initial earth alkaline water with increased portions of alkalis according to furtak and langguth 1967 and eraifej 2006 this water type is divided into two zones which are 1 d with prevailing bicarbonates 2 e with prevailing sulfate and chloride second samples are normal earth alkaline water with prevailing bicarbonate and sulfate or chloride from fig 3 it is noticeable that the chemistry of some al zaroub wells have changed from zone d to zone e which is caused by a slight increase of mg cl and so4 and the decrease of ca and hco3 the groundwater have shifted from zone b to zone d and e to become normal earth alkaline water with prevailing bicarbonate as well as sulfate and chlorides respectively which is caused mainly by the slight decrease of na and k the rest of the samples showed the same water type mg hco3 cl from the plot alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 exceed the alkalis na and k and weak acids hco3 and co3 2 dominate strong acids cl and so4 2 hence alkaline earths dominate bicarbonate indicating exchange of na ion with alkaline earths resulting in base exchanged hardened water rao 2002 in the groundwater the concentration of mg2 is more than that of ca2 table 3 as the solubility of caco3 is much lower less than that of mgco3 the calcium appears to have precipitated as caco3 resulting in decline of ca2 values the evaporation also results in the precipitation of caco3 leading to the formation of kankar caco3 rao 2002 as in the study area the data are being presented using durov diagram fig 4 which illustrates some geochemical processes which might affect the water genesis table of water classification and geochemical processes in lloyd and heathcote 1985 shows the classification of the groundwater the samples are mainly located in two zones 2 and 5 and according to lloyd and heathcote 1985 1 zone 2 waters are dominated by ca and hco3 ions with presumed association to dolomite if the mg is significant however an important exchange is presumed if the na is significant in the sample 2 zone 5 water with no dominate anion or cation which indicates water exhibiting simple dissolution or mixing 3 2 identification of hydrochemical processes reactions between groundwater and aquifer minerals have a significant role on water quality which are also useful to understand the genesis of groundwater srinivasamoorthy and gopinath 2014 the hydrogeochemical data are used to identify the hydrogeochemical processes operating in the aquifer region of study area few of the possible identified processes are explained below the ratio of ca2 mg2 has been utilized to determine the sources of calcium and magnesium ions into the groundwater environment mayo and loucks 1995 if the ca2 mg2 ratio 1 shows dissolution of dolomite and 2 reflects an effect of silicate minerals that contributes calcium and magnesium to the groundwater katz and coplen 1997 all the samples 100 fall below 1 ratio line indicating precipitation of ca2 as caco3 which results in a decline of ca2 values or ion exchange process the exchange of ion between ground water and the environment through residence or travel step can be confirmed using an index of base exchange schoeller 1967 known as chloro alkaline indices cai while k and na in water an exchange with mg2 or ca2 in weathered materials is highly expected a base exchange is then confirmed by a positive index value though low saltwater with negative value demonstrates chloro alkaline disequilibrium known as cation anion exchange reaction during this process the innkeeper rocks are the essential origin of dissolved solids in groundwater gallardo and tase 2007 the cai point out 100 of samples favor base exchange hardened waters hence all the collected water samples have higher alkaline earth than hco3 indicating base exchange hardened water el alfy and abdalla 2019 however major ion chemistry utilization to identify rock mineralogy might be beneficial but must be practiced attentively mineral precipitation ion exchange and evaporation can modify chemical composition consequently the usage of ionic ratios in water is conceivably indicating the minerals of source rock types hounslow 1995 and kalpana and elango 2013 for this objective the concentrations of the various constituents are converted to meq l 1 to be able to combine the diverse ions in a chemically substantial approach in this study most of the ion ratios have been calculated to determine the dominant sources carbonate or silicate rocks of major ions ca2 mg2 vs na k is plotted which shows buraimi groundwater chemistry is predominantly controlled by carbonate lithology fig 5 the plot for ca2 mg2 vs hco3 shows the entire of data plot fig 6 a fall above the 1 1 line suggesting an excess of alkaline earth elements ca2 mg2 over hco3 reflecting extra sources of ca2 and especially mg2 ions balanced by cl and so4 2 and or supplied by silicate weathering zhang and huang 1995 if some representations noted below 1 1 line that would probably suggest the reaction of the feldspar minerals with carbonic acid in the presence of water which releases hco3 lakshmanan and kannan 2003 the concentration of carbonates is caused by the co2 present in the soil zone formed from the weathering of parent materials the weathering is caused by alternate wet and dry conditions but in this case the arid climate of buraimi area doesn t often permit the combination of co2 with rainwater to form carbonates the hco3 may also be derived from the dissolution of silicate minerals orthoclase plagioclase hornblende diopside hypersthenes olivine and biotite of country rocks of the area by the carbonic acid a general reaction for the weathering of silicate rocks with carbonic acid is as follows rao 2002 cations silicates h2co3 h4sio4 hco3 cations solid products mostly clays the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 is used to determine the ion exchange processes fig 6b if ion exchange is preeminent the points move to left because of an excess of hco3 so4 2 fisher and mullican 1997 if reverse ion exchange is the mechanism the point s move to the right as a result to excess of ca2 mg2 over hco3 so4 2 a total of 80 of groundwater samples falls left to the 1 1 line indicating reverse ion exchange mechanism and 20 of samples falls right to the 1 1 line indicating ion exchange process preeminence the points approaching the 1 1 line advocate ions from weathering of silicates datta and tyagi 1996 a charge balance will occur between the ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 if they are derived from basic dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum sami 1992 fisher and mullican 1997 razowska jaworek 2014 generally values close to unity between ca mg indicate dissolution of dolomite but ca mg ratios suggest that the dissolution of carbonate rocks except dolomite in the aquifer materials from the catchment area so4 ca ratio shows that gypsum dissolution is not 100 a primary source of sulfate in buraimi ground water so4 ca is 1 for more than 85 of the samples the na cl ratio has been utilized to determine the sources of salinity in groundwater environment fig 7 na cl molar ratio almost equal to 1 is mostly associated to rainwater or halite dissolution whereas 1 is normally understood as reflecting na released from silicate weathering due to water rock interaction via reaction meybeck 1987 and stallard and edmond 1983 2naalsi3o8 9h2 2h2co3 ai2si2o5 oh 4 2na 2hco3 4h4sio4 fisher and mullican 1997 and ratio 1 reflects impact or presence of additional sources fig 7 presents a na cl molar ratio lesser than 1 as a result of the dominance of cl ions chloride ions are present in the groundwater as sodium chloride chloride load surpassing sodium may be a result of the base exchange phenomena or a result of pollution by anthropogenic activities jia and o connor 2019 jones and vengosh 1999 probability of chloride bearing minerals like sodalite and chlorapatite srinivasamoorthy and gopinath 2014 hence chloride in groundwater is essentially due to base exchange of na for ca2 and especially mg2 or because of agricultural return flow because agricultural return flow water is defined by higher ratios of so4 2 cl 0 05 associated to the application of gypsum fertilizers vengosh and gill 2002 except for 5 well water samples ub11 ub15 ub16 ub17 ub19 where so4 2 cl is 0 05 the na k plotted against cl so4 2 shows fig 8 majority of buraimi groundwater samples plots above 1 1 line indicating the dominance of cl and so4 2 if no known geological source for chloride and sulfate is observed sources for both these ions might probably be derived from agricultural activities like application of fertilizers rajmohan and elango 2006 heavy use of fertilizers results in high values of cl no3 so4 2 and k pawar and shaikh 1995 which not 100 highly evident from the groundwater chemistry of the study area if samples were mapped out near or below the 1 1 line it would have represented mineral dissolution as the mechanism governing the major ion chemistry variation of cl and so4 2 along the groundwater flow path may be because of the long history of evaporation sarin and krishnaswami 1989 the plot of na k versus sum of cations fig 9 a points out that groundwater in the study area has a superior ratio of cations via silicate weathering and alkaline saline soils and residence time partly further the scheme of ca2 mg2 versus total cations fig 9b almost falls below the 1 1 trend reflect an increasing contribution of na and k as tds increases the increase in alkalies also contributes to greater cl so4 2 fig 8 indicating its sources from soils as na2so4 and k2so4 rao 2002 higher na in groundwater over k table 4 is attributed to the greater resistance of k to weathering singh and hasnain 1999 and its fixation in the formation of clay minerals the dominance of na an index of weathering suggests that the ions result from silicate weathering and or dissolution of soil salt rao 2002 3 3 irrigation water quality wells water for irrigation incorporates substantial chemical components traced from natural environment and human activity that possibly lower crop yield and decline soil fertility jalali 2009 irrigation water applied to the soil inserts salts to the root zone plant roots consume a small amount of salt from the soil solution likewise water evaporates from the surface of the soil but salts stay in the mechanism engenders a substantial amassing of salts in the root zone harming the plants in a way that salinity hazard is produced water deficiency and toxicity jalali 2011 besides these irrigated agricultural crops need very good quality water thus to deal with such complications it is fundamental to have accurate information respecting the quality of irrigation water and its effect on soils and crops thus an attempt has been produced in the current study to demarcate the quality of irrigation water from the plot of conductivity versus groundwater elevation profile we can examine conductivity changes with elevation that can be related to changes in lithology water saturation and water quality to get a generalized conductivity profile for the entire survey area we extracted conductivity values averaged all values for a given interval of time and plotted the averages with elevation fig 11a average apparent conductivities declining downward with groundwater elevation in the upper 411 518 m asl suggesting that either bedrock is shallower than expected over much of the study area or that the conductivity was not accurately measured below the conductive zone at and below the water table decreasing from relatively moderate value of 877 μs cm in the upper 411 m asl to the lowest average values of 240 μs cm at elevation of 518 m asl most likely electric potential distribution in a conductive liquid is directly analogous to groundwater elevation for comparable elevation ranges the average conductivity profile calculated from the buraimi groundwater analysis data is similar to those that fit the groundwater hardness and alkalinity analysis data fig 10 b and c respectively all of the profiles calculated for buraimi well samples hardness and alkalinity data show decline in their concentrations with elevations within 411 518 m asl 3 3 1 magnesium ratio mr the ca2 and mg2 ions preserve a phase of equilibrium in most groundwater srinivasamoorthy and gopinath 2014 in equilibrium mg2 in water alters the soil to alkaline which decreases the crop yield kumar and kumari 2007 the determination of magnesium impact in irrigated water is articulated as the magnesium ratio mr table 5 paliwal 1972 developed an index for calculating the magnesium hazard mr is calculated using the formula m r m g 2 100 m g 2 c a 2 the mr values range from 5 4 to 10 8 mg

and mg2 ions permanent hardness is due to ca2 and mg2 ions that get removed by ion exchange mechanisms temporary hardness is principally caused by calcium carbonate in water that gets removed during heating hardness of water narrows its utilization for industrial functions causing scaling of pots boilers and irrigation pipes in some studies a significant correlation was observed between hardness and heart diseases in contrast a number of epidemiological studies suggest that water hardness protects against diseases who 2010 the total hardness th expressed in mg l is determined by todd 1980 as todd 1980 th mg l 2 497 ca2 4 115 mg2 the most desirable limit for th is 80 100 mg caco3 l freeze and cherry 1979 the th ranges from 9 to 341 3 mg l tending to hard water category high concentrations of hardness above 150 mg l will build up on contact surfaces plug pipes and irrigation lines and damage water heaters 3 3 3 residual sodium carbonate rsc just after the total carbonate amount surpasses the level of calcium and magnesium water quality most likely declines once the residual carbonate grows upscale carbonates associate with magnesium and calcium and produce a solid material a growth in sar as well as sodium percentage is highly anticipated sarikhani and dehnavi 2015 the quantity of bicarbonate and carbonate over the quantity of magnesium and calcium in water impacts the suitability of groundwater for irrigation functions an overabundance of sodium bicarbonate and carbonate affects the physical properties of soil in fact dissolution of organics in soil will occur and allow a black stain on surface while drying kumar and kumari 2007 eaton 1950 suggested that residual sodium carbonate rsc defined by the formula rsc co3 hco3 ca2 mg2 is a good index of the sodicity hazard of an irrigation water where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l modification of rsc by soil applied with gypsum may permit use of waters with rsc values beyond the safe level sarikhani and dehnavi 2015 rsc ranges from 10 43 to 0 34 meq l from the values no groundwater samples of the study area were found to be unsuitable for irrigation purposes 3 3 3 sodium percentage na sodium is one of the major ions utilized to classify irrigation water for the sake of its reaction with soil that lowers its permeability percentage of na is largely utilized for assessing the

where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the classification of samples is shown in table 5 as per the wilcox 1955 classification 62 of groundwater represent the excellent category and 38 represent good category in general higher na observed indicate the dominance of ion exchange and weathering from lithological units of the study area 3 3 4 sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium adsorption ratio known as alkali hazard or sodium content is imperative to conclude the amount of water utilized for irrigation goals growth in salinity lessens plants osmotic activity and prohibits water from extending to plants branches and leaves which leads to lower productivity marghade and malpe 2011 moreover irrigation water with immense na content and small ca2 content facilitates ion exchange by saturation of na ruins the soil structure by dispersion of clay particles todd 1980 leading to lesser production because of difficulty in cultivation rao 2006 the sar is figured out by richards 1954 using the formula hem 1991 as s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 concentrations expressed in meq l the sar values range from 0 074 to 1 25 if sar is higher it would indicate precipitation induced

salinity and low sodium water which can be used for irrigation in almost all types of soil with almost no danger of exchangeable sodium kumar and kumari 2007 representations in the c3s1 and especially

appropriateness of groundwater for domestic and agriculture purposes and possible direct utilizations of buraimi groundwater this exploration assesses the quality of various groundwater wells for the chemical and hydrogeological conditions findings and results depend on the chemical as well as hydrochemichal composition of buraimi groundwater buraimi groundwater is fresh water almost all water samples met the necessary criteria to be used as drinking water chemically waters are categorized as earth alkaline water with increased portions of alkalis the low salinity waters are with prevailing bicarbonates and the ones that have higher salinity are with prevailing sulfate and chloride groundwater is overpowered by ca2 and hco3 ions with assumed relationship to dolomite if mg is noteworthy nevertheless a significant exchange is presumed if the na is substantial in the sample the recognition of water rock equilibrium demonstrates simple rock dissolution actually the chemical advancement of ground waters is governed by simple crustal dissolution processes at temperature below 50 c which might indicate geogenic dominance the cai point out 100 of samples favor base exchange hardened waters subsequently all the gathered water samples have higher alkaline earth than hco3 indicating based exchange hardened water chloride content surpassing sodium in buraimi groundwater might be due to the base exchange phenomena the study area groundwater has a greater ratio of cations via silicate weathering and alkaline saline soils and residence time the suitability of buraimi groundwater for irrigation purposes was additionally examined all groundwater samples in buraimi zone cluster in c2s1 indicate medium salinity and low sodium water which can be utilized for irrigation in mostly all kinds of soil with almost no troublesome situation of exchangeable sodium the studied waters show a negative residual sodium carbonate rsc meaning the sodium build up is unlikely to happen since sufficient calcium and magnesium are in excess of what can be precipitated as carbonates when the waters are applied to the soils groundwater conductivity changes with groundwater elevation and that can be related to changes in lithology water saturation and water quality declaration of competing interest none

fluoride from drinking water the most effective adsorbent alcs fe al was prepared under the following conditions alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 1 2 while the preparation conditions of the adsorbent alcs fe al prepared according to the actual iron and aluminum contents in the sludge are alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 2 1 both of the two adsorbents could reduce the fluoride concentration to below 1 5 mg l in aqueous solution at ph 7 t 25 c with a adsorbent ratio of 3g l which meets the level of drinking water standard recommended by the world health organization who in addition it had a relatively high selectivity for fluoride versus common competitive co existing ions and high fluoride removal efficiency in a wide range of initial ph of 4 9 at neutral initial ph the adsorption isotherm was well fitted with the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity reached 30 49 mg g the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo second order model furthermore the adsorption performance composition and adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent can be proved by sem bet vsm xrd and xps this work provides a new idea for full utilization of dwts as adsorbent for fluoride removal from drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water treatment sludge fluoride removal recovery 1 introduction the waterworks produce large amounts of drinking water treatment sludge dwts every day with the increase of water consumption the production of sludge will become larger and larger how to dispose the massive drinking water treatment sludge has become an urgent problem to be solved due to the presence of organic pollutants heavy metals and other harmful substances in the sludge it exerts tremendous pressure on the environment therefore increasingly importance has been attached to the minimization of sludge volume and the recycling of sludge zhou et al 2015 in addition due to the use of iron salts and aluminum salts as coagulants in the water treatment process there are a great quantity of metal ions al3 fe3 ca2 and mg2 in the drinking water treatment sludge zou et al 2012 what s more the sludge can be widely used as a biochar and be modified by salts to be a low cost and effective adsorbent fan et al 2017 feng et al 2018 furthermore the inorganic components in the sludge can be extracted by acid leaching and other methods which can also significantly improve the performance of sludge carbon sc zou et al 2012 consequently it is effective and feasible to prepare a novel adsorbent by using the modified sludge and the inorganic metal retained in the sludge which can also fully utilize the dwts as the demand for purified water continues to increase to meet the needs of a growing population especially in developing countries the removal of fluoride from drinking water has become an increasingly important issue of public concern in 25 countries around the world fluorosis plagues local people as a local public health problem and induces various diseases vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the guidelines for drinking water quality as defined by the who indicate that the fluoride content in drinking water should not exceed 1 50 mg l edition 2011 adsorption is considered to be one of the most promising fluoride removal technologies in terms of cost design and operability mohapatra et al 2009 for many years alumina and aluminum based adsorbents have been effective and important materials for researchers in the field of fluorine removal in water and wastewater du et al 2014 yami et al 2015 goswami and purkait 2012 compared to other available conventional techniques magnetic separation is regarded as an effective technique because of its simplicity easy separation and operation shirsath and shirivastava 2015 sivashankar et al 2014 moreover due to the good magnetic separability cost effective nature chemical consistency and positive environmental impact adsorbents containing metal oxides or hydroxides such as aluminum based materials liu et al 2016 prathnaa et al 2018 and iron oxide based adsorbents kuang et al 2017 adak et al 2017 become effective materials for the adsorption of fluoride dhillon et al 2017 therefore it is feasible to load iron oxides and aluminum oxides on the sludge carbon to remove fluoride from drinking water in the current studies the dwts is often recycled as soil that can be planted for greening or as building and construction materials tay and show 1997 titshall and hughes 2005 however there are problems such as heavy metal leaching unstable quality of finished building materials and secondary pollution caused by excessive dosage in order to solve these problems it is necessary to explore more effective recycling methods of the dwts in this study metal salts iron and aluminum contained in the dwts were recycled by acid leaching of the sludge the remaining part i e sludge from acid leaching was pyrolyzed to obtain acid leaching carbonized sludge alcs a novel composite material can be obtained by loading fe al oxide on alcs by in situ synthesis 1 through a series of experiments the most effective adsorbent and optimal adsorption conditions were explored to be used for the removal of fluoride in water under normal conditions 2 in addition the adsorption process of the adsorbent was explored by means of model establishment 3 the adsorption performance composition and adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent can be proved by sem bet vsm xrd and xps it can not only realize the recycling of the dwts but also provide a new method for the removal of fluoride in aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the materials and chemicals used in the experiments for this study are shown in table 1 all chemicals are analytical grade and can be used without further purification 2 2 recycling of iron and aluminum and preparation of the adsorbent firstly the dwts was sufficiently ground into fine particles after being dried the sludge based carbon sc was obtained by roasting these sludge particles at 700 c for 2 h while being placed in a tube furnace tl1200 tianjin tianyi technology co ltd china under a nitrogen filled condition a mixture was obtained by mixing sc with hcl 2 mol l an acid leaching agent at a ratio of 1 20 g ml it was acid immersed for 80 min with the aid of ultrasonic waves the acid leaching solution and acid leaching carbonized sludge alcs were obtained by filtering the mixture as shown in fig 1 fe oh 3 and al oh 3 precipitates were obtained by adjusting the ph of the acid leaching solution at 6 and 13 respectively the obtained precipitates were respectively dissolved in an acid and concentrated by heating to cool and crystallize to obtain fecl3 6h2o and al2 so4 3 18h2o which were used as precursors for subsequent experiments further fecl3 6h2o 0 81 g 3 0 mmol acid leaching carbonized sludge alcs added in proportion anhydrous naac 2 16 g and peg 4000 0 60 g were added to ethylene glycol 24 0 ml the resulting mixture was then stirred and homogenized at room temperature and sonicated for 10 min next the mixture was placed in a 50 ml teflon lined high temperature autoclave ika anhui key power machinery technology co ltd china and reacted at 200 c for 12 h deng et al 2010 it can be taken out after being cooled to room temperature the solid and liquid in the reaction liquid were separated using a suction filtration device with a vacuum pump the adsorbent retained on the filter membrane was cross rinsing six times using ethanol and distilled water then it was placed in a vacuum drying oven dzf 6020 kangheng instrument co ltd china and dried at 60 c for 6 h finally the iron loaded alcs fe can be obtained the alcs fe obtained from the previous step and al2 so4 3 18h2o were placed in an aqueous solution of ph 6 in different ratios mass ratios of alcs fe and al2 so4 3 18h2o 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 3 8 3 9 chai et al 2013 after being thoroughly mixed and sonicated for 10 min the mixture was placed in a constant temperature shaker at 80 c for 4 h and the whole process was carried out under nitrogen it was separated from water by a magnet and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 c for 6 h to prepare the alcs fe al loaded with iron aluminum which was used for the adsorption of fluoride in an aqueous solution 2 3 characterization of the adsorbent the microstructure and morphology of the alcs fe al particles were examined by a scanning electron microscope sem sigma 300 beijing oubo optics technology co ltd china the composition of the adsorbent was identified by x ray diffraction xrd 6100 shimadzu enterprise management co ltd china the specific surface area of alcs fe al was measured by nitrogen adsorption using a specific surface area analysis tester beta201a beijing guanzheng precision electric instrument equipment co ltd china the magnetic properties of the adsorbent were analyzed by a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm mpms3 quantum design usa the chemical structure of the adsorbent before and after defluorination was determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa 2 4 adsorption performance of the adsorbent the adsorption performance of alcs fe al particles was examined by batch experiment a certain amount of adsorbent was added to the fluoride containing solution the sample was then placed in a constant temperature shaker at 25 c until the adsorption reached equilibrium unless otherwise stated the temperature of the adsorption remained unchanged the residual fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution was measured by a fluoride ion meter pxsj 216 shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china when the adsorption reached equilibrium the adsorption capacity and the fluoride removal rate were calculated the fluoride removal rate removal is defined as the percentage of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent to the initial fluoride concentration 1 removal c 0 c f c 0 100 where c0 is the concentration of f in the initial solution mg l cf is the concentration of f in the solution when adsorption reaches equilibrium mg l to investigate the effect of ph on adsorption the initial ph of the fluoride solution was adjusted to a range of 4 9 using 0 01 mol l hcl or naoh the ph of the solution was measured by a ph meter phs 3c shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china the initial fluoride concentration was set to 10 mg l when the adsorption reached equilibrium the concentration of residual fluoride in the solution was measured and the removal rate was calculated the effects of competitive coexisting anions on the adsorption of fluoride were investigated by adding nacl nahco3 na2co3 na2so4 na3po4 and na2sio3 to the fluoride containing solution the molar ratio of each anion to fluoride ion is 1 1 all chemicals are of analytical grade and could be used without further purification 2 5 regeneration of the adsorbent the adsorbent the alcs fe al was collected by utilizing the magnetism of the magnet and used for regeneration and circulation the organic solvent methanol was used as a desorbent to desorb fluoride from the adsorbent for 5 h to achieve its regeneration the adsorbent obtained after desorption was dried for 2 h in a vacuum drying oven the desorbed adsorbent was used to carry out the experiment of adsorbing fluoride in the aqueous solution in order to evaluate the reusability of the alcs fe al the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent was measured in 6 regeneration cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal conditions for fluoride removal with the alcs fe al 3 1 1 the effect of aluminum content in adsorbent as shown in fig 2 as the aluminum content in the adsorbent increased the removal rate of fluoride in aqueous solution also increased sharply which indicates that the aluminum content in the adsorbent has a great influence on the adsorption of fluoride the removal rate of fluoride reached a maximum value with the alcs fe al ratio of 1 2 i e a mass ratio of alcs fe al2 so4 3 as the aluminum content continued to increase the fluoride removal rate remained essentially constant indicating that the amount of aluminum supported in the adsorbent was saturated the removal rate of fluoride can reach 93 6 and the residual fluoride ion content in the aqueous solution is 0 63mg l which meets the standard of safe drinking water 3 1 2 the effect of iron content in adsorbent the effect of iron content in the adsorbent was investigated alcs fe al 1 2 as shown in fig 3 as the iron content in the adsorbent increased the removal rate of fluoride increased gradually when the ratio alcs fe i e a mass ratio of alcs and fecl3 6h2o was increased to 1 1 the removal rate reached a maximum of 93 85 and the residual fluoride content in the aqueous solution was 0 60 mg l by comparing the difference in the effect of the adsorbent on the adsorption of fluoride which is caused by the different contents of iron and aluminum it is worth mentioning that the effect of changes in aluminum content in the adsorbent is significantly greater than that of iron this result has also been confirmed in other studies cai et al 2015 the addition of aluminum or sulfate to the adsorbent can significantly enhance its adsorption of fluoride chai et al 2013 consequently the optimal preparation conditions of the adsorbent were determined alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 1 2 we used the adsorbent prepared under this condition for the next study 3 1 3 the effect of adsorbent dosage as shown in fig 4 as the amount of adsorbent increased the removal rate of fluoride in the adsorbent increased significantly when the amount of the adsorbent exceeded 3 g l the fluoride removal rate reached a maximum of 96 2 the increase in the amount of adsorbent can provide sufficient surface active sites to adsorb fluoride in aqueous solution yu et al 2013 when the amount of the adsorbent is high the residual fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution is low bansiwal et al 2009 the removal rate of the adsorbent was not changed much even if more adsorbent were added therefore 3g l of the alcs fe al was determined as the optimum adsorption amount for fluoride removal in summary in the neutral aqueous solution with an initial fluoride ion concentration of 10 mg l the optimum conditions for the removal of fluoride on the alcs fe al are alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 1 2 adsorbent dosage 3 g l in fact approximately 224 mg fe i e 4 0 mmol and 78 mg al i e 3 0 mmol can be extracted from 1 g carbonized sludge according to this fact a alcs fe al was obtained based on this preparation condition alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 2 1 next 3 g l of the prepared alcs fe al was used for the removal of fluoride in a neutral aqueous solution with an initial fluoride ion concentration of 10 mg l the fluoride removal rate can reach 86 7 the residual fluoride ion concentration is 1 31 mg l 1 50 mg l which is still able to meet the drinking water quality standard 3 2 adsorption and regeneration performance of alcs fe al 3 2 1 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm model is used to study the interaction and adsorption mechanism between solid adsorbent materials and adsorbate at present the two adsorption isotherms are used most widely the langmuir isotherm model and the freundlich isotherm model which can be used to predict the type of adsorption of ions on the adsorbent the langmuir isotherm model illustrates single layer adsorption at the active site of the adsorbent ali 2018 while the freundlich isotherm model assumes that the adsorbent surface is not uniform the adsorption capacity of each adsorption site is unequal and there is an interaction between the adsorbed species lalley et al 2016 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are mathematically expressed as follows 2 the langmuir isotherm model q e k l q m c e k l c e 1 where qe is the amount of adsorbed fluoride in equilibrium mg g qm is the maximum adsorption capacity for fluoride mg g ce is the concentration of fluoride at equilibrium mg l kl is the langmuir equilibrium constant l mg 3 the freundlich isotherm model q e k f c e 1 n where kf is the isothermal constant for the freundlich adsorption capacity mg g n is the adsorption strength for the freundlich isotherm l g by comparison the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 9965 table 2 is more suitable for describing the adsorption process of fluoride on the alcs fe al adsorbent than the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 9108 table 2 therefore the fluoride is adsorbed by the adsorbent through the single layer surface adsorbent indicating that the active site of the material supported on the adsorbent plays an important role in the adsorption of fluoride cai et al 2015 the qe is plotted against ce as shown in fig 5 the adsorption process of the adsorbent adsorbing fluoride is in good agreement with the langmuir model isotherm and the maximum adsorption amount qm is 30 49 mg g 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics we can predict the adsorption rate and understand the mechanism of adsorption of fluoride through adsorption kinetics which is one of the most important characteristics representing adsorption efficiency in this study two kinetic models lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model and lagergren pseudo second order kinetic model were used to describe the kinetics of sorbent adsorption of fluoride the pseudo first order kinetic model 4 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t the pseudo second order kinetic model 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe is the amount of fluoride adsorbed at equilibrium mg g qt is the amount of fluoride adsorbed at a certain moment mg g k1 and k2 are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order reaction rate constants respectively t is reaction time min in contrast the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 9998 table 3 is more suitable than the pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 9636 table 3 to describe the adsorption of fluoride on the alcs fe al adsorbent the kinetics of the adsorbent adsorbing fluoride is in good agreement with the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 6 due to the faster adsorption kinetics of smaller particles badruzzaman et al 2004 the adsorption of fluoride ions was very fast in the first 5 min finally it took about 60 min for the adsorption to reach equilibrium 3 2 3 the effect of competitive co existing anions in this study some typical anions cl hco3 co3 2 so4 2 po4 3 sio3 2 in drinking water were selected to explore the effect of coexisting anions on fluoride removal in water and the ratio of the molar concentration of each ion in the water to the initial molar concentration of the fluoride ion was set to be 1 1 as shown in fig 7 it can be observed that hco3 co3 2 po4 3 sio3 2 have no significant effect on fluoride adsorption while cl and so4 2 were present in the system the amount of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent from the aqueous solution was reduced this may be due to a decrease in the partial adsorption sites of the fluoride which is caused by the adsorption of cl and so4 2 to specific adsorption sites on the surface of the magnetic particles thereby forming competitive adsorption in natural waters other anions may compete with fluoride for adsorption sites causing interference to adsorption and reducing adsorbent removal efficiency dhillon et al 2017 however in general the presence of other coexisting anions in the water has little effect on the adsorption of f indicating that the adsorbent has a higher selectivity for the adsorption of fluoride and is suitable for fluoride removal in natural water environments 3 2 4 regeneration and circulation of the alcs fe al in order to evaluate the reusability of the alcs fe al the fluoride removal rates of the adsorbent were measured in 6 regeneration cycles using methanol as a desorbent it can be seen from fig 8 that although the efficiency of the adsorbent to remove fluoride decreased with the increase of cycle times the residual fluoride content in the water is 1 41 mg l after the adsorbent has been recycled for 6 times which can still meet the standard for safe drinking water it also shows that methanol can regenerate the adsorbent effectively which can be reused in a long period of time and still has a relatively high adsorption efficiency 3 3 characterization results and adsorption mechanism explanation of adsorbent 3 3 1 sem the sem characterization results of the original sludge carbon sc and the prepared alcs fe al are shown in fig 9 by comparing the two images we can observe that sc has a smoother surface and more pores fig 9 a which can provide an attachment site and a larger surface area for the loading of the compounds in addition the fact that the alcs fe al loaded with iron aluminum oxides has a relatively high bet specific surface area of 155 2 m2 g 1 also proves this however the surface of the alcs fe al adsorbent is relatively rough and is filled with spheroidal particles indicating that the surface of the biochar has been loaded with iron aluminum oxides after a series of preparation processes which have high adsorption capacity free active valence and surface energy dhillon and kumar 2015 in addition it can be seen from fig 9 b that the ron aluminum oxides have agglomeration on the surface of the biochar which may be due to the higher surface energy and small size of the magnetic adsorbent 3 3 2 vsm magnetic test the magnetization curve of the prepared the alcs fe al is shown in fig 10 we can observe that the magnetization increases with the increase of the strength of the applied magnetic field and finally reaches the magnetic saturation the composite material has a saturation magnetization of about 32 1 emu g 1 emu g 1 a m2 kg in addition a magnetic adsorbent with a saturation value of 16 3 emu g is sufficient to be separated from the water by a magnet ma et al 2005 therefore the magnetic adsorbent can be separated and recovered from water by the magnetic properties of a magnet 3 3 3 xrd the xrd data of the alcs fe al was analyzed by the jade software after the background value was subtracted as shown in fig 11 by compared with the pdf 2004 standard card the peak position and peak intensity of the tested the alcs fe al are substantially matched to the standard material in addition it can be observed that there are mainly three relatively strong diffraction peaks the derivative peak at 2θ 26 6 corresponds to the characteristic peak of sio2 this is due to the fact that the sludge based carbon contains sio2 which may serve as a bonding point with iron aluminum oxides zarei and saedi 2018 zhang et al 2018 the derivative peak at 2θ 8 7 corresponds to the characteristic peak of al2si2o5 oh 4 hconh2 which indicates that aluminum is likely to exist in the form of aluminum oxide or hydroxide in the adsorbent material which can be combined with other elements such as c o and si etc further the derivative peak at 2θ 35 6 corresponds to the characteristic peak of the magnetic fe3o4 which also explains that the adsorbent has a certain magnetic property however the state and type of fe and al present in the adsorbent can be further confirmed in conjunction with other characterization results and analysis 3 3 4 xps as shown in the full spectrum of xps of the alcs fe al the adsorbent mainly contains elements such as c o s si fe and al before adsorption fig 12 moreover by comparison with the standard xps binding energy table the binding energy of fe2p peak 710 57 ev and al2p peak 74 36 ev in the alcs fe al correspond to fe3o4 and al2o3 respectively combined with the results of previous xrd characterization it can be inferred that fe3o4 and al2o3 are present in the adsorbent in addition the existence form and content of each element in the adsorbent before and after adsorption were comparatively analyzed as shown in table 4 an increase in the f element in the adsorbent after adsorption can be clearly seen which can be more visually observed in fig 13 after adsorption the binding energy of the f1s peak of alcs fe al 685 18 ev is significantly higher than that of naf 684 5 ev clearly indicating the reaction between the adsorbent and the fluoride wu et al 2013 furthermore the atomic ratio of each element of the adsorbent changed before and after adsorption the atomic ratio of fe2p al2p o1s s2p in the alcs fe al decrease significantly after the adsorbent adsorb fluoride while the changes in f1s and c1s are reversed combined with the change in the binding energy of the peaks of these elements before and after adsorption it can be inferred 1 fe f and al f can be formed by the combination of fe and al with f by surface coordination of the adsorbent and this was confirmed in many studies cai et al 2015 chai et al 2013 kuang et al 2017 fe and al are hard acids and have a higher valence state as a high priced metal to provide an orbit for receiving electrons while f is a hard base which has a high electronegativity to provide electrons according to the theory of hard and soft acids and bases the two are easy to combine due to their strong affinity between them 2 the decrease in the atomic ratio of s after adsorption indicates that so4 2 participates in the adsorption of f in water the removal of fluoride is the result of ion exchange through so4 2 and f chai et al 2013 3 it can also be seen that the atomic ratio of o1s is decreased indicating that the oh group is involved in the adsorption of fluoride in fact a part of the hydroxyl group is likely to be derived from sludge based biochar many studies have shown that surface hydroxyl groups participate in the adsorption of fluoride in carbon based adsorbents ajisha and rajagopal 2015 yu et al 2015 in addition the oh group may also be derived from hydroxylated metal oxides because the metal oxide is easily hydrolyzed and hydroxylated in solution to form into m oh x n x anderson and rubin 1982 on the one hand f can be adsorbed by ion exchange with oh in an acidic medium chen et al 2016 on the other hand if the potential of the surface of the particle is lower than the zero potential the hydroxylated metal oxide is easily protonated to change its surface charge to be positive thereby adsorbing the fluoride by electrostatic attraction jadhav et al 2015 3 3 5 the effect of the ph of the solution as an important water chemistry parameter the ph of the aqueous solution has a certain influence on the adsorption of fluoride the 0 01 mol l hcl or naoh was used to adjust the ph of the solution to a range of 4 9 the result shows that the alcs fe al has a positive removal effect on fluoride in water fig 14 which indicates that the adsorbent can be widely used in a wide ph range what s more the surface of the solid particles in the solution will have different charges according to the theory of electrostatic attraction when the ph of the solution is higher than phzpc ph of zero point charge the surface of the particle is negatively charged otherwise it will be positively charged however biochar mainly improves the ph at zero potential phzpc by modifying the biochar with metal oxides or hydroxides thereby increasing the anion exchange capacity and enabling it to be used in a wider ph range of the aqueous solution lawrinenko et al 2017 therefore the phzpc of the alcs fe al mainly depends on the fe3o4 al2o3 contained therein the phzpc of fe3o4 al2o3 is 6 8 prathnaa et al 2018 therefore the surface of the adsorbent has a positive charge in an aqueous solution under acidic conditions while the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged in a medium alkaline condition however we additionally observed changes in the ph of the solution before and after adsorption as shown in table 5 it can be seen that the ph value of the solution increased in the acidic medium after adsorption while the ph value of the solution decreased in the neutral and alkaline medium after adsorption which indicates that the adsorbent has a good buffering capacity in the adsorption process this buffering effect can be explained by the amphoteric nature of the iron aluminum oxide surface in the adsorbent according to the previous investigation of the mechanism of removing fluoride by this adsorbent the metal oxides are easily hydrolyzed and hydroxylated in the solution resulting in the metal ions on the surface layer of the metal oxide having an unsaturated coordination zhang et al 2016 therefore we can infer that the process of buffering the adsorbent can be expressed as follows 6 a l c s m o h a l c s m o h 7 a l c s m o h h a l c s m o h 2 8 a l c s m o h o h a l c s m o h 2 o where m represents the surface metal species alcs represents the acid leaching carbonized sludge as shown in fig 14 we can observe that the adsorption effect of the adsorbent on fluoride is stronger in neutral and alkaline media than in acidic media under acidic conditions the adsorption may be based on electrostatic attraction under alkaline conditions as the ph of the solution increased the zeta potential on the surface of the adsorbent decreased which can weaken the electrostatic attraction of fluoride as shown in equation 9 hydroxylated metal oxides loaded on the surface of the alcs are prone to protonation in neutral and alkaline media if the potential of the surface of the particle is lower than the zero potential jadhav et al 2015 when the effect is sufficient to change the surface charge to be positive the fluoride can be adsorbed by the action of electrostatic attraction moreover combined with xps characterization analysis results there is a surface coordination between high valent metals fe al and f with high electronegativity therefore ligand exchange can be achieved by utilizing the surface coordination kuang et al 2017 the two mechanism occurred in two step protonation ligand exchange 9 a l c s m h 2 o a l c s m o h 2 10 a l c s m o h 2 f a l c s m f h 2 o 11 a l c s m o h f a l c s m f o h where m represents the surface metal species alcs represents the acid leaching carbonized sludge although electrostatic adsorption can play a role in the adsorption process the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of the ph in fluoride containing solution which indicates that electrostatic adsorption is not the main adsorption mechanism therefore as a whole the adsorption mechanism of the alcs fe al to remove fluoride is mainly the result of simultaneous action of ligand exchange surface coordination between the metal and f electrostatic adsorption and ion exchange 4 conclusion in this study a novel adsorbent alcs fe al with magnetic separation for removing fluoride in drinking water was prepared by combining the alcs with iron and aluminum salts extracted from the dwts the adsorbent has good stability and high magnetic strength and is easily separated from the solution the results show that the fluoride concentration of the fluoride containing aqueous solution 10 mg l can be reduced to less than 1 50 mg l by the adsorption of alcs fe al which meets the internationally prescribed drinking water quality standards the kinetic study shows that the adsorption process of fluoride on alcs fe al follows the lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model the adsorption isotherm is consistent with the langmuir model and the adsorption capacity is 30 49 mg g furthermore fe3o4 al2o3 and abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of alcs fe al act as active sites for fluoride adsorption the adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent to remove fluoride is mainly the result of simultaneous action of ligand exchange surface coordination electrostatic adsorption and ion exchange in addition the adsorbent can be used in a wide range of ph 4 9 and has a certain buffering capacity for changes in the ph of the solution the presence of aqueous anionic anions has a slight effect on the removal of fluoride on the alcs fe al consequently the adsorbent can be widely applied to the removal of fluoride for drinking water moreover the alcs fe al can be easily and quickly regenerated with methanol as a desorbent the adsorption efficiency is still high after 6 regeneration cycles this research not only provides a new way for the recycling of sludge but also a new method for fluoride removal from drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors of this paper feng jing bai hui xue yudan zhang rui zhu puli bu duo dan zeng li wei and lu xuebin

fluoride from drinking water the most effective adsorbent alcs fe al was prepared under the following conditions alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 1 2 while the preparation conditions of the adsorbent alcs fe al prepared according to the actual iron and aluminum contents in the sludge are alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 2 1 both of the two adsorbents could reduce the fluoride concentration to below 1 5 mg l in aqueous solution at ph 7 t 25 c with a adsorbent ratio of 3g l which meets the level of drinking water standard recommended by the world health organization who in addition it had a relatively high selectivity for fluoride versus common competitive co existing ions and high fluoride removal efficiency in a wide range of initial ph of 4 9 at neutral initial ph the adsorption isotherm was well fitted with the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity reached 30 49 mg g the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo second order model furthermore the adsorption performance composition and adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent can be proved by sem bet vsm xrd and xps this work provides a new idea for full utilization of dwts as adsorbent for fluoride removal from drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water treatment sludge fluoride removal recovery 1 introduction the waterworks produce large amounts of drinking water treatment sludge dwts every day with the increase of water consumption the production of sludge will become larger and larger how to dispose the massive drinking water treatment sludge has become an urgent problem to be solved due to the presence of organic pollutants heavy metals and other harmful substances in the sludge it exerts tremendous pressure on the environment therefore increasingly importance has been attached to the minimization of sludge volume and the recycling of sludge zhou et al 2015 in addition due to the use of iron salts and aluminum salts as coagulants in the water treatment process there are a great quantity of metal ions al3 fe3 ca2 and mg2 in the drinking water treatment sludge zou et al 2012 what s more the sludge can be widely used as a biochar and be modified by salts to be a low cost and effective adsorbent fan et al 2017 feng et al 2018 furthermore the inorganic components in the sludge can be extracted by acid leaching and other methods which can also significantly improve the performance of sludge carbon sc zou et al 2012 consequently it is effective and feasible to prepare a novel adsorbent by using the modified sludge and the inorganic metal retained in the sludge which can also fully utilize the dwts as the demand for purified water continues to increase to meet the needs of a growing population especially in developing countries the removal of fluoride from drinking water has become an increasingly important issue of public concern in 25 countries around the world fluorosis plagues local people as a local public health problem and induces various diseases vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the guidelines for drinking water quality as defined by the who indicate that the fluoride content in drinking water should not exceed 1 50 mg l edition 2011 adsorption is considered to be one of the most promising fluoride removal technologies in terms of cost design and operability mohapatra et al 2009 for many years alumina and aluminum based adsorbents have been effective and important materials for researchers in the field of fluorine removal in water and wastewater du et al 2014 yami et al 2015 goswami and purkait 2012 compared to other available conventional techniques magnetic separation is regarded as an effective technique because of its simplicity easy separation and operation shirsath and shirivastava 2015 sivashankar et al 2014 moreover due to the good magnetic separability cost effective nature chemical consistency and positive environmental impact adsorbents containing metal oxides or hydroxides such as aluminum based materials liu et al 2016 prathnaa et al 2018 and iron oxide based adsorbents kuang et al 2017 adak et al 2017 become effective materials for the adsorption of fluoride dhillon et al 2017 therefore it is feasible to load iron oxides and aluminum oxides on the sludge carbon to remove fluoride from drinking water in the current studies the dwts is often recycled as soil that can be planted for greening or as building and construction materials tay and show 1997 titshall and hughes 2005 however there are problems such as heavy metal leaching unstable quality of finished building materials and secondary pollution caused by excessive dosage in order to solve these problems it is necessary to explore more effective recycling methods of the dwts in this study metal salts iron and aluminum contained in the dwts were recycled by acid leaching of the sludge the remaining part i e sludge from acid leaching was pyrolyzed to obtain acid leaching carbonized sludge alcs a novel composite material can be obtained by loading fe al oxide on alcs by in situ synthesis 1 through a series of experiments the most effective adsorbent and optimal adsorption conditions were explored to be used for the removal of fluoride in water under normal conditions 2 in addition the adsorption process of the adsorbent was explored by means of model establishment 3 the adsorption performance composition and adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent can be proved by sem bet vsm xrd and xps it can not only realize the recycling of the dwts but also provide a new method for the removal of fluoride in aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the materials and chemicals used in the experiments for this study are shown in table 1 all chemicals are analytical grade and can be used without further purification 2 2 recycling of iron and aluminum and preparation of the adsorbent firstly the dwts was sufficiently ground into fine particles after being dried the sludge based carbon sc was obtained by roasting these sludge particles at 700 c for 2 h while being placed in a tube furnace tl1200 tianjin tianyi technology co ltd china under a nitrogen filled condition a mixture was obtained by mixing sc with hcl 2 mol l an acid leaching agent at a ratio of 1 20 g ml it was acid immersed for 80 min with the aid of ultrasonic waves the acid leaching solution and acid leaching carbonized sludge alcs were obtained by filtering the mixture as shown in fig 1 fe oh 3 and al oh 3 precipitates were obtained by adjusting the ph of the acid leaching solution at 6 and 13 respectively the obtained precipitates were respectively dissolved in an acid and concentrated by heating to cool and crystallize to obtain fecl3 6h2o and al2 so4 3 18h2o which were used as precursors for subsequent experiments further fecl3 6h2o 0 81 g 3 0 mmol acid leaching carbonized sludge alcs added in proportion anhydrous naac 2 16 g and peg 4000 0 60 g were added to ethylene glycol 24 0 ml the resulting mixture was then stirred and homogenized at room temperature and sonicated for 10 min next the mixture was placed in a 50 ml teflon lined high temperature autoclave ika anhui key power machinery technology co ltd china and reacted at 200 c for 12 h deng et al 2010 it can be taken out after being cooled to room temperature the solid and liquid in the reaction liquid were separated using a suction filtration device with a vacuum pump the adsorbent retained on the filter membrane was cross rinsing six times using ethanol and distilled water then it was placed in a vacuum drying oven dzf 6020 kangheng instrument co ltd china and dried at 60 c for 6 h finally the iron loaded alcs fe can be obtained the alcs fe obtained from the previous step and al2 so4 3 18h2o were placed in an aqueous solution of ph 6 in different ratios mass ratios of alcs fe and al2 so4 3 18h2o 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 3 8 3 9 chai et al 2013 after being thoroughly mixed and sonicated for 10 min the mixture was placed in a constant temperature shaker at 80 c for 4 h and the whole process was carried out under nitrogen it was separated from water by a magnet and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 c for 6 h to prepare the alcs fe al loaded with iron aluminum which was used for the adsorption of fluoride in an aqueous solution 2 3 characterization of the adsorbent the microstructure and morphology of the alcs fe al particles were examined by a scanning electron microscope sem sigma 300 beijing oubo optics technology co ltd china the composition of the adsorbent was identified by x ray diffraction xrd 6100 shimadzu enterprise management co ltd china the specific surface area of alcs fe al was measured by nitrogen adsorption using a specific surface area analysis tester beta201a beijing guanzheng precision electric instrument equipment co ltd china the magnetic properties of the adsorbent were analyzed by a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm mpms3 quantum design usa the chemical structure of the adsorbent before and after defluorination was determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa 2 4 adsorption performance of the adsorbent the adsorption performance of alcs fe al particles was examined by batch experiment a certain amount of adsorbent was added to the fluoride containing solution the sample was then placed in a constant temperature shaker at 25 c until the adsorption reached equilibrium unless otherwise stated the temperature of the adsorption remained unchanged the residual fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution was measured by a fluoride ion meter pxsj 216 shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china when the adsorption reached equilibrium the adsorption capacity and the fluoride removal rate were calculated the fluoride removal rate removal is defined as the percentage of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent to the initial fluoride concentration 1 removal c 0 c f c 0 100 where c0 is the concentration of f in the initial solution mg l cf is the concentration of f in the solution when adsorption reaches equilibrium mg l to investigate the effect of ph on adsorption the initial ph of the fluoride solution was adjusted to a range of 4 9 using 0 01 mol l hcl or naoh the ph of the solution was measured by a ph meter phs 3c shanghai yidian scientific instrument co ltd china the initial fluoride concentration was set to 10 mg l when the adsorption reached equilibrium the concentration of residual fluoride in the solution was measured and the removal rate was calculated the effects of competitive coexisting anions on the adsorption of fluoride were investigated by adding nacl nahco3 na2co3 na2so4 na3po4 and na2sio3 to the fluoride containing solution the molar ratio of each anion to fluoride ion is 1 1 all chemicals are of analytical grade and could be used without further purification 2 5 regeneration of the adsorbent the adsorbent the alcs fe al was collected by utilizing the magnetism of the magnet and used for regeneration and circulation the organic solvent methanol was used as a desorbent to desorb fluoride from the adsorbent for 5 h to achieve its regeneration the adsorbent obtained after desorption was dried for 2 h in a vacuum drying oven the desorbed adsorbent was used to carry out the experiment of adsorbing fluoride in the aqueous solution in order to evaluate the reusability of the alcs fe al the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent was measured in 6 regeneration cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal conditions for fluoride removal with the alcs fe al 3 1 1 the effect of aluminum content in adsorbent as shown in fig 2 as the aluminum content in the adsorbent increased the removal rate of fluoride in aqueous solution also increased sharply which indicates that the aluminum content in the adsorbent has a great influence on the adsorption of fluoride the removal rate of fluoride reached a maximum value with the alcs fe al ratio of 1 2 i e a mass ratio of alcs fe al2 so4 3 as the aluminum content continued to increase the fluoride removal rate remained essentially constant indicating that the amount of aluminum supported in the adsorbent was saturated the removal rate of fluoride can reach 93 6 and the residual fluoride ion content in the aqueous solution is 0 63mg l which meets the standard of safe drinking water 3 1 2 the effect of iron content in adsorbent the effect of iron content in the adsorbent was investigated alcs fe al 1 2 as shown in fig 3 as the iron content in the adsorbent increased the removal rate of fluoride increased gradually when the ratio alcs fe i e a mass ratio of alcs and fecl3 6h2o was increased to 1 1 the removal rate reached a maximum of 93 85 and the residual fluoride content in the aqueous solution was 0 60 mg l by comparing the difference in the effect of the adsorbent on the adsorption of fluoride which is caused by the different contents of iron and aluminum it is worth mentioning that the effect of changes in aluminum content in the adsorbent is significantly greater than that of iron this result has also been confirmed in other studies cai et al 2015 the addition of aluminum or sulfate to the adsorbent can significantly enhance its adsorption of fluoride chai et al 2013 consequently the optimal preparation conditions of the adsorbent were determined alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 1 2 we used the adsorbent prepared under this condition for the next study 3 1 3 the effect of adsorbent dosage as shown in fig 4 as the amount of adsorbent increased the removal rate of fluoride in the adsorbent increased significantly when the amount of the adsorbent exceeded 3 g l the fluoride removal rate reached a maximum of 96 2 the increase in the amount of adsorbent can provide sufficient surface active sites to adsorb fluoride in aqueous solution yu et al 2013 when the amount of the adsorbent is high the residual fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution is low bansiwal et al 2009 the removal rate of the adsorbent was not changed much even if more adsorbent were added therefore 3g l of the alcs fe al was determined as the optimum adsorption amount for fluoride removal in summary in the neutral aqueous solution with an initial fluoride ion concentration of 10 mg l the optimum conditions for the removal of fluoride on the alcs fe al are alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 1 2 adsorbent dosage 3 g l in fact approximately 224 mg fe i e 4 0 mmol and 78 mg al i e 3 0 mmol can be extracted from 1 g carbonized sludge according to this fact a alcs fe al was obtained based on this preparation condition alcs fe 1 1 alcs fe al 2 1 next 3 g l of the prepared alcs fe al was used for the removal of fluoride in a neutral aqueous solution with an initial fluoride ion concentration of 10 mg l the fluoride removal rate can reach 86 7 the residual fluoride ion concentration is 1 31 mg l 1 50 mg l which is still able to meet the drinking water quality standard 3 2 adsorption and regeneration performance of alcs fe al 3 2 1 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm model is used to study the interaction and adsorption mechanism between solid adsorbent materials and adsorbate at present the two adsorption isotherms are used most widely the langmuir isotherm model and the freundlich isotherm model which can be used to predict the type of adsorption of ions on the adsorbent the langmuir isotherm model illustrates single layer adsorption at the active site of the adsorbent ali 2018 while the freundlich isotherm model assumes that the adsorbent surface is not uniform the adsorption capacity of each adsorption site is unequal and there is an interaction between the adsorbed species lalley et al 2016 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are mathematically expressed as follows 2 the langmuir isotherm model q e k l q m c e k l c e 1 where qe is the amount of adsorbed fluoride in equilibrium mg g qm is the maximum adsorption capacity for fluoride mg g ce is the concentration of fluoride at equilibrium mg l kl is the langmuir equilibrium constant l mg 3 the freundlich isotherm model q e k f c e 1 n where kf is the isothermal constant for the freundlich adsorption capacity mg g n is the adsorption strength for the freundlich isotherm l g by comparison the langmuir isotherm model r2 0 9965 table 2 is more suitable for describing the adsorption process of fluoride on the alcs fe al adsorbent than the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 9108 table 2 therefore the fluoride is adsorbed by the adsorbent through the single layer surface adsorbent indicating that the active site of the material supported on the adsorbent plays an important role in the adsorption of fluoride cai et al 2015 the qe is plotted against ce as shown in fig 5 the adsorption process of the adsorbent adsorbing fluoride is in good agreement with the langmuir model isotherm and the maximum adsorption amount qm is 30 49 mg g 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics we can predict the adsorption rate and understand the mechanism of adsorption of fluoride through adsorption kinetics which is one of the most important characteristics representing adsorption efficiency in this study two kinetic models lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model and lagergren pseudo second order kinetic model were used to describe the kinetics of sorbent adsorption of fluoride the pseudo first order kinetic model 4 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t the pseudo second order kinetic model 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe is the amount of fluoride adsorbed at equilibrium mg g qt is the amount of fluoride adsorbed at a certain moment mg g k1 and k2 are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order reaction rate constants respectively t is reaction time min in contrast the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 9998 table 3 is more suitable than the pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 9636 table 3 to describe the adsorption of fluoride on the alcs fe al adsorbent the kinetics of the adsorbent adsorbing fluoride is in good agreement with the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 6 due to the faster adsorption kinetics of smaller particles badruzzaman et al 2004 the adsorption of fluoride ions was very fast in the first 5 min finally it took about 60 min for the adsorption to reach equilibrium 3 2 3 the effect of competitive co existing anions in this study some typical anions cl hco3 co3 2 so4 2 po4 3 sio3 2 in drinking water were selected to explore the effect of coexisting anions on fluoride removal in water and the ratio of the molar concentration of each ion in the water to the initial molar concentration of the fluoride ion was set to be 1 1 as shown in fig 7 it can be observed that hco3 co3 2 po4 3 sio3 2 have no significant effect on fluoride adsorption while cl and so4 2 were present in the system the amount of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent from the aqueous solution was reduced this may be due to a decrease in the partial adsorption sites of the fluoride which is caused by the adsorption of cl and so4 2 to specific adsorption sites on the surface of the magnetic particles thereby forming competitive adsorption in natural waters other anions may compete with fluoride for adsorption sites causing interference to adsorption and reducing adsorbent removal efficiency dhillon et al 2017 however in general the presence of other coexisting anions in the water has little effect on the adsorption of f indicating that the adsorbent has a higher selectivity for the adsorption of fluoride and is suitable for fluoride removal in natural water environments 3 2 4 regeneration and circulation of the alcs fe al in order to evaluate the reusability of the alcs fe al the fluoride removal rates of the adsorbent were measured in 6 regeneration cycles using methanol as a desorbent it can be seen from fig 8 that although the efficiency of the adsorbent to remove fluoride decreased with the increase of cycle times the residual fluoride content in the water is 1 41 mg l after the adsorbent has been recycled for 6 times which can still meet the standard for safe drinking water it also shows that methanol can regenerate the adsorbent effectively which can be reused in a long period of time and still has a relatively high adsorption efficiency 3 3 characterization results and adsorption mechanism explanation of adsorbent 3 3 1 sem the sem characterization results of the original sludge carbon sc and the prepared alcs fe al are shown in fig 9 by comparing the two images we can observe that sc has a smoother surface and more pores fig 9 a which can provide an attachment site and a larger surface area for the loading of the compounds in addition the fact that the alcs fe al loaded with iron aluminum oxides has a relatively high bet specific surface area of 155 2 m2 g 1 also proves this however the surface of the alcs fe al adsorbent is relatively rough and is filled with spheroidal particles indicating that the surface of the biochar has been loaded with iron aluminum oxides after a series of preparation processes which have high adsorption capacity free active valence and surface energy dhillon and kumar 2015 in addition it can be seen from fig 9 b that the ron aluminum oxides have agglomeration on the surface of the biochar which may be due to the higher surface energy and small size of the magnetic adsorbent 3 3 2 vsm magnetic test the magnetization curve of the prepared the alcs fe al is shown in fig 10 we can observe that the magnetization increases with the increase of the strength of the applied magnetic field and finally reaches the magnetic saturation the composite material has a saturation magnetization of about 32 1 emu g 1 emu g 1 a m2 kg in addition a magnetic adsorbent with a saturation value of 16 3 emu g is sufficient to be separated from the water by a magnet ma et al 2005 therefore the magnetic adsorbent can be separated and recovered from water by the magnetic properties of a magnet 3 3 3 xrd the xrd data of the alcs fe al was analyzed by the jade software after the background value was subtracted as shown in fig 11 by compared with the pdf 2004 standard card the peak position and peak intensity of the tested the alcs fe al are substantially matched to the standard material in addition it can be observed that there are mainly three relatively strong diffraction peaks the derivative peak at 2θ 26 6 corresponds to the characteristic peak of sio2 this is due to the fact that the sludge based carbon contains sio2 which may serve as a bonding point with iron aluminum oxides zarei and saedi 2018 zhang et al 2018 the derivative peak at 2θ 8 7 corresponds to the characteristic peak of al2si2o5 oh 4 hconh2 which indicates that aluminum is likely to exist in the form of aluminum oxide or hydroxide in the adsorbent material which can be combined with other elements such as c o and si etc further the derivative peak at 2θ 35 6 corresponds to the characteristic peak of the magnetic fe3o4 which also explains that the adsorbent has a certain magnetic property however the state and type of fe and al present in the adsorbent can be further confirmed in conjunction with other characterization results and analysis 3 3 4 xps as shown in the full spectrum of xps of the alcs fe al the adsorbent mainly contains elements such as c o s si fe and al before adsorption fig 12 moreover by comparison with the standard xps binding energy table the binding energy of fe2p peak 710 57 ev and al2p peak 74 36 ev in the alcs fe al correspond to fe3o4 and al2o3 respectively combined with the results of previous xrd characterization it can be inferred that fe3o4 and al2o3 are present in the adsorbent in addition the existence form and content of each element in the adsorbent before and after adsorption were comparatively analyzed as shown in table 4 an increase in the f element in the adsorbent after adsorption can be clearly seen which can be more visually observed in fig 13 after adsorption the binding energy of the f1s peak of alcs fe al 685 18 ev is significantly higher than that of naf 684 5 ev clearly indicating the reaction between the adsorbent and the fluoride wu et al 2013 furthermore the atomic ratio of each element of the adsorbent changed before and after adsorption the atomic ratio of fe2p al2p o1s s2p in the alcs fe al decrease significantly after the adsorbent adsorb fluoride while the changes in f1s and c1s are reversed combined with the change in the binding energy of the peaks of these elements before and after adsorption it can be inferred 1 fe f and al f can be formed by the combination of fe and al with f by surface coordination of the adsorbent and this was confirmed in many studies cai et al 2015 chai et al 2013 kuang et al 2017 fe and al are hard acids and have a higher valence state as a high priced metal to provide an orbit for receiving electrons while f is a hard base which has a high electronegativity to provide electrons according to the theory of hard and soft acids and bases the two are easy to combine due to their strong affinity between them 2 the decrease in the atomic ratio of s after adsorption indicates that so4 2 participates in the adsorption of f in water the removal of fluoride is the result of ion exchange through so4 2 and f chai et al 2013 3 it can also be seen that the atomic ratio of o1s is decreased indicating that the oh group is involved in the adsorption of fluoride in fact a part of the hydroxyl group is likely to be derived from sludge based biochar many studies have shown that surface hydroxyl groups participate in the adsorption of fluoride in carbon based adsorbents ajisha and rajagopal 2015 yu et al 2015 in addition the oh group may also be derived from hydroxylated metal oxides because the metal oxide is easily hydrolyzed and hydroxylated in solution to form into m oh x n x anderson and rubin 1982 on the one hand f can be adsorbed by ion exchange with oh in an acidic medium chen et al 2016 on the other hand if the potential of the surface of the particle is lower than the zero potential the hydroxylated metal oxide is easily protonated to change its surface charge to be positive thereby adsorbing the fluoride by electrostatic attraction jadhav et al 2015 3 3 5 the effect of the ph of the solution as an important water chemistry parameter the ph of the aqueous solution has a certain influence on the adsorption of fluoride the 0 01 mol l hcl or naoh was used to adjust the ph of the solution to a range of 4 9 the result shows that the alcs fe al has a positive removal effect on fluoride in water fig 14 which indicates that the adsorbent can be widely used in a wide ph range what s more the surface of the solid particles in the solution will have different charges according to the theory of electrostatic attraction when the ph of the solution is higher than phzpc ph of zero point charge the surface of the particle is negatively charged otherwise it will be positively charged however biochar mainly improves the ph at zero potential phzpc by modifying the biochar with metal oxides or hydroxides thereby increasing the anion exchange capacity and enabling it to be used in a wider ph range of the aqueous solution lawrinenko et al 2017 therefore the phzpc of the alcs fe al mainly depends on the fe3o4 al2o3 contained therein the phzpc of fe3o4 al2o3 is 6 8 prathnaa et al 2018 therefore the surface of the adsorbent has a positive charge in an aqueous solution under acidic conditions while the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged in a medium alkaline condition however we additionally observed changes in the ph of the solution before and after adsorption as shown in table 5 it can be seen that the ph value of the solution increased in the acidic medium after adsorption while the ph value of the solution decreased in the neutral and alkaline medium after adsorption which indicates that the adsorbent has a good buffering capacity in the adsorption process this buffering effect can be explained by the amphoteric nature of the iron aluminum oxide surface in the adsorbent according to the previous investigation of the mechanism of removing fluoride by this adsorbent the metal oxides are easily hydrolyzed and hydroxylated in the solution resulting in the metal ions on the surface layer of the metal oxide having an unsaturated coordination zhang et al 2016 therefore we can infer that the process of buffering the adsorbent can be expressed as follows 6 a l c s m o h a l c s m o h 7 a l c s m o h h a l c s m o h 2 8 a l c s m o h o h a l c s m o h 2 o where m represents the surface metal species alcs represents the acid leaching carbonized sludge as shown in fig 14 we can observe that the adsorption effect of the adsorbent on fluoride is stronger in neutral and alkaline media than in acidic media under acidic conditions the adsorption may be based on electrostatic attraction under alkaline conditions as the ph of the solution increased the zeta potential on the surface of the adsorbent decreased which can weaken the electrostatic attraction of fluoride as shown in equation 9 hydroxylated metal oxides loaded on the surface of the alcs are prone to protonation in neutral and alkaline media if the potential of the surface of the particle is lower than the zero potential jadhav et al 2015 when the effect is sufficient to change the surface charge to be positive the fluoride can be adsorbed by the action of electrostatic attraction moreover combined with xps characterization analysis results there is a surface coordination between high valent metals fe al and f with high electronegativity therefore ligand exchange can be achieved by utilizing the surface coordination kuang et al 2017 the two mechanism occurred in two step protonation ligand exchange 9 a l c s m h 2 o a l c s m o h 2 10 a l c s m o h 2 f a l c s m f h 2 o 11 a l c s m o h f a l c s m f o h where m represents the surface metal species alcs represents the acid leaching carbonized sludge although electrostatic adsorption can play a role in the adsorption process the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of the ph in fluoride containing solution which indicates that electrostatic adsorption is not the main adsorption mechanism therefore as a whole the adsorption mechanism of the alcs fe al to remove fluoride is mainly the result of simultaneous action of ligand exchange surface coordination between the metal and f electrostatic adsorption and ion exchange 4 conclusion in this study a novel adsorbent alcs fe al with magnetic separation for removing fluoride in drinking water was prepared by combining the alcs with iron and aluminum salts extracted from the dwts the adsorbent has good stability and high magnetic strength and is easily separated from the solution the results show that the fluoride concentration of the fluoride containing aqueous solution 10 mg l can be reduced to less than 1 50 mg l by the adsorption of alcs fe al which meets the internationally prescribed drinking water quality standards the kinetic study shows that the adsorption process of fluoride on alcs fe al follows the lagergren pseudo first order kinetic model the adsorption isotherm is consistent with the langmuir model and the adsorption capacity is 30 49 mg g furthermore fe3o4 al2o3 and abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of alcs fe al act as active sites for fluoride adsorption the adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent to remove fluoride is mainly the result of simultaneous action of ligand exchange surface coordination electrostatic adsorption and ion exchange in addition the adsorbent can be used in a wide range of ph 4 9 and has a certain buffering capacity for changes in the ph of the solution the presence of aqueous anionic anions has a slight effect on the removal of fluoride on the alcs fe al consequently the adsorbent can be widely applied to the removal of fluoride for drinking water moreover the alcs fe al can be easily and quickly regenerated with methanol as a desorbent the adsorption efficiency is still high after 6 regeneration cycles this research not only provides a new way for the recycling of sludge but also a new method for fluoride removal from drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors of this paper feng jing bai hui xue yudan zhang rui zhu puli bu duo dan zeng li wei and lu xuebin

12093,the groundwater levels in the non command areas of east godavari e g district of andhra pradesh state india are gradually plummeting over the years to estimate the impact of excessive use of groundwater and to suggest appropriate water management strategies a regional groundwater flow model has been constructed for a watershed of 50 km2 namely kondakalava watershed a non command area which is composed of khondalitic in the northern part and sandstones in the southern part formations the groundwater flow model has revealed that the sandstone aquifer is experiencing huge aquifer stress due to heavy pumping rates high well density etc if the present rate of pumping continued by 1 increase in every year the sandstone aquifer is going to be dried in the future year 2036 by encountering the drawdown of 12 m whereas the khondalitic aquifer sustains with the minimum drawdown of 4 m without producing the dry cells up to the future year 2040 the higher recharge conditions and decreased pumping rates are helped for rising future groundwater levels by nearly 4 m in sandstone formation hence it is suggested that the runoff can be injected by deep tube wells in sandstone aquifer the new ponds are to be constructed in order to improve the water table conditions of sandstone aquifer and the diversion of the water can be made from the newly proposed canal which is passing nearby watershed in the watershed two zones are identified to connect the existing ponds in order to improve the recharge conditions in the sandstone formation graphical abstract image 1

godavari e g district a p consists of sandstone and khondalitic suit of formations which is non command area with very less surface water resources and the groundwater is the only source for irrigation needs cgwb 2013 the groundwater levels in many parts of the non command areas in the district have dropped to alarming levels in recent years cgwb 2013 and hence there is a need to augment groundwater resources the decline of groundwater levels is continuously reporting in many parts of the non command area of the district as well as in the kondakalava watershed in view of heavy pumping in the recent years observed groundwater levels in the khondalitic and sandstone formations of the watershed are taken from andhra pradesh state government web site https core ap gov in cmdashboard index aspx the groundwater level depletion during the last six years during premonsoon may found to be 7 m and 6 m below ground level bgl in khondalite and sandstone formations respectively and shown in fig 1 a and b the rainfall histogram fig 1 c of e g district has shown that the average annual rainfall of more than 1000 mm is occured during the water years 2011 12 to 2017 18 based on these statistics the declining trend of groundwater levels in the watershed is not due to the rainfall pattern and it is mainly due to the higher abstractions hence the present study helps to understand the causes for depletion of groundwater levels in two different formations and also for accounting the groundwater budget within the watershed many numerical models such as groundwater flow modeling tools

ouazar 2011 one of the major outcomes of numerical groundwater flow models is the identification of recharge and discharge areas in the flow regime the simulation of transient groundwater flow model

regional groundwater systems and also helped to take the decisions on water resources management yao et al 2015 in accordance with the good calibrated model the remedial measures have been suggested by al salamah et al 2011 in the places of high drawdowns the groundwater model using modflow has been employed by banejad et al 2014 to forecast changes in groundwater systems and flow patterns of the nahavand plain aquifer located in iran the dynamics of groundwater due to heavy pumping from tehran aquifer are studied by karimi et al 2019 this study highlighted the capability of the groundwater flow modeling using visual modflow and predicted the aquifer hydraulic head distribution and its changes the simulation of a three dimensional groundwater flow modflow and solute transport model mt3d

to forecast the groundwater table under different abstraction strategies and also to identify the over stressed areas within the watershed covered with khondalitic terrain siva prasad et al 2020 groundwater flow model using visual modflow has been used by patil and chetan 2017 for the hiranyakeshi watershed of ghataprabha sub basin maharashtra karnataka formed by deccan traps sandstones and quartzite with two conceptual layers the modeling results showed that for the next 10 years the water table would decrease more than 50 m in the study area and they suggested that the present draft should be reduced by nearly 50 to overcome the critical stage of groundwater decline groundwater flow models calculate the rate and movement of groundwater through aquifers and confining layers in the subsurface sunderarajan and sankaran 2020 keeping in view of the advantage of groundwarer flow modeling as a tool the kondakalava watershed in the suddagedda basin a p india has been chosen to analyze the impact of excessive pumping of groundwater and also to formulate water managment strategies to protect groundwater table decline in kondalite and sandstone formations 2 study area the total catchment area of the suddagedda river basin is 658 km2 located in the non command upland area of e g district since the development of groundwater is not uniform throughout the basin a watershed having high groundwater withdrawal namely kondakalava 50 km2 is delineated in the suddagedda river basin fig 2 to estimate the impact of excessive use of groundwater and to suggest appropriate water management strategies in order to improve the recharge conditions the kondakalava stream has joined in the left flank of the suddagedda river the drainage pattern in the watershed is dendritic sandstone formations and khondalites occupy southern and northern parts of the kondakalva watershed respectively nih 2000 the kondakalava watershed lies between north latitudes 17010 30 n and 17015 00 n and east longitudes 82014 00 e and 82019 00 e the average annual rainfall of the e g district is 1060 mm the watershed represents in non command area of the e g district with the elevation above mean sea level a m s l in the range of 6 m to 157 m fig 2 the basin has a general slope towards south southeast the watershed area falls under tropical climate with hot summers and cold winters 3 conceptualization of the model the map of the kondakalava watershed along with observation wells is shown in fig 3 a the size of the each grid cell in the watershed taken as 100 m 100 m and it contains 70 rows and 70 columns based on the geology and lithological information the kondakalava watershed has two formations the northern portion of the basin is covered by the khondalites and the southern portion is mainly occupied by sandstone formations in the north portion highly weathered khondalite laid above the fractured khondalite nih 2000 in the southern part of the watershed two distinct sandstone formations laid one above the other thin rajahmundry sandstones on top surface underlain by thick tirupathi sandstones a two layer model has been constructed for the watershed the second layer is more saturated than the first layer in both the formations in northern khondalites and southern part sandstones the thickness of first layer consists of 15 25 m followed by 30 120 m second layer the maximum thickness of vertical section in khondalitic and sandstone formations is 45 m and 145 m bgl respectively fig 3 b the pre monsoon may 2018 groundwater levels of 6 observation wells fig 3 have been measured in the watershed the minimum groundwater level of 3 m bgl and 22 m bgl is observed in the khondalitic and in the sandstone aquifer respectively fig 4 more than 260 tube wells are existed in the watershed out of which nearly 200 tube wells are in the sandstone formation with higher abstraction rates and the remaining tube wells are in kondalite formation all over the watershed the abstraction rates of selected tube wells in each village are calculated in liters per second on the basis of pumping duration 6 h per day the appropriate pumping rates are assisgned for the pumping wells of each village the distribution of pumping wells in the model is shown in fig 5 according to the water balance studies of the suddegedda basin nih 1993 initially 10 of annual rainfall applied as rainfall recharge to all the zones in the watershed model since the watershed is formed with two different formations the groundwater recharge rates are not uniform throughout the watershed therefore the historical well hydrographs 2016 2018 in these two formations are analysed to understand the recharge conditions of different aquifers of the watershed annually even though deeper groundwater levels up to 27 m bgl are being existed in every pre monsoon season in the sandstone aquifer than khondalitic aquifer the sandstone aquifer is being more recharged than khondalitic aquifer during monsoon season fig 6 hence in the model more groundwater recharge is assigned for the sandstone aquifer than khondalitic aquifer during steady state calibration apart from the cropping pattern return flows also play a significant role on recharge hence depending on recharge conditions and return flows three recharge zones 130 mm year 190 mm year and 170 mm year are considered in the first layer of simulated model and are shown in fig 5 for calculation of the potential evapotranspiration pet in the basin the thornthwaite 1948 method is used the pet is estimated in the basin as 200 mm year the actual evapotranspiration aet is estimated from the pet the average aet value of 120 mm year for a depth of 1 m based on the type of soil plants and crops are taken into consideration in the entire watershed siva prasad and satyaji rao 2018 that means 1 m below the ground surface no evapotranspiration rate takes place and it is 120 mm year at the ground surface based on saturated conditions the higher conductivity values are assigned for the second layers than the first layers the simulated hydraulic conductivities of the first and second layers of both formations are shown in fig 7 the main stream kondakalava has been simulated with river boundary conditions varying from 20 m to 7 m amsl the elevation difference of 0 5 m is assigned to river stage and river bed bottom elevation for all appropriate grids 4 results and discussion the model is calibrated against input parameters during many sequential runs until the best match between the observed and calculated water level contours for the year 2018 are obtained fig 8 the average groundwater velocity in the watershed is obtained as 0 2 m d from the water balance analysis of the watershed it is identified that the groundwater abstraction is 68 of annual groundwater recharge table 1 and the majority of the abstractions are from sandstone aquifer more than 200 pumping wells with deeper depths of nearly 150 m are existed in a sandstone formation whereas 60 tube wells are presented in the khondalitic rock formation with 60 90 m depth the pumping rates of tube wells nearly 700 m3 day in the sandstone aquifer are also higher than the pumping rates nearly 400 m3 day in the khondalitic rock aquifer hence during steady and transient state calibrations it is observed that the tube wells falling in the sandstone aquifer southern part are dried up and no well is dried in khondalitic aquifer fig 9 by the present abstractions hence the groundwater levels in the sandstone aquifer are affected significantly due to higher abstraction rates for agricultural activities two possible scenarios are studied with the help of steady state calibration and simulations are made for the next 20 years 2020 2040 to assess the effects of different abstraction rates on future groundwater levels and drawdowns in the watershed case 1 increasing the abstraction rate by 1 with present recharge rates in this scenario it is assumed that there is an increase in the present groundwater extraction rates by 1 every year until the end of year 2040 thus the extraction rates are increased by 20 for the future year 2040 the drawdown values change of hydraulic head for every 5 year period is shown in table 2 this scenario can be observed in the sandstone aquifer that when compared with groundwater levels of the year 2019 there will be a decline of groundwater levels by 12 m up to the future year 2035 and those will be dried from the year 2036 table 2 it is also observed in table 2 that in khondalitic aquifer there would be 4 m decline in groundwater levels up to the future year 2040 and no wells would be dried up in the northern part of the watershed the groundwater levels of khondalitic aquifer are not affected significantly in this scenario hence the drawdown values of sandstone aquifer are only considered for further analysis the future drawdown values of the sandstone aquifer for every 5 years have been shown in fig 9 if present rates of abstraction are continued by 1 every year in sandstone aquifer as high as 12 m drawdown is observed in the year 2035 fig 10 due to increase of new tube wells abstraction rates in future it is also observed that the sandstone aquifer could only sustain up to the year 2035 and further increase of abstraction rates resulting the formation of dry cells from the year 2036 case 2 decreasing abstraction rate by 1 and increasing the recharge rates in the model it is observed that for every future year decreasing the abstraction rates by 1 has not helped in rising the groundwater levels hence the more recharge rates are given and pumping rates have decreased by 1 annually this scenario has helped in the sandstone aquifer for improving water levels by nearly 4 m fig 10 in this scenario in sandstone aquifer low hydraulic heads are maintained table 2 and dry cells are also not appeared till the end of the year 2040 4 1 management plans it is observed from the above analysis that if the present abstraction rates are increased by 1 annually throughout the watershed 12 m drawdown will be encountered in sandstone aquifer in the future year 2035 and the aquifer will be dried from the year 2036 this situation could create a groundwater crisis in future and needs few important management plans in this aquifer the optimal use of water can be achieved by the following measures 4 1 1 installation of low capacity of submersible motors it is observed from the southern part of watershed that the tube wells are being extracted by using very high capacity of 25 horse power hp submersible motors from the deeper depths with the pumping rates of nearly 700 m3 day this capacity of motors should be restricted to lower capacities for present future tube wells to not to get further depletion of groundwater levels in these villages by improving water use efficiency the pumping rates of present and future tube wells should be restricted from installing lower capacity of motors 5 hp in order to increase the life of the sandstone aquifer by at least 30 4 1 2 reviving the surface water bodies with the evidence of field observations in sandstone aquifer the present situation of all dug wells are already dried up due to higher abstraction rates and the model is producing dry cells even for small reductions of recharge the existing surface water bodies such as ponds are to be developed wherever possible the new ponds are to be constructed in order to improve the water table conditions of sandstone aquifer runoff augmentation is also to be used to revive the surface water bodies more wisely and this runoff can be injected by deep tube wells in sandstone aquifer or diversion of the water can be made from the new proposed canal which is passing nearby watershed 4 1 3 interconnecting the existing ponds the new network of both ponds and feeder channels are to be created and connected from northern part of southern part of watershed to utilize the available surface and groundwater resources in the watershed the interconnection of ponds is needed on a priority basis according to the dry cells appearing in the model according to the appearance of dry cells in the model zone 1 and zone 2 is identified where there is no interconnectivity of existing ponds fig 11 hence in the watershed two zones are identified nearby dry cells areas where there is a chance to connect the existing ponds in order to improve the recharge conditions and also to improve the surface water resources 5 conclusions groundwater flow model is set up for the kondakalava watershed with two aquifer layers and suitable boundary conditions ggroundwater levels for steady and unsteady state conditions are simulated successfully and found that the total groundwater abstraction by pumping wells is about 68 of total groundwater recharge the groundwater levels of sandstone aquifer in the southern part of the basin are declined due to over usage of deep tube wells with higher abstraction rates the groundwater levels are not affected significantly for the present rate of abstraction rates in khondalitic aquifer and there would be a decline of 4 m in groundwater levels in the future year 2040 as high as 12 m drawdown would be encountered in the year 2035 due to the probable increase of 1 abstraction rates by the new tube wells in sandstone aquifer resulting the formation of dry cells from the year 2036 in order to overcome this critical situation in the sandstone formation the higher recharge conditions as well as lower abstraction rates are helped to rise the water levels by 4 m the suggested water management plans are to be effectively applied in order to improve the water table conditions in the watershed the runoff can be injected by deep tube wells for the optimal use of water in sandstone aquifer in order to minimize the present and future higher groundwater abstractions the submersible motors should be restricted to lower capacities two possible zones are identified where there is no interconnectivity of existing ponds and where there is a chance to connect the existing ponds to increase the recharge conditions and also to improve the surface water resources in the sandstone aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors have no affiliation with any organization with a direct or

12093,the groundwater levels in the non command areas of east godavari e g district of andhra pradesh state india are gradually plummeting over the years to estimate the impact of excessive use of groundwater and to suggest appropriate water management strategies a regional groundwater flow model has been constructed for a watershed of 50 km2 namely kondakalava watershed a non command area which is composed of khondalitic in the northern part and sandstones in the southern part formations the groundwater flow model has revealed that the sandstone aquifer is experiencing huge aquifer stress due to heavy pumping rates high well density etc if the present rate of pumping continued by 1 increase in every year the sandstone aquifer is going to be dried in the future year 2036 by encountering the drawdown of 12 m whereas the khondalitic aquifer sustains with the minimum drawdown of 4 m without producing the dry cells up to the future year 2040 the higher recharge conditions and decreased pumping rates are helped for rising future groundwater levels by nearly 4 m in sandstone formation hence it is suggested that the runoff can be injected by deep tube wells in sandstone aquifer the new ponds are to be constructed in order to improve the water table conditions of sandstone aquifer and the diversion of the water can be made from the newly proposed canal which is passing nearby watershed in the watershed two zones are identified to connect the existing ponds in order to improve the recharge conditions in the sandstone formation graphical abstract image 1

rainfall applied as rainfall recharge to all the zones in the watershed model since the watershed is formed with two different formations the groundwater recharge rates are not uniform throughout the watershed therefore the historical well hydrographs 2016 2018 in these two formations are analysed to understand the recharge conditions of different aquifers of the watershed annually even though deeper groundwater levels up to 27 m bgl are being existed in every pre monsoon season in the sandstone aquifer than khondalitic aquifer the sandstone aquifer is being more recharged than khondalitic aquifer during monsoon season fig 6 hence in the model more groundwater recharge is assigned for the sandstone aquifer than khondalitic aquifer during steady state calibration apart from the cropping pattern return flows also play a significant role on recharge hence depending on recharge conditions and return flows three recharge zones 130 mm year 190 mm year and 170 mm year are considered in the

elevation for all appropriate grids 4 results and discussion the model is calibrated against input parameters during many sequential runs until the best match between the observed and calculated water level contours for the year 2018 are obtained fig 8 the average groundwater velocity in the watershed is obtained as 0 2 m d from the water balance analysis of the watershed it is identified that the groundwater abstraction is 68 of annual groundwater recharge table 1 and the majority of the abstractions are from sandstone aquifer more than 200 pumping wells with deeper depths of nearly 150 m are existed in a sandstone formation whereas 60 tube wells are presented in the khondalitic rock formation with 60 90 m depth the pumping rates of tube wells nearly 700 m3 day in the sandstone aquifer are also higher than the pumping rates nearly 400 m3 day in the khondalitic rock aquifer hence during steady and transient state calibrations it is observed that the tube wells falling in the sandstone aquifer southern part are dried up and no well is dried in khondalitic aquifer fig 9 by the present abstractions hence the groundwater levels in the sandstone aquifer are affected significantly due to higher abstraction rates for agricultural activities two possible scenarios are studied with the help of steady state calibration and simulations are made for the next 20 years 2020 2040 to assess the effects of different abstraction rates on future groundwater levels and drawdowns in the watershed case 1 increasing the abstraction rate by 1 with present recharge rates in this scenario it is assumed that there is an increase in the present groundwater extraction rates by 1 every year until the end of year 2040 thus the extraction rates are increased by 20 for the future year 2040 the drawdown values change of hydraulic head for every 5 year period is shown in table 2 this scenario can be observed in the sandstone aquifer that when compared with groundwater levels of the year 2019 there will be a decline of groundwater levels by 12 m up to the future year 2035 and those will be dried from the year 2036 table 2 it is also observed in table 2 that in khondalitic aquifer there would be 4 m decline in groundwater levels up to the future year 2040 and no wells would be dried up in the northern part of the watershed the groundwater levels of khondalitic aquifer are not affected significantly in this scenario hence the drawdown values of sandstone aquifer are only considered for further analysis the future drawdown values of the sandstone aquifer for every 5 years have been shown in fig 9 if present rates of abstraction are continued by 1 every year in sandstone aquifer as high as 12 m drawdown is observed in the year 2035 fig 10 due to increase of new tube wells abstraction rates in future it is also observed that the sandstone aquifer could only sustain up to the year 2035 and further increase of abstraction rates resulting the formation of dry cells from the year 2036 case 2 decreasing abstraction rate by 1 and increasing the recharge rates in the model it is observed that for every future year decreasing the abstraction rates by 1 has not helped in rising the groundwater levels hence the more recharge rates are given and pumping rates have decreased by 1 annually this scenario has helped in the sandstone aquifer for improving water levels by nearly 4 m fig 10 in this scenario in sandstone aquifer low hydraulic heads are maintained table 2 and dry cells are also not appeared till the end of the year 2040 4 1 management plans it is observed from the above analysis that if the present abstraction rates are increased by 1 annually throughout the watershed 12 m drawdown will be encountered in sandstone aquifer in the future year 2035 and the aquifer will be dried from the year 2036 this situation could create a groundwater crisis in future and needs few important management plans in this aquifer the optimal use of water can be achieved by the following measures 4 1 1 installation of low capacity of submersible motors it is observed from the southern part of watershed that the tube wells are being extracted by using very high capacity of 25 horse power hp submersible motors from the deeper depths with the pumping rates of nearly 700 m3 day this capacity of motors should be restricted to lower capacities for present future tube wells to not to get further depletion of groundwater levels in these villages by improving water use efficiency the pumping rates of present and future tube wells should be restricted from installing lower capacity of motors 5 hp in order to increase the life of the sandstone aquifer by at least 30 4 1 2 reviving the surface water bodies with the evidence of field observations in sandstone aquifer the present situation of all dug wells are already dried up due to higher abstraction rates and the model is producing dry cells even for small reductions of recharge the existing surface water bodies such as ponds are to be developed wherever possible the new ponds are to be constructed in order to improve the water table conditions of sandstone aquifer runoff augmentation is also to be used to revive the surface water bodies more wisely and this runoff can be injected by deep tube wells in sandstone aquifer or diversion of the water can be made from the new proposed canal which is passing nearby watershed 4 1 3 interconnecting the existing ponds the new network of both ponds and feeder channels are to be created and connected from northern part of southern part of watershed to utilize the available surface and groundwater resources in the watershed the interconnection of ponds is needed on a priority basis according to the dry cells appearing in the model according to the appearance of dry cells in the model zone 1 and zone 2 is identified where there is no interconnectivity of existing ponds fig 11 hence in the watershed two zones are identified nearby dry cells areas where there is a chance to connect the existing ponds in order to improve the recharge conditions and also to improve the surface water resources 5 conclusions groundwater flow model is set up for the kondakalava watershed with two aquifer layers and suitable boundary conditions ggroundwater levels for steady and unsteady state conditions are simulated successfully and found that the total groundwater abstraction by pumping wells is about 68 of total groundwater recharge the groundwater levels of sandstone aquifer in the southern part of the basin are declined due to over usage of deep tube wells with higher abstraction rates the groundwater levels are not affected significantly for the present rate of abstraction rates in khondalitic aquifer and there would be a decline of 4 m in groundwater levels in the future year 2040 as high as 12 m drawdown would be encountered in the year 2035 due to the probable increase of 1 abstraction rates by the new tube wells in sandstone aquifer resulting the formation of dry cells from the year 2036 in order to overcome this critical situation in the sandstone formation the higher recharge conditions as well as lower abstraction rates are helped to rise the water levels by 4 m the suggested water management plans are to be effectively applied in order to improve the water table conditions in the watershed the runoff can be injected by deep tube wells for the optimal use of water in sandstone aquifer in order to minimize the present and future higher groundwater abstractions the submersible motors should be restricted to lower capacities two possible zones are identified where there is no interconnectivity of existing ponds and where there is a chance to connect the existing ponds to increase the recharge conditions and also to improve the surface water resources in the sandstone aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors have no affiliation with any organization with a direct or

12094,the use of large diameter hand dug wells as main source of rural water supply for drinking domestic and irrigation uses in many developing countries has offer an opportunity to developed darcy based methods for estimating hydraulic conductivity in screened lined large diameter hand dug wells to determine the yield and discharge potential of the wells however in many rural areas of sub saharan african countries the use of un screened concrete lining is most common method of protecting large diameter hand dug wells against collapsing and pollution due to the affordability of the method the use of un screened concrete lining prevents horizontal water flow to the well and inflow of water in un screened concrete well occur through well base therefore existing darcy based method not suitable to estimate hydraulic conductivity for this well design this study proposed a new method for estimating aquifer hydraulic conductivity for un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells to demonstrate the viability of the new method field recovery tests were conducted in twelve 12 un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells to estimate apparent hydraulic conductivity ka of aquifer formation the twelve 12 un screened concrete wells were screened for the second round of recovery tests to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k the results showed that the estimated apparent hydraulic conductivity ka values were lower than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity k values and this show effect of un screened concrete lining a relationship between ka and k was established to make a correction factor for estimation of k from ka by a regression analysis which showed a linear regression of 0 78 with a significant strong relationship of 0 00 between ka and k using a bivariate pearson correlation coefficient the new method will be useful to determine well yield most especially in the rural areas of developing countries where un screened

particularly in sub saharan africa today this region accounts for about 40 of the water stress globally united nations 2018 groundwater serves as the most affordable means of meeting the ever increasing demands of water resources in the rural areas for different purposes such as drinking domestic and agricultural uses groundwater development has reduced poverty and promote sustainable livelihood in many rural communities particularly in the sub saharan african countries calow et al 2002 the most affordable way of accessing groundwater in the rural areas for drinking domestic and irrigation uses is through large diameter hand dug wells large diameter hand dug wells are suited to unconsolidated formations which make it easy to excavate by using manual methods and can be installed in any kind of formation where manual excavation is possible therefore it is possible to say that in some good hydrogeological situations large diameter hand dug wells can be cost effective and cheaper to excavate and give good yield like borehole some good examples of these include alluvial aquifers where the water bearing alluvial deposits are basically unconsolidated and can be excavated manually these also goes for weathered basement aquifers the depths of the large diameter hand dug wells are mostly varying depending on the hydrogeological geohydrological situations and water needs of the concerned area gomo et al 2019 though some developed countries have changed to modernised water system by constructing boreholes but large diameter hand dug wells are still used in rural areas of developing countries aina and oshunrinade 2016 gipson and singer 1969 gomo et al 2019 1999 rushton and de silva 2016 as shown in fig 1 large diameter hand dug well construction includes the use of curb lining such as brick rock and concrete to protect the well against collapsing the lining is screened to allow horizontal water flow to the well and increase the well yield for the screened hand dug wells standard recovery methods were developed based on darcy s law darcy 1856 to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity that used to determine aquifer yield and well discharge these includes the work of boulton and streltsova 1976 herbert and kitching 1981 macdonald et al 2008 papadopulos and cooper 1967 rupp et al 2011 rupp et al 2011 rushton de silva 2016 uribe et al 2014 the use of un screened concrete lining in protecting large diameter hand dug well fig 2 has been a most common method of lining in many rural areas of developing sub saharan african countries due to the simplicity of the method and affordable materials involved the use of un screened concrete lining prevents horizontal water flow to the well and inflow of water occur through well base fig 3 a this make darcy based method for screened lined well fig 3b not suitable to be used for this well design based on reviewed of existing methods for estimating aquifer hydraulic conductivity in hand dug wells it is possible to argue that the estimation of aquifer hydraulic conductivity in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells have not been covered in previous research studies this study proposed a new method for estimating hydraulic conductivity in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka was determined through which horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation was estimated 2 method development fig 4 shows the flow in an unconfined aquifer for un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug well with the basic components of the proposed equation for estimation of ka of the aquifer formation in an unscreened concrete lined large diameter hand dug well the derivation of groundwater flow starts from darcy s law darcy 1856 the darcy s law is a simple proportional relationship between the instantaneous inflow outflow rate through a porous medium the viscosity of the fluid and the pressure drop over a given distance the flow into the well q at a particular value of y can be determined from darcy s law we get 1 q k i a in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug well the water flows to the well through the uncemented well base therefore the area providing water to the well is given as a π r 2 from fig 4 above rc is the inside radius of the concrete lined well m rw is the distance from the well centre to the original aquifer or the inside radius plus the thickness of the concrete lining m y is the vertical distance between the water level in the well and equilibrium water table in the aquifer y is ho h where ho is the equilibrium water

above where ho is the equilibrium water table in aquifer m h is the water level in the well m y is the vertical distance between the water level in the well and equilibrium water table in the aquifer m from above 8 y q π r w k a ln r e r w the inflow of water to the well q at a particular value of y for unscreened concrete lined large diameter hand dug well can be calculated as 9 q π r w k a y l n r e r w where q is the inflow of water to the well length3 time ka is the apparent hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer length time y is the vertical distance between the water level in the well and the equilibrium water table in the aquifer l re is the effective radius over which y is dissipated l rw is distance from well centre to the original aquifer l the terms y re and rw are expressed in units of length in a large diameter hand dug well when the water level in the well is lowered the recovery or rate of rise dy dt of the water level back to the initial or pretest level is related to the inflow q herbert and kitching 1981 rushton and holt 1981 given as 10 d y d t q π r c 2 where q is the inflow of water to the well l y is the head change l t is the time t rc is the inner radius of the well l from eq 9 above where π r w k a y ln r e r w by inserting equation 9 into equation 10 and integrate a working equation will be derived to determine apparent hydraulic conductivity ka for an un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug well as follows combining eq 9 and eq 10 and integrate 11 1 y d y k a r w r c 2 ln r e r w d t integrated eq 11 12 l n y k a r w t r c 2 ln r e r w c

t ln yo yt will also be constant equation 16 requires plotting a recovery curve as y on log scale against t on linear scale using a semi log graph where y is the recovery drawdown and t is the time taken then to identify the slope where the relationship is approximately linear however due to the inaccessibility to an electric resistance network analogue and also for the fact that a resistance network could not simulate or account for unsaturated conditions which are important for large diameter hand dug wells in unconfined aquifers where unsaturated soil properties are considered as important factors ln r e r w is therefore determined using the empirical equation developed by rupp et al 2011 rupp et al 2011 and uribe et al 2014 this will improve the estimations of apparent hydraulic conductivity by accounting for the unsaturated zone and useful in the developing areas of the world where there is no access to software for numerical analysis the equation was specifically based on the textural characteristics of the soil rock materials surrounding the aquifer 17 ln r e r w c 1 c 2 l n λ d r 2 1 c 3 d d d 1 2 d r 5 8 the capillary parameter λ in the equation is a function of water retention of soil materials in the well unsaturated zone surrounding the aquifer which was determined in the laboratory from textural properties of the soil rock materials and interpreted using soil s water retention properties rupp et al 2011 2011 i e for an unconsolidated soil rock media c 1 c 2 and c 3 are constants for units in metres c 1 1 839 c 2 0 209 and c 3 1 614 the estimated ka using the proposed equation is relatively a low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer formation because the flow into the well is not horizontal there will be a reduce in flow due to energy loss also there will be a time difference in recharge through the base of the well and the direction of the flow moves against the force of gravity to account for the gaps in the stated above facts the horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer formation will be determined based on darcy s law using bouwer and rice 1976 method which will take into account the horizontal flow into the well the estimated k is expected to reflect true flow characteristics of the aquifer formation 3 application of the proposed method to test the viability of the proposed method the field recovery tests were conducted in twelve 12 un screened concrete wells in two stages the first recovery tests were conducted in un screened concrete wells to determine apparent hydraulic conductivity ka fig 6 and then screening was added for the second recovery tests to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k fig 7 the study was carried out in the rural areas of ilorin northcentral nigeria as shown in fig 5 the well radius well depth and static water of the wells were recorded before the commencement of the field test as presented in table 1 these included the well depth m referred to as the distance from the land surface to the bottom of the well rc called the radius of the unscreened part of the well where the head is rising m and rw is the distance from the centre of the well to the undisturbed aquifer these wells are concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells having depths between 8 6 m and 10 6 m and well radius ranges from 0 68 m to 0 78 m 3 1 field recovery tests to achieve this objective the field tests were conducted by pumping the wells to draw the water level down the pump was then turned off while the well was monitored up to 90 of recovery since the aquifer was unconfined the water level in the well was lowered to no more than 10 of the aquifer thickness herbert and kitching 1981 mace 1999 the measured recovery water level at specific time interval was used to calculate the recovery drawdown as shown in table 2 and table 3 while the recovery drawdown time data in un screened and screened wells were used to estimate apparent hydraulic conductivity ka and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer formation 4 results and discussions the calculated recovery drawdown y m from the field recovery tests conducted in un screened and screened wells are presented in tables 2 and 3 below 4 1 analysis of recovery drawdown trends the recovery drawdown obtained un screened and screened wells were plotted on direct linear regression graphs as shown in fig 8 the well recovery is proportional to the flow rate of the well and increases as the flow of the well increases in screened wells k groundwater enters the well with a minimal amount of energy loss and well recovery after pumping is generally rapid and may sometimes exhibit near full recovery up to the static water level conversely in un screened wells ka exhibits excessive energy losses and well recovery and the time after pumping is slower 4 2 estimation of the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka to estimate the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka the calculated recovery drawdown data was plotted against recovery drawdown time derived from equation 16 above k rc rw and re are constants and 1 t ln yo yt is also constant therefore it is required that the recovery drawdown y is plotted against time t on a semi log graph drawdown on the logarithmic and time on a linear scale a best fit straight line through the set of data points was plotted the straight line plotted was also used to calculate the value of 1 t ln yo yt fig 9 shows a semi log plot of recovery drawdown against time in well 5 for ka estimation the values obtained from the plotted curves along with other well parameters were substituted into the proposed equation 16 as derived above in order to estimate the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka of the aquifer formation in concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells from equation 16 above i e k a r c 2 ln r e r w r w 1 t l n y o y t where rc is radius of the unscreened part of the well at which the head is rising m rw is called the distance from the well centre to undisturbed aquifer m t is the time taken min the straight line plotted was used to evaluate 1 t ln yo yt yo is the water depth below water table at beginning of test yt is the depth to water or drawdown at time t re is the radial distance over which the difference in head is dissipated in the flow system of the aquifer to calculate the radial distance re the equation of rupp et al 2011 and uribe et al 2014 for a large diameter well was used as given in equation 17 above from equation 17 above i e ln r e r w c 1 c 2 l n λ a r 2 1 c 3 d a d 1 2 a r 5 8 where r is well radius m c1 c2 and c3 are constants m a is the well base for recharge m d is distance from the water table to the well base m the calculated effective radius re for the tested wells is presented in table 4 while table 5 shows the calculated data from equation 17 for the twelve concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells 4 3 estimation of horizontal hydraulic conductivity k from apparent hydraulic conductivity ka the horizontal hydraulic conductivity k was determined which take into account the horizontal flow into the well following the darcy s law 1856 the k is expected to give a true reflection of flow characteristics of the aquifer formation to achieve the above objective the method of bouwer and rice 1976 developed for an unconfined aquifer of large diameter wells was considered following the field recovery tests conducted in screened wells as discussed above the recovery field tests were equivalent to slug tests of bouwer and rice 1976 because the pumping period tp to lower the water level in the well was short when compared with recovery period herbert and kitching 1981 rushton and holt 1981 mace 1999 the measured recovery water levels at specific time intervals were used to calculate the recovery drawdown as shown in table 3 above to estimate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity k the calculated recovery drawdown data was plotted against time fig 10 according to bouwer and rice 1976 the k rc rw re and le are constants and 1 t ln yo yt is also constant therefore on a semi log paper the recovery drawdown y was plotted against time t recovery drawdown on the logarithmic and time on a linear scale then a best fit straight line was made through the set of data points plotted fig 10 shows a semi plot of recovery drawdown against time for well 7 the straight line plotted was used to calculate values for the 1 t ln yo yt the values obtained from the plotted curves along with other well properties were substituted into the bouwer and rice 1976 equation 18 to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer formation for screened wells 18 k r c 2 ln r e r w 2 l e 1 t l n y o y t where k true hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation m day rc inner well radius m rw distance from the well centre to the undisturbed aquifer m le length of the screen or open portion of the well m t time taken s yo well water depth below water table at the beginning of test m yt depth to water or drawdown at time t m re is the radial distance over which the difference in head is dissipated in the flow system of the aquifer bouwer and rice 1976 determined the values of re experimentally using a resistance network analogue for different values of rw lw le and d the lw the length of the well in aquifer was equal to the distance from the water table to the bottom of the well d fig 10 the effective radius re was calculated using equation 19 according to bouwer and rice 1976 19 l n r e r w 1 1 l n l w r w c l e r w 1 le rw from equation 19 was obtained from the curve generated by bouwer and rice 1976 as shown in fig 11 the calculated effective radius re for screened wells is presented in table 6 the calculated data from the curves and estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation in screened wells using bouwer and rice 1976 method is shown in table 7 the estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation using the bouwer and rice 1976 method in table 7 shows that the estimated k values are higher than the ka values as compared in table 8 this is reasonable considering the difference in flow pattern between the wells descriptive statistical correlation was determined between the estimated ka and k values taken at different parts of the site specifically this strategy was carried out to describe the strength and direction of the relationship existing between the estimated values of ka and k the degree of relationship or association between the estimated ka and k values was measured by a correlation coefficient denoted by r it is sometimes referred to as the pearson correlation coefficient and was used to measure the linear relationship or association the pearson correlation coefficient between estimated ka and k values was determined using spss software as presented in table 9 the pearson moment r cal is 0 88 with the pearson level of significance value of 0 00 which simply indicates that there is a significant strong positive relationship between the estimated ka and k values further information on the relationship or association between estimated ka and k values was made from a regression analysis with the use of bivariate plots as shown in fig 12 the regression analysis was determined from best straight line to summarise the relationship between k and ka values this also helps to show how one variable or value changes on average with another as shown in fig 12 above there is a linear regression between the estimated ka and k values taken from different areas having r2 0 775 with a linear equation as presented in equation 20 20 y 0 71x 0 87 the linear equation 21 shows the regression between two variables ka and k which implies that a change by 0 71 unit in one variable results in one unit change in another the usefulness of this is that once the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka is estimated it is possible to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer formation using equation 21 below 21 k 0 71ka 0 87 where k is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aquifer formation l t ka is the estimated apparent hydraulic conductivity of aquifer formation l t 5 conclusion the use of un screened concrete lining in the construction of large diameter hand dug wells will prevent the horizontal water flow to the well and this makes darcy based methods not suitable for estimation of horizontal hydraulic conductivity in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells the recovery test method proposed in this study can be used to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k from apparent hydraulic conductivity ka in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells the application of the proposed method showed that the estimated ka values were lower than k values which shows the effect of un screened concrete lining a relationship between ka and k values was established with a correction factor for the estimation of k from ka by a regression analysis with the use of a bivariate pearson correlation coefficient using spss software the pearson moment r cal was 0 88 with the pearson level of significant value of 0 00 which implies a significant strong positive relationship between the estimated ka and k values the estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k is useful to determine well yield and to evaluate water resources coverage and distribution for water management and sustainability most especially in developing rural areas of sub saharan african countries and

method development fig 4 shows the flow in an unconfined aquifer for un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug well with the basic components of the proposed equation for estimation of ka of

the estimated ka using the proposed equation is relatively a low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer formation because the flow into the well is not horizontal there will be a reduce in flow due to energy loss also there will be a time difference in recharge through the base of the well and the direction of the flow moves against the force of gravity to account for the gaps in the stated above facts the horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer formation will be determined based on darcy s law using bouwer and rice 1976 method which will take into account the horizontal flow into the well the estimated k is expected to reflect true flow characteristics of the aquifer formation 3 application of the proposed method to test the viability of the proposed method the field recovery tests were conducted in twelve 12 un screened concrete wells in two stages the first recovery tests were conducted in un screened concrete wells to determine apparent hydraulic conductivity ka fig 6 and then screening was added for the second recovery tests to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k fig 7 the study was carried out in the rural areas of ilorin northcentral nigeria as shown in fig 5 the well radius well depth and static water of the wells were recorded before the commencement of the field test as presented in table 1 these included the well depth m referred to as the distance from the land surface to the bottom of the well rc called the radius of the unscreened part of the well where the head is rising m and rw is the distance from the centre of the well to the undisturbed aquifer these wells are concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells having depths between 8 6 m and 10 6 m and well radius ranges from 0 68 m to 0 78 m 3 1 field recovery tests to achieve this objective the field tests were conducted by pumping the wells to draw the water level down the pump was then turned off while the well was monitored up to 90 of recovery since the aquifer was unconfined the water level in the well was lowered to no more than 10 of the aquifer thickness herbert and kitching 1981 mace 1999 the measured recovery water level at specific time interval was used to calculate the recovery drawdown as shown in table 2 and table 3 while the recovery drawdown time data in un screened and screened wells were used to estimate apparent hydraulic conductivity ka and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer formation 4 results and discussions the calculated recovery drawdown y m from the field recovery tests conducted in un screened and screened wells are presented in tables 2 and 3 below 4 1 analysis of recovery drawdown trends the recovery drawdown obtained un screened and screened wells were plotted on direct linear regression graphs as shown in fig 8 the well recovery is proportional to the flow rate of the well and increases as the flow of the well increases in screened wells k groundwater enters the well with a minimal amount of energy loss and well recovery after pumping is generally rapid and may sometimes exhibit near full recovery up to the static water level conversely in un screened wells ka exhibits excessive energy losses and well recovery and the time after pumping is slower 4 2 estimation of the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka to estimate the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka the calculated recovery drawdown data was plotted against recovery drawdown time derived from equation 16 above k rc rw and re are constants and 1 t ln yo yt is also constant therefore it is required that the recovery drawdown y is plotted against time t on a semi log graph drawdown on the logarithmic and time on a linear scale a best fit straight line through the set of data points was plotted the straight line plotted was also used to calculate the value of 1 t ln yo yt fig 9 shows a semi log plot of recovery drawdown against time in well 5 for ka estimation the values obtained from the plotted curves along with other well parameters were substituted into the proposed equation 16 as derived above in order to estimate the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka of the aquifer formation in concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells from equation 16 above i e k a r c 2 ln r e r w r w 1 t l n y o y t where rc is radius of the unscreened part of the well at which the head is rising m rw is called the distance from the well centre to undisturbed aquifer m t is the time taken min the straight line plotted was used to evaluate 1 t ln yo yt yo is the water depth below water table at beginning of test yt is the depth to water or drawdown at time t re is the radial distance over which the difference in head is dissipated in the flow system of the aquifer to calculate the radial distance re the equation of rupp et al 2011 and uribe et al 2014 for a large diameter well was used as given in equation 17 above from equation 17 above i e ln r e r w c 1 c 2 l n λ a r 2 1 c 3 d a d 1 2 a r 5 8 where r is well radius m c1 c2 and c3 are constants m a is the well base for recharge m d is distance from the water table to the well base m the calculated effective radius re for the tested wells is presented in table 4 while table 5 shows the calculated data from equation 17 for the twelve concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells 4 3 estimation of horizontal hydraulic conductivity k from apparent hydraulic conductivity ka the horizontal hydraulic conductivity k was determined which take into account the horizontal flow into the well following the darcy s law 1856 the k is expected to give a true reflection of flow characteristics of the aquifer formation to achieve the above objective the method of bouwer and rice 1976 developed for an unconfined aquifer of large diameter wells was considered following the field recovery tests conducted in screened wells as discussed above the recovery field tests were equivalent to slug tests of bouwer and rice 1976 because the pumping period tp to lower the water level in the well was short when compared with recovery period herbert and kitching 1981 rushton and holt 1981 mace 1999 the measured recovery water levels at specific time intervals were used to calculate the recovery drawdown as shown in table 3 above to estimate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity k the calculated recovery drawdown data was plotted against time fig 10 according to bouwer and rice 1976 the k rc rw re and le are constants and 1 t ln yo yt is also constant therefore on a semi log paper the recovery drawdown y was plotted against time t recovery drawdown on the logarithmic and time on a linear scale then a best fit straight line was made through the set of data points plotted fig 10 shows a semi plot of recovery drawdown against time for well 7 the straight line plotted was used to calculate values for the 1 t ln yo yt the values obtained from the plotted curves along with other well properties were substituted into the bouwer and rice 1976 equation 18 to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer formation for screened wells 18 k r c 2 ln r e r w 2 l e 1 t l n y o y t where k true hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation m day rc inner well radius m rw distance from the well centre to the undisturbed aquifer m le length of the screen or open portion of the well m t time taken s yo well water depth below water table at the beginning of test m yt depth to water or drawdown at time t m re is the radial distance over which the difference in head is dissipated in the flow system of the aquifer bouwer and rice 1976 determined the values of re experimentally using a resistance network analogue for different values of rw lw le and d the lw the length of the well in aquifer was equal to the distance from the water table to the bottom of the well d fig 10 the effective radius re was calculated using equation 19 according to bouwer and rice 1976 19 l n r e r w 1 1 l n l w r w c l e r w 1 le rw from equation 19 was obtained from the curve generated by bouwer and rice 1976 as shown in fig 11 the calculated effective radius re for screened wells is presented in table 6 the calculated data from the curves and estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation in screened wells using bouwer and rice 1976 method is shown in table 7 the estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of aquifer formation using the bouwer and rice 1976 method in table 7 shows that the estimated k values are higher than the ka values as compared in table 8 this is reasonable considering the difference in flow pattern between the wells descriptive statistical correlation was determined between the estimated ka and k values taken at different parts of the site specifically this strategy was carried out to describe the strength and direction of the relationship existing between the estimated values of ka and k the degree of relationship or association between the estimated ka and k values was measured by a correlation coefficient denoted by r it is sometimes referred to as the pearson correlation coefficient and was used to measure the linear relationship or association the pearson correlation coefficient between estimated ka and k values was determined using spss software as presented in table 9 the pearson moment r cal is 0 88 with the pearson level of significance value of 0 00 which simply indicates that there is a significant strong positive relationship between the estimated ka and k values further information on the relationship or association between estimated ka and k values was made from a regression analysis with the use of bivariate plots as shown in fig 12 the regression analysis was determined from best straight line to summarise the relationship between k and ka values this also helps to show how one variable or value changes on average with another as shown in fig 12 above there is a linear regression between the estimated ka and k values taken from different areas having r2 0 775 with a linear equation as presented in equation 20 20 y 0 71x 0 87 the linear equation 21 shows the regression between two variables ka and k which implies that a change by 0 71 unit in one variable results in one unit change in another the usefulness of this is that once the apparent hydraulic conductivity ka is estimated it is possible to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer formation using equation 21 below 21 k 0 71ka 0 87 where k is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aquifer formation l t ka is the estimated apparent hydraulic conductivity of aquifer formation l t 5 conclusion the use of un screened concrete lining in the construction of large diameter hand dug wells will prevent the horizontal water flow to the well and this makes darcy based methods not suitable for estimation of horizontal hydraulic conductivity in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells the recovery test method proposed in this study can be used to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity k from apparent hydraulic conductivity ka in un screened concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells the application of the proposed method showed that the estimated ka values were lower than k values which shows the effect of un screened concrete lining a relationship between ka and k values was established with a correction factor for the estimation of k from ka by a regression analysis with the use of a bivariate pearson correlation coefficient using spss software the pearson moment r cal was 0 88 with the pearson level of significant value of 0 00 which implies a significant strong positive relationship between the estimated ka and k values the estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity k is useful to determine well yield and to evaluate water resources coverage and distribution for water management and sustainability most especially in developing rural areas of sub saharan african countries and for other developing rural areas of the world where concrete lined large diameter hand dug wells are mostly being used declaration of competing interest we write to inform you that there is no
