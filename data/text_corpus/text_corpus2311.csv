11555,this paper presents an ex ante policy analysis of the implementation of a publicly run active water bank operating at the basin level designed to temporarily reallocate water resources between farmers considering different scenarios of reduced water availability cyclical scarcity due to droughts for this purpose the guadalquivir river basin located in southern spain is used as a case study fifteen representative farm types were considered to simulate water trading through public tender for purchasing and selling temporary water rights the model is built at the basin level to estimate the aggregate demand and supply curves to establish expected exchange prices volumes of water traded enhancement in economic efficiency and improvement in rural development as measured by employment generation the simulation results show that the proposed water bank encourages water transfers from 19 of the total water used in the case of a moderate drought to almost 40 in the case of an extreme drought significantly reducing the economic and labor demand losses due to water shortages the public water agency can recover all of the incurred water bank operation costs by implementing a 0 01 m3 price differential between purchase and sale prices without meaningfully affecting the performance of the water bank thus we conclude that the implementation of this kind of water bank during droughts would be useful in mitigating negative effects of droughts thus policymakers are encouraged to create water banks as an effective instrument to cope with droughts keywords water banks modeling irrigated agriculture guadalquivir river basin spain 1 introduction climate change is causing a progressive reduction in water availability in many semiarid regions worldwide as is the case in the mediterranean region ipcc 2014 this fact combined with population growth and the rising demand for food and ultimately for irrigation water is a primary reason for why water resources have become scarcer in these regions throughout the past few decades in addition to the resulting increase in structural water scarcity climate change is also producing more frequent and severe drought periods resulting in more recurrent and intense episodes of cyclical water scarcity due to the competitive advantages of irrigated versus rain fed agriculture in these semiarid regions the primary solution that has been advanced by public and private initiatives has been to increase water availability by building dams and other water infrastructure this process commonly known as supply side water policy was implemented during the 20th century during which a great amount of water infrastructure was built however there is evidence from around the world that this kind of water policy cannot be further developed in these regions since in many river basins new increases in water availability are technically infeasible or economically unaffordable which is a situation called basin closure molle et al 2010 when basin development reaches the closure stage any new water demand must be satisfied by reducing other existing water use under these circumstances demand side water policy instruments such as water trading instruments are considered to be the most suitable solutions to provide the necessary flexibility in water rights systems allowing for a more efficient reallocation of water resources thus water trading instruments are useful tools for managing both cyclical and structural scarcity water trading instruments encompass a full range of institutions that facilitate voluntary exchanges of water between users delacámara et al 2015 these markets can take different forms depending on key variables that define their operational rules griffin 2016 such as the rights being traded permanent rights temporary rights and options on temporary rights or the parties allowed to trade sellers and buyers regarding the latter it is important to distinguish between water markets that involve only private parties where buyers and sellers interact directly to negotiate the terms of water rights transfers sometimes with the participation of intermediaries or brokers and the so called water banks which operate in a more institutionalized context where an administrative agency public or private acts as a necessary intermediary in the trading of rights rey et al 2014 water banks are intermediaries that centralize the purchases and sales of water rights acting between buyers and sellers spulber and sabbaghi 1994 these banks are typically managed by a public institution e g water agencies in such cases water is transferred under the supervision of the public administration which verifies that the water transactions fulfil all legal requirements sometimes including constraints that are linked to environmental and social criteria garrido et al 2012 these institutional arrangements are designed to cope with both structural scarcity permanent exchange of water rights and with cyclical scarcity temporary water rights transfers montilla lópez et al 2016 reviewed international experiences with water banks and demonstrated the advantages of this instrument over other kinds of water trading instruments i e water markets more concretely the authors show how water banks allow for a more flexible and efficient reallocation of water resources because they facilitate contact and negotiation between buyers and sellers and they improve transparency by providing public information on prices and quantities resulting in lower trade operation transaction costs garrick et al 2013 thus boosting market activity and fostering a more efficient use of water resources grafton et al 2011 furthermore water banks encourage government oversight of environmental and social externalities that arise from water trading they also allow operations with environmental purposes public offers to purchase rights without subsequent reallocation in order to increase river flows restore overexploited groundwater bodies etc clifford et al 2004 numerous empirical works have focused on water markets worldwide and many have analyzed the potential and actual performance of this instrument easter and huang 2014 maestu 2013 for ex ante analyzes of the performance of water markets simulation models that are developed with mathematical programming are typically used e g gómez limón and martínez 2006 garrido and calatrava 2009 qureshi et al 2009 kahil et al 2015 providing evidence of the potential impacts of water markets on the economy economic efficiency the environment water use and other environmental issues and society regional development these studies note that trade of water entitlements permanent rights and water allocations temporary rights improves the efficiency of water use at the basin level with farmers typically playing central roles in the process despite these advantages of water banks over other water trading instruments there is little literature with a similar purpose focused on water banks the only exceptions worth noting are the works of qureshi et al 2007 mainuddin et al 2007 and dixon et al 2012 in australia medellín azuara et al 2013 in the western united states and martínez granados and calatrava 2014 and pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 in spain however all of these studies simulated water banks that were designed to reduce overall water consumption in over allocated basins for environmental reasons thus empirical evidence has focused only on water banks that bought water rights in order to restore water balances known as buyback none of these works have analyzed the implementation of water banks as instruments for reallocating water rights between productive users e g between irrigators as an alternative to other kinds of water trading instruments i e water markets this paper aims to bridge this knowledge gap by simulating the potential performance of a water bank that is designed to reallocate water resources between irrigators to check whether this is really a useful approach for coping with droughts thus the objective of this work is to perform an ex ante policy analysis of the implementation of water banks that trade temporary water rights first buying these rights and then selling them to other productive users accounting for different future reduced water availability scenarios cyclical scarcity for this purpose a simulation model based on mathematical programming is built to estimate the aggregate demand and supply curves to establish the expected exchange prices volumes of water traded enhancement in economic efficiency and employment generation this model was used to simulate the performance of the water bank proposed considering the irrigation sector within the guadalquivir river basin grb in southern spain as an illustrative case study although there are no previous modeling exercises that simulate water banks in this basin there are several empirical studies that analyze the potential performance of water markets using this simulation approach garrido 2000 arriaza et al 2002 calatrava and garrido 2005 these previous works would provide a basis for an interesting discussion regarding the implementation of both water trading instruments to achieve the abovementioned objective the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the next section justifies the type of water bank that is proposed to improve cyclical scarcity management within the irrigation sector as the specific instrument to be simulated the third section introduces the case of the irrigation sector in the grb for which an empirical implementation is developed section 4 details the simulation model that was developed to simulate the performance of the water bank that was proposed for enhanced drought management the results of the simulations are summarized in section 5 the final section concludes by providing the main insights derived from this study 2 water banks for managing drought periods within the irrigation sector as mentioned above the term water banks covers a wide variety of institutional designs montilla lópez et al 2016 identified a number of different types of water banks as shown in table 1 having compared the different kinds of water banks there is no doubt that all designs could be useful in reducing the operational transaction costs for all agents thus boosting market activity however public and active water banks are assumed to improve the management of cyclical and structural water scarcity since they can exercise more effective control over market operations reducing environmental and social negative externalities moreover considering that the main purpose of the bank proposed is to reallocate water within the agricultural sector during drought periods it is also evident that the best design for this instrument should consider the water itself spot market or temporary water rights lease market as assets to be exchanged and all irrigators in the basin as agents who may potentially participate in market activities purchases and sales in this sense an active water bank seeks to set the conditions for the purchase and sale of rights for reallocation purposes in order to achieve a balanced market thus the bank should first act as the sole water buyer of water rights monopsony market by organizing public water rights purchase offers and subsequently act as the unique water seller monopoly market of all the rights that were previously bought by organizing public sale offerings to date there have been many experiences with a number of different water bank designs around the world some of these experiences are based on the same type of water bank that is proposed in this paper for ex ante policy analysis with most in the western states in the us the most well known program is likely the drought emergency water bank that was developed in california in 1991 to improve water management during a cyclical scarcity period this water bank was designed as an active management bank aiming to facilitate temporary transfers of water from the agricultural sector to urban use at a price set by the state government lund et al 1992 other similar active water banks aiming to reallocate water resources include the colorado west slope bank which has been in operation since 2009 and the dungeness water exchange in washington state which has been active since 2013 montilla lópez et al 2016 the spanish water act was reformed in 1999 for the first time allowing the implementation of water markets and water banks for exchanging temporary water rights regarding the latter the reformed act established regulations for the creation and operation of water exchange centers wec emulating the californian drought emergency water bank embid 2013 per this new regulation water banks in spain can be established only under exceptional situations of water scarcity special drought situations or severe overexploitation of aquifers and are operated by river basin authorities confederaciones hidrográficas once established these public drought water banks must operate by actively buying and selling temporary water rights in order to achieve two objectives improve efficiency in water use reallocate water resources between productive users and restore endangered water balances environmental purposes or buybacks this information confirms that the type of water bank proposed here for empirical analysis could be created immediately in spain with the current legal framework although spot water markets and water banks were legally approved two decades ago their implementation has been rather disappointing as during extreme scarcity situations trading activity when considering both instruments accounted for less than 5 0 of total water use and only a quarter of these operations were accomplished through water banks palomo hierro et al 2015 in fact to date only three wecs have been created in spain guadiana júcar and segura basins all in the southeastern part of the country where water resources are scarcer during the drought period from 2005 to 2008 with the main purpose of coping with environmental problems montilla lópez et al 2016 martínez granados and calatrava 2014 carmona et al 2011 in the grb another closed basin in southern spain the national government also approved the creation of a wec in 2005 but in the end this water bank was not actually implemented because of the advantages of water banks in managing water shortages from droughts and improving efficiency in water use while minimizing environmental and social negative externalities from trade activities spanish river basin authorities should reconsider the role of this instrument in their policy mix thus this paper aims to provide information on the potential performance of a water bank for reallocation purposes 3 case study 3 1 the guadalquivir river basin the case study focuses on the grb a semiarid region located in southern spain see fig 1 that covers a total surface area of 57 184 km2 and is home to a population of 4 4 million inhabitants the grb has a typical mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and mild winters and frequent episodes of hydrological drought as in many other regions worldwide the grb is currently closed to new users due to a significant increase in water demand over the past few decades mainly due to the growth of irrigated areas which currently cover approximately 28 of the agricultural area in the basin expósito and berbel 2017 thus demand side management has become the only tool available for managing new water demands the average water use in the grb amounts to 3815 mm3 per year of which approximately 3357 mm3 is used for agricultural irrigation 88 of the total water demand and 379 mm3 is used by households and for other urban demands 10 chg 2015 spanish water law deems that urban users have senior water rights this is their water demands are served first in the event of water scarcity this priority system leads urban users to normally be unwilling to participate in either water markets or banks since their water demands are always covered thus considering that irrigated agriculture accounts in this basin almost all water users potentially willing to participate in water trading only irrigators are considered operating agents when simulating the water bank proposed here moreover it is worth pointing out that water trading among irrigators is technically feasible because most irrigation districts in the basin are located in the same water management system allowing water transfers to use existing infrastructure the potential performance of water markets in the grb is high because of the significant differences in the marginal values of water in several irrigation districts and farm types within the basin as shown by garrido 2000 arriaza et al 2002 and calatrava and garrido 2005 however the actual development of water trading in this basin has been very limited in fact a very low quantity of water has been traded through spot water markets and water banks have not yet been implemented for instance in the busiest market year 2007 during which there was a severe drought 33 2 mm3 were transferred that corresponded only to 0 88 of the total water use moreover most of the water transfers had a different basin as a destination 20 mm3 was allocated to the irrigation districts in the andalusian mediterranean basins garrido et al 2012 palomo hierro et al 2015 the main reasons behind the disappointing performance of these reallocation mechanisms in the grb are twofold on one hand the activity of spot water markets has been very constrained due to legal administrative cultural psychological and technical barriers palomo hierro et al 2015 giannoccaro et al 2016 these barriers have ultimately led to high transaction costs that in turn have limited the number of mutually beneficial transactions on the other hand water banks have not yet been used in this basin to reallocate water resources due to the lack of political will to implement such a plan montilla lópez et al 2016 in this sense the motivation of this paper is to propose a water bank capable of minimizing abovementioned barriers in order to improve water management by boosting water trade in fact it can be assumed that most legal and administrative barriers would be removed because is precisely the public agency in charge of bank management that would be promoting transactions so they will be expected to be minimized moreover cultural and psychological barriers would be also minimized because a selling or buying water to or from the public agency would avoid the negative idea of gaining a profit from common resources granted by that same public agency and b a publicly run water bank provides more legal security to willing buyers and sellers that ultimately could reduce psychological barriers 3 2 data acquisition to properly model the potential performance of a water bank as proposed by spanish law the heterogeneity of the irrigation districts located in the grb should be considered gómez limón et al 2013 classified irrigation districts in this basin into the following five categories c1 traditional annual crops 4 6 of total irrigated area in the grb c2 modernized irrigated areas 36 9 c3 modern olive groves 48 3 c4 traditional vegetables 6 1 and c5 traditional rice 4 1 considering this classification we selected seven representative irrigation districts see location in fig 1 that account for a total area of 49 562 ha 5 8 of total irrigated area in the basin c3 is the largest type among the irrigated areas though this category is very homogeneous since all of these regions are devoted to only olive growing which justifies modeling this category by considering only two irrigation districts pajarejos and santiago apóstol c2 is the most heterogeneous category in terms of farming systems and as such three districts within this type have been selected for inclusion in the basin model genil cabra sector bxii del bajo guadalquivir and bembézar margen izquierda c1 and c5 are quite small and homogeneous categories that can be represented by only one irrigation district marismas del guadalquivir and la ermita respectively 1 1 c4 is not specifically represented in the basin model because of its low relevance in terms of irrigated area and the volume of water used and because its geographic location makes it difficult to exchange water resources due to technical barriers to trade the main characteristics of the selected irrigation districts are shown in table 2 after selecting the abovementioned irrigation districts the primary information to input into the simulation model was obtained from direct surveys that were conducted in spring 2014 involving managers of each district and 355 farmers and were sampled using random routes along the irrigation districts under consideration the questionnaires provided information about farm size crop mix irrigation technology and water use among other descriptive variables about farms in the different irrigation districts secondary information was obtained from official agricultural statistics to generate historical time series of income revenues and profitability indicators for the different crops in each district for the period 2007 2013 real life observations show that there is heterogeneity between farms regarding crop mixes agricultural practices and water use within the same irrigation district mainly due to differences in farmers objectives berkhout et al 2011 thus considering irrigation districts as units to be modeled would lead to serious aggregation bias as such for modeling purposes sufficiently homogeneous farm types are usually considered decision units to minimize this aggregation bias to define these homogenous groups of farms within each irrigation district statistical clustering techniques were used from the set of such clustering techniques we selected euclidean distance as the measure of distance between farms exemplifying features crop mix and we selected ward s method as the criterion for aggregation hair et al 2010 following this procedure different groups of farms clusters were obtained in each irrigation district with the exception of homogeneous districts with only a single crop those representing olive groves or rice systems where all farms were included in the same group berbel and rodríguez ocaña 1998 gómez limón and riesgo 2004 the resulting clusters of farms were characterized by calculating the average values of the different variables that were collected including crop mix and other variables related to farm and farmer features farm size and irrigation technology farmer s age gender educational level and agricultural training the average values for these variables were used to define the corresponding farm types as shown in table 3 these farm types were used as decision units in the model in order to simulate water trading through the water bank 4 modeling approach 4 1 farmers decision making optimizing cobb douglas maufs classical economic theory relies on the assumption that farmers behavior can be modeled by maximizing profits or any utility function with profits as a single attribute however farmers decision making processes are driven by various usually conflicting criteria in addition to the expected profit in this way it can be assumed that producers decision making is guided by the maximization of a multi attribute utility function mauf where all relevant attributes that are considered are condensed which is the main idea that underlies multi attribute utility theory maut an approach that was largely developed after the publication of the seminal work by keeney and raiffa 1976 to overcome the limitations of single attribute profit related utility functions this alternative approach has also been widely implemented for simulating farmers behavior as shown in sumpsi et al 1997 amador et al 1998 gómez limón and berbel 2000 and gómez limón et al 2004 among others given that linear specifications for maufs are easier to elicit and interpret most empirical implementations of the maut approach for simulating farmers decision making have relied on the elicitation of additive maufs usually estimated with a non interactive procedure based on weighted goal programming as suggested by sumpsi et al 1997 however it is worth pointing out that considering additive maufs implies linear indifference curves also called isoutility curves or isopreference curves a condition that is somewhat restrictive because it involves the oversimplified behavior of real decision makers this implication also makes additive maufs inaccurate when simulating actual decision making hardaker et al 2007 these limitations have encouraged authors to use more general and flexible multiplicative forms for maufs since these types of utility functions allow more real indifference curves in fact as has been shown by andré and riesgo 2007 the application of multiplicative utility functions could be more successful in reproducing farmers behavior than additive ones following this line of research we aim to simulate farmers decision making process using the cobb douglas utility function as has been proposed by gutiérrez martín and gómez gómez 2011 and gómez limón et al 2016 this choice is justified because this function is coherent with neoclassical economic theory since it guarantees that there is a global optimum when the efficient frontier is convex and because this formulation is consistent with the postulate of decreasing marginal utility for every attribute the proposed formulation of the cobb douglas mauf is as follows 1 u x a u a f a x α a where x n 1 is the vector of decision variables xc is the area devoted to each productive activity crop u a f a x is a single attribute or partial utility function related to attribute a and αa denotes the coefficient of each attribute that expresses its relative importance these coefficients are assumed to be lower than one in order to ensure decreasing marginal utility for every attribute furthermore these coefficients are assumed to sum to 1 for normalization purposes based on the abovementioned consideration farmers productive behavior can be simulated using a mathematical programming model in which the utility function 1 is the objective function to be maximized 2 1 m a x u x a 1 m u a f a x α a s t 2 2 a 1 m α a 1 2 3 ax b 2 4 x 0 where u x represents a farmer s utility in a multi attribute setting which depends on a set of m single or partial utility functions ua fa x considering all relevant attributes fa x for a producer s decision making as mentioned above the mauf proposed as the objective function is a homothetic cobb douglas function thus the objective function needs to be constrained by expression 2 2 finally the model constraints are built based on matrix a p n of technical coefficients in allocable resource constraints and vector b p 1 of available resource levels 4 2 eliciting farmers mauf to simulate the farmer s decision making process under a cobb douglas mauf it is necessary to elicit the values of the calibrating parameters αa for this purpose the values that most closely approximate the observed behavior are found following a similar procedure to that developed by sumpsi et al 1997 as explained below for operational purposes we consider that i all relevant attributes are related to the objectives that are to be maximized i e more is better attributes and ii each single attribute or partial utility function u a f a x is equal to the corresponding attribute and is properly normalized to be between 0 and 1 n f a x thus the crop mix selection x can be seen as a multi objective programming mop decision making problem gómez limón et al 2016 mop problems seek to obtain the pareto efficient subset from the feasible solutions election possibility set denoted by f assuming that whatever preferences decision makers may have their choices belong to the efficient frontier a first approximation to this efficient frontier can be assessed through the pay off matrix this matrix is obtained by maximizing each of the objectives i e partial utility functions subject to the constraints set expressions 2 2 2 4 in mathematical terms one of the advantages of the cobb douglas function is its potential to be transformed into the additive function which is as follows 3 l o g u x v x a 1 m α a l o g n f a x this transformation allows for following a similar procedure to that developed by sumpsi et al 1997 to estimate more appropriate alpha parameters by solving the following m 1 system of equations 4 1 l o g n f 11 l o g n f 1 l o g n f 12 l o g n f 1 m l o g n f 21 l o g n f 22 l o g n f 2 l o g n f 2 m l o g n f m 1 l o g n f m 2 l o g n f m m l o g n f m α 1 α 2 α m l o g n f 1 o b s l o g n f 2 o b s l o g n f m o b s 4 2 a 1 m α a 1 where n f a is the normalized ideal value for attribute a nfaa are the normalized values of the elements in the pay off matrix of attribute a when attribute a is optimized and n f a o b s are the normalized observed values of each attribute usually there is not an exact solution to the above system and it is therefore necessary to solve the problem by minimizing the sum of the deviational variables that find the closest set of parameters αa 5 1 min a 1 m n a p a s t 5 2 α 1 l o g n f 11 α 2 l o g n f 12 α m l o g n f 1 m n 1 p 1 log n f 1 o b s 5 3 α 1 l o g n f 21 α 2 l o g n f 22 α m l o g n f 2 m n 2 p 2 log n f 2 o b s 5 m 1 α 1 l o g n f m 1 α 2 l o g n f m 2 α m l o g n f m m n m p m log n f m o b s 5 m 2 a 1 m α a 1 where na and pa are the absolute negative and positive deviations respectively 4 3 mauf elicitation for the case study to model farmers decision making we selected the three most relevant attributes for irrigators in the case study considered i the expected total gross margin as a proxy of profit in the short run f 1 x g m x to be maximized ii the production risk measured as the variance of the gross margin f 2 x v a r x to be minimized and iii the total labor f 3 x t l x as a proxy of managerial complexity also to be minimized the concrete formulations of these attributes are explained in the next section each of these attributes are defined as a mathematical function of decision variables the area covered by alternative productive activity x in our case study these activities are denoted by xi where i means the crop and j indicates the irrigation technique used as explained above for operational purposes partial utilities functions must be normalized in order to transform them into more is better and dimensionless functions with values varying within the interval 0 1 n f a x aiming to fulfil these requirements we propose transforming the original attribute functions into rates of success with respect to the ideal value of each attribute gm var and tl respectively thus the normalized attributes can be represented as follows 6 n f g m x g m x g m n f v a r x v a r v a r x n f t l x t l t l x note that more is better attributes such as g m x are normalized differently than less is better attributes such as v a r x or t l x for the former the ideal values the largest possible values are in the denominator and for the latter the ideal values the smallest possible values are in the numerator thus it can be checked that by proceeding in this way all normalized attributes are related with more is better objectives and that their values range between 0 and 1 thus the shape of the mauf to be used for modeling purposes is 7 u x n f g m x α g m n f v a r x α v a r n f t l x α t l where the alpha parameters are estimated by running model 5 4 4 modeling farmers decision making considering water bank operations to simulate water bank operations it is necessary to know how farmers would react if they could sell or purchase water through this kind of water market thus in addition to variables x it must be considered that farmers can also make decisions regarding the quantity of water sold to the bank or water bank purchases denoted by wbp or the quantity of water purchased from the bank or water banks sales denoted by wbs considering these two new decision variables farmers decision making process in this setting can be simulated by the following model 8 1 m a x u x n f g m x α g m n f v a r x α v a r n f t l x α t l 8 2 g m x i j p i y i j s i v c i j x i j w p p w b p w p s w b s 8 3 v a r x x t cov x 8 4 t l x i j t l i j x i j s t 8 5 i j x i j f a 8 6 i j x i j w i j δ w a f a w b s w b p 8 7 ax b 8 8 x i j w b p w b s 0 i j eqs 8 2 to 8 4 are mathematical representations of partial utility functions thus the farm gross margin is calculated as the sum of total income including both product sales crop price p i multiplied by yield per crop and irrigation technique y i j and coupled subsidies s i minus the variable costs from crops vc i j furthermore considering the operations in water markets the gross margin also includes the income from the water sold to the bank water price wp p multiplied by the quantity of water purchased by the bank wbp and the cost derived from the water bought from the bank water price wps by the quantity of water sold by the bank wbs risk is calculated in eq 8 3 as the variance of the gross margin where cov is the variance covariance matrix of the gross margins of crops per hectare during the period 2007 2013 the last attribute is total labor which is calculated in eq 8 4 as the sum of labor requirements per crop and the irrigation technique tli for the entire farm constraints 8 5 and 8 6 are related to land and water availability respectively the first constraint limits the total area covered by the different alternatives to the farm size fa the water constraint establishes that irrigation water requirements cannot exceed water availability the former being the sum of water requirements per alternative and the latter is the water allotment provided by the water agency considering farm size fa water rights granted per hectare wa and resource availability at the basin level water availability coefficient δ plus minus the quantity of water purchased sold from to the water bank wbs wbp eq 8 7 denotes the other constraints that define the feasible solution set for this purpose the following restrictions were considered i agronomic practices allowing only those rotational practices actually followed by farmers ii permanent crops fruit and olive groves fixing the area covered by each of these crops in the short run iii irrigation techniques constraining the area irrigated by each irrigation system surface sprinkler and drip as irrigation equipment is also fixed in the short term iv sugar beet and cotton quotas limiting the maximum area devoted to each of these two crops because of agricultural policy production quotas and v market constraints for perishable agricultural products such as tomatoes garlic onions and carrots because of limited marketing channels finally we also establish that decision variables xi wbp and wbs must be non negative as denoted by eq 8 8 4 5 simulation model for a water bank at the basin level the potential performance of the water bank that is proposed for trading temporary water rights was simulated considering that first the bank implements a public offer to purchase these rights and afterwards it sells all the rights that were previously bought through a public sale offering with both tenders organized considering centralized trading rules i e a monopsony market for right purchases and monopoly market for sales for this purpose a two step procedure is implemented the first step is the estimation of the aggregate demand and supply curves at the basin level these curves are estimated by aggregating the results of the models that were developed for the 15 representative farm types see table 3 accounting for the relative weight of each type over the total irrigated area at the basin level the aggregation procedure followed for this purpose is double sided firstly farm type models were run in order to simulate the purchases of temporary water rights by the bank from willing sellers for this purpose the value of wp p has been parametrized from 0 00 m3 to 1 00 m3 thus by running these models the aggregate supply of temporary rights is estimated that is the total quantity of water that the bank could buy for every purchase price secondly the same farm type models were run in order to parametrize the value of wp s from 0 00 m3 to 1 00 m3 which allowed us to built the aggregate demand of temporary rights that is the total amount of water that the bank could sell to farmers that are willing to buy additional water at each sale price it is worth pointing out that this first step was implemented for three scenarios of water availability to simulate droughts with different values for the coefficient of water availability δ for our case study the values of 0 75 moderate drought only 75 of water rights are available 0 50 severe drought only 50 of water rights available and 0 25 extreme drought only 25 of water rights are available were considered 2 2 this simplification can be considered plausible enough for modeling purposes since most of the irrigated area in the basin are located within the same water management system where all available water resources are shared i e they have the same annual water allotment in any case the same modeling approach could be used considering different δ parameters for each irrigation districts if required for simulating heterogenous water availability fig 2 shows the resulting aggregate demand and supply curves in each of these scenarios once aggregate demand and supply curves are estimated the second step in the procedure is calculating the amount of water that the bank should trade assuming that the proposed public water bank is a non profit and non subsidized institution that is willing to optimize water use efficiency its objective should be to maximize the quantity of water that is reallocated among irrigators considering only the constraint that wp p wp s in the absence of operational costs this maximum is reached in every scenario of water availability when the aggregate demand and supply curves intersect in this point the optimum bank outcome fulfils two conditions a the quantity of water purchased is equal to the quantity of water sold q p q s and b purchase price is equal to the sale price wp p wp s thus to achieve this outcome the bank should implement a public offer to purchase temporary water rights at price wp p in a monopsonistic market buying the amount of water q p afterward it should organize a public offer to sell at the same price in a monopolistic market then selling the same amount of water if non null operational costs are considered the purchase price should be lower than the sale price wp p wp s in order to allow the public agency that is in charge of the bank operations to cover its costs with its own income assumption of non subsidized institution in this situation the maximization of water traded i e maximum efficiency in water use is achieved by fixing wp p and wp s as close to each other as possible with the difference between both prices serving only to cover the costs of water bank operations borne by the public agency thus to reach the optimum bank outcome with operational cost we graphically looked for the gap between aggregate demand and supply whose value is equal to the operational costs considered equaling the amount of water purchased and sold q s q p the prices for aggregated supply wp p and demand wp s for this situation would be the prices to be used by the bank for the public offer to purchase temporary water rights in a monopsonistic market and for the public offer to sell them in a monopolistic market respectively an accurate estimate of water bank operation costs for this case study is beyond the scope of this work in any case for illustrative purposes only staff from the júcar and guadiana water agencies who have already created and managed water banks and other experts were consulted and they roughly estimate that these costs for the guadalquivir basin would fall within a range from 1 to 2 million euros annually because it is assumed that the simulated water bank is not a subsidized institution a different water price for water purchases and sales will be applied in order to generate a positive net public revenue to cover all operational costs borne by the public agency for this purpose the difference wp p wp s has been parameterized from 0 01 m3 to 0 03 m3 allowing us to analyze the impact of this differential price strategy on the quantity of water traded the economic and social effects and the public income needed to cover these costs it is worth clarifying that the optimal bank outcome that is reached as explained above is equivalent to the market equilibrium provided by a hypothetical perfect competitive spot water market or a passive water bank that operates through a clearing house this kind of water bank does not use its own budget to buy and sell but acts only as an intermediary thus it is relevant to remark that the optimal reallocation of water resources from an economic point of view maximum efficiency of water use can be reached by several water trading instruments including active water banks the bank outcome that was calculated as explained above can provide useful information about the potential economic efficiency that is reachable with this trading instrument however to assess this potential performance it is also relevant to consider the social impact of the instrument which can be estimated by measuring the changes in employment generation in our modeling approach these changes are calculated by comparing simulated agricultural labor demand for the different drought scenarios with and without water bank reallocations for both scenarios labor demand is estimated based on the crop mixes that are implemented in each case as temporary water rights are transferred from extensive and low value added activities to more intensive and profitable crops it is expected that water reallocation leads to an aggregated net increase in employment generation with the labor increase in water buying farms being higher than labor losses in water selling farms 5 results 5 1 elicited utility functions running the calibration procedures as explained in the model 5 the sets of calibration parameters α a have been elicited in order to obtain the maufs that are to be optimized by each farm type considered in this way table 4 shows the results obtained table 4 also shows two indexes of calibration goodness measuring the differences between the observed values and the simulated values when the utility function is maximized the first index is the mean squared error mse which measures these differences in the space of attributes 9 m s e a 1 m f a o b s x f a x f a o b s x 2 m the second is the finger kreinin fk similarity index which measures the differences in the space of decision variables i e crop areas 10 f k s i m i l a r i t y i n d e x i j m i n x i j f a x i j o b s f a the results provided by both indexes show that calibration procedure proposed offers a reasonably good approximation of farmers decision making 5 2 water bank performance without operational costs this second sub section analyzes the outcomes that were obtained from the simulations of different scenarios of water availability the coefficient of water availability δ equals 0 75 0 50 or 0 25 in the ideal case where operational costs of zero are considered i e market balance achieved for wp p wp s these scenario simulations are interesting for two reasons first these results show the maximum potential of water banks to increase economic efficiency second these simulations also display the performance of a subsidized water bank when all transactions costs are covered by the public budget fig 2 shows the resulting aggregated curves for purchases and sales in each of three water availability scenarios as we can see when water availability is reduced to 75 of water rights moderate drought δ 0 75 the equilibrium price managed by the water bank reaches 0 15 m3 involving 381 mm3 of water traded for the intermediate scenario that simulates a severe drought δ 0 50 the purchase and sale prices reach 0 24 m3 and 363 mm3 of water is exchanged finally when the drought is extreme δ 0 25 the clearing price is 0 38 m3 and 259 mm3 is exchanged the water prices and quantities of water traded that were obtained for each scenario are also shown in table 5 this quantitative assessment clearly shows that despite the decrease in water quantity traded in absolute terms mm3 as water availability is reduced the percentage of water exchanged over the total water used at the basin level increases as the drought becomes more acute in fact this percentage reaches 38 9 for the extreme drought scenario while for the moderate drought scenario the water bank only mobilizes 19 1 of the total usable water these results can be compared with previous work that focused on simulating the spot water market in the same river basin without operational costs in this sense it is worth quoting the work of arriaza et al 2002 where potential of water markets were analyzed in a single irrigation district el bajo guadalquivir showing that a reduction of water availability in a 50 annual allotment of 2670 m3 ha would lead to equilibrium price of 0 15 m3 exchanging only 4 of total water used similarly calatrava and garrido 2005 analyzed the impact of a spot water market in another irrigation district within the grb guadalmellato and their estimates show that a water allotment of only 50 compared with a normal hydric year annual allotment of 2800 m3 ha would require that 21 of total water used was reallocated among irrigators at a price of 0 12 m3 it is worth noting that both works simulated local water markets irrigation district level this scope is much lower than that considered in this paper basin level the latter of which allows much more users higher heterogeneity in water utility to participate in the exchanges which could explain why the estimates reported here suggest a more active reallocation in terms of the share of water resources exchanged considering the five categories of irrigation districts that are explained in section 3 the results show that in general the farm types located in modernized irrigation areas type c2 are willing to purchase water when a moderate drought occurs some of these farms the more profitable ones those oriented to fruit and vegetable crops also continue to acquire water from the water bank in severe drought situations however only farm types with perennial crops fruit citrus and olive groves are willing to purchase water when an extreme drought is in place 3 3 in the scenarios of extreme and severe droughts a previously approved drought plan is implemented assuring a minimum allocation of water for perennial crops in order to avoid the collapse of the orchards however it is worth pointing out that this allocation does not allow any profitable production thus in drought situations farmers with permanent crops are willing to participate in the bank purchasing water to obtain a complete harvest the farm types located in the traditional rice irrigated areas type c5 are the main sellers in all drought situations for severe and extreme droughts less profitable farm types located in traditional annual crops irrigated areas type c1 also behave as sellers to the water bank because of the differential behavior of farm types described above water transfers have different effects on cropping patterns farm types with higher water productivity mostly in c2 and c3 irrigated areas can afford to purchase water from the bank and during moderate water shortages these farms do not need to modify their usual cropping patterns those implemented under normal hydrological conditions rather changes in crop mixes occur only during severe and extreme droughts these changes being more relevant as water scarcity became more acute on the other hand farm types with low water productivity crops mainly in c5 and c1 irrigated areas change their usual crop mixes to crops with lower water requirements in every simulated scenario eventually switching to rain fed crops in severe and extreme droughts table 5 also shows the performance of the water bank in terms of economic profit changes in the agricultural sector and public revenue and social changes in labor demand in the agricultural sector impacts when the water availability equals 75 of water rights in the absence of a water bank there are significant profit losses in the irrigation sector at the basin level estimated to be 54 9 m 4 9 of the aggregated profit at full water availability in contrast the simulation results indicate that the creation of a water bank would reduce these losses to 19 3 m only 1 7 of aggregated profit under normal hydrologic conditions thus compared to the current situation without a water bank the operations of the water bank proposed in this drought scenario would increase economic efficiency at the basin level by 35 6 m 3 2 of normal aggregated profit clearly the profit losses are larger both in absolute and relative terms when the drought is more severe however for severe and extreme drought episodes the water bank considered here has a more relevant role as a water efficiency enhancer since the market operations implemented by the water bank could increase the aggregated profit by 56 2 m and 52 8 m 5 0 and 4 7 of normal aggregated profit respectively these results clearly demonstrate the potential of water banks to increase economic efficiency in the grb regarding economic impacts it is clear that a water bank management strategy that aims to maximize the amount of water exchanged i e wp p wp s involves a net public revenue of zero thus considering that in a real world setting the transaction costs that are borne by the public water agency are not negligible the implementation of this market strategy would lead to a hidden subsidy that is equal to all costs actually covered by the agency in order to create and manage the water bank in the next section this point will be further discussed finally with respect to social impacts table 5 also shows how the water bank led to a reduction in the aggregated losses of labor demand at the basin level for all drought scenarios considered for example when a severe drought is in place the labor demand in the irrigation sector is reduced by 6 5 if no water market instrument is implemented however this loss can be reduced to only 2 0 if a water bank is considered an instrument for managing water scarcity because the water bank favors the maintenance of the most profitable crops which also require the most labor in fact as seen in table 5 the role of a water bank proposed as an economic instrument to mitigate the negative social impacts of water shortages is more relevant when the drought is more acute both in absolute and relative terms these results also indicate the potential of water banks to improve the management of drought periods in the grb from a social perspective 5 3 performance water banks with operational costs this section analyzes the simulated outcomes accounting for the water bank operation costs that are borne by the public agency that manages the water bank this agency would thus implement a differential water price between water purchases and sales wp p wp s generating a net positive public revenue that aims to cover these costs table 6 shows the results obtained for the different scenarios of reduced water availability the coefficient of water availability δ equals to 0 75 0 50 or 0 25 when there is a difference of 0 01 m3 0 02 m3 and 0 03 m3 between the purchase and sale price similar to the case in which water bank operation costs are assumed to be zero the results measure the performance of the proposed water bank in terms of the clearing prices volumes of water transferred aggregated gross margin in agricultural sector public revenues and total demand for labor the first result worth noting is that implementing a differential price of only 0 01 m3 would be enough to cover all public transactions costs that are incurred from the creation and management of a water bank in the grb in fact the net public revenues that would be generated would range from 3 8 m for the case of a moderate drought δ 0 75 to 2 6 m for the case of an extreme drought δ 0 25 far above the estimated costs 1 2 m annually therefore this minimum differential price strategy would be enough for cost recovery thus avoiding the need to subsidize this market institution focusing on the results for a differential price of 0 01 m3 the water quantities exchanged by the water bank are very similar to those reported in the case where water bank operation costs were zero in fact the quantities are almost the same for the moderate and extreme drought situations and are only 26 mm3 lower 8 less from 363 to 337 mm3 for a severe drought these findings are in line with those of garrido 2000 who simulated a spot water market between four irrigation districts in the grb and found that with operation costs of 0 006 m3 and with a water availability of 50 18 2 of used water would be traded however this study shows that in case that these costs increase up to 0 018 m3 market activity would be reduced to 15 3 over the region s total water availability these similar water exchanges involve similar economic and social performances for example when implementing a differential price of 0 01 m3 in an extreme drought situation the losses are 372 1 m only 2 6 m more than the performance achieved without implementing such a differential price moreover this difference is equivalent to the net public revenue generated in this case this result means that the economic inefficiency produced by implementing a differential price strategy is negligible at this level regarding social impacts there is no difference between the results obtained in this simulated scenario and those when considering water bank operation costs of zero as shown in table 6 only an insignificant economic inefficiency appears for a severe drought scenario in this case since the price of the water exchanged is slightly lower the profit losses when water bank is operating are 155 6 m 3 7 m more than the performance achieved when no differential price is implemented however in this case the public revenue is only 3 4 m meaning that recovering the water bank operation costs would lead to an economic inefficiency of 0 3 m which is less than 0 1 of the aggregated profit slightly more relevant is the change in social performance since the decrease in aggregated labor demand in this case is 15 higher than the scenario in which no differential price strategy is implemented increasing from 751 to 863 awus although the scenarios considering differential price strategies of 0 02 m3 and 0 03 m3 are more than needed to recover costs one point is worth noting the relatively large increase in economic efficiency generated by the operation of the water bank would allow for the implementation of reasonable differential price strategies i e less than 0 03 m3 without significantly impacting market performance both in economic and social terms thus there is room to consider water banks not only as an instrument for enhancing economic efficiency regarding water use but also as a mechanism for collecting extra water fees in case this is considered necessary by decision makers 6 concluding remarks although the implementation of a publicly run active water bank is usually suggested as a demand side policy instrument for reallocating water resources during drought periods there is little evidence regarding their potential performance this study attempts to fill this gap in empirical knowledge by simulating the implementation of this kind of water bank taking into account different future scenarios of reduced water availability cyclical scarcity at the basin level for this purpose the bank proposed it is assumed to operate during drought periods first implementing public offers to purchase temporary rights and afterwards selling all the rights that were previously bought through public sale offerings the key idea guiding this proactive strategy is that by fixing purchase and sale prices properly this bank could maximize the quantity of water that is reallocated among irrigators thus enhancing water use efficiency in a similar way to a spot water market or a passive water bank operating through a clearing house although the potential outcomes of all these water trading instruments could be similar in terms of increased water use efficiency it is worth noting that the proposed active water bank has the advantages of involving lower operation costs and more effective control over market operations reducing environmental and social negative externalities the analysis of this case study guadalquivir river basin yielded evidence that the implementation of a water bank could lead to large water transfers potentially ranging from 19 of the total water used in the case of a moderate drought to almost 40 in case of an extreme drought this traded water is accompanied by an increase in farmers total profit i e an increase in the economic efficiency and in the aggregated agricultural labor demand i e positive social impact enhancing rural development both of these positive impacts serve to minimize the effects of cyclical scarcity in fact the more severe the drought is the greater the increase in profit and labor demand will be the outcomes obtained from the simulation of different water availability scenarios show that a difference in the purchase and sales prices of only 0 01 m3 would be enough to cover all operational costs that are borne by the public agency that manages the bank moreover the results demonstrate that a strategy that employs differential prices greater than 0 01 m3 could generate an extra source of public revenue without significantly affecting bank performance in terms of economic efficiency or labor demand these results lead to the conclusion that a water bank that is designed to reallocate water resources between irrigators is a very useful instrument for coping with cyclical scarcity in closed basins such as the grb since water trading would significantly mitigate the negative effects of droughts in this sense we suggest that policymakers pay attention to this economic instrument to improve water management and encourage the creation of drought water banks nonetheless it should be noted that water banks should not be considered panaceas for solving all management problems during drought periods in fact these tools should be just understood as complementary economic instruments and should be combined with other demand side policy instruments moreover the results reported in this paper must be understood as the maximum potential performance of the water bank proposed for implementation the simulation model presented here ignores some possible barriers to trade that are difficult to model when using mathematical programming techniques such as legal administrative cultural psychological technical and environmental barriers in fact although the proposed water trading instrument could minimize many of the barriers all but technical and environmental ones it should be noted that these limitations of the model could lead to overestimating the amount of water traded and the increase in economic efficiency in this sense further research is suggested to refine this kind of modeling approach especially by considering a more realistic constraints related to physical connectivity among agents also including groundwater users b transportation costs when transfers require specific infrastructures and c environmental constraints to maintain minimum environmental water flows as fixed in the basin management plan in any case all abovementioned limitations should not cloud the results that suggest the promising potential performance of the proposed active water plan as an instrument to enhance water use efficiency during drought periods in this regard further research is also suggested to analyze other alternative management strategies for active water banks such as implementing auction systems for water bank purchases and sales in order to minimize private agents surplus and maximize increases in efficiency similarly implementing double purpose purchases both for reallocation increasing efficiency in water use and buyback decreasing withdrawals to improve environment would be worth exploring in order to analyze the trade off between both objectives acknowledgments we are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions which have

11555,this paper presents an ex ante policy analysis of the implementation of a publicly run active water bank operating at the basin level designed to temporarily reallocate water resources between farmers considering different scenarios of reduced water availability cyclical scarcity due to droughts for this purpose the guadalquivir river basin located in southern spain is used as a case study fifteen representative farm types were considered to simulate water trading through public tender for purchasing and selling temporary water rights the model is built at the basin level to estimate the aggregate demand and supply curves to establish expected exchange prices volumes of water traded enhancement in economic efficiency and improvement in rural development as measured by employment generation the simulation results show that the proposed water bank encourages water transfers from 19 of the total water used in the case of a moderate drought to almost 40 in the case of an extreme drought significantly reducing the economic and labor demand losses due to water shortages the public water agency can recover all of the incurred water bank operation costs by implementing a 0 01 m3 price differential between purchase and sale prices without meaningfully affecting the performance of the water bank thus we conclude that the implementation of this kind of water bank during droughts would be useful in mitigating negative effects of droughts thus policymakers are encouraged to create water banks as an effective instrument to cope with droughts keywords water banks modeling irrigated agriculture guadalquivir river basin spain 1 introduction climate change is causing a progressive reduction in water availability in many semiarid regions worldwide as is the case in the mediterranean region ipcc 2014 this fact combined with population growth and the rising demand for food and ultimately for irrigation water is a primary reason for why water resources have become scarcer in these regions throughout the past few decades in addition to the resulting increase in structural water scarcity climate change is also producing more frequent and severe drought periods resulting in more recurrent and intense episodes of cyclical water scarcity due to the competitive advantages of irrigated versus rain fed agriculture in these semiarid regions the primary solution that has been advanced by public and private initiatives has been to increase water availability by building dams and other water infrastructure this process commonly known as supply side water policy was implemented during the 20th century during which a great amount of water infrastructure was built however there is evidence from around the world that this kind of water policy cannot be further developed in these regions since in many river basins new increases in water availability are technically infeasible or economically unaffordable which is a situation called basin closure molle et al 2010 when basin development reaches the closure stage any new water demand must be satisfied by reducing other existing water use under these circumstances demand side water policy instruments such as water trading instruments are considered to be the most suitable solutions to provide the necessary flexibility in water rights systems allowing for a more efficient reallocation of water resources thus water trading instruments are useful tools for managing both cyclical and structural scarcity water trading instruments encompass a full range of institutions that facilitate voluntary exchanges of water between users delacámara et al 2015 these markets can take different forms depending on key variables that define their operational rules griffin 2016 such as the rights being traded permanent rights temporary rights and options on temporary rights or the parties allowed to trade sellers and buyers regarding the latter it is important to distinguish between water markets that involve only private parties where buyers and sellers interact directly to negotiate the terms of water rights transfers sometimes with the participation of intermediaries or brokers and the so called water banks which operate in a more institutionalized context where an administrative agency public or private acts as a necessary intermediary in the trading of rights rey et al 2014 water banks are intermediaries that centralize the purchases and sales of water rights acting between buyers and sellers spulber and sabbaghi 1994 these banks are typically managed by a public institution e g water agencies in such cases water is transferred under the supervision of the public administration which verifies that the water transactions fulfil all legal requirements sometimes including constraints that are linked to environmental and social criteria garrido et al 2012 these institutional arrangements are designed to cope with both structural scarcity permanent exchange of water rights and with cyclical scarcity temporary water rights transfers montilla lópez et al 2016 reviewed international experiences with water banks and demonstrated the advantages of this instrument over other kinds of water trading instruments i e water markets more concretely the authors show how water banks allow for a more flexible and efficient reallocation of water resources because they facilitate contact and negotiation between buyers and sellers and they improve transparency by providing public information on prices and quantities resulting in lower trade operation transaction costs garrick et al 2013 thus boosting market activity and fostering a more efficient use of water resources grafton et al 2011 furthermore water banks encourage government oversight of environmental and social externalities that arise from water trading they also allow operations with environmental purposes public offers to purchase rights without subsequent reallocation in order to increase river flows restore overexploited groundwater bodies etc clifford et al 2004 numerous empirical works have focused on water markets worldwide and many have analyzed the potential and actual performance of this instrument easter and huang 2014 maestu 2013 for ex ante analyzes of the performance of water markets simulation models that are developed with mathematical programming are typically used e g gómez limón and martínez 2006 garrido and calatrava 2009 qureshi et al 2009 kahil et al 2015 providing evidence of the potential impacts of water markets on the economy economic efficiency the environment water use and other environmental issues and society regional development these studies note that trade of water entitlements permanent rights and water allocations temporary rights improves the efficiency of water use at the basin level with farmers typically playing central roles in the process despite these advantages of water banks over other water trading instruments there is little literature with a similar purpose focused on water banks the only exceptions worth noting are the works of qureshi et al 2007 mainuddin et al 2007 and dixon et al 2012 in australia medellín azuara et al 2013 in the western united states and martínez granados and calatrava 2014 and pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 in spain however all of these studies simulated water banks that were designed to reduce overall water consumption in over allocated basins for environmental reasons thus empirical evidence has focused only on water banks that bought water rights in order to restore water balances known as buyback none of these works have analyzed the implementation of water banks as instruments for reallocating water rights between productive users e g between irrigators as an alternative to other kinds of water trading instruments i e water markets this paper aims to bridge this knowledge gap by simulating the potential performance of a water bank that is designed to reallocate water resources between irrigators to check whether this is really a useful approach for coping with droughts thus the objective of this work is to perform an ex ante policy analysis of the implementation of water banks that trade temporary water rights first buying these rights and then selling them to other productive users accounting for different future reduced water availability scenarios cyclical scarcity for this purpose a simulation model based on mathematical programming is built to estimate the aggregate demand and supply curves to establish the expected exchange prices volumes of water traded enhancement in economic efficiency and employment generation this model was used to simulate the performance of the water bank proposed considering the irrigation sector within the guadalquivir river basin grb in southern spain as an illustrative case study although there are no previous modeling exercises that simulate water banks in this basin there are several empirical studies that analyze the potential performance of water markets using this simulation approach garrido 2000 arriaza et al 2002 calatrava and garrido 2005 these previous works would provide a basis for an interesting discussion regarding the implementation of both water trading instruments to achieve the abovementioned objective the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the next section justifies the type of water bank that is proposed to improve cyclical scarcity management within the irrigation sector as the specific instrument to be simulated the third section introduces the case of the irrigation sector in the grb for which an empirical implementation is developed section 4 details the simulation model that was developed to simulate the performance of the water bank that was proposed for enhanced drought management the results of the simulations are summarized in section 5 the final section concludes by providing the main insights derived from this study 2 water banks for managing drought periods within the irrigation sector as mentioned above the term water banks covers a wide variety of institutional designs montilla lópez et al 2016 identified a number of different types of water banks as shown in table 1 having compared the different kinds of water banks there is no doubt that all designs could be useful in reducing the operational transaction costs for all agents thus boosting market activity however public and active water banks are assumed to improve the management of cyclical and structural water scarcity since they can exercise more effective control over market operations reducing environmental and social negative externalities moreover considering that the main purpose of the bank proposed is to reallocate water within the agricultural sector during drought periods it is also evident that the best design for this instrument should consider the water itself spot market or temporary water rights lease market as assets to be exchanged and all irrigators in the basin as agents who may potentially participate in market activities purchases and sales in this sense an active water bank seeks to set the conditions for the purchase and sale of rights for reallocation purposes in order to achieve a balanced market thus the bank should first act as the sole water buyer of water rights monopsony market by organizing public water rights purchase offers and subsequently act as the unique water seller monopoly market of all the rights that were previously bought by organizing public sale offerings to date there have been many experiences with a number of different water bank designs around the world some of these experiences are based on the same type of water bank that is proposed in this paper for ex ante policy analysis with most in the western states in the us the most well known program is likely the drought emergency water bank that was developed in california in 1991 to improve water management during a cyclical scarcity period this water bank was designed as an active management bank aiming to facilitate temporary transfers of water from the agricultural sector to urban use at a price set by the state government lund et al 1992 other similar active water banks aiming to reallocate water resources include the colorado west slope bank which has been in operation since 2009 and the dungeness water exchange in washington state which has been active since 2013 montilla lópez et al 2016 the spanish water act was reformed in 1999 for the first time allowing the implementation of water markets and water banks for exchanging temporary water rights regarding the latter the reformed act established regulations for the creation and operation of water exchange centers wec emulating the californian drought emergency water bank embid 2013 per this new regulation water banks in spain can be established only under exceptional situations of water scarcity special drought situations or severe overexploitation of aquifers and are operated by river basin authorities confederaciones hidrográficas once established these public drought water banks must operate by actively buying and selling temporary water rights in order to achieve two objectives improve efficiency in water use reallocate water resources between productive users and restore endangered water balances environmental purposes or buybacks this information confirms that the type of water bank proposed here for empirical analysis could be created immediately in spain with the current legal framework although spot water markets and water banks were legally approved two decades ago their implementation has been rather disappointing as during extreme scarcity situations trading activity when considering both instruments accounted for less than 5 0 of total water use and only a quarter of these operations were accomplished through water banks palomo hierro et al 2015 in fact to date only three wecs have been created in spain guadiana júcar and segura basins all in the southeastern part of the country where water resources are scarcer during the drought period from 2005 to 2008 with the main purpose of coping with environmental problems montilla lópez et al 2016 martínez granados and calatrava 2014 carmona et al 2011 in the grb another closed basin in southern spain the national government also approved the creation of a wec in 2005 but in the end this water bank was not actually implemented because of the advantages of water banks in managing water shortages from droughts and improving efficiency in water use while minimizing environmental and social negative externalities from trade activities spanish river basin authorities should reconsider the role of this instrument in their policy mix thus this paper aims to provide information on the potential performance of a water bank for reallocation purposes 3 case study 3 1 the guadalquivir river basin the case study focuses on the grb a semiarid region located in southern spain see fig 1 that covers a total surface area of 57 184 km2 and is home to a population of 4 4 million inhabitants the grb has a typical mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and mild winters and frequent episodes of hydrological drought as in many other regions worldwide the grb is currently closed to new users due to a significant increase in water demand over the past few decades mainly due to the growth of irrigated areas which currently cover approximately 28 of the agricultural area in the basin expósito and berbel 2017 thus demand side management has become the only tool available for managing new water demands the average water use in the grb amounts to 3815 mm3 per year of which approximately 3357 mm3 is used for agricultural irrigation 88 of the total water demand and 379 mm3 is used by households and for other urban demands 10 chg 2015 spanish water law deems that urban users have senior water rights this is their water demands are served first in the event of water scarcity this priority system leads urban users to normally be unwilling to participate in either water markets or banks since their water demands are always covered thus considering that irrigated agriculture accounts in this basin almost all water users potentially willing to participate in water trading only irrigators are considered operating agents when simulating the water bank proposed here moreover it is worth pointing out that water trading among irrigators is technically feasible because most irrigation districts in the basin are located in the same water management system allowing water transfers to use existing infrastructure the potential performance of water markets in the grb is high because of the significant differences in the marginal values of water in several irrigation districts and farm types within the basin as shown by garrido 2000 arriaza et al 2002 and calatrava and garrido 2005 however the actual development of water trading in this basin has been very limited in fact a very low quantity of water has been traded through spot water markets and water banks have not yet been implemented for instance in the busiest market year 2007 during which there was a severe drought 33 2 mm3 were transferred that corresponded only to 0 88 of the total water use moreover most of the water transfers had a different basin as a destination 20 mm3 was allocated to the irrigation districts in the andalusian mediterranean basins garrido et al 2012 palomo hierro et al 2015 the main reasons behind the disappointing performance of these reallocation mechanisms in the grb are twofold on one hand the activity of spot water markets has been very constrained due to legal administrative cultural psychological and technical barriers palomo hierro et al 2015 giannoccaro et al 2016 these barriers have ultimately led to high transaction costs that in turn have limited the number of mutually beneficial transactions on the other hand water banks have not yet been used in this basin to reallocate water resources due to the lack of political will to implement such a plan montilla lópez et al 2016 in this sense the motivation of this paper is to propose a water bank capable of minimizing abovementioned barriers in order to improve water management by boosting water trade in fact it can be assumed that most legal and administrative barriers would be removed because is precisely the public agency in charge of bank management that would be promoting transactions so they will be expected to be minimized moreover cultural and psychological barriers would be also minimized because a selling or buying water to or from the public agency would avoid the negative idea of gaining a profit from common resources granted by that same public agency and b a publicly run water bank provides more legal security to willing buyers and sellers that ultimately could reduce psychological barriers 3 2 data acquisition to properly model the potential performance of a water bank as proposed by spanish law the heterogeneity of the irrigation districts located in the grb should be considered gómez limón et al 2013 classified irrigation districts in this basin into the following five categories c1 traditional annual crops 4 6 of total irrigated area in the grb c2 modernized irrigated areas 36 9 c3 modern olive groves 48 3 c4 traditional vegetables 6 1 and c5 traditional rice 4 1 considering this classification we selected seven representative irrigation districts see location in fig 1 that account for a total area of 49 562 ha 5 8 of total irrigated area in the basin c3 is the largest type among the irrigated areas though this category is very homogeneous since all of these regions are devoted to only olive growing which justifies modeling this category by considering only two irrigation districts pajarejos and santiago apóstol c2 is the most heterogeneous category in terms of farming systems and as such three districts within this type have been selected for inclusion in the basin model genil cabra sector bxii del bajo guadalquivir and bembézar margen izquierda c1 and c5 are quite small and homogeneous categories that can be represented by only one irrigation district marismas del guadalquivir and la ermita respectively 1 1 c4 is not specifically represented in the basin model because of its low relevance in terms of irrigated area and the volume of water used and because its geographic location makes it difficult to exchange water resources due to technical barriers to trade the main characteristics of the selected irrigation districts are shown in table 2 after selecting the abovementioned irrigation districts the primary information to input into the simulation model was obtained from direct surveys that were conducted in spring 2014 involving managers of each district and 355 farmers and were sampled using random routes along the irrigation districts under consideration the questionnaires provided information about farm size crop mix irrigation technology and water use among other descriptive variables about farms in the different irrigation districts secondary information was obtained from official agricultural statistics to generate historical time series of income revenues and profitability indicators for the different crops in each district for the period 2007 2013 real life observations show that there is heterogeneity between farms regarding crop mixes agricultural practices and water use within the same irrigation district mainly due to differences in farmers objectives berkhout et al 2011 thus considering irrigation districts as units to be modeled would lead to serious aggregation bias as such for modeling purposes sufficiently homogeneous farm types are usually considered decision units to minimize this aggregation bias to define these homogenous groups of farms within each irrigation district statistical clustering techniques were used from the set of such clustering techniques we selected euclidean distance as the measure of distance between farms exemplifying features crop mix and we selected ward s method as the criterion for aggregation hair et al 2010 following this procedure different groups of farms clusters were obtained in each irrigation district with the exception of homogeneous districts with only a single crop those representing olive groves or rice systems where all farms were included in the same group berbel and rodríguez ocaña 1998 gómez limón and riesgo 2004 the resulting clusters of farms were characterized by calculating the average values of the different variables that were collected including crop mix and other variables related to farm and farmer features farm size and irrigation technology farmer s age gender educational level and agricultural training the average values for these variables were used to define the corresponding farm types as shown in table 3 these farm types were used as decision units in the model in order to simulate water trading through the water bank 4 modeling approach 4 1 farmers decision making optimizing cobb douglas maufs classical economic theory relies on the assumption that farmers behavior can be modeled by maximizing profits or any utility function with profits as a single attribute however farmers decision making processes are driven by various usually conflicting criteria in addition to the expected profit in this way it can be assumed that producers decision making is guided by the maximization of a multi attribute utility function mauf where all relevant attributes that are considered are condensed which is the main idea that underlies multi attribute utility theory maut an approach that was largely developed after the publication of the seminal work by keeney and raiffa 1976 to overcome the limitations of single attribute profit related utility functions this alternative approach has also been widely implemented for simulating farmers behavior as shown in sumpsi et al 1997 amador et al 1998 gómez limón and berbel 2000 and gómez limón et al 2004 among others given that linear specifications for maufs are easier to elicit and interpret most empirical implementations of the maut approach for simulating farmers decision making have relied on the elicitation of additive maufs usually estimated with a non interactive procedure based on weighted goal programming as suggested by sumpsi et al 1997 however it is worth pointing out that considering additive maufs implies linear indifference curves also called isoutility curves or isopreference curves a condition that is somewhat restrictive because it involves the oversimplified behavior of real decision makers this implication also makes additive maufs inaccurate when simulating actual decision making hardaker et al 2007 these limitations have encouraged authors to use more general and flexible multiplicative forms for maufs since these types of utility functions allow more real indifference curves in fact as has been shown by andré and riesgo 2007 the application of multiplicative utility functions could be more successful in reproducing farmers behavior than additive ones following this line of research we aim to simulate farmers decision making process using the cobb douglas utility function as has been proposed by gutiérrez martín and gómez gómez 2011 and gómez limón et al 2016 this choice is justified because this function is coherent with neoclassical economic theory since it guarantees that there is a global optimum when the efficient frontier is convex and because this formulation is consistent with the postulate of decreasing marginal utility for every attribute the proposed formulation of the cobb douglas mauf is as follows 1 u x a u a f a x α a where x n 1 is the vector of decision variables xc is the area devoted to each productive activity crop u a f a x is a single attribute or partial utility function related to attribute a and αa denotes the coefficient of each attribute that expresses its relative importance these coefficients are assumed to be lower than one in order to ensure decreasing marginal utility for every attribute furthermore these coefficients are assumed to sum to 1 for normalization purposes based on the abovementioned consideration farmers productive behavior can be simulated using a mathematical programming model in which the utility function 1 is the objective function to be maximized 2 1 m a x u x a 1 m u a f a x α a s t 2 2 a 1 m α a 1 2 3 ax b 2 4 x 0 where u x represents a farmer s utility in a multi attribute setting which depends on a set of m single or partial utility functions ua fa x considering all relevant attributes fa x for a producer s decision making as mentioned above the mauf proposed as the objective function is a homothetic cobb douglas function thus the objective function needs to be constrained by expression 2 2 finally the model constraints are built based on matrix a p n of technical coefficients in allocable resource constraints and vector b p 1 of available resource levels 4 2 eliciting farmers mauf to simulate the farmer s decision making process under a cobb douglas mauf it is necessary to elicit the values of the calibrating parameters αa for this purpose the values that most closely approximate the observed behavior are found following a similar procedure to that developed by sumpsi et al 1997 as explained below for operational purposes we consider that i all relevant attributes are related to the objectives that are to be maximized i e more is better attributes and ii each single attribute or partial utility function u a f a x is equal to the corresponding attribute and is properly normalized to be between 0 and 1 n f a x thus the crop mix selection x can be seen as a multi objective programming mop decision making problem gómez limón et al 2016 mop problems seek to obtain the pareto efficient subset from the feasible solutions election possibility set denoted by f assuming that whatever preferences decision makers may have their choices belong to the efficient frontier a first approximation to this efficient frontier can be assessed through the pay off matrix this matrix is obtained by maximizing each of the objectives i e partial utility functions subject to the constraints set expressions 2 2 2 4 in mathematical terms one of the advantages of the cobb douglas function is its potential to be transformed into the additive function which is as follows 3 l o g u x v x a 1 m α a l o g n f a x this transformation allows for following a similar procedure to that developed by sumpsi et al 1997 to estimate more appropriate alpha parameters by solving the following m 1 system of equations 4 1 l o g n f 11 l o g n f 1 l o g n f 12 l o g n f 1 m l o g n f 21 l o g n f 22 l

value for attribute a nfaa are the normalized values of the elements in the pay off matrix of attribute a when attribute a is optimized and n f a o b s are the normalized observed values of each attribute usually there is not an exact solution to the above system and it is therefore necessary to solve the problem by minimizing the sum of the deviational variables that find the closest set of parameters αa 5 1 min a 1 m n a p a s t 5 2 α 1 l o g n f 11 α 2 l o g n f 12 α m l o g n f 1 m n 1 p 1 log n f 1 o b s 5 3 α 1 l o g n f 21 α 2 l o g n f 22 α m l o g n f 2 m n 2 p 2 log n f 2 o b s

elicitation for the case study to model farmers decision making we selected the three most relevant attributes for irrigators in the case study considered i the expected total gross margin as a proxy of profit in the short run f 1 x g m x to be maximized ii the production risk measured as the variance of the gross margin f 2 x v a r x to be minimized and iii the total labor f 3 x t l x as a proxy of managerial complexity also to be minimized the concrete formulations of these attributes are explained in the next section each of these attributes are defined as a mathematical function of decision variables the area covered by alternative productive activity x in our case study these activities are denoted by xi where i means the crop and j indicates the irrigation technique used as explained above for operational purposes partial utilities functions must be normalized in order to transform them into more is better and dimensionless functions with values varying within the interval 0 1 n f a x aiming to fulfil these requirements we propose transforming the original attribute functions into rates of success with respect to the ideal value of each attribute gm var and tl respectively thus the normalized attributes can be represented as follows 6 n f g m x g m x g m n f v a r x v a r v a r x n f t l x t l t l x note that more is better attributes such as g m x are normalized differently than less is better attributes such as v a r x or t l x for the former the ideal values the largest possible values are in the denominator and for the latter the ideal values the smallest possible values are in the numerator thus it can be checked that by proceeding in this way all normalized attributes are related with more is better objectives and that their values range between 0 and 1 thus the shape of the mauf to be used for modeling purposes is 7 u x n f g m x α g m n f v a r x α v a r n f t l x α t l where the alpha parameters are estimated by running model 5 4 4 modeling farmers decision making considering water bank operations to simulate water bank operations it is necessary to know how farmers would react if they could sell or purchase water through this kind of water market thus in addition to variables x it must be considered that farmers can also make decisions regarding the quantity of water sold to the bank or water bank purchases denoted by wbp or the quantity of water purchased from the bank or water banks sales denoted by wbs considering these two new decision variables farmers decision making process in this setting can be simulated by the following model 8 1 m a x u x n f g m x α g m n f v a r x α v a r n f t l x α t l 8 2 g m x i j p i y i j s i v c i j x i j w p p w b p w p s w b s 8 3 v a r x x t cov x 8 4 t l x i j t l i j x i j s t 8 5 i j x i j f a 8 6 i j x i j w i j δ w a f a w b s w b p 8 7 ax b 8 8 x i j w b p w b s 0 i j eqs 8 2 to 8 4 are mathematical representations of partial utility functions thus the farm gross margin is calculated as the sum of total income including both product sales crop price p i multiplied by yield per crop and irrigation technique y i j and coupled subsidies s i minus the variable costs from crops vc i j furthermore considering the operations in water markets the gross margin also includes the income from the water sold to the bank water price wp p multiplied by the quantity of water purchased by the bank wbp and the cost derived from the water bought from the bank water price wps by the quantity of water sold by the bank wbs risk is calculated in eq 8 3 as the variance of the gross margin where cov is the variance covariance matrix of the gross margins of crops per hectare during the period 2007 2013 the last attribute is total labor which is calculated in eq 8 4 as the sum of labor requirements per crop and the irrigation technique tli for the entire farm constraints 8 5 and 8 6 are related to land and water availability respectively the first constraint limits the total area covered by the different alternatives to the farm size fa the water constraint establishes that irrigation water requirements cannot exceed water availability the former being the sum of water requirements per alternative and the latter is the water allotment provided by the water agency considering farm size fa water rights granted per hectare wa and resource availability at the basin level water availability coefficient δ plus minus the quantity of water purchased sold from to the water bank wbs wbp eq 8 7 denotes the other constraints that define the feasible solution set for this purpose the following restrictions were considered i agronomic practices allowing only those rotational practices actually followed by farmers ii permanent crops fruit and olive groves fixing the area covered by each of these crops in the short run iii irrigation techniques constraining the area irrigated by each irrigation system surface sprinkler and drip as irrigation equipment is also fixed in the short term iv sugar beet and cotton quotas limiting the maximum area devoted to each of these two crops because of agricultural policy production quotas and v market constraints for perishable agricultural products such as tomatoes garlic onions and carrots because of limited marketing channels finally we also establish that decision variables xi wbp and wbs must be non negative as denoted by eq 8 8 4 5 simulation model for a water bank at the basin level the potential performance of the water bank that is proposed for trading temporary water rights was simulated considering that first the bank implements a public offer to purchase these rights and afterwards it sells all the rights that were previously bought through a public sale offering with both tenders organized considering centralized trading rules i e a monopsony market for right purchases and monopoly market for sales for this purpose a two step procedure is implemented the first step is the estimation of the aggregate demand and supply curves at the basin level these curves are estimated by aggregating the results of the models that were developed for the 15 representative farm types see table 3 accounting for the relative weight of each type over the total irrigated area at the basin level the aggregation procedure followed for this purpose is double sided firstly farm type models were run in order to simulate the purchases of temporary water rights by the bank from willing sellers for this purpose the value of wp p has been parametrized from 0 00 m3 to 1 00 m3 thus by running these models the aggregate supply of temporary rights is estimated that is the total quantity of water that the bank could buy for every purchase price secondly the same farm type models were run in order to parametrize the value of wp s from 0 00 m3 to 1 00 m3 which allowed us to built the aggregate demand of temporary rights that is the total amount of water that the bank could sell to farmers that are willing to buy additional water at each sale price it is worth pointing out that this first step was implemented for three scenarios of water availability to simulate droughts with different values for the coefficient of water availability δ for our case study the values of 0 75 moderate drought only 75 of water rights are available 0 50 severe drought only 50 of water rights available and 0 25 extreme drought only 25 of water rights are available were considered 2 2 this simplification can be considered plausible enough for modeling purposes since most of the irrigated area in the basin are located within the same water management system where all available water resources are shared i e they have the same annual water allotment in any case the same modeling approach could be used considering different δ parameters for each irrigation districts if required for simulating heterogenous water availability fig 2 shows the resulting aggregate demand and supply curves in each of these scenarios once aggregate demand and supply curves are estimated the second step in the procedure is calculating the amount of water that the bank should trade assuming that the proposed public water bank is a non profit and non subsidized institution that is willing to optimize water use efficiency its objective should be to maximize the quantity of water that is reallocated among irrigators considering only the constraint that wp p wp s in the absence of operational costs this maximum is reached in every scenario of water availability when the aggregate demand and supply curves intersect in this point the optimum bank outcome fulfils two conditions a the quantity of water purchased is equal to the quantity of water sold q p q s and b purchase price is equal to the sale price wp p wp s thus to achieve this outcome the bank should implement a public offer to purchase temporary water rights at price wp p in a monopsonistic market buying the amount of water q p afterward it should organize a public offer to sell at the same price in a monopolistic market then selling the same amount of water if non null operational costs are considered the purchase price should be lower than the sale price wp p wp s in order to allow the public agency that is in charge of the bank operations to cover its costs with its own income assumption of non subsidized institution in this situation the maximization of water traded i e maximum efficiency in water use is achieved by fixing wp p and wp s as close to each other as possible with the difference between both prices serving only to cover the costs of water bank operations borne by the public agency thus to reach the optimum bank outcome with operational cost we graphically looked for the gap between aggregate demand and supply whose value is equal to the operational costs considered equaling the amount of water purchased and sold q s q p the prices for aggregated supply wp p and demand wp s for this situation would be the prices to be used by the bank for the public offer to purchase temporary water rights in a monopsonistic market and for the public offer to sell them in a monopolistic market respectively an accurate estimate of water bank operation costs for this case study is beyond the scope of this work in any case for illustrative purposes only staff from the júcar and guadiana water agencies who have already created and managed water banks and other experts were consulted and they roughly estimate that these costs for the guadalquivir basin would fall within a range from 1 to 2 million euros annually because it is assumed that the simulated water bank is not a subsidized institution a different water price for water purchases and sales will be applied in order to generate a positive net public revenue to cover all operational costs borne by the public agency for this purpose the difference wp p wp s has been parameterized from 0 01 m3 to 0 03 m3 allowing us to analyze the impact of this differential price strategy on the quantity of water traded the economic and social effects and the public income needed to cover these costs it is worth clarifying that the optimal bank outcome that is reached as explained above is equivalent to the market equilibrium provided by a hypothetical perfect competitive spot water market or a passive water bank that operates through a clearing house this kind of water bank does not use its own budget to buy and sell but acts only as an intermediary thus it is relevant to remark that the optimal reallocation of water resources from an economic point of view maximum efficiency of water use can be reached by several water trading instruments including active water banks the bank outcome that was calculated as explained above can provide useful information about the potential economic efficiency that is reachable with this trading instrument however to assess this potential performance it is also relevant to consider the social impact of the instrument which can be estimated by measuring the changes in employment generation in our modeling approach these changes are calculated by comparing simulated agricultural labor demand for the different drought scenarios with and without water bank reallocations for both scenarios labor demand is estimated based on the crop mixes that are implemented in each case as temporary water rights are transferred from extensive and low value added activities to more intensive and profitable crops it is expected that water reallocation leads to an aggregated net increase in employment generation with the labor increase in water buying farms being higher than labor losses in water selling farms 5 results 5 1 elicited utility functions running the calibration procedures as explained in the model 5 the sets of calibration parameters α a have been elicited in order to obtain the maufs that are to be optimized by each farm type considered in this way table 4 shows the results obtained table 4 also shows two indexes of calibration goodness measuring the differences between the observed values and the simulated values when the utility function is maximized the first index is the mean squared error mse which measures these differences in the space of attributes 9 m s e a 1 m f a o b s x f a x f a o b s x 2 m the second is the finger kreinin fk similarity index which measures the differences in the space of decision variables i e crop areas 10 f k s i m i l a r i t y i n d e x i j m i n x i j f a x i j o b s f a the results provided by both indexes show that calibration procedure proposed offers a reasonably good approximation of farmers decision making 5 2 water bank performance without operational costs this second sub section analyzes the outcomes that were obtained from the simulations of different scenarios of water availability the coefficient of water availability δ equals 0 75 0 50 or 0 25 in the ideal case where operational costs of zero are considered i e market balance achieved for wp p wp s these scenario simulations are interesting for two reasons first these results show the maximum potential of water banks to increase economic efficiency second these simulations also display the performance of a subsidized water bank when all transactions costs are covered by the public budget fig 2 shows the resulting aggregated curves for purchases and sales in each of three water availability scenarios as we can see when water availability is reduced to 75 of water rights moderate drought δ 0 75 the equilibrium price managed by the water bank reaches 0 15 m3 involving 381 mm3 of water traded for the intermediate scenario that simulates a severe drought δ 0 50 the purchase and sale prices reach 0 24 m3 and 363 mm3 of water is exchanged finally when the drought is extreme δ 0 25 the clearing price is 0 38 m3 and 259 mm3 is exchanged the water prices and quantities of water traded that were obtained for each scenario are also shown in table 5 this quantitative assessment clearly shows that despite the decrease in water quantity traded in absolute terms mm3 as water availability is reduced the percentage of water exchanged over the total water used at the basin level increases as the drought becomes more acute in fact this percentage reaches 38 9 for the extreme drought scenario while for the moderate drought scenario the water bank only mobilizes 19 1 of the total usable water these results can be compared with previous work that focused on simulating the spot water market in the same river basin without operational costs in this sense it is worth quoting the work of arriaza et al 2002 where potential of water markets were analyzed in a single irrigation district el bajo guadalquivir showing that a reduction of water availability in a 50 annual allotment of 2670 m3 ha would lead to equilibrium price of 0 15 m3 exchanging only 4 of total water used similarly calatrava and garrido 2005 analyzed the impact of a spot water market in another irrigation district within the grb guadalmellato and their estimates show that a water allotment of only 50 compared with a normal hydric year annual allotment of 2800 m3 ha would require that 21 of total water used was reallocated among irrigators at a price of 0 12 m3 it is worth noting that both works simulated local water markets irrigation district level this scope is much lower than that considered in this paper basin level the latter of which allows much more users higher heterogeneity in water utility to participate in the exchanges which could explain why the estimates reported here suggest a more active reallocation in terms of the share of water resources exchanged considering the five categories of irrigation districts that are explained in section 3 the results show that in general the farm types located in modernized irrigation areas type c2 are willing to purchase water when a moderate drought occurs some of these farms the more profitable ones those oriented to fruit and vegetable crops also continue to acquire water from the water bank in severe drought situations however only farm types with perennial crops fruit citrus and olive groves are willing to purchase water when an extreme drought is in place 3 3 in the scenarios of extreme and severe droughts a previously approved drought plan is implemented assuring a minimum allocation of water for perennial crops in order to avoid the collapse of the orchards however it is worth pointing out that this allocation does not allow any profitable production thus in drought situations farmers with permanent crops are willing to participate in the bank purchasing water to obtain a complete harvest the farm types located in the traditional rice irrigated areas type c5 are the main sellers in all drought situations for severe and extreme droughts less profitable farm types located in traditional annual crops irrigated areas type c1 also behave as sellers to the water bank because of the differential behavior of farm types described above water transfers have different effects on cropping patterns farm types with higher water productivity mostly in c2 and c3 irrigated areas can afford to purchase water from the bank and during moderate water shortages these farms do not need to modify their usual cropping patterns those implemented under normal hydrological conditions rather changes in crop mixes occur only during severe and extreme droughts these changes being more relevant as water scarcity became more acute on the other hand farm types with low water productivity crops mainly in c5 and c1 irrigated areas change their usual crop mixes to crops with lower water requirements in every simulated scenario eventually switching to rain fed crops in severe and extreme droughts table 5 also shows the performance of the water bank in terms of economic profit changes in the agricultural sector and public revenue and social changes in labor demand in the agricultural sector impacts when the water availability equals 75 of water rights in the absence of a water bank there are significant profit losses in the irrigation sector at the basin level estimated to be 54 9 m 4 9 of the aggregated profit at full water availability in contrast the simulation results indicate that the creation of a water bank would reduce these losses to 19 3 m only 1 7 of aggregated profit under normal hydrologic conditions thus compared to the current situation without a water bank the operations of the water bank proposed in this drought scenario would increase economic efficiency at the basin level by 35 6 m 3 2 of normal aggregated profit clearly the profit losses are larger both in absolute and relative terms when the drought is more severe however for severe and extreme drought episodes the water bank considered here has a more relevant role as a water efficiency enhancer since the market operations implemented by the water bank could increase the aggregated profit by 56 2 m and 52 8 m 5 0 and 4 7 of normal aggregated profit respectively these results clearly demonstrate the potential of water banks to increase economic efficiency in the grb regarding economic impacts it is clear that a water bank management strategy that aims to maximize the amount of water exchanged i e wp p wp s involves a net public revenue of zero thus considering that in a real world setting the transaction costs that are borne by the public water agency are not negligible the implementation of this market strategy would lead to a hidden subsidy that is equal to all costs actually covered by the agency in order to create and manage the water bank in the next section this point will be further discussed finally with respect to social impacts table 5 also shows how the water bank led to a reduction in the aggregated losses of labor demand at the basin level for all drought scenarios considered for example when a severe drought is in place the labor demand in the irrigation sector is reduced by 6 5 if no water market instrument is implemented however this loss can be reduced to only 2 0 if a water bank is considered an instrument for managing water scarcity because the water bank favors the maintenance of the most profitable crops which also require the most labor in fact as seen in table 5 the role of a water bank proposed as an economic instrument to mitigate the negative social impacts of water shortages is more relevant when the drought is more acute both in absolute and relative terms these results also indicate the potential of water banks to improve the management of drought periods in the grb from a social perspective 5 3 performance water banks with operational costs this section analyzes the simulated outcomes accounting for the water bank operation costs that are borne by the public agency that manages the water bank this agency would thus implement a differential water price between water purchases and sales wp p wp s generating a net positive public revenue that aims to cover these costs table 6 shows the results obtained for the different scenarios of reduced water availability the coefficient of water availability δ equals to 0 75 0 50 or 0 25 when there is a difference of 0 01 m3 0 02 m3 and 0 03 m3 between the purchase and sale price similar to the case in which water bank operation costs are assumed to be zero the results measure the performance of the proposed water bank in terms of the clearing prices volumes of water transferred aggregated gross margin in agricultural sector public revenues and total demand for labor the first result worth noting is that implementing a differential price of only 0 01 m3 would be enough to cover all public transactions costs that are incurred from the creation and management of a water bank in the grb in fact the net public revenues that would be generated would range from 3 8 m for the case of a moderate drought δ 0 75 to 2 6 m for the case of an extreme drought δ 0 25 far above the estimated costs 1 2 m annually therefore this minimum differential price strategy would be enough for cost recovery thus avoiding the need to subsidize this market institution focusing on the results for a differential price of 0 01 m3 the water quantities exchanged by the water bank are very similar to those reported in the case where water bank operation costs were zero in fact the quantities are almost the same for the moderate and extreme drought situations and are only 26 mm3 lower 8 less from 363 to 337 mm3 for a severe drought these findings are in line with those of garrido 2000 who simulated a spot water market between four irrigation districts in the grb and found that with operation costs of 0 006 m3 and with a water availability of 50 18 2 of used water would be traded however this study shows that in case that these costs increase up to 0 018 m3 market activity would be reduced to 15 3 over the region s total water availability these similar water exchanges involve similar economic and social performances for example when implementing a differential price of 0 01 m3 in an extreme drought situation the losses are 372 1 m only 2 6 m more than the performance achieved without implementing such a differential price moreover this difference is equivalent to the net public revenue generated in this case this result means that the economic inefficiency produced by implementing a differential price strategy is negligible at this level regarding social impacts there is no difference between the results obtained in this simulated scenario and those when considering water bank operation costs of zero as shown in table 6 only an insignificant economic inefficiency appears for a severe drought scenario in this case since the price of the water exchanged is slightly lower the profit losses when water bank is operating are 155 6 m 3 7 m more than the performance achieved when no differential price is implemented however in this case the public revenue is only 3 4 m meaning that recovering the water bank operation costs would lead to an economic inefficiency of 0 3 m which is less than 0 1 of the aggregated profit slightly more relevant is the change in social performance since the decrease in aggregated labor demand in this case is 15 higher than the scenario in which no differential price strategy is implemented increasing from 751 to 863 awus although the scenarios considering differential price strategies of 0 02 m3 and 0 03 m3 are more than needed to recover costs one point is worth noting the relatively large increase in economic efficiency generated by the operation of the water bank would allow for the implementation of reasonable differential price strategies i e less than 0 03 m3 without significantly impacting market performance both in economic and social terms thus there is room to consider water banks not only as an instrument for enhancing economic efficiency regarding water use but also as a mechanism for collecting extra water fees in case this is considered necessary by decision makers 6 concluding remarks although the implementation of a publicly run active water bank is usually suggested as a demand side policy instrument for reallocating water resources during drought periods there is little evidence regarding their potential performance this study attempts to fill this gap in empirical knowledge by simulating the implementation of this kind of water bank taking into account different future scenarios of reduced water availability cyclical scarcity at the basin level for this purpose the bank proposed it is assumed to operate during drought periods first implementing public offers to purchase temporary rights and afterwards selling all the rights that were previously bought through public sale offerings the key idea guiding this proactive strategy is that by fixing purchase and sale prices properly this bank could maximize the quantity of water that is reallocated among irrigators thus enhancing water use efficiency in a similar way to a spot water market or a passive water bank operating through a clearing house although the potential outcomes of all these water trading instruments could be similar in terms of increased water use efficiency it is worth noting that the proposed active water bank has the advantages of involving lower operation costs and more effective control over market operations reducing environmental and social negative externalities the analysis of this case study guadalquivir river basin yielded evidence that the implementation of a water bank could lead to large water transfers potentially ranging from 19 of the total water used in the case of a moderate drought to almost 40 in case of an extreme drought this traded water is accompanied by an increase in farmers total profit i e an increase in the economic efficiency and in the aggregated agricultural labor demand i e positive social impact enhancing rural development both of these positive impacts serve to minimize the effects of cyclical scarcity in fact the more severe the drought is the greater the increase in profit and labor demand will be the outcomes obtained from the simulation of different water availability scenarios show that a difference in the purchase and sales prices of only 0 01 m3 would be enough to cover all operational costs that are borne by the public agency that manages the bank moreover the results demonstrate that a strategy that employs differential prices greater than 0 01 m3 could generate an extra source of public revenue without significantly affecting bank performance in terms of economic efficiency or labor demand these results lead to the conclusion that a water bank that is designed to reallocate water resources between irrigators is a very useful instrument for coping with cyclical scarcity in closed basins such as the grb since water trading would significantly mitigate the negative effects of droughts in this sense we suggest that policymakers pay attention to this economic instrument to improve water management and encourage the creation of drought water banks nonetheless it should be noted that water banks should not be considered panaceas for solving all management problems during drought periods in fact these tools should be just understood as complementary economic instruments and should be combined with other demand side policy instruments moreover the results reported in this paper must be understood as the maximum potential performance of the water bank proposed for implementation the simulation model presented here ignores some possible barriers to trade that are difficult to model when using mathematical programming techniques such as legal administrative cultural psychological technical and environmental barriers in fact although the proposed water trading instrument could minimize many of the barriers all but technical and environmental ones it should be noted that these limitations of the model could lead to overestimating the amount of water traded and the increase in economic efficiency in this sense further research is suggested to refine this kind of modeling approach especially by considering a more realistic constraints related to physical connectivity among agents also including groundwater users b transportation costs when transfers require specific infrastructures and c environmental constraints to maintain minimum environmental water flows as fixed in the basin management plan in any case all abovementioned limitations should not cloud the results that suggest the promising potential performance of the proposed active water plan as an instrument to enhance water use efficiency during drought periods in this regard further research is also suggested to analyze other alternative management strategies for active water banks such as implementing auction systems for water bank purchases and sales in order to minimize private agents

11556,poor soil conditions and drought stress are two main factors restricting the agriculture production in arid and semiarid areas of china the ridge furrow film mulching rffm cultivation pattern has been shown to have the ability of improving yield and water productivity wp of maize wheat and potato however its effect on winter oilseed rape is not clear a two year 2014 2016 field experiment was conducted to determine whether the rffm cultivation pattern has the potential of improving winter oilseed rape productivity under dryland conditions the optimal nitrogen n application rate for winter oilseed rape maximum yield under the rffm cultivation pattern was also measured winter oilseed rape was planted in rffm and flat cultivation patterns both with six nitrogen n application rates 0 60 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 the results showed that compared to the flat cultivation pattern the rffm cultivation pattern greatly increased leaf area index lai by 18 7 on average aboveground dry matter adm by 25 6 at harvest seed yield by 23 8 and wp by 32 7 and decreased evapotranspiration et by 7 2 application of n fertilizer remarkably increased lai adm et seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape under both cultivation patterns under the rffm cultivation pattern average seed yield wp and economic benefit in 240 kg n ha 1 were 2904 kg ha 1 8 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 1259 6 ha 1 respectively and were significantly higher than the other five n rates the optimal n application amount for maximum winter oilseed rape productivity under the rffm cultivation pattern was found to be 240 kg n ha 1 in conclusion the rffm cultivation pattern has the potential of improving the seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape in northwest china keywords cultivation pattern nitrogen fertilization dryland winter oilseed rape water productivity economic benefit 1 introduction droughts majorly limit crop production in arid and semiarid regions of northwest china huang et al 2005 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 low yields have been reported in spring wheat about 1500 3000 kg ha 1 and maize 2500 3500 kg ha 1 crops in areas where heat leads to high evaporation and rainfall is sparse and unevenly distributed hu et al 2009 huang et al 2005 wang et al 2008 film mulching is an important agricultural technique for improving soil moisture and crop yields gan et al 2013 the ridge furrow planting pattern has also been widely applied to conserve soil water during crop production li et al 2007 the combination of the two techniques has been termed the ridge furrow film mulching rffm planting pattern which employs ridges mulched with plastic film to serve as the runoff area and furrows used as the planting area li et al 2001 li and gong 2002 numerous studies have demonstrated that the rffm planting pattern significantly improves soil water availability crop yield and water productivity wp in maize wang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wheat li et al 2017 zhang et al 2007 and potato qin et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 however the rffm planting pattern has rarely been tested in oilseed rape brassica napus l for yield improvements in areas where soil evaporation is high oilseed rape is one of the most widely cultivated oil crops throughout the world as one of the leading rapeseed producing countries china generated an annual average of 12 6 million tons of seeds from 2001 to 2014 faostat 2016 chinese rapeseed yields have steadily increased over the last five decades not only due to the introduction of high yield potential cultivars and the improved agronomic practices but also the higher nitrogen based fertilizer inputs hamzei and soltani 2012 rathke et al 2006 however excessive use of n fertilizers not only causes a huge waste of resources and economic losses but also adversely impacts the environment godfray et al 2010 thereby affecting the safety of human beings hvistendahl 2010 oilseed rape response to n fertilizers is dependent upon many environmental factors including water availability ambient temperature and soil properties rathke et al 2006 rffm planting pattern has been suggested to have an effect on soil n transport n mineralization and plant n uptake through its effect on soil temperature and moisture wang et al 2015 all of these factors may alter the responses of oilseed rape to n fertilization affecting seed yield the objectives of the present study were to examine the coupling effects of the rffm planting pattern and n fertilizer on leaf area index aboveground dry matter evapotranspiration seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape results from this study may provide information that can be used to 1 determine whether the rffm planting pattern has the potential to improve winter oilseed rape productivity and 2 offer insight into optimum n application rates under the rffm system for high oilseed rape yields and wp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas at the ministry of education 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m asl northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china from september 2014 to may 2016 the average annual precipitation and pan evaporation were approximately 632 mm and 1500 mm respectively the mean temperature was 12 9 c the duration of sunlight was 2164 h and the frost free period was more than 210 d the experimental field soil was a loam with a field capacity of 24 0 dry bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 the nutrient properties of the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows soil organic matter 12 18 g kg 1 nitrate nitrogen 76 01 mg kg 1 olsen phosphorus 25 22 mg kg 1 nh4oac extracted potassium 132 97 mg kg 1 ph water 8 14 at the beginning of 2014 2015 and the corresponding data were 12 57 g kg 1 73 93 mg kg 1 24 80 mg kg 1 133 62 mg kg 1 and 8 13 respectively at the beginning of 2015 2016 monthly mean temperatures during the two experimental seasons followed a similar trend and were close to the mean value of 2006 2014 while the temperature in january 2015 was higher than the mean value of 2006 2014 fig 1 total rainfall during the growing period was 264 3 mm and 183 9 mm for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and the mean rainfall during the growing period in 2006 2014 was about 263 mm at the experimental site march to may is the stem elongation flowering and pod filling stages of winter oilseed rape occurring in northwest china rainfall from march to may in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was 178 7 and 48 1 mm which was 33 4 more and 64 1 lower than the mean value of 2006 2014 134 mm respectively 2 2 experimental design field experiments for each season were arranged on a split plot design with the cultivation pattern as the main plot and the n levels as the subplot each plot was 20 m2 4 m 5 m in size and three replicates were conducted in each season two cultivation patterns were involved in the experiment ridge furrow film mulching fig 2 a and flat planting fig 2b methods each cultivation pattern had six n levels 0 n0 60 n60 120 n120 180 n180 240 n240 and 300 n300 kg n ha 1 in the form of urea n 46 and were all applied as basal fertilizer in addition calcium super phosphate p2o5 16 potassium sulphate k2o 51 and borax b 11 were applied at rates of 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 120 kg k2o ha 1 and 15 kg b ha 1 in each plot before oilseed rape was sown no additional fertilizer was applied during the growth of the oilseed rape after ploughing and leveling the experimental field dividing the experimental plots and applying all basal fertilizers in each plot the ridges and furrows as shown in fig 2a were formed seeds of winter rape shaanyou no 107 were manually sown on 21 september 2014 and 16 september 2015 transparent plastic film 0 8 m wide and 0 008 mm thick was laid over the soil surface layer of ridges immediately after emergence for the rffm treatments fig 2a plant density was determined as 120 000 plants ha 1 at the fifth leaf stage by manually thinning seedlings other field production practices such as weed and pest control were conducted to minimise yield loss the plastic film was gathered and recycled after the crop was harvested on 23 may 2015 and 20 may 2016 no irrigation was applied during the growth of winter oilseed rape for both seasons 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 leaf area index lai and aboveground dry matter adm a total of 12 plants in each plot were cut at ground level about every 30 days to determine leaf area index lai and aboveground dry matter adm the plants were separated into stems leaves pods and seeds leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter li 3100c li cor inc usa lai was defined as the ratio of total one sided leaf area to ground surface area behrens and diepenbrock 2006 after the leaf area was measured each separated organ was dried in an oven for 30 min at 105 c to deactivate enzymes then dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed adm was the sum of the weights of the dry stem leaf pod and seed 2 3 2 soil moisture before sowing after harvesting and at each plant sampling time soil moisture to a depth of 200 cm was determined for calculating soil water storage in the soil profiles in each growing season three soil cores per plot were manually sampled at 10 cm intervals between adjacent plants within a row and the gravimetric water content of the soil samples was calculated on the basis of oven dried weights dried at 105 c soil water storage was defined as 1 sws 10γhω where sws is soil water storage mm γ is soil dry bulk density g cm 3 h is soil thickness cm and ω is gravimetric water content evapotranspiration was calculated using the equation for the soil water balance 2 et i p r d w 0 w 1 where et is evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation amount mm which equalled to zero in each treatment because no irrigation was applied in this study p is precipitation mm r is runoff mm which was assumed to be zero as no heavy rain occurred and the experimental soil had a good infiltration rate and also each plot was protected by a 50 cm bund in this study d is deep drainage into the lower boundary of 200 cm mm which was assumed to be negligible in this study because no heavy rains appeared during the rapeseed growing seasons and w 0 and w 1 are the swss before sowing and after harvesting mm respectively 2 3 3 seed yield and water productivity wp plants were manually harvested from an area of 1 m2 in the middle of each plot and were threshed after being sun dried to determine seed yield water productivity was calculated as 3 wp y et where wp and y are the water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 and seed yield kg ha 1 of winter rape respectively 2 4 data analysis all data were presented as the mean value of three replicates the analysis of variance was conducted by spss 18 0 and the significant differences between the treatments were compared by the least significant differences test at 5 probability origin 8 0 was used to make graphics 3 results 3 1 leaf area index lai as shown in tables 1 and 2 lai varied at different growth stages and constantly changed overtime lai had no significant response to n fertilizer at the first two and the last samplings under the rffm cultivation condition or the flat cultivation condition however lai was significantly influenced by n levels at the other five time points in both cultivation patterns and growth seasons tables 1 and 2 from the third to seventh determination the n240 treatment resulted in the largest lai followed by n180 and n300 however no significant differences were found among the three n levels in both cultivation patterns and growth seasons the n0 treatment always produced the lowest lai and was always significantly lower than the other five n levels the rffm cultivation pattern increased lai throughout the entire growth stages of winter oilseed rape in comparison to flat cultivation pattern tables 1 and 2 for flat cultivation treatments the average lai of the six n levels was around 0 68 by mid november around 0 94 by mid january increased to larger than 2 30 by mid april and then sharply declined to about 0 17 the corresponding lai for the rffm cultivation treatments was much larger than non film mulching the lai was around 0 85 by mid november around 1 12 by mid january increased to larger than 2 65 by mid april and then sharply reduced to about 0 23 3 2 aboveground dry matter adm at any time of determinations the adm in the rffm cultivation treatment was significantly higher than that in flat cultivation treatment tables 3 and 4 at maturity the average adm of the six n levels was 9268 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 7957 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 for rffm cultivation treatment while was 7518 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 6195 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 for flat cultivation treatment the former being 23 3 higher in 2014 2015 and 28 4 higher in 2015 2016 than the latter adm of winter oilseed rape had no significant response to n fertilizer under either the rffm cultivation or flat cultivation patterns at the first two determinations tables 3 and 4 after the first two sampling times adm in n application treatments was markedly higher than that without n application and adm was almost increased until n rate reaching 240 kg ha 1 and then slightly decreased when n rate was 300 kg ha 1 at oilseed rape maturity the adm in n240 was significantly higher than in n60 and n120 treatments and had no marked differences with n180 and n300 treatments in both cultivation patterns and growing seasons 3 3 evapotranspiration et as shown in tables 5 6 7 and 8 et of winter oilseed rape was affected by both cultivation patterns and n levels in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 throughout the experiment et was low at early growth stages and high at vigorous growth stages especially in march april and may et at each determination was always higher in flat cultivation treatments than in rffm cultivation treatments at the same n levels tables 5 6 7 and 8 rffm cultivation treatments substantially decreased total et of winter oilseed rape on average rffm cultivation treatments consumed 324 0 mm ha 1 and 312 0 mm ha 1 water in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and the corresponding data in flat cultivation treatments were 354 5 mm ha 1 and 331 0 mm ha 1 respectively in addition some other differences were also found between rffm cultivation and flat cultivation conditions et under rffm cultivation treatments was lower at early growth stages and was higher at vigorous growth stages than et under flat cultivation treatments application of n fertilizer increased the et of winter oilseed rape the et continually increased from n0 to n300 at each determination in both cultivation patterns and growth seasons tables 5 6 7 and 8 using the average of total et to make comparisons under the rffm cultivation conditions the n fertilized treatments consumed 330 8 mm ha 1 and 319 5 mm ha 1 water on average and the control n0 290 3 mm ha 1 and 274 5 mm ha 1 water in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively under the flat cultivation conditions the n fertilized treatments consumed 361 6 mm ha 1 and 337 0 mm ha 1 water on average and n0 319 1 mm ha 1 and 298 3 mm ha 1 water in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively 3 4 seed yield and water productivity wp seed yield initially increased and then decreased with the increase of n levels in both seasons and cultivation patterns table 9 in the flat cultivation condition treatment seed yield significantly increased among the n0 to n180 treatments in both seasons seed yield began to reduce when n levels rose to 240 kg ha 1 however no significant difference was found between n180 and n240 while seed yield was markedly decreased when n level rose to 300 kg ha 1 in the rffm cultivation condition treatment n240 obtained a significantly higher seed yield than other n levels in both seasons and the average seed yield in n240 was 8 0 215 0 kg ha 1 and 11 2 292 5 kg ha 1 greater than in n180 and n300 respectively the effect of cultivation patterns on seed yield was consistent in both seasons seed yield in the rffm cultivation treatments was consecutively higher than in flat cultivation treatments by 22 0 438 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and by 26 0 414 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 table 9 applying n fertilizer significantly improved wp of winter oilseed rape regardless of growth seasons and cultivation patterns table 9 compared to n0 average wp of the other five n levels was improved by 55 0 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the rffm cultivation condition and 56 1 2 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the flat cultivation condition in the rffm cultivation condition n240 produced a significantly higher wp than in the other five n levels in both seasons in the flat cultivation condition n180 achieved the highest wp among the six n levels however no significant differences were found between n180 and n240 and the wp of these two nitrogen treatments in both seasons were significantly higher than the other n levels the rffm cultivation pattern greatly increased seed yield and reduced et thus improving wp table 9 rffm cultivation substantially improved wp by 32 1 1 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2014 2015 and 33 3 1 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2015 2016 respectively when compared to the flat cultivation treatments in addition seed yield and wp in 2014 2015 were 21 1 and 15 6 higher in film mulching conditions and 25 0 and 16 7 higher in non film mulching conditions than in 2015 2016 3 5 relationship among seed yield et and wp relationships between seed yield and et and wp and et under the rffm cultivation and flat cultivation conditions are shown in fig 3 the slopes of correlation between seed yield and et and wp and et in rffm cultivation condition were 27 676 and 0 068 respectively and were much higher than the corresponding data 19 835 and 0 044 in the flat cultivation condition treatment these results confirmed that seed yield and wp are much higher in rffm cultivation condition than in flat cultivation condition when the plants of winter rapeseed consumed same amount of water 3 6 economic benefit economic benefit was assessed from five aspects rapeseed yield establishment for cultivation pattern fertilizer weed control and harvest table 10 the highest economic benefit in both seasons was found in n240 averaged 1259 6 ha 1 for rffm cultivation pattern and n180 averaged 1010 9 ha 1 for flat cultivation pattern respectively the economic benefit was lower in rffm cultivation pattern than in flat cultivation pattern in both seasons when n rate was 0 kg ha 1 while when n rate was up to 120 kg ha 1 the economic benefit in rffm cultivation pattern was 43 9 ha 1 higher than in flat cultivation pattern the gap between the economic benefit of rffm and flat cultivation pattern reached its peak at 240 kg n ha 1 averaged 282 3 ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 growth characteristics the rffm planting system more efficiently uses sparse precipitation by harvesting and retaining rainwater from the ridges and offering water to crop plants in the furrows compared with flat farming practices zhou et al 2009 it has been reported that the rffm planting pattern exhibits rainwater harvesting efficiency as high as 87 due to better use of light rainfalls 5 mm li et al 2000 additionally studies have shown that film mulching effectively increases the temperature of topsoil ramakrishna et al 2006 wang et al 2015 increased soil temperature and higher volumes of retained water as a consequence of rffm conditions have resulted in boosted plant vigor and enhanced canopy size li et al 2015 qin et al 2014 in the present study results showed that lai and adm were always higher under rffm treatments than under flat cultivation treatments at same n application rates tables 1 2 3 and 4 adequate levels of n fertilization have been shown to accelerate crop growth increase dry matter accumulation and expand leaf area rossini et al 2011 however in the current study lai and adm had no significant response to n fertilizer under either the rffm cultivation conditions or the flat cultivation conditions at first two determinations this was a result of the indigenous soil n being adequate for plant nutrient requirement as n application rates increased both lai and adm began to show an escalated response until the n rate reached 240 kg ha 1 the decrease in lai and adm at nitrogen rates of 300 kg n ha 1 suggests that excessive use of n would not promote winter oilseed rape growth corroborating reports have shown that the growth of winter oilseed rape is very poor with low n supply and adm in lower n input treatments is only 21 9 60 0 of the adm in the high n input treatments ren et al 2017 however in our study adm in n0 and n60 treatments accounted for 52 8 66 1 and 65 9 84 1 of the adm in other four n application rates respectively the differences might be caused by the different climates varieties and cultivation patterns 4 2 et understanding the et rates of a cropping system helps improve water management and efficiency other studies have shown that compared to the flat cultivation pattern the rffm cultivation pattern significantly decreases the et of maize by 6 0 31 0 mm zhou et al 2009 wheat by about 50 mm zhang et al 2007 and potato by 9 9 12 6 mm qin et al 2014 in our study the rffm cultivation pattern decreased the et of winter oilseed rape by 12 6 34 1 mm compared to the flat cultivation pattern plastic mulches on the soil surface have been shown to conserve water by suppressing soil evaporation especially early in the crop season when the crop canopy is small bond and willis 1969 at the seedling stage of winter oilseed rape from september to february et under the rffm treatment was 40 4 61 3 mm lower than et under the flat cultivation treatment the main reasons might be due to rffm could make better use of light rains collected by mulching ridges and retained more water in the soil li et al 2000 in addition the plastic film can intercept the moisture and heat exchange between ground and atmosphere and then decreased the soil evaporation jalota and prihar 1990 larger canopies under rffm treatments will shade the soil surface and also reduce the soil evaporation li et al 2015 by reducing soil evaporation when the canopy is small during the early growth period maintained soil water will be used for plant transpiration and increase water productivity later in the season li et al 2008 in our study from winter oilseed rape stem elongation to the maturity stage the rffm cultivation pattern increased et by 15 2 29 8 mm compared to the flat cultivation pattern the application of n fertilizers plays a very important role to increase plant transpiration in turn increasing crop et reports have shown that compared to no n addition the et of maize in n fertilized plots increased by 44 9 120 9 mm under plastic film mulching conditions li et al 2015 additionally even in flat cultivation conditions the et of winter oilseed rape in n fertilized plots was 16 0 68 0 mm higher than when no nitrogen was amended to the soils gu et al 2016b in our study the et of winter oilseed rape increased with rising n application and the n fertilized plots increased et by 20 4 60 5 mm and 15 7 60 9 mm in comparison to the n0 under the rffm and flat cultivation patterns respectively 4 3 yield and wp in the present study the rffm cultivation pattern significantly improved yield and wp of winter oilseed rape compared to the flat cultivation pattern over both growing seasons this result was consistent with previous studies in maize gao et al 2014 and potato qin et al 2014 the differences in yields and wp found in the two cultivation conditions may be due to 1 higher lai and adm in the rffm cultivation treatments than in the flat cultivation pattern was consistent throughout the crop growth periods 2 the rffm cultivation pattern lowers soil evaporation increases the infiltration of rainwater into the soil and enhances the retention of soil water ramakrishna et al 2006 and 3 the rffm cultivation pattern increases the diameter and weight of taproots and significantly induced the proliferation of lateral roots gu et al 2016a higher taproot diameter and weight can improve the lodging resistance of oilseed rape ma et al 2010 and higher lateral root proliferation can increase nutrient and water uptake by oilseed rape hammer et al 2009 the two of which could make an important contribution to the rapeseed yield n fertilizers are very important for significantly increasing wp and crop yield liu 2000 li et al 2009 in many cases even when film mulching is properly conducted the crop yield and wp are still very low because n nutrients were deficient in the soils li et al 2009 yield and wp of winter oilseed rape have increased by 22 0 37 1 and 7 5 18 1 respectively when 100 260 kg n ha 1 are applied gu et al 2016b zou et al 2011 reported that seed yield is improved by 200 2850 kg ha 1 under n application treatments in most regions of china the present study showed that when the n application rate was 0 or 60 kg ha 1 the seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape under the rffm cultivation pattern ranged from 1229 to 1742 kg ha 1 and from 4 5 to 5 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively when the n application rate reached 240 kg ha 1 seed yield and wp were increased by 112 0 122 1 and 77 8 90 0 in comparison to the n0 treatment and by 65 0 83 8 and 53 8 69 6 in comparison to n60 in both growth seasons seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape in 2014 2015 were higher than in 2015 2016 this may be because there was 130 6 mm more rainfall during 2014 2015 in march april and may when the flowering and pod filling stages of winter oilseed rape in northwestern china occur this demonstrates that irrigation should be carefully monitored and only applied at the flowering and pod filling stages this is especially dire for regions where irrigation water is scarce and efficiency is the key to achieve a higher seed yield 4 4 finding an optimal n application rate it is well documented that n fertilizer applications increase crop yields significantly however excess n has been shown to hinder yields hu et al 2013 kirda et al 2005 in addition n fertilization must be monitored and modulated as excessive n fertilization poses a real danger to environmental safety morell et al 2011 understanding optimal n application rates for different crop systems is the key to maximize yields profits and environmental security in the present study seed yield wp and economic benefit of winter oilseed rape significantly increased from n0 to n240 application rates then significantly decreased at the n300 rate under the rffm cultivation pattern however in the flat cultivation pattern the seed yield wp and economic benefit significantly increased from n0 to n180 application rates and remained stable up to a rate of n240 followed by a significant reduction at n300 application rate these results showed that the optimal n application rates for winter oilseed rape are 240 and 180 kg ha 1 under the rffm and flat cultivation patterns respectively in northwest china 5 conclusions rffm cultivation pattern significantly improved lai adm rapeseed yield and wp meanwhile significantly decreased et of winter oilseed rape in comparison to flat cultivation without mulching in addition n240 treatment obtained the significantly higher seed yield and wp than the other five n levels under rffm cultivation pattern present study indicated that rffm cultivation pattern has the potential of improving winter oilseed rape productivity in arid and semiarid regions with the optimal n application rate of 240 kg ha 1 further study is mainly needed to evaluate 1 the optimal n application level of winter oilseed rape under ridge furrow planting pattern covered by biodegradable film ridges or straw furrows and 2 the soil nutrient condition microorganism enzymatic activity especially the distribution and leaching of nitrate n under different cultivation patterns and n levels acknowledgements this research was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest china

11556,poor soil conditions and drought stress are two main factors restricting the agriculture production in arid and semiarid areas of china the ridge furrow film mulching rffm cultivation pattern has been shown to have the ability of improving yield and water productivity wp of maize wheat and potato however its effect on winter oilseed rape is not clear a two year 2014 2016 field experiment was conducted to determine whether the rffm cultivation pattern has the potential of improving winter oilseed rape productivity under dryland conditions the optimal nitrogen n application rate for winter oilseed rape maximum yield under the rffm cultivation pattern was also measured winter oilseed rape was planted in rffm and flat cultivation patterns both with six nitrogen n application rates 0 60 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 the results showed that compared to the flat cultivation pattern the rffm cultivation pattern greatly increased leaf area index lai by 18 7 on average aboveground dry matter adm by 25 6 at harvest seed yield by 23 8 and wp by 32 7 and decreased evapotranspiration et by 7 2 application of n fertilizer remarkably increased lai adm et seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape under both cultivation patterns under the rffm cultivation pattern average seed yield wp and economic benefit in 240 kg n ha 1 were 2904 kg ha 1 8 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 1259 6 ha 1 respectively and were significantly higher than the other five n rates the optimal n application amount for maximum winter oilseed rape productivity under the rffm cultivation pattern was found to be 240 kg n ha 1 in conclusion the rffm cultivation pattern has the potential of improving the seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape in northwest china keywords cultivation pattern nitrogen fertilization dryland winter oilseed rape water productivity economic benefit 1 introduction droughts majorly limit crop production in arid and semiarid regions of northwest china huang et al 2005 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 low yields have been reported in spring wheat about 1500 3000 kg ha 1 and maize 2500 3500 kg ha 1 crops in areas where heat leads to high evaporation and rainfall is sparse and unevenly distributed hu et al 2009 huang et al 2005 wang et al 2008 film mulching is an important agricultural technique for improving soil moisture and crop yields gan et al 2013 the ridge furrow planting pattern has also been widely applied to conserve soil water during crop production li et al 2007 the combination of the two techniques has been termed the ridge furrow film mulching rffm planting pattern which employs ridges mulched with plastic film to serve as the runoff area and furrows used as the planting area li et al 2001 li and gong 2002 numerous studies have demonstrated that the rffm planting pattern significantly improves soil water availability crop yield and water productivity wp in maize wang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 wheat li et al 2017 zhang et al 2007 and potato qin et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 however the rffm planting pattern has rarely been tested in oilseed rape brassica napus l for yield improvements in areas where soil evaporation is high oilseed rape is one of the most widely cultivated oil crops throughout the world as one of the leading rapeseed producing countries china generated an annual average of 12 6 million tons of seeds from 2001 to 2014 faostat 2016 chinese rapeseed yields have steadily increased over the last five decades not only due to the introduction of high yield potential cultivars and the improved agronomic practices but also the higher nitrogen based fertilizer inputs hamzei and soltani 2012 rathke et al 2006 however excessive use of n fertilizers not only causes a huge waste of resources and economic losses but also adversely impacts the environment godfray et al 2010 thereby affecting the safety of human beings hvistendahl 2010 oilseed rape response to n fertilizers is dependent upon many environmental factors including water availability ambient temperature and soil properties rathke et al 2006 rffm planting pattern has been suggested to have an effect on soil n transport n mineralization and plant n uptake through its effect on soil temperature and moisture wang et al 2015 all of these factors may alter the responses of oilseed rape to n fertilization affecting seed yield the objectives of the present study were to examine the coupling effects of the rffm planting pattern and n fertilizer on leaf area index aboveground dry matter evapotranspiration seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape results from this study may provide information that can be used to 1 determine whether the rffm planting pattern has the potential to improve winter oilseed rape productivity and 2 offer insight into optimum n application rates under the rffm system for high oilseed rape yields and wp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas at the ministry of education 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m asl northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china from september 2014 to may 2016 the average annual precipitation and pan evaporation were approximately 632 mm and 1500 mm respectively the mean temperature was 12 9 c the duration of sunlight was 2164 h and the frost free period was more than 210 d the experimental field soil was a loam with a field capacity of 24 0 dry bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 the nutrient properties of the 0 20 cm soil layer were as follows soil organic matter 12 18 g kg 1 nitrate nitrogen 76 01 mg kg 1 olsen phosphorus 25 22 mg kg 1 nh4oac extracted potassium 132 97 mg kg 1 ph water 8 14 at the beginning of 2014 2015 and the corresponding data were 12 57 g kg 1 73 93 mg kg 1 24 80 mg kg 1 133 62 mg kg 1 and 8 13 respectively at the beginning of 2015 2016 monthly mean temperatures during the two experimental seasons followed a similar trend and were close to the mean value of 2006 2014 while the temperature in january 2015 was higher than the mean value of 2006 2014 fig 1 total rainfall during the growing period was 264 3 mm and 183 9 mm for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and the mean rainfall during the growing period in 2006 2014 was about 263 mm at the experimental site march to may is the stem elongation flowering and pod filling stages of winter oilseed rape occurring in northwest china rainfall from march to may in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was 178 7 and 48 1 mm which was 33 4 more and 64 1 lower than the mean value of 2006 2014 134 mm respectively 2 2 experimental design field experiments for each season were arranged on a split plot design with the cultivation pattern as the main plot and the n levels as the subplot each plot was 20 m2 4 m 5 m in size and three replicates were conducted in each season two cultivation patterns were involved in the experiment ridge furrow film mulching fig 2 a and flat planting fig 2b methods each cultivation pattern had six n levels 0 n0 60 n60 120 n120 180 n180 240 n240 and 300 n300 kg n ha 1 in the form of urea n 46 and were all applied as basal fertilizer in addition calcium super phosphate p2o5 16 potassium sulphate k2o 51 and borax b 11 were applied at rates of 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 120 kg k2o ha 1 and 15 kg b ha 1 in each plot before oilseed rape was sown no additional fertilizer was applied during the growth of the oilseed rape after ploughing and leveling the experimental field dividing the experimental plots and applying all basal fertilizers in each plot the ridges and furrows as shown in fig 2a were formed seeds of winter rape shaanyou no 107 were manually sown on 21 september 2014 and 16 september 2015 transparent plastic film 0 8 m wide and 0 008 mm thick was laid over the soil surface layer of ridges immediately after emergence for the rffm treatments fig 2a plant density was determined as 120 000 plants ha 1 at the fifth leaf stage by manually thinning seedlings other field production practices such as weed and pest control were conducted to minimise yield loss the plastic film was gathered and recycled after the crop was harvested on 23 may 2015 and 20 may 2016 no irrigation was applied during the growth of winter oilseed rape for both seasons 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 leaf area index lai and aboveground dry matter adm a total of 12 plants in each plot were cut at ground level about every 30 days to determine leaf area index lai and aboveground dry matter adm the plants were separated into stems leaves pods and seeds leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter li 3100c li cor inc usa lai was defined as the ratio of total one sided leaf area to ground surface area behrens and diepenbrock 2006 after the leaf area was measured each separated organ was dried in an oven for 30 min at 105 c to deactivate enzymes then dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed adm was the sum of the weights of the dry stem leaf pod and seed 2 3 2 soil moisture before sowing after harvesting and at each plant sampling time soil moisture to a depth of 200 cm was determined for calculating soil water storage in the soil profiles in each growing season three soil cores per plot were manually sampled at 10 cm intervals between adjacent plants within a row and the gravimetric water content of the soil samples was calculated on the basis of oven dried weights dried at 105 c soil water storage was defined as 1 sws 10γhω where sws is soil water storage mm γ is soil dry bulk density g cm 3 h is soil thickness cm and ω is gravimetric water content evapotranspiration was calculated using the equation for the soil water balance 2 et i p r d w 0 w 1 where et is evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation amount mm which equalled to zero in each treatment because no irrigation was applied in this study p is precipitation mm r is runoff mm which was assumed to be zero as no heavy rain occurred and the experimental soil had a good infiltration rate and also each plot was protected by a 50 cm bund in this study d is deep drainage into the lower boundary of 200 cm mm which was assumed to be negligible in this study because no heavy rains appeared during the rapeseed growing seasons and w 0 and w 1 are the swss before sowing and after harvesting mm respectively 2 3 3 seed yield and water productivity wp plants were manually harvested from an area of 1 m2 in the middle of each plot and were threshed after being sun dried to determine seed yield water productivity was calculated as 3 wp y et where wp and y are the water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 and seed yield kg ha 1 of winter rape respectively 2 4 data analysis all data were presented as the mean value of three replicates the analysis of variance was conducted by spss 18 0 and the significant differences between the treatments were compared by the least significant differences test at 5 probability origin 8 0 was used to make graphics 3 results 3 1 leaf area index lai as shown in tables 1 and 2 lai varied at different growth stages and constantly changed overtime lai had no significant response to n fertilizer at the first two and the last samplings under the rffm cultivation condition or the flat cultivation condition however lai was significantly influenced by n levels at the other five time points in both cultivation patterns and growth seasons tables 1 and 2 from the third to seventh determination the n240 treatment resulted in the largest lai followed by n180 and n300 however no significant differences were found among the three n levels in both cultivation patterns and growth seasons the n0 treatment always produced the lowest lai and was always significantly lower than the other five n levels the rffm cultivation pattern increased lai throughout the entire growth stages of winter oilseed rape in comparison to flat cultivation pattern tables 1 and 2 for flat cultivation treatments the average lai of the six n levels was around 0 68 by mid november around 0 94 by mid january increased to larger than 2 30 by mid april and then sharply declined to about 0 17 the corresponding lai for the rffm cultivation treatments was much larger than non film mulching the lai was around 0 85 by mid november around 1 12 by mid january increased to larger than 2 65 by mid april and then sharply reduced to about 0 23 3 2 aboveground dry matter adm at any time of determinations the adm in the rffm cultivation treatment was significantly higher than that in flat cultivation treatment tables 3 and 4 at maturity the average adm of the six n levels was 9268 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 7957 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 for rffm cultivation treatment while was 7518 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 6195 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 for flat cultivation treatment the former being 23 3 higher in 2014 2015 and 28 4 higher in 2015 2016 than the latter adm of winter oilseed rape had no significant response to n fertilizer under either the rffm cultivation or flat cultivation patterns at the first two determinations tables 3 and 4 after the first two sampling times adm in n application treatments was markedly higher than that without n application and adm was almost increased until n rate reaching 240 kg ha 1 and then slightly decreased when n rate was 300 kg ha 1 at oilseed rape maturity the adm in n240 was significantly higher than in n60 and n120 treatments and had no marked differences with n180 and n300 treatments in both cultivation patterns and growing seasons 3 3 evapotranspiration et as shown in tables 5 6 7 and 8 et of winter oilseed rape was affected by both cultivation patterns and n levels in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 throughout the experiment et was low at early growth stages and high at vigorous growth stages especially in march april and may et at each determination was always higher in flat cultivation treatments than in rffm cultivation treatments at the same n levels tables 5 6 7 and 8 rffm cultivation treatments substantially decreased total et of winter oilseed rape on average rffm cultivation treatments consumed 324 0 mm ha 1 and 312 0 mm ha 1 water in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and the corresponding data in flat cultivation treatments were 354 5 mm ha 1 and 331 0 mm ha 1 respectively in addition some other differences were also found between rffm cultivation and flat cultivation conditions et under rffm cultivation treatments was lower at early growth stages and was higher at vigorous growth stages than et under flat cultivation treatments application of n fertilizer increased the et of winter oilseed rape the et continually increased from n0 to n300 at each determination in both cultivation patterns and growth seasons tables 5 6 7 and 8 using the average of total et to make comparisons under the rffm cultivation conditions the n fertilized treatments consumed 330 8 mm ha 1 and 319 5 mm ha 1 water on average and the control n0 290 3 mm ha 1 and 274 5 mm ha 1 water in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively under the flat cultivation conditions the n fertilized treatments consumed 361 6 mm ha 1 and 337 0 mm ha 1 water on average and n0 319 1 mm ha 1 and 298 3 mm ha 1 water in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively 3 4 seed yield and water productivity wp seed yield initially increased and then decreased with the increase of n levels in both seasons and cultivation patterns table 9 in the flat cultivation condition treatment seed yield significantly increased among the n0 to n180 treatments in both seasons seed yield began to reduce when n levels rose to 240 kg ha 1 however no significant difference was found between n180 and n240 while seed yield was markedly decreased when n level rose to 300 kg ha 1 in the rffm cultivation condition treatment n240 obtained a significantly higher seed yield than other n levels in both seasons and the average seed yield in n240 was 8 0 215 0 kg ha 1 and 11 2 292 5 kg ha 1 greater than in n180 and n300 respectively the effect of cultivation patterns on seed yield was consistent in both seasons seed yield in the rffm cultivation treatments was consecutively higher than in flat cultivation treatments by 22 0 438 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and by 26 0 414 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 table 9 applying n fertilizer significantly improved wp of winter oilseed rape regardless of growth seasons and cultivation patterns table 9 compared to n0 average wp of the other five n levels was improved by 55 0 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the rffm cultivation condition and 56 1 2 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the flat cultivation condition in the rffm cultivation condition n240 produced a significantly higher wp than in the other five n levels in both seasons in the flat cultivation condition n180 achieved the highest wp among the six n levels however no significant differences were found between n180 and n240 and the wp of these two nitrogen treatments in both seasons were significantly higher than the other n levels the rffm cultivation pattern greatly increased seed yield and reduced et thus improving wp table 9 rffm cultivation substantially improved wp by 32 1 1 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2014 2015 and 33 3 1 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2015 2016 respectively when compared to the flat cultivation treatments in addition seed yield and wp in 2014 2015 were 21 1 and 15 6 higher in film mulching conditions and 25 0 and 16 7 higher in non film mulching conditions than in 2015 2016 3 5 relationship among seed yield et and wp relationships between seed yield and et and wp and et under the rffm cultivation and flat cultivation conditions are shown in fig 3 the slopes of correlation between seed yield and et and wp and et in rffm cultivation condition were 27 676 and 0 068 respectively and were much higher than the corresponding data 19 835 and 0 044 in the flat cultivation condition treatment these results confirmed that seed yield and wp are much higher in rffm cultivation condition than in flat cultivation condition when the plants of winter rapeseed consumed same amount of water 3 6 economic benefit economic benefit was assessed from five aspects rapeseed yield establishment for cultivation pattern fertilizer weed control and harvest table 10 the highest economic benefit in both seasons was found in n240 averaged 1259 6 ha 1 for rffm cultivation pattern and n180 averaged 1010 9 ha 1 for flat cultivation pattern respectively the economic benefit was lower in rffm cultivation pattern than in flat cultivation pattern in both seasons when n rate was 0 kg ha 1 while when n rate was up to 120 kg ha 1 the economic benefit in rffm cultivation pattern was 43 9 ha 1 higher than in flat cultivation pattern the gap between the economic benefit of rffm and flat cultivation pattern reached its peak at 240 kg n ha 1 averaged 282 3 ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 growth characteristics the rffm planting system more efficiently uses sparse precipitation by harvesting and retaining rainwater from the ridges and offering water to crop plants in the furrows compared with flat farming practices zhou et al 2009 it has been reported that the rffm planting pattern exhibits rainwater harvesting efficiency as high as 87 due to better use of light rainfalls 5 mm li et al 2000 additionally studies have shown that film mulching effectively increases the temperature of topsoil ramakrishna et al 2006 wang et al 2015 increased soil temperature and higher volumes of retained water as a consequence of rffm conditions have resulted in boosted plant vigor and enhanced canopy size li et al 2015 qin et al 2014 in the present study results showed that lai and adm were always higher under rffm treatments than under flat cultivation treatments at same n application rates tables 1 2 3 and 4 adequate levels of n fertilization have been shown to accelerate crop growth increase dry matter accumulation and expand leaf area rossini et al 2011 however in the current study lai and adm had no significant response to n fertilizer under either the rffm cultivation conditions or the flat cultivation conditions at first two determinations this was a result of the indigenous soil n being adequate for plant nutrient requirement as n application rates increased both lai and adm began to show an escalated response until the n rate reached 240 kg ha 1 the decrease in lai and adm at nitrogen rates of 300 kg n ha 1 suggests that excessive use of n would not promote winter oilseed rape growth corroborating reports have shown that the growth of winter oilseed rape is very poor with low n supply and adm in lower n input treatments is only 21 9 60 0 of the adm in the high n input treatments ren et al 2017 however in our study adm in n0 and n60 treatments accounted for 52 8 66 1 and 65 9 84 1 of the adm in other four n application rates respectively the differences might be caused by the different climates varieties and cultivation patterns 4 2 et understanding the et rates of a cropping system helps improve water management and efficiency other studies have shown that compared to the flat cultivation pattern the rffm cultivation pattern significantly decreases the et of maize by 6 0 31 0 mm zhou et al 2009 wheat by about 50 mm zhang et al 2007 and potato by 9 9 12 6 mm qin et al 2014 in our study the rffm cultivation pattern decreased the et of winter oilseed rape by 12 6 34 1 mm compared to the flat cultivation pattern plastic mulches on the soil surface have been shown to conserve water by suppressing soil evaporation especially early in the crop season when the crop canopy is small bond and willis 1969 at the seedling stage of winter oilseed rape from september to february et under the rffm treatment was 40 4 61 3 mm lower than et under the flat cultivation treatment the main reasons might be due to rffm could make better use of light rains collected by mulching ridges and retained more water in the soil li et al 2000 in addition the plastic film can intercept the moisture and heat exchange between ground and atmosphere and then decreased the soil evaporation jalota and prihar 1990 larger canopies under rffm treatments will shade the soil surface and also reduce the soil evaporation li et al 2015 by reducing soil evaporation when the canopy is small during the early growth period maintained soil water will be used for plant transpiration and increase water productivity later in the season li et al 2008 in our study from winter oilseed rape stem elongation to the maturity stage the rffm cultivation pattern increased et by 15 2 29 8 mm compared to the flat cultivation pattern the application of n fertilizers plays a very important role to increase plant transpiration in turn increasing crop et reports have shown that compared to no n addition the et of maize in n fertilized plots increased by 44 9 120 9 mm under plastic film mulching conditions li et al 2015 additionally even in flat cultivation conditions the et of winter oilseed rape in n fertilized plots was 16 0 68 0 mm higher than when no nitrogen was amended to the soils gu et al 2016b in our study the et of winter oilseed rape increased with rising n application and the n fertilized plots increased et by 20 4 60 5 mm and 15 7 60 9 mm in comparison to the n0 under the rffm and flat cultivation patterns respectively 4 3 yield and wp in the present study the rffm cultivation pattern significantly improved yield and wp of winter oilseed rape compared to the flat cultivation pattern over both growing seasons this result was consistent with previous studies in maize gao et al 2014 and potato qin et al 2014 the differences in yields and wp found in the two cultivation conditions may be due to 1 higher lai and adm in the rffm cultivation treatments than in the flat cultivation pattern was consistent throughout the crop growth periods 2 the rffm cultivation pattern lowers soil evaporation increases the infiltration of rainwater into the soil and enhances the retention of soil water ramakrishna et al 2006 and 3 the rffm cultivation pattern increases the diameter and weight of taproots and significantly induced the proliferation of lateral roots gu et al 2016a higher taproot diameter and weight can improve the lodging resistance of oilseed rape ma et al 2010 and higher lateral root proliferation can increase nutrient and water uptake by oilseed rape hammer et al 2009 the two of which could make an important contribution to the rapeseed yield n fertilizers are very important for significantly increasing wp and crop yield liu 2000 li et al 2009 in many cases even when film mulching is properly conducted the crop yield and wp are still very low because n nutrients were deficient in the soils li et al 2009 yield and wp of winter oilseed rape have increased by 22 0 37 1 and 7 5 18 1 respectively when 100 260 kg n ha 1 are applied gu et al 2016b zou et al 2011 reported that seed yield is improved by 200 2850 kg ha 1 under n application treatments in most regions of china the present study showed that when the n application rate was 0 or 60 kg ha 1 the seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape under the rffm cultivation pattern ranged from 1229 to 1742 kg ha 1 and from 4 5 to 5 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively when the n application rate reached 240 kg ha 1 seed yield and wp were increased by 112 0 122 1 and 77 8 90 0 in comparison to the n0 treatment and by 65 0 83 8 and 53 8 69 6 in comparison to n60 in both growth seasons seed yield and wp of winter oilseed rape in 2014 2015 were higher than in 2015 2016 this may be because there was 130 6 mm more rainfall during 2014 2015 in march april and may when the flowering and pod filling stages of winter oilseed rape in northwestern china occur this demonstrates that irrigation should be carefully monitored and only applied at the flowering and pod filling stages this is especially dire for regions where irrigation water is scarce and efficiency is the key to achieve a higher seed yield 4 4 finding an optimal n application rate it is well documented that n fertilizer applications increase crop yields significantly however excess n has been shown to hinder yields hu et al 2013 kirda et al 2005 in addition n fertilization must be monitored and modulated as excessive n fertilization poses a real danger to environmental safety morell et al 2011 understanding optimal n application rates for different crop systems is the key to maximize yields profits and environmental security in the present study seed yield wp and economic benefit of winter oilseed rape significantly increased from n0 to n240 application rates then significantly decreased at the n300 rate under the rffm cultivation pattern however in the flat cultivation pattern the seed yield wp and economic benefit significantly increased from n0 to n180 application rates and remained stable up to a rate of n240 followed by a significant reduction at n300 application rate these results showed that the optimal n application rates for winter oilseed rape are 240 and 180 kg ha 1 under the rffm and flat cultivation patterns respectively in northwest china 5 conclusions rffm cultivation pattern significantly improved lai adm rapeseed yield and wp meanwhile significantly decreased et of winter oilseed rape in comparison to flat cultivation without mulching in addition n240 treatment obtained the significantly higher seed yield and wp than the other five n levels under rffm cultivation pattern present study indicated that rffm cultivation pattern has the potential of improving winter oilseed rape productivity in arid and semiarid regions with the optimal n application rate of 240 kg ha 1 further study is mainly needed to evaluate 1 the optimal n application level of winter oilseed rape under ridge furrow planting pattern covered by biodegradable film ridges or straw furrows and 2 the soil nutrient condition microorganism enzymatic activity especially the distribution and leaching of nitrate n under different cultivation patterns and n levels acknowledgements this research was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest china

11557,applying fertilizer through drip irrigation system is a very important method to save fertilizer and labour three manifold layouts water supply in one end for transversal drip tapes m1 water supply in both ends for transversal drip tapes m2 and water supply in one end for longitudinal drip tapes m3 and four different fertilizer solution concentrations 50 00 g l 1 c1 66 67 g l 1 c2 100 g l 1 c3 and 200 g l 1 c4 were selected to investigated the effect of the manifold and concentration on water fertigation uniformity results showed that the emitter at the extreme end of the manifold needed more time to clean the rudimental fertilizer in the drip tapes the minimal flushing time increased from 8 to 13 4 to 7 and 7 to 12 min with increasing the fertilizer concentration from c1 to c4 for m1 m2 and m3 respectively the drip irrigation system needed more time for flushing to reduce the risk of emitter clogging when a higher fertilizer solution concentration was applied in order of performance m2 had the highest water and fertilizer uniformity followed by m3 and lastly by m1 the fertilizer solution concentration had no significant effect on water distribution however it had a significant effect on fertilizer distribution the mass of the applied fertilizer for the drip tapes close to the inlet increased with increasing fertilizer solution concentration from c1 to c4 which indicated that higher fertilizer solution concentration can result in lower fertilizer distribution uniformity there was a significant effect of the manifold layout on water uniformity the fertilizer concentration and the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had no significant effect on the water uniformity similarly both the manifold layout and concentration had a significant effect on fertilizer uniformity the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had a significant effect on the christiansen s uniformity cu and distribution uniformity du for fertilizer whilst a significant effect on emission uniformity eu was not found the manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration should therefore be considered in the design and operation of fertigation system keywords fertigation flushing time water distribution fertilizer distribution proportional injector 1 introduction drip irrigation has the potential to offer a precise flexible and high level irrigation management method demir et al 2007 ella et al 2009 yurdem et al 2015 it can be adapted to different cropping patterns and climates fertigation is the application of fertilizer to a crop through an irrigation system bar yosef 1999 watts and martin 1981 showed that fertigation has several advantages over conventional blended fertilizer such as lower fertilizer inputs reduced nutrient leaching flexibility in scheduling to meet crop demands and lower costs lamm et al 2001 stated that accurate application of nitrogen through drip irrigation can enhance crop yields and reduce the potential for groundwater contamination from nitrates fertigation is expected to play a major role in the future to efficiently meet demands of fertilizer and minimise environmental consequences of irrigation brahma et al 2010 kumari and kaushal 2014 li et al 2016 however several factors such as injector type manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration can potentially affect the water and fertilizer uniformity of the drip fertigation system the effect of injector type on fertigation uniformity has already been widely investigated bracy et al 2003 obtained better fertilizer distribution uniformity with the proportional injector compared with the continuously diluting injector in a greenhouse experiment li et al 2007 evaluated the effects of different injector types on the fertigation uniformity of subsurface drip irrigation systems and the proportional injector was recommended for the design of fertigation system fan et al 2016 assessed the proportional injector differential pressure tank and venturi injector and indicated that the proportional injector resulted better fertilizer uniformity hence the proportional injector is generally preferred for most fertigation applications due to its high accuracy in metering fertilizer into the system bracy et al 2003 han et al 2010 li et al 2016 moreover the injector type manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration are additional factors that affect the water and fertilizer uniformity of drip irrigation systems sun 2014 compared the water uniformity of longitudinal and transverse lateral layouts in the greenhouse and reported that the water uniformity of the transverse lateral layout was greater than that of the longitudinal arrangement due to the larger pressure head losses from the longer lateral length bomfim et al 2014 evaluated the uniformity of potassium distribution for a drip irrigation system and indicated that the potassium concentration decreased linearly with increasing distance between injection point and drip tape inlet fan et al 2016 also evaluated the effect of differential pressures and piping arrangements on fertigation uniformity through field experiments and indicated that the water distribution uniformity was higher than the fertilizer distribution uniformity for water supply from one end and from the middle longitudinally some researchers also have focused on fertilizer solution concentration nemali and van iersel 2004 evaluated the effects of photosynthetic photon flux fertilizer concentrations and the interaction on growth rate dong et al 2006 studied the nitrate nitrogen concentration distribution characteristics under single point source infiltration with different fertilizer solution concentrations based on an indoor experiment kumar et al 2012 evaluated the injection rate of a commercially available venturi injector under different differential pressure and fertilizer solution concentration few studies have been carried out to evaluate the influence of manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration on fertigation distribution uniformity of drip irrigation system hence the specific objectives of this research were to evaluate the effect of manifold layout concentration and their interaction on fertigation uniformity and provide the design and manage basis for a drip irrigation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 fertilizer injection device fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the proportional injector which was installed directly in the water supply line the pump operates without the electrical motor it uses the flow of water as the power source to activate the motor piston which takes up the required percentage of concentrate and injects it into the water inside the pump the injected solution is mixed with the water and the water pressure forces the mixed solution downstream the setting injection ratio can be adjusted by changing the dosing piston stroke in the piston chamber the d25re2 proportional injector from the dosatron international s a s rue pascal france was selected for this study table 1 presents the technical parameters of the proportional injector the inlet and outlet inside diameter were 19 mm the working pressure ranged from 0 02 to 0 6 mpa and the setting injection ratio ranged from 0 2 to 2 0 2 2 performance testing for emitter the drip tapes with internally embedded sticking patch emitters shanghai huawei water saving irrigation corp ltd china were used as laterals which have a nominal diameter of 16 mm a wall thickness of 0 6 mm an emitter spacing of 30 cm a nominal flow rate of 2 7 l h 1 with an operating pressure of 100 kpa fig 2 shows detail of the performance testing for emitter five lateral lines were used in the test and each one with five emitters the manufacturing variability of emitter flow rate variation coefficient cv was one important index to evaluate the hydraulic performance of emitter which can be calculated by the following equation 1 c v s q ave 100 where cv is the manufacturing variability of emitter flow rate variation coefficient dimensionless dimensionless s is the standard deviation of the emitter flow rate of the sample and q ave is the emitter average flow rate of the sample 2 3 field experiments field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of different manifold layouts and different solution concentrations on fertilization time and fertigation uniformity for the drip irrigation system based on the most common glasshouse size in china an identical area with the length and width of 40 m 7 m was chosen as the test field three manifold layouts shown in fig 3 were investigated in this study namely water supply in one end for transversal drip tapes m1 water supply in both ends for transversal drip tapes m2 water supply in one end for longitudinal drip tapes m3 respectively for m1 and m2 seven 40 m long drip tapes with 1 m spacing between the drip tapes were installed in the field however the drip tapes were interrupted in the middle in order to ease flushing for m2 for m3 40 7 m long drip tapes with 1 m spacing between the drip tapes were installed in the field a total of 40 points on the drip tapes were sampled to investigate the fertigation uniformity according to the asae standard ep458 asae 2003 for m1 and m2 shown in fig 3a and b four drip tapes were selected and each one had 10 sampled points with the spacing of 4 m wide to ensure better representation and consistency for m3 shown in fig 3c ten drip tapes were selected and each one had four sampled points with the spacing of 1 5 m wide to investigate the fertilizer travel time in drip irrigation system m1 m2 and m3 had four additional sampled points to monitor the variation of fertilizer solution concentration the concentration of each additional sampled point was measured every minute when the fertilizer solution began to inject into the drip irrigation system in the field experiment a pump was used to increase water pressure and two pressure gauges with an accuracy of 0 4 were installed in the upstream and downstream of the proportional injector to monitor the differential pressure for each experiment the differential pressure of the proportional injector was fixed at about 100 kpa the pressure at the outlet of the drip irrigation system was kept at 100 kpa to keep the drip tape working under normal operating pressure the same amount of water 2 5 m3 was applied for each experiment and the drip irrigation system was allowed to run for about one hour potassium chloride kcl was selected as the fertilizer because it is readily soluble and ionizes easily in water for each experiment 1 kg of kcl was dissolved in sufficient water and then the solution was agitated for several minutes to maintain sufficient mixing and obtain a uniform initial fertilizer concentration the solubility of kcl was tested and it was 344 g l 1 at 20 c table 1 shows the different fertilizer solution volumes and concentrations with the same applied fertilizer amount of 1 kg four different concentrations of 50 00 c1 66 67 c2 100 c3 and 200 g l 1 c4 were taken to research the effect of different concentration on fertigation uniformity the injection ratio of the proportional injector was set as 2 0 in the experiments fresh water was applied in the drip fertigation system during the initial 15 min to stabilise the system and then fertilizer solution was injected into the system through proportional injector until the fertilizer solution was finished finally the drip tape was flushed with the remaining applied water after the completion of each experiment the solution volume in each catch can was measured using a cylinder and the electrical conductivity ec value of the solution was determined by an ec meter barron and ashton 2005 indicated that the uncompensated ec obtained from the ec meter needs to be converted to a compensated ec at a reference temperature of 25 c and then a regression equation can be used to represent the relationship between concentration and compensated ec fertilizer amount in each catch can was obtained by multiplying the volume by the concentration hence an ec meter hm digital inc culver ca usa with the characteristics of automatic temperature compensation was used for the measurement a total of twelve field experiments were conducted and for each combination of manifold layout and concentration three replications were carried out 2 4 evaluation indexes for drip irrigation system several mathematical definitions have been proposed and used to describe the uniformity of a system christiansen s uniformity coefficient christiansen 1942 was defined to evaluate irrigation systems and has the strongest historical precedent in the irrigation industry it is defined as 2 c u 100 1 0 x i x m x i where cu is christiansen s uniformity coefficient xi is measured depth volume or mass of water in equally spaced catch cans on a grid xm is mean depth volume or mass of water of the catch in all cans the uniformity for surface irrigation systems is most commonly characterized by distribution uniformity defined as the average depth infiltrated in the low one quarter of the field divided by the average depth infiltrated over the entire field expressed as 3 d u 100 d l q d a v where du is distribution uniformity dlq is average emitter discharge on one quarter of the field with the least infiltration dav is average emitter discharge over the entire field the variability of emitter flow rate caused by variations in orifice structure and hydraulic performance can result from inadequate manufacturing quality control emission uniformity has been one of the most frequently used criteria for micro irrigation design and evaluation barragan et al 2006 keller and karmeli 1974 defined an empirical design emission uniformity relationship for drip irrigation system as 4 e u 100 1 0 1 27 c v n q min q a where eu is emission uniformity n is number of emitters q min is minimum emitter flow rate q a is the average emitter flow rate the evaluated system can be classified using the merriam and keller 1978 proposed criterion values as shown in table 2 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using the microsoft excel 2010 microsoft corporation redmond ws usa tukey s pairwise comparison was used to identify the significance and a p value of less than 0 05 and 0 01 was considered significant and extremely significant respectively 3 results 3 1 emitter performance table 3 presents the flow rate of the emitter with normal operating pressure 100 kpa the maximum deviation between the first and second measurements was always less than 2 0 which means the emitters used in the experiment have a good hydraulic performance in terms of flow rate uniformity fig 4 presents the relationship between the flow rate and the operating pressure and an equation was obtained using regression analysis 5 q 0 217 p 0 55 where q is the flow rate of the emitter l h 1 and p is the operating pressure kpa the equation had very high determination coefficient r 2 0 9965 the measured flow rate at the nominal operating pressure 100 kpa was very close to the reported value by the manufacturer the manufacturing variability of emitter was 1 80 and less than 5 0 solomon 1979 indicated that the coefficient of variation for emitters typically range from 3 to 20 and emitters with cv values less than 20 are acceptable for micro irrigation system which means the emitters used in the study were acceptable 3 2 calibration of the relationship between ec and concentration the relationship between compensated ec and solution concentration is shown in fig 5 it was observed from fig 5 that the preferred relationship between compensated ec values and fertilizer solution concentration was linear the regression equation was determined as 6 c 0 8536 ec25 0 7743 where c is the fertilizer solution concentration g l 1 and ec25 is the compensated ec value ms cm 1 the coefficient of determination for eq 6 was 0 9975 which indicated that this equation fitted the measured data well and can be used to calculate the applied fertilizer amount in each catch can 3 3 fertilization time the fertilization times with four different fertilizer solution concentrations of c1 c2 c3 and c4 were 24 18 13 and 7 min respectively which showed that the fertilization time can be reduced dramatically by increasing the fertilizer solution concentration the change in fertilizer concentration of four additional sampled points for m1 m2 and m3 were similar hence the combination of m1 with c1 c2 c3 and c4 were taken as a typical case to show the change of fertilizer concentration for different sampled points from the beginning of fertilizer injection until the fertilizer in the drip tapes was cleaned the results are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 the concentration of sampled point a4 needed more time to decrease to zero after the end of fertilizer injection for the same manifold layout the flushing time increased with increase in fertilizer solution concentration table 4 presents the minimal flushing time for clearing the rudimental fertilizer in drip tapes under various combinations of manifold layouts and concentrations as can be seen from table 4 the minimal flushing time increased from 8 to 13 min with increasing the fertilizer concentration from c1 to c4 for m1 similarly the minimal flushing time increased from 4 to 7 min and 7 12 min for m2 and m3 respectively 3 4 fertigation uniformity fig 7 presents the spatial distribution of applied water and fertilizer for different combinations of m1 m2 m3 and c1 c2 c3 and c4 as can be seen from fig 7a the applied water volume and fertilizer mass decreased with increasing the distance along the length direction of the tested area for m1 with different fertilizer solution concentrations the fertilizer solution concentration had no significant effect on water distribution however it had obvious effects on fertilizer distribution the mass of the applied fertilizer for the drip tapes close to the inlet increased with increasing fertilizer solution concentration from c1 to c4 similar distribution pattern of the applied water and fertilizer for m2 and m3 can be observed from fig 7b and c however the fluctuation range of applied water and fertilizer for m2 was minimal and m1 was maximal which indicated that m2 achieved the highest water and fertilzer uniformity m3 followed and the least uniform was observed in m1 table 5 presents a comparison between different uniformity indexes cu du eu for water and fertilizer uniformity with various combinations of manifold layouts and fertilizer solution concentrations generally a high water uniformity was observed for all manifold layout and concentration combinations with cu ranged from 93 to 97 du from 90 to 96 and eu from 85 to 94 a significantly lower fertilizer uniformity was observed and cu ranging from 83 to 96 du from 72 to 94 and eu from 70 to 90 in the same manifold layout the concentration had no significant effect on cu du and eu values for water however it had obvious effects on the cu du and eu values of fertilizer the results were well accordant with the analysis in fig 7 the combination of m2 and c1 generated the highest water and fertilizer uniformity the significant influence of manifold layouts concentration and the interaction between these two factors on water and fertilizer uniformity indexes cu du and eu at a significant level of α 0 05 are shown in table 6 as can be seen from table 6 a significant effect of the manifold layout on water uniformity was found the concentration and the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had no significant effect on water uniformity a significant effect of the manifold layout and concentration on fertilizer uniformity was found the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had a significant effect on fertilizer uniformity indexes cu and du however a significant effect on fertilizer uniformity index eu was not found 3 5 system classifications according to the classification method by merriam and keller 1978 the system classifications of applied water and fertilizer for drip irrigation system with various combinations of manifold layouts and concentrations are shown in table 7 m1 can be classified as good with different fertilizer concentration for water however only as good with c1 and c2 m2 and m3 can be classified as excellent with different fertilizer concentration for water the combinations of m1c3 m1c4 m3c3 and m3c4 classified as fair for applying fertilizer which indicated that the four different combinations were detrimental to apply fertilizer 4 discussion our study analyzed the change of fertilizer concentration for different sampled point we found that the emitter at the extreme end of the manifold needed more time to clean the rudimental fertilizer in the drip tapes our findings are consistent with zhou et al 2009 who investigated the fertilizer travel time in a drip irrigation system using fluorescent tracer solution as the fertilizer and indicated that there was fertilizer delay time and stop lag time in fertilizer application process for the fertilizer solution concentration ours results illustrated that the drip irrigation system needed more time to clean for reducing the risk of emitter clogging when a higher fertilizer solution concentration was applied li et al 2015 and liu et al 2017 investigated the effect of applying fertilizer on emitter clogging and found that fertilizer had an obvious acceleration effect on emitter clogging and the effect was more clear in fertilizer solution with a high concentration which indicated that it is better to clean the drip tapes as well as possible however li et al 2004 conducted detailed experiments and suggested that flushing of the rudimental fertilizer in the drip tapes should be as short as possible after the fertilizer injection is finished to avoid the potential loss of nitrate from the root zone hence it is very important to manage the drip irrigation system with precise control of flushing time when different manifold layouts and fertilizer solution concentrations are applied the applied water and fertilizer were uneven along the drip tapes previous studies also have shown this phenomenon and illustrated the reason for the decrease in pressure along the drip tapes caused by frictional loss which can reduce the emitter flow rate li et al 2007 coates et al 2012 fan et al 2016 higher fertilizer solution concentration can result in lower fertilizer uniformity this result obtained from the experiment agrees with sousa et al 2003 who indicated that smaller injection time resulted in lower uniformity of k2o the water uniformity were higher than the fertilizer uniformity for each experiment a similar phenomenon of water uniformity higher than fertilizer uniformity for a drip irrigation system was also observed li et al 2007 li et al 2008 borssoi et al 2012 bomfim et al 2014 fan et al 2016 this was due to the fertilization time was less than the irrigation time hence the difference of applied fertilizer for each emitter became more significant than applied water the analysis of statistical significance revealed the influencing degree of manifold layout fertilizer solution concentration and their interaction on water and fertilizer uniformity apparently manifold layout was the most important factor due to it had significant effect on both water uniformity and fertilizer uniformity li et al 2007 also found the same results for a subsurface drip fertigation system hence the designer need to design a suitable layout form to reduce the frictional loss along the drip tapes accoding to different terrain conditions the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had significant effect and which indicated that the influencing degree of concentration on du was inconsistency for each manifold layout for example the du values were 89 3 84 9 74 8 and 72 4 for the combinations of m1c1 m1c2 m1c3 and m1c4 hence the decrease range was 4 4 14 5 and 16 9 respectively however the decrease range was 1 5 5 4 and 5 8 for the combinations of m2c1 m2c2 m2c3 and m2c4 respectively this research demonstrated the importance of manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration on the hydraulic performance of drip irrigation system future research would be necessary to assess the effect of long term fertigation on uniformity 5 conclusions the emitter located at the extreme end of the manifold needed more time to clean the rudimental fertilizer in drip tapes the drip irrigation system needed more time to flush in order to reduce the risk of emitter clogging when a higher fertilizer solution concentration was applied m2 had the best water and fertilizer uniformity followed by m3 and at least in m1 the fertilizer solution concentration had no significant effect on water distribution however it had obvious effects on fertilizer distribution higher fertilizer solution concentration can result in lower fertilizer uniformity a significant effect of the manifold layout on water uniformity was found the concentration and the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had no significant effect on the water uniformity a significant effect of the manifold layout and concentration on fertilizer uniformity was found the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had a significant effect on the cu and du for fertilizer whilst a significant effect on eu was not found acknowledgements this work

11557,applying fertilizer through drip irrigation system is a very important method to save fertilizer and labour three manifold layouts water supply in one end for transversal drip tapes m1 water supply in both ends for transversal drip tapes m2 and water supply in one end for longitudinal drip tapes m3 and four different fertilizer solution concentrations 50 00 g l 1 c1 66 67 g l 1 c2 100 g l 1 c3 and 200 g l 1 c4 were selected to investigated the effect of the manifold and concentration on water fertigation uniformity results showed that the emitter at the extreme end of the manifold needed more time to clean the rudimental fertilizer in the drip tapes the minimal flushing time increased from 8 to 13 4 to 7 and 7 to 12 min with increasing the fertilizer concentration from c1 to c4 for m1 m2 and m3 respectively the drip irrigation system needed more time for flushing to reduce the risk of emitter clogging when a higher fertilizer solution concentration was applied in order of performance m2 had the highest water and fertilizer uniformity followed by m3 and lastly by m1 the fertilizer solution concentration had no significant effect on water distribution however it had a significant effect on fertilizer distribution the mass of the applied fertilizer for the drip tapes close to the inlet increased with increasing fertilizer solution concentration from c1 to c4 which indicated that higher fertilizer solution concentration can result in lower fertilizer distribution uniformity there was a significant effect of the manifold layout on water uniformity the fertilizer concentration and the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had no significant effect on the water uniformity similarly both the manifold layout and concentration had a significant effect on fertilizer uniformity the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had a significant effect on the christiansen s uniformity cu and distribution uniformity du for fertilizer whilst a significant effect on emission uniformity eu was not found the manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration should therefore be considered in the design and operation of fertigation system keywords fertigation flushing time water distribution fertilizer distribution proportional injector 1 introduction drip irrigation has the potential to offer a precise flexible and high level irrigation management method demir et al 2007 ella et al 2009 yurdem et al 2015 it can be adapted to different cropping patterns and climates fertigation is the application of fertilizer to a crop through an irrigation system bar yosef 1999 watts and martin 1981 showed that fertigation has several advantages over conventional blended fertilizer such as lower fertilizer inputs reduced nutrient leaching flexibility in scheduling to meet crop demands and lower costs lamm et al 2001 stated that accurate application of nitrogen through drip irrigation can enhance crop yields and reduce the potential for groundwater contamination from nitrates fertigation is expected to play a major role in the future to efficiently meet demands of fertilizer and minimise environmental consequences of irrigation brahma et al 2010 kumari and kaushal 2014 li et al 2016 however several factors such as injector type manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration can potentially affect the water and fertilizer uniformity of the drip fertigation system the effect of injector type on fertigation uniformity has already been widely investigated bracy et al 2003 obtained better fertilizer distribution uniformity with the proportional injector compared with the continuously diluting injector in a greenhouse experiment li et al 2007 evaluated the effects of different injector types on the fertigation uniformity of subsurface drip irrigation systems and the proportional injector was recommended for the design of fertigation system fan et al 2016 assessed the proportional injector differential pressure tank and venturi injector and indicated that the proportional injector resulted better fertilizer uniformity hence the proportional injector is generally preferred for most fertigation applications due to its high accuracy in metering fertilizer into the system bracy et al 2003 han et al 2010 li et al 2016 moreover the injector type manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration are additional factors that affect the water and fertilizer uniformity of drip irrigation systems sun 2014 compared the water uniformity of longitudinal and transverse lateral layouts in the greenhouse and reported that the water uniformity of the transverse lateral layout was greater than that of the longitudinal arrangement due to the larger pressure head losses from the longer lateral length bomfim et al 2014 evaluated the uniformity of potassium distribution for a drip irrigation system and indicated that the potassium concentration decreased linearly with increasing distance between injection point and drip tape inlet fan et al 2016 also evaluated the effect of differential pressures and piping arrangements on fertigation uniformity through field experiments and indicated that the water distribution uniformity was higher than the fertilizer distribution uniformity for water supply from one end and from the middle longitudinally some researchers also have focused on fertilizer solution concentration nemali and van iersel 2004 evaluated the effects of photosynthetic photon flux fertilizer concentrations and the interaction on growth rate dong et al 2006 studied the nitrate nitrogen concentration distribution characteristics under single point source infiltration with different fertilizer solution concentrations based on an indoor experiment kumar et al 2012 evaluated the injection rate of a commercially available venturi injector under different differential pressure and fertilizer solution concentration few studies have been carried out to evaluate the influence of manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration on fertigation distribution uniformity of drip irrigation system hence the specific objectives of this research were to evaluate the effect of manifold layout concentration and their interaction on fertigation uniformity and provide the design and manage basis for a drip irrigation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 fertilizer injection device fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the proportional injector which was installed directly in the water supply line the pump operates without the electrical motor it uses the flow of water as the power source to activate the motor piston which takes up the required percentage of concentrate and injects it into the water inside the pump the injected solution is mixed with the water and the water pressure forces the mixed solution downstream the setting injection ratio can be adjusted by changing the dosing piston stroke in the piston

each one with five emitters the manufacturing variability of emitter flow rate variation coefficient cv was one important index to evaluate the hydraulic performance of emitter which can be calculated by the following equation 1 c v s q ave 100 where cv is the manufacturing variability of emitter flow rate variation coefficient dimensionless dimensionless s is the standard deviation of the emitter flow rate of the sample and q ave is the emitter average flow rate of the sample 2 3 field experiments field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of different manifold layouts and

the analysis of statistical significance revealed the influencing degree of manifold layout fertilizer solution concentration and their interaction on water and fertilizer uniformity apparently manifold layout was the most important factor due to it had significant effect on both water uniformity and fertilizer uniformity li et al 2007 also found the same results for a subsurface drip fertigation system hence the designer need to design a suitable layout form to reduce the frictional loss along the drip tapes accoding to different terrain conditions the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had significant effect and which indicated that the influencing degree of concentration on du was inconsistency for each manifold layout for example the du values were 89 3 84 9 74 8 and 72 4 for the combinations of m1c1 m1c2 m1c3 and m1c4 hence the decrease range was 4 4 14 5 and 16 9 respectively however the decrease range was 1 5 5 4 and 5 8 for the combinations of m2c1 m2c2 m2c3 and m2c4 respectively this research demonstrated the importance of manifold layout and fertilizer solution concentration on the hydraulic performance of drip irrigation system future research would be necessary to assess the effect of long term fertigation on uniformity 5 conclusions the emitter located at the extreme end of the manifold needed more time to clean the rudimental fertilizer in drip tapes the drip irrigation system needed more time to flush in order to reduce the risk of emitter clogging when a higher fertilizer solution concentration was applied m2 had the best water and fertilizer uniformity followed by m3 and at least in m1 the fertilizer solution concentration had no significant effect on water distribution however it had obvious effects on fertilizer distribution higher fertilizer solution concentration can result in lower fertilizer uniformity a significant effect of the manifold layout on water uniformity was found the concentration and the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had no significant effect on the water uniformity a significant effect of the manifold layout and concentration on fertilizer uniformity was found the interaction between manifold layout and concentration had a significant effect on the cu and du for fertilizer whilst a significant effect on eu was not found acknowledgements this work

11558,sea level rise and upstream development is causing salinity intrusion in vietnam s mekong river delta mrd and as a consequence agricultural productivity is declining as the vietnamese government and local communities search for a solution it has become apparent that there are insufficient public resources to build the dykes necessary to control this problem so we employ a referendum contingent valuation methodology cvm to determine whether or not farm households might be willing to pay for part of the cost of a salinity intrusion risk reduction program we find that farm households are willing to contribute funds to such a program in areas where salinity intrusion is already reducing productivity farm households are willing to contribute us 2 58 per month in areas where salinity intrusion is expected to be reducing productivity by 2030 willingness to contribute is us 1 99 per month surprisingly in mrd areas where salinity intrusion is not expected within the next 15 years willingness to contribute remains positive at us 1 32 per month these findings have local national and international implications that require careful consideration in passing we make a methodological observation that a treatment model including do not know responses provides consistent results with conventional referendum elicitation procedures jel classification q51 q54 q58 keywords climate change willingness to pay referendum 1 introduction the mekong river delta mrd located in southern vietnam plays an important role in the country s agricultural development the total agricultural area is four million hectares producing approximately 45 of vietnam s rice while salinity intrusion impacts are beginning to affect other river deltas around the world if mean sea levels rise by one meter above current levels vietnam would be the most adversely affected region in the developing world buys et al 2006 in the past flooding was the most typical cause of disruption to agricultural production in this region le anh tuan et al 2007 in recent years however salinity intrusion has become the most significant challenge faced by farm households salinity intrusion is caused by two processes a rising sea levels as a result of adverse climate change and b a significant decline in river flows as a result of upstream dam construction and increased extractions of water reduced upstream flow rates combined with increased sea levels under climate change drive lower hydrologic pressure in the mrd which allows salt water to intrude further inland danh and khai 2014 le anh tuan et al 2007 smajgl et al 2015 according to the vietnam academy for water resources salinity intrusion is on the increase and has recently been detected in the kien giang and hau giang provinces see fig 1 the vietnam academy for water resources 2015 currently around 620 000 ha are affected by salinity intrusion roughly 16 of the total mrd agricultural production area by 2030 under current sea level increase predictions it is estimated that up to 45 of the mrd agricultural area could be impacted with coastal provinces such as tien giang tra vinh soc trang bac lieu ca mau and ben tre experiencing the highest levels of impact center of environmental engineering 2012 adverse impacts of sea level rise are being worsened by increasing upstream development along the mekong river the national hydro meteorological service of vietnam is warning that the impact of future droughts similar to those experienced during the 2015 and 2016 el niño events will also be worse in future creating further negative salinity intrusion outcomes as one of the largest rice exporters in asia disruptions to mrd agricultural production can result in wider serious regional food security issues as well as reduced national trade income in the past mrd farm households largely treated salinity intrusion as a normal phenomenon le anh tuan et al 2007 more recently under increasing salinity impacts farm households and local authorities have recognized the abnormal properties of local salinity intrusion and begun searching for management solutions including changed irrigation schedules increased water storage in dams and altered rice planting times these solutions are largely viewed as short term 1 5 year duration fixes however under a recent recognition that increasing salinity intrusion cannot be managed by private on farm actions alone in 2016 the general program of the mekong delta economic cooperation forum in hau giang mdec forum hau giang argued that it would be necessary to explore and develop longer term 5 30 year solutions based on public intervention one possible long term approach is the use of concrete sea dikes or embankment structures that prevent water inundation onto low lying floodplain areas the mrd is a vast floodplain only 0 4 m above mean sea level over the last 300 years more than 11 000 kilometers of canals have been constructed in the mrd to mitigate flooding in low lying areas in addition approximately 2000 kilometers of dike walls have been constructed to minimize mrd flooding during periods of high upstream flows and very high tides that can occur during storm events le anh tuan et al 2007 in may 2009 the vietnamese government issued decree no 667 qd ttg with a view to upgrading dike walls and increasing maintenance in the central and southern mrd this program will include the construction of additional earthen sea dikes and concrete sluicegates along the coastline danh and khai 2014 smajgl et al 2015 as there is a shortage of soils suitable for upgrading these dikes and the incidence of erosion is high sorensen et al 1984 consideration is being given to the construction of concrete sea dike walls according to a undp disaster management unit project vie 97 002 managed by the general department of land administration the total length of required sea dike walls in mrd would be 1469 kilometers danh 2012 and danh and khai 2014 argued that vietnam cannot afford to build the total required lengths of sea dike walls due to public budget constraints these authors go on to point out that if these sea dike walls were constructed local authorities would also struggle to maintain them danh 2012 this means that if any proposed intervention program based on infrastructure is to proceed and be sustained over time local households may have to fill a construction and maintenance funding gap however it is unclear whether local households are willing to contribute to these types of public investments and if so how much they would be willing to contribute the purpose of this paper is to explore mrd farm household willingness to contribute pay to local authority programs aimed at mitigating salinity intrusion risk the willingness to pay wtp literature is generally classified into revealed and stated preference methodologies with stated preference methods typically employed to estimate wtp in contexts where actual markets for the good in question do not exist bateman et al 2002 competition commission 2010 in climate change related research a subset of stated preference estimations known as contingent valuation methods cvm have been widely employed to estimate willingness to pay for climate risk reduction projects many of these previous climate risk reduction project studies have focused on issues such as willingness to pay for insurance botzen et al 2009 botzen and van den bergh 2008 2012 charpentier 2008 mcclelland et al 1993 flooding risk mitigation through improved management baan and klijn 2004 brilly and polic 2005 and willingness to pay to reduce environmental health or mortality risks alberini and chiabai 2007 alberini et al 2006 corso et al 2001 however while southeast asian countries also face emerging climate risks previous studies of wtp have mainly been conducted in developed countries moreover studies looking at people s willingness to contribute to coastal defense in climate risk areas are quite rare so far research on this topic has only been conducted by jones et al 2015 in england and landry et al 2011 in the us with little that can be directly related to developing nation contexts as a result this paper contributes to significant gaps in the literature by applying a referendum contingent valuation methodology to evaluate developing country community contributions toward climate change risk reduction programs in the form of concrete sea dike walls in the mrd this paper also attempts to identify the determinants of farm household characteristics on wtp previous studies have found a number of factors affecting people s wtp for climate change risk reduction in japan the netherlands and italy alberini and chiabai 2007 botzen and van den bergh 2012 zhai 2006 for example willingness to pay was positively associated with the size of the risk reduction alberini and chiabai 2007 botzen and van den bergh 2012 zhai 2006 respondent age and health alberini and chiabai 2007 income zhai 2006 and proximity to the risk concu 2007 however wtp can decrease with acceptability of flood risk and environmental information provision zhai 2006 moreover risk awareness and geographical characteristics are also noted as important factors influencing respondents willingness to pay botzen and van den bergh 2008 in those studies referendum and payment cards were employed broadly as the instrument of cvm elicitation and so we follow that approach in this paper 2 methods consistent with many of the studies of climate change risk reduction cited above we employ the cvm approach to estimate farm household willingness to pay for mrd salinity intrusion management programs cvm was first proposed by ciriacy wantrup 1947 and since the 1970s the methodology has been routinely applied to measure the benefits of a variety of goods such as recreation hunting water quality and decreased mortality risk from accidents khai and yabe 2014 in essence cvm requires each participant in a study to respond by employing four types of question including open ended dichotomous choice iterative bidding or payment card the most common question format is an open ended and dichotomous choice although debate over the best form of cvm questionnaire continues dichotomous choice rather than open ended elicitation approaches are recommended due to minimization of opportunities for strategic behaviour and an argument that such questions are cognitively easier on respondents mitchell and carson 1989 the valuation question in this study thus required each participant to respond to a dichotomous choice based on wtp guidelines by bateman et al 2002 and the competition commission 2010 the robustness of the decision to adopt a dichotomous choice format was enhanced in this instance by a large sample of farm households 2 1 survey method the primary data for the study was obtained through a field survey conducted among farm households in the mrd the questionnaire was pre tested with 30 randomly selected farm household heads spread across three mrd study areas ranging from heavily salinity affected areas down to non salinity affected areas the purpose of the pre test was to check likely farmer comprehension of the questionnaire refine the range of willingness to pay bid measures proposed and test the viability of the proposed payment vehicle that is the feasibility of getting farmers to make a monthly contribution to a fund managed by their local authority based on the pre test results five different bid values were chosen for the monthly payment vehicle vnd 50 000 100 000 150 000 200 000 and 250 000 equivalent to us 1 1 us 1 dollar was equal to 22 695 vietnamese dong vnd at may 01 2017 2 20 4 41 6 61 8 81 and 11 02 following the survey pretests and content finalization the formal in field face to face survey data collection commenced the survey sample areas were based on an mrd salinity intrusion map provided by the local department of agriculture and rural development the opinion of local departmental staff as to which areas might present useful sample sites was also sought as a result of this exercise the survey was directed at three farmer groups i those where salinity intrusion impacts are already prevalent the cau ke district ii those living in areas with a high probability and risk of future salinity intrusion the tra on district and part of the cau ke district and iii a control group area where salinity intrusion is not yet of concern the vinh thanh district in the can tho province using simple random sampling techniques farm households were randomly selected from a list provided by district local authorities once selected a survey enumerator 2 2 enumerators were carefully chosen from staff and final year students from department of agricultural economics college of economics at the can tho university those with previous experience of survey data collection and cvm approaches were specifically targeted each enumerator also received additional training before the official survey took place visited the household to ascertain eligibility for survey participation to be selected the head of the farm household or their partner had to live in the area work on an mrd rice field and have at least three years farming experience eligible respondents were then asked some demographic and social characteristic questions this was followed by questions related to their perceptions of local climate change and then salinity impacts 3 3 sample copies of the questionnaire are available from the corresponding author in vietnamese and english due to the importance of collecting reliable willingness to pay information causes of salinity intrusion in the mekong river delta were first explained carefully to respondents this included a range of hypothetical salinity reduction program options possible program options suggested in this survey included converting current earth sea dike walls to concrete structures upgrading existing or building new river mouth sluicegate systems and the planting of new or reforestation of degraded existing mangrove systems next to sea dike walls each respondent was then asked whether or not they their household would be willing to contribute monthly to fund such programs they were told that the program funds would be administered by a committee including their local government local and international consultants and representatives from non government organizations this committee would then decide how to invest in concrete sea dike walls sluice gate construction and mangrove forest in their local area it was made clear that these programs would seek to reduce current and expected future salinity intrusion risk in their relevant village area following the guidelines from arrow et al 1993 and competition commission 2010 willingness to pay bids were collected using a referendum style format where respondents could select one of three options yes no or do not know dk during the survey respondents were given an opportunity to reconsider their vote before asking them to nominate their specific monthly payment bid each possible willingness to pay bid value was provided to at least 30 of the randomly selected farm households for a total of 150 observations from each area after data cleaning there were 441 4 4 sample size was identified by function n z 1 α 2 2 p 1 p d 2 useable observations from three different salinity impact areas despite some disadvantages with referendum approaches such as a limited range for the bid values offered this option simplifies the respondent s cognitive task pearce et al 2002 which is an important factor in survey areas where farm household education levels can be quite low further previous studies have identified the fact that cvm approaches can result in over estimations of willingness to pay the likelihood of this occurring can be reduced by using survey pretesting ahead of official data collection adopting face to face surveying approaches and framing the willingness to pay question in the form of a referendum that includes a no vote or do not know response option arrow et al 1993 carson et al 1998 competition commission 2010 wang 1997 in support of our adoption of these approaches the referendum vote has been endorsed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration u s noaa panel which suggested that valuation questions should be formed as a vote and include do not know answer options as distinct from yes and no responses arrow et al 1993 carson et al 1998 champ et al 2005 pearce et al 2002 wang 1997 in this study we also employed ex ante bias correction by using a cheap talk instrument which is designed to mitigate hypothetical bias by explaining the risk of this outcome to respondents before asking the valuation questions competition commission 2010 mahieu et al 2012 the version of the cheap talk approach we used was based on the short and neutral approaches developed by aadland and caplan 2006 do and bennett 2007 and khai and yabe 2014 the cheap talk scrip was also tested to ensure good understanding by participants in the pilot survey our approach included a reminder to respondents to consider budget constraints when making their responses and treating their decision as if the payment were real this information is then cross checked with information about the respondent s socio economic characteristics and their ability to pay finally an ex post robustness approach was also adopted using a follow up question asking respondents to specify the certainty of their answers champ et al 1997 competition commission 2010 whitehead and cherry 2007 in these approaches the farm household participants had more time to reconsider their responses before a firm decision was made and noted in the questionnaire 2 2 analytical method the basic theory of cvm approach was proposed by hanemann 1984 with concepts derived from consumer theory we begin with the random utility function of a respondent which is 1 u k u k w z e k v k w z e k where k 0 is the status quo and k 1 is the condition where a salinity intrusion mitigation public good is provided utility function components include income w respondents characteristics z and error component e respondent s utility increases when public goods provided with the payment tj are higher than utility in the status quo 2 u 1 j u 1 w j t j z j e 1 j u 0 w j z j e 0 j the probability of an individual response would be yes if the following conditions hold 3 pr y e s t j pr u 1 w j t j z j e 1 j u 0 w j z j e 0 j from eq 1 we can rewrite this probability as follows 4 pr y e s t pr v 1 w j t j z j e 1 j v 0 w j z j e 0 j and assume that the utility function vk is linear we can then rewrite eq 4 as 5 pr yes t pr α1 z j β 1 w j t j e 1j α0 z j β 0 w j e 0j this then allows us to rearrange the above function as follows 6 p r y e s t pr α 1 α 0 z j β t j e 1 j e 0 j 0 pr α z j β t j e j 0 where α α1 α0 and e j e 1j e 0j because the error terms are assumed to be independently and identically distributed the probability of a respondent choosing yes can be estimated with 7 pr yes t j pr αz j βt j e j 0 pr e j αz j βt j pr e j αz j βt j f αz j βt j the function in eq 7 is then estimated using maximum likelihood procedures and v assumes a linear form including income w farm household s characteristics z and the final bid value in this study multinomial logistic regression mnl and binary logistic regression treatment models were initially employed to analyse the referendum format of the cvm details of such analysis models are discussed by lancsar et al 2017 as stated above in our cvm survey farm households were asked to respond to the willingness to pay bid value question in one of three ways yes no or do not know in the analysis model α and β are coefficients and x is a vector of the socio economic explanatory variables related to an individual s selection including farm household income head of household s age head of household s gender farm household size head of household s education and total farming experience table 1 the non parametric technique is employed to estimate the mean values for wtp this technique was suggested by previous researchers in the same survey area đan and duyên 2010 khai and yabe 2014 thus we estimated mean willingness to pay values as follows 8 n j k j 1 5 n k where n is the sample size n j is the sub sample size who chose b j with b j as the bid value where j 1 2 3 n and n j is the sub sample size that is willing to pay more than bid value b j then the survivor function at each b j is 9 s b j n j n j 0 t o 5 finally the mean value for mrd farm households willingness to pay is estimated as follows 10 m e a n w t p j 0 5 s b j b j 1 b j 3 results 3 1 descriptive analysis results the socioeconomic characteristics for each of the mrd farm household groups are presented in table 2 5 vietnam household living standard survey 2010 there is a wider range of educational levels 1 primary school 2 secondary school 3 high school 4 7 vocational education 8 college 9 university 10 masters 11 phd 12 other used in the vhlss and this difference is taken into account in our comparison below to test for sample representativeness the results are compared with data from the vietnam household living standard survey vhlss a national survey of the vietnamese population conducted every two years in general respondent characteristics in each group are consistent across the three groups and with the vhlss results in the context of an mrd culture in which decision makers are typically men the majority of household heads interviewed were male the average age of the head of household was 47 years the mean head of household s education level was 2 05 for the current salinity impacted group 2 03 for the high future risk group and 2 48 for the control group indicating that mrd farmers have mainly achieved primary or secondary school level educations the majority were born immediately after the vietnam war when much of the national and local infrastructure had been destroyed and communities were trying to re establish themselves this may explain the relatively low education levels among respondents in terms of farm household income the control group group 3 had highest annual income at vnd 112 million per annum us 5022 compared to the salinity intrusion group 1 and high risk groups group 2 which on average earned vnd 104 5 million per annum us 4753 this outcome together with the higher variability in results as depicted by the standard deviation values would suggest some negative farm income affects associated with current salinity and or the risk of future salinity impacts in addition to identify any differences in the mean values of the variables in table 2 across the three farm households groups we employed the one way analysis of variance anova and tukey post hoc tests the anova results confirmed no statistically significant differences between the three groups except gender f 2438 5 28 p 0 0054 and education level f 2438 7 13 p 0 0009 similarly the tukey post hoc test revealed slightly higher farm head of household education levels in the control group group 3 and slightly higher numbers of females in groups 1 and 2 however the differences are minimal and we therefore conclude that the analysis results from this study are broadly representative of the mrd farmer population 3 2 willingness to pay results 3 2 1 reasons for unwillingness to pay in terms of respondents willingness to pay our study first examined reasons why respondents may be unwilling to pay for the goods of interest key reasons offered include a preference for alternative goods and programs a lack of capacity to pay and questions of government capacity to manage the proposed program s table 3 summarises the reasons why some farm households are unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program the main reason households voted against a proposed program was their reported inability to afford the required payments the second highest selected reason was a farm household perception that salinity intrusion reduction should primarily be the responsibility of the vietnamese government approximately 20 percent of farm households also did not believe that their contributions would be used to fund the program correctly finally approximately 15 percent of farm households in salinity impacted areas voted against the program contributions because they felt that they could adapt to and live with mrd salinity intrusion 6 6 following discussion by jorgensen et al 1999 we estimated the model results using expanded zero bid protest vote definitions that included program ineffectiveness beliefs and feelings that the respondent can deal with problem by themselves the model estimates did not vary greatly from the original analyses and so were not included here these estimates are available on request 3 2 2 willingness to pay and its determinants fig 2 summarizes the proportion of farm household responses to various bid levels offered in the survey in general the percentage of farm households answering yes decreases as the bid level increases however those mrd farms that are currently affected by salinity or facing a high risk of future impact were generally inclined toward a yes response even at higher bid levels as expected the proportion of farmers that indicated their unwillingness to contribute increased as bid levels were raised but again with smaller total percentages from the currently affected and high future risk groups finally the proportion of farmers answering do not know to the bid levels rapidly falls to zero in the control group but remains positive for the other groups at relatively low levels 4 on average these results suggest that mrd farmers recognize the significant risks and negative impacts associated with salinity intrusion even when they are not yet exposed to salinity factors that influence mrd farm households willingness to pay for salinity intrusion risk reduction are presented in table 4 we estimate the results across three models model 1 is an mnl model with no responses as the base outcome while model 2 is a binary logistic regression that reclassifies all do not know answers as a no in model 3 also in the form of a binary logistic regression do not know answers are deleted entirely from the dataset the results of model fit statistics showed that the likelihood ratio lr in three models are significant p 0 001 in all models and pseudo r square values of 0 304 0 294 and 0 338 in models 1 2 and 3 respectively hence this result indicated a good fit and all three models are statistically significant and explained by the independent variables included further and as detailed in table 4 variance inflation factor vif values for each of the independent variables are smaller than 7 0 indicating that there are no significant multicollinearity issues with the modeling the results from the three models are broadly uniform consistent with economic theory farm household income and bid value are strongly correlated with increased probability of willingness to pay that is high farm income correlates with a positive probability of willingness to pay as expected higher bid values are negatively correlated with a probability of willingness to pay in a manner that is consistent with other climate change impact studies e g wang 1997 and willingness to pay studies from the mrd đan and duyên 2010 khai and yabe 2014 interestingly although older farmers are weakly associated with an increased probability of willingness to pay farmers with more experience were generally less likely to be willing to pay toward salinity intrusion reduction programs we did not expect to find this outcome it may be because experienced mrd farmers feel capable of dealing with salinity intrusion on their own or consider that local authorities cannot be trusted to manage the problem effectively in any case this result is supported by recent research on farmers willingness to pay for rice farming insurance in the mrd thong 2014 finally the negative coefficient for the group variable suggests that the probability of farm household willingness to pay increases with their proximity to current and expected salinity impact results from the non parametric estimation methods using eq 10 show that the highest willingness to pay level is associated with the group already experiencing high salinity intrusion table 5 farm households in this group are willing to contribute approximately us 2 58 per month toward the salinity reduction programs while farms in the control group are only willing to contribute around half of that amount i e us 1 32 per month across the three groups annual farm household contribution to salinity reduction programs would average us 23 57 a kruskal willis h test was employed to examine whether these wtp values were statistically different for the three farm household groups the results showed a statistical difference between the three groups χ 2 2 9 847 at a strong significance level p 0 0073 which is below 0 01 we can loosely compare this to research in the uk where people were willing to pay a monthly premium of 4 46 about us 5 77 for coastal defence projects jones et al 2015 this finding is also somewhat comparable with a review of previous studies which indicated that annual willingness to pay for climate policy is in a range of between us 22 and us 437 per household in samples drawn from american asian and european populations johnson et al 2010 finally in the literature surrounding climate change mitigation projects funded by higher energy prices we note that korean consumers are willing to pay us 3 21 per month for renewable energy lee and heo 2016 while japanese consumers median wtp for green electricity is about us 17 per month nomura and akai 2004 which align with the values reported here in any case the results of this study reveal a promising community participation attitude toward solving the sea dike public funding deficit in vietnam offering a promising basis for policy makers to establish appropriate projects actions 3 2 3 adjustment for biases finally our study also estimated relative economic sacrifice res values to assess the robustness of the willingness to pay results where res b i y i bi is the chosen bid level and yi is the farm household s total income this res is the ratio between the respondent s willingness to pay level and total per annum farm household income the res value for each farm household group was 0 0032 salinity impacted areas 0 0034 high future risk areas and 0 0019 control group areas these values are relatively small and suggest that our willingness to pay estimates are not overstated this conclusion is further supported by an assessment of the ratio between mean willingness to pay and annual farm household income 4 discussion the positive willingness to pay results reported here suggest that mrd farm households are concerned about the adverse impacts of salinity intrusion while some larger mrd farm households may struggle to contribute as reflected in our findings there is little evidence of a large scale protest based on our results it is reasonable to conclude that the financial impact on most households would be minimal approximately at the 0 65 of one percent level of annual net farm income the next issue to consider is the question of how much money might be needed to fund an effective salinity intrusion control program and how much households could contribute to the cost of running such a program as shown in fig 3 and according to danh 2012 one option is to build around 1469 km of concrete sea dikes accepting this as a possible scenario and noting that a it may be possible for many farmers to live with and adapt to salinity intrusion by doing such things as moving from rice production to fish or shrimp farming b that a combination of earth dikes and mangroves may provide a more environmentally friendly program and after a completion of a full economic evaluation of non market benefits may also provide a more socially beneficial solution and c under the premise that some of this problem has been caused by the actions of people in other countries and that as such a significant international contribution to the cost of controlling salinity intrusion could be expected it may be possible to conduct a more detail exploratory analysis of the feasibility of calling upon mrd households to fund much if not all of any mrd salinity intrusion control program table 6 contains estimates of the costs of constructing and maintaining concrete sea dike walls across rural vietnam adapted from danh 2012 a two meter concrete sea dike wall requires approximately us 1 16 million per kilometre in construction costs this increases to us 2 8 million per kilometre if the sea dike wall height is increased to four meters over the total length of mrd coastal area identified program costs for concrete sea dike wall construction would require total funding of approximately us 1 7 billion for two meter concrete sea dike walls us 2 8 billion for three meter concrete sea dike walls and us 4 1 billion for four meter concrete sea dike walls significantly as a relatively poor country and where climate induced sea level rise is the prime cause of the salinity intrusion problem the vietnamese government should be able to borrow the money needed to build a sea dike walls system at 1 08 7 7 this is the weighted average cost of capital wacc estimated by asian development bank applied for transport corridor noi bai lao cai highway project loan for vietnam p a interest rate from asian development bank adb and repay the principle over a loan term 40 years if this is the case then the annual payment would be between 53 m and 127 m per annual table 6 8 identified by function a us loan amount i 1 i n i 1 i n 1 where i is wacc and n is number of loan years if the repayment figure is then equally divided across the 3 3 million farm households 9 9 the number of household in mrd is around 4 7 million in 2015 the vietnam general statistic office www gso gov vn in which 69 3 are farm household in rural areas ministry of planning and investment currently located in the mrd ministry of planning and investment 2015 it would result in a need to collect between us 16 and us 39 per farm household however if the contribution involves all households including non farm households in the mrd where a total of 4 7 million households are located the annual payment period will be decreased from 40 to 30 years and the annual contribution required per household would fall to between us 14 and us 35 per household clearly this is a very crude estimate and not sufficient to recommend the implementation of an mrd concrete sea dike program nevertheless the estimated per farm household contribution required to meet adb loan repayment is less than the average stated willingness to pay levels found in our study therefore our results suggest that in the absence of other public funds private mrd farm household contributions may be sufficient to cover the cost of building a concrete sea dike that would protect farm lands from climate change induced sea level rise the issue of whether this is equitable remains the subject of further analysis and discussion that we will address in future research nevertheless the insights provided by this paper have important ramifications for vietnam other developing country contexts faced with salinity intrusion impacts and broader climate change management policy 5 conclusions this study estimates mrd farm household willingness to pay for salinity intrusion mitigation programs the results reveal that more than 50 percent of farm households are willing to contribute to a fund that could be used to reduce salinity intrusion risk and that their willingness to pay is in proportion to expected salinity impacts farm households in current salinity intrusion affected areas are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those farm households located in lower or no current risk areas however all farm households included in the study including those who at present are unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to pay for an mrd salinity management program when assessed in aggregate the total amount of money that farm households are prepared to pay is significant and may be sufficient to cover the total costs of such a program care must be taken however in the interpretation of this result while the payment vehicle adopted in this study suggests feasibility work on the most appropriate government arrangements requires further analysis careful research for example on the merits of establishing a separate salinity intrusion control authority versus the use of an existing government structure is needed similarly there is a need to consider how best to involve farmers in any program that they pay for further the question of whether or not mrd farm households should be made to pay for the adverse effects of global climate change and upstream development is an important ethical and legal question to resolve it is our intention to address these issues in future research papers acknowledgements

11558,sea level rise and upstream development is causing salinity intrusion in vietnam s mekong river delta mrd and as a consequence agricultural productivity is declining as the vietnamese government and local communities search for a solution it has become apparent that there are insufficient public resources to build the dykes necessary to control this problem so we employ a referendum contingent valuation methodology cvm to determine whether or not farm households might be willing to pay for part of the cost of a salinity intrusion risk reduction program we find that farm households are willing to contribute funds to such a program in areas where salinity intrusion is already reducing productivity farm households are willing to contribute us 2 58 per month in areas where salinity intrusion is expected to be reducing productivity by 2030 willingness to contribute is us 1 99 per month surprisingly in mrd areas where salinity intrusion is not expected within the next 15 years willingness to contribute remains positive at us 1 32 per month these findings have local national and international implications that require careful consideration in passing we make a methodological observation that a treatment model including do not know responses provides consistent results with conventional referendum elicitation procedures jel classification q51 q54 q58 keywords climate change willingness to pay referendum 1 introduction the mekong river delta mrd located in southern vietnam plays an important role in the country s agricultural development the total agricultural area is four million hectares producing approximately 45 of vietnam s rice while salinity intrusion impacts are beginning to affect other river deltas around the world if mean sea levels rise by one meter above current levels vietnam would be the most adversely affected region in the developing world buys et al 2006 in the past flooding was the most typical cause of disruption to agricultural production in this region le anh tuan et al 2007 in recent years however salinity intrusion has become the most significant challenge faced by farm households salinity intrusion is caused by two processes a rising sea levels as a result of adverse climate change and b a significant decline in river flows as a result of upstream dam construction and increased extractions of water reduced upstream flow rates combined with increased sea levels under climate change drive lower hydrologic pressure in the mrd which allows salt water to intrude further inland danh and khai 2014 le anh tuan et al 2007 smajgl et al 2015 according to the vietnam academy for water resources salinity intrusion is on the increase and has recently been detected in the kien giang and hau giang provinces see fig 1 the vietnam academy for water resources 2015 currently around 620 000 ha are affected by salinity intrusion roughly 16 of the total mrd agricultural production area by 2030 under current sea level increase predictions it is estimated that up to 45 of the mrd agricultural area could be impacted with coastal provinces such as tien giang tra vinh soc trang bac lieu ca mau and ben tre experiencing the highest levels of impact center of environmental engineering 2012 adverse impacts of sea level rise are being worsened by increasing upstream development along the mekong river the national hydro meteorological service of vietnam is warning that the impact of future droughts similar to those experienced during the 2015 and 2016 el niño events will also be worse in future creating further negative salinity intrusion outcomes as one of the largest rice exporters in asia disruptions to mrd agricultural production can result in wider serious regional food security issues as well as reduced national trade income in the past mrd farm households largely treated salinity intrusion as a normal phenomenon le anh tuan et al 2007 more recently under increasing salinity impacts farm households and local authorities have recognized the abnormal properties of local salinity intrusion and begun searching for management solutions including changed irrigation schedules increased water storage in dams and altered rice planting times these solutions are largely viewed as short term 1 5 year duration fixes however under a recent recognition that increasing salinity intrusion cannot be managed by private on farm actions alone in 2016 the general program of the mekong delta economic cooperation forum in hau giang mdec forum hau giang argued that it would be necessary to explore and develop longer term 5 30 year solutions based on public intervention one possible long term approach is the use of concrete sea dikes or embankment structures that prevent water inundation onto low lying floodplain areas the mrd is a vast floodplain only 0 4 m above mean sea level over the last 300 years more than 11 000 kilometers of canals have been constructed in the mrd to mitigate flooding in low lying areas in addition approximately 2000 kilometers of dike walls have been constructed to minimize mrd flooding during periods of high upstream flows and very high tides that can occur during storm events le anh tuan et al 2007 in may 2009 the vietnamese government issued decree no 667 qd ttg with a view to upgrading dike walls and increasing maintenance in the central and southern mrd this program will include the construction of additional earthen sea dikes and concrete sluicegates along the coastline danh and khai 2014 smajgl et al 2015 as there is a shortage of soils suitable for upgrading these dikes and the incidence of erosion is high sorensen et al 1984 consideration is being given to the construction of concrete sea dike walls according to a undp disaster management unit project vie 97 002 managed by the general department of land administration the total length of required sea dike walls in mrd would be 1469 kilometers danh 2012 and danh and khai 2014 argued that vietnam cannot afford to build the total required lengths of sea dike walls due to public budget constraints these authors go on to point out that if these sea dike walls were constructed local authorities would also struggle to maintain them danh 2012 this means that if any proposed intervention program based on infrastructure is to proceed and be sustained over time local households may have to fill a construction and maintenance funding gap however it is unclear whether local households are willing to contribute to these types of public investments and if so how much they would be willing to contribute the purpose of this paper is to explore mrd farm household willingness to contribute pay to local authority programs aimed at mitigating salinity intrusion risk the willingness to pay wtp literature is generally classified into revealed and stated preference methodologies with stated preference methods typically employed to estimate wtp in contexts where actual markets for the good in question do not exist bateman et al 2002 competition commission 2010 in climate change related research a subset of stated preference estimations known as contingent valuation methods cvm have been widely employed to estimate willingness to pay for climate risk reduction projects many of these previous climate risk reduction project studies have focused on issues such as willingness to pay for insurance botzen et al 2009 botzen and van den bergh 2008 2012 charpentier 2008 mcclelland et al 1993 flooding risk mitigation through improved management baan and klijn 2004 brilly and polic 2005 and willingness to pay to reduce environmental health or mortality risks alberini and chiabai 2007 alberini et al 2006 corso et al 2001 however while southeast asian countries also face emerging climate risks previous studies of wtp have mainly been conducted in developed countries moreover studies looking at people s willingness to contribute to coastal defense in climate risk areas are quite rare so far research on this topic has only been conducted by jones et al 2015 in england and landry et al 2011 in the us with little that can be directly related to developing nation contexts as a result this paper contributes to significant gaps in the literature by applying a referendum contingent valuation methodology to evaluate developing country community contributions toward climate change risk reduction programs in the form of concrete sea dike walls in the mrd this paper also attempts to identify the determinants of farm household characteristics on wtp previous studies have found a number of factors affecting people s wtp for climate change risk reduction in japan the netherlands and italy alberini and chiabai 2007 botzen and van den bergh 2012 zhai 2006 for example willingness to pay was positively associated with the size of the risk reduction alberini and chiabai 2007 botzen and van den bergh 2012 zhai 2006 respondent age and health alberini and chiabai 2007 income zhai 2006 and proximity to the risk concu 2007 however wtp can decrease with acceptability of flood risk and environmental information provision zhai 2006 moreover risk awareness and geographical characteristics are also noted as important factors influencing respondents willingness to pay botzen and van den bergh 2008 in those studies referendum and payment cards were employed broadly as the instrument of cvm elicitation and so we follow that approach in this paper 2 methods consistent with many of the studies of climate change risk reduction cited above we employ the cvm approach to estimate farm household willingness to pay for mrd salinity intrusion management programs cvm was first proposed by ciriacy wantrup 1947 and since the 1970s the methodology has been routinely applied to measure the benefits of a variety of goods such as recreation hunting water quality and decreased mortality risk from accidents khai and yabe 2014 in essence cvm requires each participant in a study to respond by employing four types of question including open ended dichotomous choice iterative bidding or payment card the most common question format is an open ended and dichotomous choice although debate over the best form of cvm questionnaire continues dichotomous choice rather than open ended elicitation approaches are recommended due to minimization of opportunities for strategic behaviour and an argument that such questions are cognitively easier on respondents mitchell and carson 1989 the valuation question in this study thus required each participant to respond to a dichotomous choice based on wtp guidelines by bateman et al 2002 and the competition commission 2010 the robustness of the decision to adopt a dichotomous choice format was enhanced in this instance by a large sample of farm households 2 1 survey method the primary data for the study was obtained through a field survey conducted among farm households in the mrd the questionnaire was pre tested with 30 randomly selected farm household heads spread across three mrd study areas ranging from heavily salinity affected areas down to non salinity affected areas the purpose of the pre test was to check likely farmer comprehension of the questionnaire refine the range of willingness to pay bid measures proposed and test the viability of the proposed payment vehicle that is the feasibility of getting farmers to make a monthly contribution to a fund managed by their local authority based on the pre test results five different bid values were chosen for the monthly payment vehicle vnd 50 000 100 000 150 000 200 000 and 250 000 equivalent to us 1 1 us 1 dollar was equal to 22 695 vietnamese dong vnd at may 01 2017 2 20 4 41 6 61 8 81 and 11 02 following the survey pretests and content finalization the formal in field face to face survey data collection commenced the survey sample areas were based on an mrd salinity intrusion map provided by the local department of agriculture and rural development the opinion of local departmental staff as to which areas might present useful sample sites was also sought as a result of this exercise the survey was directed at three farmer groups i those where salinity intrusion impacts are already prevalent the cau ke district ii those living in areas with a high probability and risk of future salinity intrusion the tra on district and part of the cau ke district and iii a control group area where salinity intrusion is not yet of concern the vinh thanh district in the can tho province using simple random sampling techniques farm households were randomly selected from a list provided by district local authorities once selected a survey enumerator 2 2 enumerators were carefully chosen from staff and final year students from department of agricultural economics college of economics at the can tho university those with previous experience of survey data collection and cvm approaches were specifically targeted each enumerator also received additional training before the official survey took place visited the household to ascertain eligibility for survey participation to be selected the head of the farm household or their partner had to live in the area work on an mrd rice field and have at least three years farming experience eligible respondents were then asked some demographic and social characteristic questions this was followed by questions related to their perceptions of local climate change and then salinity impacts 3 3 sample copies of the questionnaire are available from the corresponding author in vietnamese and english due to the importance of collecting reliable willingness to pay information causes of salinity intrusion in the mekong river delta were first explained carefully to respondents this included a range of hypothetical salinity reduction program options possible program options suggested in this survey included converting current earth sea dike walls to concrete structures upgrading existing or building new river mouth sluicegate systems and the planting of new or reforestation of degraded existing mangrove systems next to sea dike walls each respondent was then asked whether or not they their household would be willing to contribute monthly to fund such programs they were told that the program funds would be administered by a committee including their local government local and international consultants and representatives from non government organizations this committee would then decide how to invest in concrete sea dike walls sluice gate construction and mangrove forest in their local area it was made clear that these programs would seek to reduce current and expected future salinity intrusion risk in their relevant village area following the guidelines from arrow et al 1993 and competition commission 2010 willingness to pay bids were collected using a referendum style format where respondents could select one of three options yes no or do not know dk during the survey respondents were given an opportunity to reconsider their vote before asking them to nominate their specific monthly payment bid each possible willingness to pay bid value was provided to at least 30 of the randomly selected farm households for a total of 150 observations from each area after data cleaning there were 441 4 4 sample size was identified by function n z 1 α 2 2 p 1 p d 2 useable observations from three different salinity impact areas despite some disadvantages with referendum approaches such as a limited range for the bid values offered this option simplifies the respondent s cognitive task pearce et al 2002 which is an important factor in survey areas where farm household education levels can be quite low further previous studies have identified the fact that cvm approaches can result in over estimations of willingness to pay the likelihood of this occurring can be reduced by using survey pretesting ahead of official data collection adopting face to face surveying approaches and framing the willingness to pay question in the form of a referendum that includes a no vote or do not know response option arrow et al 1993 carson et al 1998 competition commission 2010 wang 1997 in support of our adoption of these approaches the referendum vote has been endorsed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration u s noaa panel which suggested that valuation questions should be formed as a vote and include do not know answer options as distinct from yes and no responses arrow et al 1993 carson et al 1998 champ et al 2005 pearce et al 2002 wang 1997 in this study we also employed ex ante bias correction by using a cheap talk instrument which is designed to mitigate hypothetical bias by explaining the risk of this outcome to respondents before asking the valuation questions competition commission 2010 mahieu et al 2012 the version of the cheap talk approach we used was based on the short and neutral approaches developed by aadland and caplan 2006 do and bennett 2007 and khai and yabe 2014 the cheap talk scrip was also tested to ensure good understanding by participants in the pilot survey our approach included a reminder to respondents to consider budget constraints when making their responses and treating their decision as if the payment were real this information is then cross checked with information about the respondent s socio economic characteristics and their ability to pay finally an ex post robustness approach was also adopted using a follow up question asking respondents to specify the certainty of their answers champ et al 1997 competition commission 2010 whitehead and cherry 2007 in these approaches the farm household participants had more time to reconsider their responses before a firm decision was made and noted in the questionnaire 2 2 analytical method the basic theory of cvm approach was proposed by hanemann 1984 with concepts derived from consumer theory we begin with the random utility function of a respondent which is 1 u k u k w z e k v k w z e k where k 0 is the status quo and k 1 is the condition where a salinity intrusion mitigation public good is provided utility function components include income w respondents characteristics z and error component e respondent s utility increases when public goods provided with the payment tj are higher than utility in the status quo 2 u 1 j u 1 w j t j z j e 1 j u 0 w j z j e 0 j the probability of an individual response would be yes if the following conditions hold 3 pr y e s t j pr u 1 w j t j z j e 1 j u 0 w j z j e 0 j from eq 1 we can rewrite this probability as follows 4 pr y e s t pr v 1 w j t j z j e 1 j v 0 w j z j e 0 j and assume that the utility function vk is linear we can then rewrite eq 4 as 5 pr yes t pr α1 z j β 1 w j t j e 1j α0 z j β 0 w j e 0j this then allows us to rearrange the above function as follows 6 p r y e s t pr α 1 α 0 z j β t j e 1 j e 0 j 0 pr α z j β t j e j 0 where α α1 α0 and e j e 1j e 0j because the error terms are assumed to be independently and identically distributed the probability of a respondent choosing yes can be estimated with 7 pr yes t j pr αz j βt j e j 0 pr e j αz j βt j pr e j αz j βt j f αz j βt j the function in eq 7 is then estimated using maximum likelihood procedures and v assumes a linear form including income w farm household s characteristics z and the final bid value in this study multinomial logistic regression mnl and binary logistic regression treatment models were initially employed to analyse the referendum format of the cvm details of such analysis models are discussed by lancsar et al 2017 as stated above in our cvm survey farm households were asked to respond to the willingness to pay bid value question in one of three ways yes no or do not know in the analysis model α and β are coefficients and x is a vector of the socio economic explanatory variables related to an individual s selection including farm household income head of household s age head of household s gender farm household size head of household s education and total farming experience table 1 the non parametric technique is employed to estimate the mean values for wtp this technique was suggested by previous researchers in the same survey area đan and duyên 2010 khai and yabe 2014 thus we estimated mean willingness to pay values as follows 8 n j k j 1 5 n k where n is the sample size n j is the sub sample size who chose b j with b j as the bid value where j 1 2 3 n and n j is the sub sample size that is willing to pay more than bid value b j then the survivor function at each b j is 9 s b j n j n j 0 t o 5 finally the mean value for mrd farm households willingness to pay is estimated as follows 10 m e a n w t p j 0 5 s b j b j 1 b j 3 results 3 1 descriptive analysis results the socioeconomic characteristics for each of the mrd farm household groups are presented in table 2 5 vietnam household living standard survey 2010 there is a wider range of educational levels 1 primary school 2 secondary school 3 high school 4 7 vocational education 8 college 9 university 10 masters 11 phd 12 other used in the vhlss and this difference is taken into account in our comparison below to test for sample representativeness the results are compared with data from the vietnam household living standard survey vhlss a national survey of the vietnamese population conducted every two years in general respondent characteristics in each group are consistent across the three groups and with the vhlss results in the context of an mrd culture in which decision makers are typically men the majority of household heads interviewed were male the average age of the head of household was 47 years the mean head of household s education level was 2 05 for the current salinity impacted group 2 03 for the high future risk group and 2 48 for the control group indicating that mrd farmers have mainly achieved primary or secondary school level educations the majority were born immediately after the vietnam war when much of the national and local infrastructure had been destroyed and communities were trying to re establish themselves this may explain the relatively low education levels among respondents in terms of farm household income the control group group 3 had highest annual income at vnd 112 million per annum us 5022 compared to the salinity intrusion group 1 and high risk groups group 2 which on average earned vnd 104 5 million per annum us 4753 this outcome together with the higher variability in results as depicted by the standard deviation values would suggest some negative farm income affects associated with current salinity and or the risk of future salinity impacts in addition to identify any differences in the mean values of the variables in table 2 across the three farm households groups we employed the one way analysis of variance anova and tukey post hoc tests the anova results confirmed no statistically significant differences between the three groups except gender f 2438 5 28 p 0 0054 and education level f 2438 7 13 p 0 0009 similarly the tukey post hoc test revealed slightly higher farm head of household education levels in the control group group 3 and slightly higher numbers of females in groups 1 and 2 however the differences are minimal and we therefore conclude that the analysis results from this study are broadly representative of the mrd farmer population 3 2 willingness to pay results 3 2 1 reasons for unwillingness to pay in terms of respondents willingness to pay our study first examined reasons why respondents may be unwilling to pay for the goods of interest key reasons offered include a preference for alternative goods and programs a lack of capacity to pay and questions of government capacity to manage the proposed program s table 3 summarises the reasons why some farm households are unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program the main reason households voted against a proposed program was their reported inability to afford the required payments the second highest selected reason was a farm household perception that salinity intrusion reduction should primarily be the responsibility of the vietnamese government approximately 20 percent of farm households also did not believe that their contributions would be used to fund the program correctly finally approximately 15 percent of farm households in salinity impacted areas voted against the program contributions because they felt that they could adapt to and live with mrd salinity intrusion 6 6 following discussion by jorgensen et al 1999 we estimated the model results using expanded zero bid protest vote definitions that included program ineffectiveness beliefs and feelings that the respondent can deal with problem by themselves the model estimates did not vary greatly from the original analyses and so were not included here these estimates are available on request 3 2 2 willingness to pay and its determinants fig 2 summarizes the proportion of farm household responses to various bid levels offered in the survey in general the percentage of farm households answering yes decreases as the bid level increases however those mrd farms that are currently affected by salinity or facing a high risk of future impact were generally inclined toward a yes response even at higher bid levels as expected the proportion of farmers that indicated their unwillingness to contribute increased as bid levels were raised but again with smaller total percentages from the currently affected and high future risk groups finally the proportion of farmers answering do not know to the bid levels rapidly falls to zero in the control group but remains positive for the other groups at relatively low levels 4 on average these results suggest that mrd farmers recognize the significant risks and negative impacts associated with salinity intrusion even when they are not yet exposed to salinity factors that influence mrd farm households willingness to pay for salinity intrusion risk reduction are presented in table 4 we estimate the results across three models model 1 is an mnl model with no responses as the base outcome while model 2 is a binary logistic regression that reclassifies all do not know answers as a no in model 3 also in the form of a binary logistic regression do not know answers are deleted entirely from the dataset the results of model fit statistics showed that the likelihood ratio lr in three models are significant p 0 001 in all models and pseudo r square values of 0 304 0 294 and 0 338 in models 1 2 and 3 respectively hence this result indicated a good fit and all three models are statistically significant and explained by the independent variables included further and as detailed in table 4 variance inflation factor vif values for each of the independent variables are smaller than 7 0 indicating that there are no significant multicollinearity issues with the modeling the results from the three models are broadly uniform consistent with economic theory farm household income and bid value are strongly correlated with increased probability of willingness to pay that is high farm income correlates with a positive probability of willingness to pay as expected higher bid values are negatively correlated with a probability of willingness to pay in a manner that is consistent with other climate change impact studies e g wang 1997 and willingness to pay studies from the mrd đan and duyên 2010 khai and yabe 2014 interestingly although older farmers are weakly associated with an increased probability of willingness to pay farmers with more experience were generally less likely to be willing to pay toward salinity intrusion reduction programs we did not expect to find this outcome it may be because experienced mrd farmers feel capable of dealing with salinity intrusion on their own or consider that local authorities cannot be trusted to manage the problem effectively in any case this result is supported by recent research on farmers willingness to pay for rice farming insurance in the mrd thong 2014 finally the negative coefficient for the group variable suggests that the probability of farm household willingness to pay increases with their proximity to current and expected salinity impact results from the non parametric estimation methods using eq 10 show that the highest willingness to pay level is associated with the group already experiencing high salinity intrusion table 5 farm households in this group are willing to contribute approximately us 2 58 per month toward the salinity reduction programs while farms in the control group are only willing to contribute around half of that amount i e us 1 32 per month across the three groups annual farm household contribution to salinity reduction programs would average us 23 57 a kruskal willis h test was employed to examine whether these wtp values were statistically different for the three farm household groups the results showed a statistical difference between the three groups χ 2 2 9 847 at a strong significance level p 0 0073 which is below 0 01 we can loosely compare this to research in the uk where people were willing to pay a monthly premium of 4 46 about us 5 77 for coastal defence projects jones et al 2015 this finding is also somewhat comparable with a review of previous studies which indicated that annual willingness to pay for climate policy is in a range of between us 22 and us 437 per household in samples drawn from american asian and european populations johnson et al 2010 finally in the literature surrounding climate change mitigation projects funded by higher energy prices we note that korean consumers are willing to pay us 3 21 per month for renewable energy lee and heo 2016 while japanese consumers median wtp for green electricity is about us 17 per month nomura and akai 2004 which align with the values reported here in any case the results of this study reveal a promising community participation attitude toward solving the sea dike public funding deficit in vietnam offering a promising basis for policy makers to establish appropriate projects actions 3 2 3 adjustment for biases finally our study also estimated relative economic sacrifice res values to assess the robustness of the willingness to pay results where res b i y i bi is the chosen bid level and yi is the farm household s total income this res is the ratio between the respondent s willingness to pay level and total per annum farm household income the res value for each farm household group was 0 0032 salinity impacted areas 0 0034 high future risk areas and 0 0019 control group areas these values are relatively small and suggest that our willingness to pay estimates are not overstated this conclusion is further supported by an assessment of the ratio between mean willingness to pay and annual farm household income 4 discussion the positive willingness to pay results reported here suggest that mrd farm households are concerned about the adverse impacts of salinity intrusion while some larger mrd farm households may struggle to contribute as reflected in our findings there is little evidence of a large scale protest based on our results it is reasonable to conclude that the financial impact on most households would be minimal approximately at the 0 65 of one percent level of annual net farm income the next issue to consider is the question of how much money might be needed to fund an effective salinity intrusion control program and how much households could contribute to the cost of running such a program as shown in fig 3 and according to danh 2012 one option is to build around 1469 km of concrete sea dikes accepting this as a possible scenario and noting that a it may be possible for many farmers to live with and adapt to salinity intrusion by doing such things as moving from rice production to fish or shrimp farming b that a combination of earth dikes and mangroves may provide a more environmentally friendly program and after a completion of a full economic evaluation of non market benefits may also provide a more socially beneficial solution and c under the premise that some of this problem has been caused by the actions of people in other countries and that as such a significant international contribution to the cost of controlling salinity intrusion could be expected it may be possible to conduct a more detail exploratory analysis of the feasibility of calling upon mrd households to fund much if not all of any mrd salinity intrusion control program table 6 contains estimates of the costs of constructing and maintaining concrete sea dike walls across rural vietnam adapted from danh 2012 a two meter concrete sea dike wall requires approximately us 1 16 million per kilometre in construction costs this increases to us 2 8 million per kilometre if the sea dike wall height is increased to four meters over the total length of mrd coastal area identified program costs for concrete sea dike wall construction would require total funding of approximately us 1 7 billion for two meter concrete sea dike walls us 2 8 billion for three meter concrete sea dike walls and us 4 1 billion for four meter concrete sea dike walls significantly as a relatively poor country and where climate induced sea level rise is the prime cause of the salinity intrusion problem the vietnamese government should be able to borrow the money needed to build a sea dike walls system at 1 08 7 7 this is the weighted average cost of capital wacc estimated by asian development bank applied for transport corridor noi bai lao cai highway project loan for vietnam p a interest rate from asian development bank adb and repay the principle over a loan term 40 years if this is the case then the annual payment would be between 53 m and 127 m per annual table 6 8 identified by function a us loan amount i 1 i n i 1 i n 1 where i is wacc and n is number of loan years if the repayment figure is then equally divided across the 3 3 million farm households 9 9 the number of household in mrd is around 4 7 million in 2015 the vietnam general statistic office www gso gov vn in which 69 3 are farm household in rural areas ministry of planning and investment currently located in the mrd ministry of planning and investment 2015 it would result in a need to collect between us 16 and us 39 per farm household however if the contribution involves all households including non farm households in the mrd where a total of 4 7 million households are located the annual payment period will be decreased from 40 to 30 years and the annual contribution required per household would fall to between us 14 and us 35 per household clearly this is a very crude estimate and not sufficient to recommend the implementation of an mrd concrete sea dike program nevertheless the estimated per farm household contribution required to meet adb loan repayment is less than the average stated willingness to pay levels found in our study therefore our results suggest that in the absence of other public funds private mrd farm household contributions may be sufficient to cover the cost of building a concrete sea dike that would protect farm lands from climate change induced sea level rise the issue of whether this is equitable remains the subject of further analysis and discussion that we will address in future research nevertheless the insights provided by this paper have important ramifications for vietnam other developing country contexts faced with salinity intrusion impacts and broader climate change management policy 5 conclusions this study estimates mrd farm household willingness to pay for salinity intrusion mitigation programs the results reveal that more than 50 percent of farm households are willing to contribute to a fund that could be used to reduce salinity intrusion risk and that their willingness to pay is in proportion to expected salinity impacts farm households in current salinity intrusion affected areas are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those farm households located in lower or no current risk areas however all farm households included in the study including those who at present are unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to pay for an mrd salinity management program when assessed in aggregate the total amount of money that farm households are prepared to pay is significant and may be sufficient to cover the total costs of such a program care must be taken however in the interpretation of this result while the payment vehicle adopted in this study suggests feasibility work on the most appropriate government arrangements requires further analysis careful research for example on the merits of establishing a separate salinity intrusion control authority versus the use of an existing government structure is needed similarly there is a need to consider how best to involve farmers in any program that they pay for further the question of whether or not mrd farm households should be made to pay for the adverse effects of global climate change and upstream development is an important ethical and legal question to resolve it is our intention to address these issues in future research papers acknowledgements

11559,effect of plant bio regulators pbrs viz potassium nitrate kno3 15gl 1 thio urea tu 500ppm salicylic acid sa 10μm gibberellic acid ga3 25ppm and sodium benzoate sb 150mgl 1 for two years 2015 17 under various levels of deficit irrigation created using line source sprinkler system lss was evaluated in onion allium cepa l the crop could sustain little water deficits and its bulb yield declined to 0 84 0 66 0 48 0 35 0 24 and 0 16 when irrigation water iw applied equalled 0 85 0 70 0 55 0 40 0 25 and 0 10 times the pan evaporation cpe against maximum yield at full irrigation iw cpe 1 00 application of pbrs helped to mitigate the water stress through maintenance of leaf water content modulating the canopy temperature and better water usage thereby improving average bulb yields by 10 1 25 especially kno3 and tu were more effective under low to medium water deficits the water productivity ranged between 7 78 and 9 61 with pbrs against 7 36kgm 3 under control the overall water saving was 18 3 25 7 48 4 and 63 8 with pbrs namely ga3 sa tu and kno3 respectively the marketable quality monitored in terms of bulb weight geometric mean diameter and sphericity was significantly reduced with water deficits while it improved with pbrs among the other physicochemical and functional quality characteristics of the onion bulb rehydration ratio protein content total soluble sugar total phenolics content and pyruvic acid were lowered by water deficits these were improved significantly with pbrs thus it was concluded that combining pbrs like kno3 and tu can further facilitate to implement deficit irrigation technology for sustaining productivity and quality of onion under water scarce conditions keywords deficit irrigation plant bio regulators pbrs water productivity onion bulb quality line source sprinkler system lss 1 introduction onion is one of the major vegetable crops grown in arid and semi arid regions across the world india is second largest onion producer contributes about one fifth of the world production though cultivated both during and post monsoon seasons vanitha et al 2013 latter is preferred by farmers for its superior quality larger and uniform bulb size better storage and fewer incidences of diseases however this crop is vulnerable to midseason drought as a consequence of erratic rainfall and low storage of moisture due to shallowness of soils which are insufficient to meet crop water demands pelter et al 2004 el balla et al 2013 therefore supplemental irrigation continues to be the key strategy to achieve its yield potential and stabilized production zheng et al 2013 pejic et al 2014 anyhow scarcity of water being a main constraint for its production the priority should be on the adoption of appropriate irrigation strategies those help in saving irrigation water among the various techniques proposed deficit irrigation provides a means of reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on yield zhang et al 2004 mermoud et al 2005 here the crop is exposed to a certain level of water stress either during a particular period or throughout the growing season however the deficit irrigation has been tested in most of agricultural crops which are able to sustain via extracting water from comparatively lower soil depth during irrigation limiting situations ali et al 2007 being shallow rooted crop onion is more sensitive to water stress rao 2016 and therefore requires frequent and light irrigations koriem et al 1994 therefore deficit irrigation may have limited feasibility in onion but the same needs to be established keeping this in view the first objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of deficit irrigation levels on yield and quality of onion bulbs for promotion of growth and development under water stress conditions exogenous application of plant bio regulators pbrs and other nutrient supplements have been tried under both controlled and actual field conditions hassanein et al 2015 ratnakumar et al 2016 srivastava et al 2016 these promote the ability of plants to cope with the stress conditions by mediating growth development nutrient allocation and source sink transitions mainly the pbrs with thiol groups which are involved in redox signalling and help to improve phloem translocation of photosynthate in plants and thereby alleviating salinity and drought stress in cereals pulses and spices crops bhunia et al 2015 ratnakumar et al 2016 wakchaure et al 2016a phenolic compound salicylic acid sa is an important signal transducer for mediating plant tolerance against the different abiotic stresses through regulation of physiological processes such as photosynthesis antioxidant defense system nitrogen metabolism proline metabolism production of glycinebetaine gb and plant water relations under stress conditions khan et al 2015 potassium k is key element for crop growth which improves yield and tolerance to drought by regulating turgor pressure and photosynthesis translocation of cations and enzymes activation raza et al 2013 the plant hormone gibberellin ga3 is a natural diterpenoid which promotes growth related physiological processes in plants sodium benzoate a hydroxyl radical scavenger which protects the plant against oxidative damage under stress condition by inhibiting the ethylene synthesis thereby improving the seed yield of forage cowpea and wheat beltrano et al 1999 kumar et al 2014 overall these reports signify the beneficial role of exogenous application of pbrs in regulation of physiological processes plant water relations and induction of antioxidant defence mechanism essential for plant tolerance to abiotic stresses thus deficit irrigation is now being proposed for sustaining crop productivity and supplementing plant bio regulators pbrs can further help to mitigate water stress wakchaure et al 2016b however their impacts are yet to be evaluated for shallow rooted vegetable crops onion allium cepa l is one such crop that is often grown under water scarcity conditions there is general lack of knowledge on relative response of pbrs on onion particularly for alleviation of water stress under field conditions therefore some of the selected pbrs were tested for their role in mitigating stress specifically their interactive effects under varied moisture regimes in terms of performance of onion and its quality characteristics 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and treatments a field experiment was carried at the research farm of icar national institute of abiotic stress management niasm baramati in pune district of maharashtra india 18 09 n 74 30 e and 560 mamsl during the post monsoon season november april of two consecutive years 2015 2017 the black soil 40cm depth

148kgha 1 respectively the site characterized by low and erratic rainfall and is highly susceptible to drought the long term average annual rainfall is 588mm mainly restricted to south west monsoon 71 and retreating monsoon 22 of which post monsoon onion growing season receives less than 20mm rainfall saha et al 2015 annual uswb open pan evaporation averages 1965mm minhas et al 2015 and that of the two growing seasons is 769 4mm the meteorological parameters during onion growth in two years were recorded using automated weather station aws located at the research farm of niasm the daily mean temperature ranged between 17 5 32 2 c while the corresponding minimum and maximum temperatures were 6 5 and 39 8 c respectively for same growth period average wind speed values were 5 3 and 4 7kmh 1 in the year 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively the corresponding average relative humidity values were 47 6 and 45 1 for the respective years only 5 5mm and 0 8mm rainfall was received during the entire onion growth season in the year 2015 16 and 2016 2017 respectively experimental field was initially ploughed and this was followed by rotovator for preparation of beds onion cv bhima kiran seedlings of 45days old were transplanted on 20 and 19 november during 2015 and 2016 in rows 15cm apart keeping plant to plant distance as 10cm after initial two post plant irrigations to facilitate the seedling establishment the treatments consisted of the combinations of i exogenous application of pbrs viz potassium nitrate kno3 15gl 1 thio urea tu 500ppm salicylic acid sa 10μm giberellic acid ga3 25ppm and sodium benzoate sb 150mgl 1 at 40 60 80 and 100days after transplanting dat with control no pbr as main plot and ii quantities of supplemental irrigation based upon climatological approach i e ratio of depth of irrigation water iw applied to cumulative open pan evaporation cpe as subplot these were arranged in split plot design with three replications fig 1 the irrigation water applied using line source sprinkler system lss operated at 300kpa that provided linearly decreasing water distribution pattern at 30m wetted diameter the details of iw applied in each irrigation was measured using series of pvc catchment canes 100mm dia 195mm height placed across the center of subplots 2m 2m is given table 1 thus the levels of irrigation created in terms of iw cpe were 1 00 0 85 0 70 0 55 0 40 0 25 and 0 10 the water deficits generated with irrigation at iw cpe 0 84 0 70 0 69 0 40 and 0 39 0 10 were rated as low medium and severe water deficits the recommended doses of n p2o5 and k2o i

thermometer agri therm iii 6210l everest interscience inc usa before solar noon time a positive catd indicates stress condition while a negative value indicates no stress for a plant similarly relative water content rwc was determined by using method proposed by bandyopadhyay et al 2014 total onion bulb yield and other attributes were measured from each subplot after manual harvesting of crop at physiological maturity plant height stem girth weight bulb bulb sphericity φ and geometric mean diameter dgm were measured from the randomly selected 10 plants from each subplot the geometric mean diameter dgm and sphericity φ were calculated from a number of linear dimensions of onion bulb viz polar and equatorial diameter and thickness as expression given by park et al 2013 2 3 bulb quality parameters estimation freshly harvested healthy bulbs from respective treatments were evaluated for quality parameters the adhering debris were removed by thorough washing with tap water the outer skins and ends of the cleaned bulbs were removed and the inner material was homogeneously chopped into smaller pieces 5mm the pieces were mixed vigorously and used for estimation of physicochemical and functional characteristics the rehydration ratio rr was determined according to the procedure given by ranganna 2002 briefly 5g of dried bulb samples were added to 150ml of distilled water boiled for 15min cooled and the rr was determined by draining off the excess water the total soluble sugar tss content from the bulb tissues was determined by using anthrone reagent method yemm and willis 1954 total protein from the bulb tissues were estimated using lowry s method lowry et al 1951 briefly the tissue samples 0 5g were homogenized in chilled phosphate edta buffer 100 1mm ph 7 8 the supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 12000rpm for 10min and used for estimation of total protein bovine serum albumin bsa served as standard the quantification of total phenolics tp from the bulb tissues was achieved using folin ciocalteu method singleton et al 1999 bharathi et al 2014 and expressed in terms of gallic acid equivalent gae the pyruvic acid content was estimated as described by teare ketter and randle 1998 2 4 statistical analysis data from experiment were statistically analysed using sas software ver 9 3 to study the effect of pbrs and irrigation levels on growth yield and nutritional quality parameters statistical significance among main and subplot treatments was estimated by analysis of variance gomez and gomez 1984 since the larger irrigation effects are obtained in the field experiment performed using lss farre and faci 2006 least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 were determined using student s t and duncan s multiple range tests for separating means of two treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth and bulb yield periodic changes in growth as indicated by growth and canopy parameters like plant height stem girth and lai are presented in fig 2 the overall improvements in these parameters was quite rapid until 70days after transplanting dat and thereafter stem girth and plant height remained almost constant while the lai decreased with drying the growth rate was limited by water stress under deficit irrigation e g the plant height at 90 dat averaged 66 1 64 7 63 2 60 3 55 7 52 3 and 52 2cm when irrigated at iw cpe of 1 0 0 85 0 70 0 55 0 40 0 25 and 0 10 whereas their respective stem girth was 16 8 15 3 13 7 12 4 11 1 9 5 and 8 7mm similarly the lai peaked at 70 dat with corresponding values being 2 12 1 73 1 37 0 99 0 76 0 61 and 0 56 respectively the growth also got improved with application of pbrs the kno3 showed maximum impact followed by tu sa ga3 and sb e g the respective lai s attained at 70 dat averaged 1 41 1 33 1 18 1 10 0 99 over control 0 96 the other physiological parameter like relative water content rwc indicated that the impact of water stress was the maximum at 70 90 dat fig 3 however pbrs helped to maintain higher rw anosheh et al 2012 and bandyopadhyay et al 2014 have earlier reported that the lai rwc and other growth parameters reduced drastically under severe water deficits owing to lower light interception and root water uptake thus decreases photosynthesis and overall plant growth the pbrs play an important role in improving leaf water content chlorophyll content photosynthesis and photosynthetically active surface semida 2016 the catd value continued to be negative up to 88 110 dat with low to medium water deficits iw cpe 0 55 1 00 indicating absence of stress till bulb development stage fig 3 however the early set of water stress was eminent from catd values becoming positive after 65 76 dat with deficit irrigation at iw cpe 0 10 0 40 and the values increased during post vegetative and bulb formation stages the highest catd difference 8 1 c was obtained at 90 dat followed by 4 7 c at 110 dat and 4 5 c at 70 dat also indicating that onion is highly sensitive to water stress during this period further the limited water uptake after 65 76 dat at iw cpe 0 10 0 40 indicates that their transpiration was reflected in terms of rise in catd this is supported by lower rwc which is the main factor accountable for lowering of transpiration rate resulted into higher canopy temperature at severe water deficits bandyopadhyay et al 2014 foliar sprays of pbrs helped to keep the cooler canopy temperature upto 3 1 c particularly at most sensitive water stress stage 90 dat for all pbrs negative catd values 1 8 to 0 0 c were obtained up to 80 dat while no pbr showed positive catd 0 5 c subsequently positivity in catd was attended at 102 97 91 84 and 81 dat for kno3 tu sa ga3 and sb respectively representing relative response of pbrs to alleviate the impact of water stress over control 76 dat thus pbrs play an important role in modulating canopy temperature and leaf water status under heat stress and water deficits srivastava et al 2016 the changes in growth with deficit irrigation and pbrs were also reflected in bulb yield table 2 onion bulb yield decreased with increase in water deficits the bulb yield averaged 57 92mgha 1 with irrigation at iw cpe 1 00 and the minimum 10 76mgha 1 under severe water stress iw cpe 0 10 when referenced to iw cpe 1 00 under control no pbr the relative yields ry obtained at iw cpe 0 85 0 70 0 55 0 40 0 25 and 0 10 were 0 84 0 66 0 48 0 35 0 24 and 0 16 respectively similar reductions in bulb yield have earlier been reported by bekele and tilahun 2007 and zheng et al 2013 as a result of water deficit plants reduce water loss by closing their stomata which mainly cuts co2 supply for photosynthesis sun et al 2013 moreover reduction in nutrients uptake in water stress conditions restricts dry matter production amiri et al 2017 thereby overall reduction in yields the application of pbrs helped to improve the onion bulb yield when averaged for two years the improvement in bulb yield equalled 25 1 19 3 12 9 10 1 and 4 6 respectively with kno3 tu sa ga3 and sb over the control the interactive effects of pbrs and irrigation levels were also significant table 2 supplementary table 1 mainly kno3 and tu were more effective in mitigating the negative impact of water stress at all the deficit levels though the crop responded to application of sa and ga3 in 2016 17 these remained ineffective during 2015 16 these results endorsed the earlier reports on the benefits of pbrs and possible mechanisms illustrated for enhancing tolerance growth and yield components under stress environments e g in wheat under drought stress with tu hassanein et al 2015 and salt stress with kno3 zheng et al 2008 in sunflower amutha et al 2007 under high temperature stress and wheat anosheh et al 2012 under drought with sa in wheat under water stress with sb beltrano et al 1999 and in rice under salinity stress with ga3 misratia et al 2013 the positive responses to pbrs are usually assigned to their ability to fine tune the plant redox homeostasis which regulate root growth for improving plant water nutrient status photosynthetic efficiency and source sink homeostasis to enhance crop yield ratnakumar et al 2016 3 2 water productivity affected by pbrs and water deficits water productivity wp calculated as ratio of onion bulb yield to water consumption that includes applied water and rainfall varied significantly with pbrs practices across the irrigation levels fig 4 wp decreased with increase in water deficits for all pbrs comparatively higher wp values were noticed with pbrs and these averaged 9 61 9 11 8 51 8 33 7 78 and 7 36kgm 3 with kno3 tu ga3 sa sb and control respectively the wp values improved by 8 4 13 4 13 5 20 9 and 21 0 23 5 at low iw cpe 0 84 0 70 medium 0 69 0 40 and severe stress 0 39 0 25 conditions respectively over the control as given above and reported earlier by wakchaure et al 2016a pbrs like kno3 and tu were more effective in maintenance of cooler leaf canopy modulating the stomata opening and water usage which considerably enhanced wp under water stress conditions a decline of wp of onion to almost half 12 6 4kgm 3 has earlier been reported by zheng et al 2013 others bekele and tilahun 2007 reported that up to 23 reduction in water use efficiency for onion grown under different growth stages specific deficit irrigation treatments second degree polynomials were fitted r2 0 93 0 98 to elucidate the role of pbrs at various deficit irrigation levels fig 4 it is evident that improvement in wp with pbrs was relatively more at higher water deficits the maximum wp computed using these curvilinear relations ranged between 9 6 10 2kgm 3 with pbrs at iw cpe 0 70 1 00 against 9 4kgm 3 with no pbr at iw cpe 1 00 considering the wp of 8 7kgm 3 obtained at the recommended irrigation practice for onion i e iw cpe 0 85 equalling the application of 525mm irrigation water the calculations show that the same could be obtained with irrigation water equalling 190 271 390 and 429mm with kno3 tu sa and ga3 respectively thus there exists a considerable possibility of deficit irrigation if combined with pbrs e g water saving of 18 3 25 7 48 4 and 63 8 in irrigation water with ga3 sa tu and kno3 respectively al jamal et al 2000 described the similar curvilinear relationship because of excess water applied in different irrigation levels was utilised to keep the root zone wet for uniform root growth and reduces evapotranspiration for shallow rooted onion crop whereas others zheng et al 2013 reported logarithmic function best defined the relationship between aw and wp for the onion 3 3 bulb quality the marketable quality i e onion bulb size as monitored in terms of bulb weight sphericity φ and geometric mean diameter dgm was affected by both water deficits and pbrs table 3 when averaged for the two years the bulb weight was reduced to one fourth at the highest stress level iw cpe 0 10 while the geometric mean diameter dgm was three fifth pbrs improved the average bulb weight 93 1 104 6g over control 89 8g and also the dgm to 55 3 60 4cm against 53 8cm in control a corresponding response was also monitored in sphericity of bulbs φ such variations in bulb quality were also observed in onion grown with deficit irrigation under arid region of northwest china zheng et al 2013 and lower rio grande valley of texas enciso et al 2009 the physicochemical and functional quality characteristics of onion bulbs as affected by deficit irrigation levels and the application of pbrs are presented in fig 5 rehydration ratio rr was improved substantially by water deficits e g the average rr was 6 6 6 8 6 9 7 2 and 7 3 7 9 at low medium and severe stress levels as compared to 6 1 at full irrigation this was obviously due to increased dry matter with occurrence of earlier bulb maturity in stressed conditions zheng et al 2013 comparatively lesser damage in spore structure during rehydration mitra et al 2011 and exertion of lower pressure on cell wall and higher epidermal elasticity with decreased internal turgor due to water stress could be the another possible reasons guichard et al 1999 pbrs helped to improve the rr 5 9 8 5 over control 5 8 7 2 the maximum improvement in rr 9 4 15 3 occurred with kno3 and this was followed by tu 6 5 13 3 pbrs stimulated cell growth and facilitated plant regeneration thereby enhancing the yield and better fruit quality seems the major reason for the same mohamed et al 2012 total soluble sugar content tss increased initially iw cpe 1 00 from 38 5 to 42 5 44 8mgg 1 with low water stress iw cpe 0 70 and thereafter reduced to 30 2 37 7mgg 1 at severe stress conditions the characteristic initial upward and constant trend of tss is usually attributed to the influence of stressor on carbohydrates synthesis mechanism in the leaves and subsequent translocation to the bulbs during senescence hamilton et al 1998 higher rate of conversion of starch to sugars under moderate stress could also contribute to the fluctuations in tss content this phenomenon was also confirmed by marouelli et al 2004 where occurrence of moderate water stress during growth period remarkably enhanced the tss content of tomato however the dehydration of leaves under severe stress conditions markedly influences the overall bulb sugar accumulation due to dehydration mediated photosynthesis arrest a general downfall in the tss content was noted under the influence of all pbrs across the irrigation levels however the foliar application of pbrs enhanced the tss values those ranged from 37 7 45 3 35 9 43 5 32 8 42 5 35 4 41 9 and 32 1 40 4mgg 1 with kno3 tu sa ga and sb respectively as compared to 30 2 39 6mgg 1 under control these results indicating towards the protective mechanism of pbrs in the regulation of phloem translocation of sucrose for photosynthate in plants thereby inducing drought tolerance are similar to those reported by bhunia et al 2015 the total protein content of onion improved with pbrs at different water deficits e g it ranged between 2 34 2 93 2 35 3 62 and 2 82 3 86 at low medium and severe stress levels with pbrs whereas respective values were 2 22 2 25 2 26 2 59 and 2 60 2 91 under control amongst the pbrs the improvement in protein content equalled 25 9 21 6 15 3 14 9 and 6 9 with kno3 tu sa ga3 and sb respectively over control onset of water deficit has restrictive effect on root development as well as intake of k from the soil which finally results in down regulated tolerance of the plant the role of k in protein synthesis and enzymes activation photosynthesis stress tolerance etc have been well demonstrated previously marschner 2012 thus our results strongly support the replenishment of k from exogenously applied kno3 under higher levels of water deficit which could have contributed the role in overall maintenance of high protein content and superior physiological status of the crop these results also endorse the earlier findings that protein content increased under water stress with application of pbrs in other crops as well farooq and bano 2006 anosheh et al 2012 onion is rich in polyphenol compounds which encompass antioxidant potential cheng et al 2013 water deficits resulted in enhancement of the total phenolics contents tp of bulb tissue tp increased from 6 9 to 15 4mg gae 100g 1 with increase in level of water deficits while it ranged between 6 2 8 1mg gae 100g 1 with full irrigation iw cpe 1 0 in other words smaller size onion bulb obtained at higher water deficits contained higher tp compared to larger onion bulb without stress thus it seems that water deficits imposed oxidative stress where the phenolics fraction could contribute the non enzymatic management of superoxide radicals gill and tuteja 2010 tp was also reported to increase under severe and moderate water stress in cumin by rebey et al 2012 pbrs further helped to increase tp contents especially under higher water deficits kno3 tu and ga3 performed better than others the pbrs especially kno3 induced enhancement in phenolic compounds in plants improved the overall resistivity of the plant towards an array of biotic and abiotic factors prasad et al 2010 these observations have implication that the demand of greater bulb size imposes limits on tp and water deficits therefore the supplementation of pbrs can be an important strategy to achieve tp levels without loss of yields with water deficits an array of sulphur containing volatile compounds vocs generated upon mechanical injury contribute to the pungency of onion these compounds are principally generated following the action of enzyme alliinase on s alk en yl l cysteine sulphoxides which also generates proportionate quantities of pyruvic acid along with vocs schwimmer and weston 1961 wall and corigan 1992 pyruvic acid content therefore serve as an index of onion pungency in this study we observed significant variations in the pyruvate content of the bulb tissue across the water regimes and pbrs treatments fig 6 pungency values increased with the stress intensity and also with pbrs the maximum pungency 102 105mmg 1 was recorded under severe water stress conditions with kno3 and this was followed by tu it seems that kno3 has nitrate n and tu has sulfhydryl group and their attribution to biosynthesis of amino acids as cysteines known to protect to metabolites of the oxidation jocelyn 1972 yoshiyama et al 1996 mohamed et al 2012 the pungency also being one of the major economic and quality determinant in onion these results highlight that pbrs can ensure the quality of onion under water scarce environments 4 conclusions water saving with deficit irrigation for vegetable crops has become a major concern to sustain their yields while maintaining the quality to produce the pbrs were quite effective in improving bulb yield 10 1 25 and water productivity 7 78 9 61kgm 3 of onion especially the kno3 and tu were identified to have role for mitigating water stress and help to boost the production vis a vis productivity of onion under water deficit conditions the overall results suggest that foliar application of pbrs with low to moderate stress iw cpe 0 84 0 55 should be preferred to sustain both the productivity and quality of onion bulb otherwise the latter is also a major issue under water deficits acknowledgement the research work was supported by the research grants ixx11584 from the indian council of agricultural research new delhi india appendix a supplementary

application of pbrs helped to mitigate the water stress through maintenance of leaf water content modulating the canopy temperature and better water usage thereby improving average bulb yields by 10 1

was 18 3 25 7 48 4 and 63 8 with pbrs namely ga3 sa tu and kno3 respectively the marketable quality monitored in terms of bulb weight geometric mean diameter and sphericity was significantly reduced

phenolics content and pyruvic acid were lowered by water deficits these were improved significantly with pbrs thus it was concluded that combining pbrs like kno3 and tu can further facilitate to

bulb quality line source sprinkler system lss 1 introduction onion is one of the major vegetable crops grown in arid and semi arid regions across the world india is second largest onion producer contributes about one fifth of the world production though cultivated both during and post monsoon seasons vanitha et al 2013 latter is preferred by farmers for its superior quality larger and uniform bulb size better storage and fewer incidences of diseases however this crop is vulnerable to midseason drought as a consequence of erratic rainfall and low storage of moisture due to shallowness of soils which are insufficient to meet crop water demands pelter et al 2004 el balla et al 2013 therefore supplemental irrigation continues to be the key strategy to achieve its yield potential and stabilized production zheng et al 2013 pejic et al 2014 anyhow scarcity of water being a main constraint for its production the priority should be on the adoption of appropriate irrigation strategies those help in saving irrigation water among the various techniques proposed deficit irrigation provides a means of reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on yield zhang et al 2004 mermoud et al 2005 here the crop is exposed to a certain level of water stress either during a particular period or throughout the growing season however the deficit irrigation has been tested in most of agricultural crops which are able to sustain via extracting water from comparatively lower soil depth during irrigation limiting situations ali et al 2007 being shallow rooted crop onion is more sensitive to water stress rao 2016 and therefore requires frequent and light irrigations koriem et al 1994 therefore deficit irrigation may have limited feasibility in onion but the same needs to be established keeping this in view the first objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of deficit irrigation levels on yield and quality of onion bulbs for promotion of growth and development under water stress conditions exogenous application of plant bio regulators pbrs and other nutrient supplements have been tried under both controlled and actual field conditions hassanein et al 2015 ratnakumar et al 2016 srivastava et al 2016 these promote the ability of plants to cope with the stress conditions by mediating growth development nutrient allocation and source sink transitions mainly the pbrs with thiol groups which are involved in redox signalling and help to improve phloem translocation of photosynthate in plants and thereby alleviating salinity and drought stress in cereals pulses and spices crops bhunia et al 2015 ratnakumar et al 2016 wakchaure et al 2016a phenolic compound salicylic acid sa is an important signal transducer for mediating plant tolerance against the different abiotic stresses through regulation of physiological processes such as photosynthesis antioxidant defense system nitrogen metabolism proline metabolism production of glycinebetaine gb and plant water relations under stress conditions khan et al 2015 potassium k is key element for crop growth which improves yield and tolerance to drought by regulating turgor pressure and photosynthesis translocation of cations and enzymes activation raza et al 2013 the plant hormone gibberellin ga3 is a natural diterpenoid which promotes growth related physiological processes in plants sodium benzoate a hydroxyl radical scavenger which protects the plant against oxidative damage under stress condition by inhibiting the ethylene synthesis thereby improving the seed yield of forage cowpea and wheat beltrano et al 1999 kumar et al 2014 overall these reports signify the beneficial role of exogenous application of pbrs in regulation of physiological processes plant water relations and induction of antioxidant defence mechanism essential for plant tolerance to abiotic stresses thus deficit irrigation is now being proposed for sustaining crop productivity and supplementing plant bio regulators pbrs can further help to mitigate water stress wakchaure et al 2016b however their impacts are yet to be evaluated for shallow rooted vegetable crops onion allium cepa l is one such crop that is often grown under water scarcity conditions there is general lack of knowledge on relative response of pbrs on onion particularly for alleviation of water stress under field conditions therefore some of the selected pbrs were tested for their role in mitigating stress specifically their interactive effects under varied moisture regimes in terms of performance of onion and its quality characteristics 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and treatments a field experiment was carried at the research farm of icar national institute of abiotic stress management niasm baramati in pune district of maharashtra india 18 09 n 74 30 e and 560 mamsl during the post monsoon season november april of two consecutive years 2015 2017 the black soil 40cm depth

148kgha 1 respectively the site characterized by low and erratic rainfall and is highly susceptible to drought the long term average annual rainfall is 588mm mainly restricted to south west monsoon 71 and retreating monsoon 22 of which post monsoon onion growing season receives less than 20mm rainfall saha et al 2015 annual uswb open pan evaporation averages 1965mm minhas et al 2015 and that of the two growing seasons is 769 4mm the meteorological parameters during onion growth in two years were recorded using automated weather station aws located at the research farm of niasm the daily mean temperature ranged between 17 5 32 2 c while the corresponding minimum and maximum temperatures were 6 5 and 39 8 c respectively for same growth period average wind speed values were 5 3 and 4 7kmh 1 in the year 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively the corresponding average relative humidity values were 47 6 and 45 1 for the respective years only 5 5mm and 0 8mm rainfall was received during the entire onion growth season in the year 2015 16 and 2016 2017 respectively experimental field was initially ploughed and this was followed by rotovator for preparation of beds onion cv bhima kiran seedlings of 45days old were transplanted on 20 and 19 november during 2015 and 2016 in rows 15cm apart keeping plant to plant distance as 10cm after initial two post plant irrigations to facilitate the seedling establishment the treatments consisted of the combinations of i exogenous application of pbrs viz potassium nitrate kno3 15gl 1 thio urea tu 500ppm salicylic acid sa 10μm giberellic acid ga3 25ppm and sodium benzoate sb 150mgl 1 at 40 60 80 and 100days after transplanting dat with control no pbr as main plot and ii quantities of supplemental irrigation based upon climatological approach i e ratio of depth of irrigation water iw applied to cumulative open pan evaporation cpe as subplot these were arranged in split plot design with three replications fig 1 the irrigation water applied using line source sprinkler system lss operated at 300kpa that provided linearly decreasing water distribution pattern at 30m wetted diameter the details of iw applied in each irrigation was measured using series of pvc catchment canes 100mm dia 195mm height placed across the center of subplots 2m 2m is given table 1 thus the levels of irrigation created in terms of iw cpe were 1 00 0 85 0 70 0 55 0 40 0 25 and 0 10 the water deficits generated with irrigation at iw cpe 0 84 0 70 0 69 0 40 and 0 39 0 10 were rated as low medium and severe water deficits the recommended doses of n p2o5 and k2o i e 40kgha 1 each were applied as basal dose while remaining 70kgha 1 of n was top dressed in two splits at 35 and 55days after transplanting dat the crop was harvested manually at physiological maturity in april 1 and 2 during 2016 and 2017 respectively 2 2 growth canopy and yield attributes the observations of plant height stem girth leaf area index lai canopy air temperature difference catd and relative water content rwc were recorded with interval of 20days from 30 dat onwards leaf area index lai ratio of foliar area to ground area was measured using portable lai meter accpar par lai centometer l 8 decagon devces inc wa the differences between canopy and air temperatures catd an indicator of the relative water stress status of the plant were measured using handheld infrared thermometer agri therm iii 6210l everest interscience inc usa before solar noon time a positive catd indicates stress condition while a negative value indicates no stress for a plant similarly relative water content rwc was determined by using method proposed by bandyopadhyay et al 2014 total onion bulb yield and other attributes were measured from each subplot after manual harvesting of crop at physiological maturity plant height stem girth weight bulb bulb sphericity φ and geometric mean diameter dgm were measured from the randomly selected 10 plants from each subplot the geometric mean diameter dgm and sphericity φ were calculated from a number of linear dimensions of onion bulb viz polar and equatorial diameter and thickness as expression given by park et al 2013 2 3 bulb quality parameters estimation freshly harvested healthy bulbs from respective treatments were evaluated for quality parameters the adhering debris were removed by thorough washing with tap water the outer skins and ends of the cleaned bulbs were removed and the inner material was homogeneously chopped into smaller pieces 5mm the pieces were mixed vigorously and used for estimation of physicochemical and functional characteristics the rehydration ratio rr was determined according to the procedure given by ranganna 2002 briefly 5g of dried bulb samples were added to 150ml of distilled water boiled for 15min cooled and the rr was determined by draining off the excess water the total soluble sugar tss content from the bulb tissues was determined by using anthrone reagent method yemm and willis 1954 total protein from the bulb tissues were estimated using lowry s method lowry et al 1951 briefly the tissue samples 0 5g were homogenized in chilled phosphate edta buffer 100 1mm ph 7 8 the supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 12000rpm for 10min and used for estimation of total protein bovine serum albumin bsa served as standard the quantification of total phenolics tp from the bulb tissues was achieved using folin ciocalteu method singleton et al 1999 bharathi et al 2014 and expressed in terms of gallic acid equivalent gae the pyruvic acid content was estimated as described by teare ketter and randle 1998 2 4 statistical analysis data from experiment were statistically analysed using sas software ver 9 3 to study the effect of pbrs and irrigation levels on growth yield and nutritional quality parameters statistical significance among main and subplot treatments was estimated by analysis of variance gomez and gomez 1984 since the larger irrigation effects are obtained in the field experiment performed using lss farre and faci 2006 least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 were determined using student s t and duncan s multiple range tests for separating means of two treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth and bulb yield periodic changes in growth as indicated by growth and canopy parameters like plant height stem girth and lai are presented in fig 2 the overall improvements in these parameters was quite rapid until 70days after transplanting dat and thereafter stem girth and plant height remained almost constant while the lai decreased with drying the growth rate was limited by water stress under deficit irrigation e g the plant height at 90 dat averaged 66 1 64 7 63 2 60 3 55 7 52 3 and 52 2cm when irrigated at iw cpe of 1 0 0 85 0 70 0 55 0 40 0 25 and 0 10 whereas their respective stem girth was 16 8 15 3 13 7 12 4 11 1 9 5 and 8 7mm similarly the lai peaked at 70 dat with corresponding values being 2 12 1 73 1 37 0 99 0 76 0 61 and 0 56 respectively the growth also got improved with application of pbrs the kno3 showed maximum impact followed by tu sa ga3 and sb e g the respective lai s attained at 70 dat averaged 1 41 1 33 1 18 1 10 0 99 over control 0 96 the other physiological parameter like relative water content rwc indicated that the impact of water stress was the maximum at 70 90 dat fig 3 however pbrs helped to maintain higher rw anosheh et al 2012 and bandyopadhyay et al 2014 have earlier reported that the lai rwc and other growth parameters reduced drastically under severe water deficits owing to lower light interception and root water uptake thus decreases photosynthesis and overall plant growth the pbrs play an important role in improving leaf water content chlorophyll content photosynthesis and photosynthetically active surface semida 2016 the catd value continued to be negative up to 88 110 dat with low to medium water deficits iw cpe 0 55 1 00 indicating absence of stress till bulb development stage fig 3 however the early set of water stress was eminent from catd values becoming positive after 65 76 dat with deficit irrigation at iw cpe 0 10 0 40 and the values increased during post vegetative and bulb formation stages the highest catd difference 8 1 c was obtained at 90 dat followed by 4 7 c at 110 dat and 4 5 c at 70 dat also indicating that onion is highly sensitive to water stress during this period further the limited water uptake after 65 76 dat at iw cpe 0 10 0 40 indicates that their transpiration was reflected in terms of rise in catd this is supported by lower rwc which is the main factor accountable for lowering of transpiration rate resulted into higher canopy temperature at severe water deficits bandyopadhyay et al 2014 foliar sprays of pbrs helped to keep the cooler canopy temperature upto 3 1 c particularly at most sensitive water stress stage 90 dat for all pbrs negative catd values 1 8 to 0 0 c were obtained up to 80 dat while no pbr showed positive catd 0 5 c subsequently positivity in catd was attended at 102 97 91 84 and 81 dat for kno3 tu sa ga3 and sb respectively representing relative response of pbrs to alleviate the impact of water stress over control 76 dat thus pbrs play an important role in modulating canopy temperature and leaf water status under heat stress and water deficits srivastava et al 2016 the changes in growth with deficit irrigation and pbrs were also reflected in bulb yield table 2 onion bulb yield decreased with increase in water deficits the bulb yield averaged 57 92mgha 1 with irrigation at iw cpe 1 00 and the minimum 10 76mgha 1 under severe water stress iw cpe 0 10 when referenced to iw cpe 1 00 under control no pbr the relative yields ry obtained at iw cpe 0 85 0 70 0 55 0 40 0 25 and 0 10 were 0 84 0 66 0 48 0 35 0 24 and 0 16 respectively similar reductions in bulb yield have earlier been reported by bekele and tilahun 2007 and zheng et al 2013 as a result of water deficit plants reduce water loss by closing their stomata which mainly cuts co2 supply for photosynthesis sun et al 2013 moreover reduction in nutrients uptake in water stress conditions restricts dry matter production amiri et al 2017 thereby overall reduction in yields the application of pbrs helped to improve the onion bulb yield when averaged for two years the improvement in bulb yield equalled 25 1 19 3 12 9 10 1 and 4 6 respectively with kno3 tu sa ga3 and sb over the control the interactive effects of pbrs and irrigation levels were also significant table 2 supplementary table 1 mainly kno3 and tu were more effective in mitigating the negative impact of water stress at all the deficit levels though the crop responded to application of sa and ga3 in 2016 17 these remained ineffective during 2015 16 these results endorsed the earlier reports on the benefits of pbrs and possible mechanisms illustrated for enhancing tolerance growth and yield components under stress environments e g in wheat under drought stress with tu hassanein et al 2015 and salt stress with kno3 zheng et al 2008 in sunflower amutha et al 2007 under high temperature stress and wheat anosheh et al 2012 under drought with sa in wheat under water stress with sb beltrano et al 1999 and in rice under salinity stress with ga3 misratia et al 2013 the positive responses to pbrs are usually assigned to their ability to fine tune the plant redox homeostasis which regulate root growth for improving plant water nutrient status photosynthetic efficiency and source sink homeostasis to enhance crop yield ratnakumar et al 2016 3 2 water productivity affected by pbrs and water deficits water productivity wp calculated as ratio of onion bulb yield to water consumption that includes applied water and rainfall varied significantly with pbrs practices across the irrigation levels fig 4 wp decreased with increase in water deficits for all pbrs comparatively higher wp values were noticed with pbrs and these averaged 9 61 9 11 8 51 8 33 7 78 and 7 36kgm 3 with kno3 tu ga3 sa sb and control respectively the wp values improved by 8 4 13 4 13 5 20 9 and 21 0 23 5 at low iw cpe 0 84 0 70 medium 0 69 0 40 and severe stress 0 39 0 25 conditions respectively over the control as given above and reported earlier by wakchaure et al 2016a pbrs like kno3 and tu were more effective in maintenance of cooler leaf canopy modulating the stomata opening and water usage which considerably enhanced wp under water stress conditions a decline of wp of onion to almost half 12 6 4kgm 3 has earlier been reported by zheng et al 2013 others bekele and tilahun 2007 reported that up to 23 reduction in water use efficiency for onion grown under different growth stages specific deficit irrigation treatments second degree polynomials were fitted r2 0 93 0 98 to elucidate the role of pbrs at various deficit irrigation levels fig 4 it is evident that improvement in wp with pbrs was relatively more at higher water deficits the maximum wp computed using these curvilinear relations ranged between 9 6 10 2kgm 3 with pbrs at iw cpe 0 70 1 00 against 9 4kgm 3 with no pbr at iw cpe 1 00 considering the wp of 8 7kgm 3 obtained at the recommended irrigation practice for onion i e iw cpe 0 85 equalling the application of 525mm irrigation water the calculations show that the same could be obtained with irrigation water equalling 190 271 390 and 429mm with kno3 tu sa and ga3 respectively thus there exists a considerable possibility of deficit irrigation if combined with pbrs e g water saving of 18 3 25 7 48 4 and 63 8 in irrigation water with ga3 sa tu and kno3 respectively al jamal et al 2000 described the similar curvilinear relationship because of excess water applied in different irrigation levels was utilised to keep the root zone wet for uniform root growth and reduces evapotranspiration for shallow rooted onion crop whereas others zheng et al 2013 reported logarithmic function best defined the relationship between aw and wp for the onion 3 3 bulb quality the marketable quality i e onion bulb size as monitored in terms of bulb weight sphericity φ and geometric mean diameter dgm was affected by both water deficits and pbrs table 3 when averaged for the two years the bulb weight was reduced to one fourth at the highest stress level iw cpe 0 10 while the geometric mean diameter dgm was three fifth pbrs improved the average bulb weight 93 1 104 6g over control 89 8g and also the dgm to 55 3 60 4cm against 53 8cm in control a corresponding response was also monitored in sphericity of bulbs φ such variations in bulb quality were also observed in onion grown with deficit irrigation under arid region of northwest china zheng et al 2013 and lower rio grande valley of texas enciso et al 2009 the physicochemical and functional quality characteristics of onion bulbs as affected by deficit irrigation levels and the application of pbrs are presented in fig 5 rehydration ratio rr was improved substantially by water deficits e g the average rr was 6 6 6 8 6 9 7 2 and 7 3 7 9 at low medium and severe stress levels as compared to 6 1 at full irrigation this was obviously due to increased dry matter with occurrence of earlier bulb maturity in stressed conditions zheng et al 2013 comparatively lesser damage in spore structure during rehydration mitra et al 2011 and exertion of lower pressure on cell wall and higher epidermal elasticity with decreased internal turgor due to water stress could be the another possible reasons guichard et al 1999 pbrs helped to improve the rr 5 9 8 5 over control 5 8 7 2 the maximum improvement in rr 9 4 15 3 occurred with kno3 and this was followed by tu 6 5 13 3 pbrs stimulated cell growth and facilitated plant regeneration thereby enhancing the yield and better fruit quality seems the major reason for the same mohamed et al 2012 total soluble sugar content tss increased initially iw cpe 1 00 from 38 5 to 42 5 44 8mgg 1 with low water stress iw cpe 0 70 and thereafter reduced to 30 2 37 7mgg 1 at severe stress conditions the characteristic initial upward and constant trend of tss is usually attributed to the influence of stressor on carbohydrates synthesis mechanism in the leaves and subsequent translocation to the bulbs during senescence hamilton et al 1998 higher rate of conversion of starch to sugars under moderate stress could also contribute to the fluctuations in tss content this phenomenon was also confirmed by marouelli et al 2004 where occurrence of moderate water stress during growth period remarkably enhanced the tss content of tomato however the dehydration of leaves under severe stress conditions markedly influences the overall bulb sugar accumulation due to dehydration mediated photosynthesis arrest a general downfall in the tss content was noted under the influence of all pbrs across the irrigation levels however the foliar application of pbrs enhanced the tss values those ranged from 37 7 45 3 35 9 43 5 32 8 42 5 35 4 41 9 and 32 1 40 4mgg 1 with kno3 tu sa ga and sb respectively as compared to 30 2 39 6mgg 1 under control these results indicating towards the protective mechanism of pbrs in the regulation of phloem translocation of sucrose for photosynthate in plants thereby inducing drought tolerance are similar to those reported by bhunia et al 2015 the total protein content of onion improved with pbrs at different water deficits e g it ranged between 2 34 2 93 2 35 3 62 and 2 82 3 86 at low medium and severe stress levels with pbrs whereas respective values were 2 22 2 25 2 26 2 59 and 2 60 2 91 under control amongst the pbrs the improvement in protein content equalled 25 9 21 6 15 3 14 9 and 6 9 with kno3 tu sa ga3 and sb respectively over control onset of water deficit has restrictive effect on root development as well as intake of k from the soil which finally results in down regulated tolerance of the plant the role of k in protein synthesis and enzymes activation photosynthesis stress tolerance etc have been well demonstrated previously marschner 2012 thus our results strongly support the replenishment of k from exogenously applied kno3 under higher levels of water deficit which could have contributed the role in overall maintenance of high protein content and superior physiological status of the crop these results also endorse the earlier findings that protein content increased under water stress with application of pbrs in other crops as well farooq and bano 2006 anosheh et al 2012 onion is rich in polyphenol compounds which encompass antioxidant potential cheng et al 2013 water deficits resulted in enhancement of the total phenolics contents tp of bulb tissue tp increased from 6 9 to 15 4mg gae 100g 1 with increase in level of water deficits while it ranged between 6 2 8 1mg gae 100g 1 with full irrigation iw cpe 1 0 in other words smaller size onion bulb obtained at higher water deficits contained higher tp compared to larger onion bulb without stress thus it seems that water deficits imposed oxidative stress where the phenolics fraction could contribute the non enzymatic management of superoxide radicals gill and tuteja 2010 tp was also reported to increase under severe and moderate water stress in cumin by rebey et al 2012 pbrs further helped to increase tp contents especially under higher water deficits kno3 tu and ga3 performed better than others the pbrs especially kno3 induced enhancement in phenolic compounds in plants improved the overall resistivity of the plant towards an array of biotic and abiotic factors prasad et al 2010 these observations have implication that the demand of greater bulb size imposes limits on tp and water deficits therefore the supplementation of pbrs can be an important strategy to achieve tp levels without loss of yields with water deficits an array of sulphur containing volatile compounds vocs generated upon mechanical injury contribute to the pungency of onion these compounds are principally generated following the action of enzyme alliinase on s alk en yl l cysteine sulphoxides which also generates proportionate quantities of pyruvic acid along with vocs schwimmer and weston 1961 wall and corigan 1992 pyruvic acid content therefore serve as an index of onion pungency in this study we observed significant variations in the pyruvate content of the bulb tissue across the water regimes and pbrs treatments fig 6 pungency values increased with the stress intensity and also with pbrs the maximum pungency 102 105mmg 1 was recorded under severe water stress conditions with kno3 and this was followed by tu it seems that kno3 has nitrate n and tu has sulfhydryl group and their attribution to biosynthesis of amino acids as cysteines known to protect to metabolites of the oxidation jocelyn 1972 yoshiyama et al 1996 mohamed et al 2012 the pungency also being one of the major economic and quality determinant in onion these results highlight that pbrs can ensure the quality of onion under water scarce environments 4 conclusions water saving with deficit irrigation for vegetable crops has become a major concern to sustain their yields while maintaining the quality to produce the pbrs were quite effective in improving bulb yield 10 1 25 and water productivity 7 78 9 61kgm 3 of onion especially the kno3 and tu were identified to have role for mitigating water stress and help to boost the production vis a vis productivity of onion under water deficit conditions the overall results suggest that foliar application of pbrs with low to moderate stress iw cpe 0 84 0 55 should be preferred to sustain both the productivity and quality of onion bulb otherwise the latter is also a major issue under water deficits acknowledgement the research work was supported by the research grants ixx11584 from the indian council of agricultural research new delhi india appendix a supplementary
