8250,study region eight river catchments within central asia study focus the limited amount of water resources is already an issue in the central asian region and climate change may be crucial for water availability and development of countries in the region this study investigates potential climate change impacts on water resources in central asia to the end of the century by focusing on eight river catchments with diverse natural conditions located in different countries the eco hydrological model swim was setup calibrated and validated for all selected catchments under study scenarios from five bias corrected gcms under representative concentration pathways 4 5 and 8 5 were used to drive the hydrological model new hydrological insights for the region the results show an increase of mean annual temperature in all catchments for both rcps to the end of the century the projected changes in annual precipitation indicate a clear trend to increase in the zhabay and to decrease in the murghab catchments and for other catchments they were smaller the projected trends for river discharge are similar to those of precipitation with an increase in the north and decrease in the south of the study region seasonal changes are characterized by a shift in the peak of river discharge up to one month shortage of snow accumulation period and reduction of discharge in summer months keywords central asia climate change hydrological modelling amu darya syr darya swim 1 introduction the water resources in the central asian region kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan tajikistan and turkmenistan are mainly provided by transboundary rivers and they play a key role in the economy of countries manning et al 2018 in the mountains for kyrgyzstan and tajikistan water is the main source of electricity production 76 of the total by existing operating and planned hydropower plants central asia kyrgyzstan the world factbook 2019 the world bank group 2018 downstream in uzbekistan and partly in turkmenistan where agriculture plays an essential role in the economy of the countries water is demanded for crops irrigation russell 2018 the share of annual freshwater withdrawals for agriculture exceeds 90 in most central asian countries except kazakhstan the world bank group 2019a the limited amount of transboundary water resources is already an issue for cooperation between the countries in the region and information about the future changes of water availability is vitally important for sustainable development of the central asian countries the unequal distribution of water resources in the region and in particular the low availability of internal renewable water resources in the downstream countries like turkmenistan 257 m3 per capita and uzbekistan 531 m3 per capita the world bank group 2019b together with inefficient water use can be a source of potential conflicts in central asian region weinthal 2006 the natural conditions of the region are characterized by an uneven distribution of the river network which is determined by orographic features and dominant atmospheric circulation patterns shults 1965 the major part of central asia has a continental type of climate with strong intraannual variability kottek et al 2006 manning et al 2018 this type of regional climate a result of its deep inland location and the lowland area in the north determines hot summers and cold winters in the major part of central asia the lowland area is characterized by a low density of river network low amount of precipitation and often appears as a water dissemination zone of the river catchment through evaporation infiltration and intensive water use for agriculture in opposite to the lowlands the mountainous areas due to high elevation and higher amount of precipitation have a highly dense river network and act as an accumulation zone of water resources for the whole central asian region shults 1965 the abovementioned features indicate a prominent role of precipitation and temperature and explain the important role of the mountainous areas being a major source of water for river basins of central asia therefore future climate changes will affect all countries in the region which are highly dependent on water resources the problem of climate change impact is crucial for the future development of the central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan tajikistan and turkmenistan up to now there has been a limited amount of studies that looked into ongoing and future changes of climate in central asia and their impacts on water resources hijioka et al 2014 saibnazarova 2015 agaltseva et al 2011 savitskiy et al 2008 which significantly limits understanding of future changes for specific regions most of the studies confirm a general temperature increase in the central asian region during the 20th century with an acceleration since the 1970s the mean annual temperature raised from 0 18 to 0 42 c per decade during the last 60 years and at the same time no clear trends were found for annual precipitation hijioka et al 2014 the future changes of mean annual temperature over central asia are projected to be higher compared to the global mean with an increase by more than 5 c to the end of the century and up to 6 5 c in summer months under rcp 8 5 reyer et al 2015 white et al 2014 the projected changes in precipitation have no clear trend several studies for the amu darya basin suggest an uncertain or small increasing tendency for example in the study of hagg et al 2013 for the upper amu darya basin show a small increase from 3 to 4 by 2050 also the results of gan et al 2015 for the naryn catchment a tributary of the syr darya the annual precipitation is projected to change from 7 4 to 2 3 under different climate projections by the end of the century as a result of the expected temperature increase and glaciers reduction a slight decrease in mean annual river discharge is projected for the central asian region gan et al 2015 hagg et al 2013 reyer et al 2015 white et al 2014 seasonal changes of river discharge are characterized by a shift of timing of peak runoff to an earlier period as was shown for the naryn catchment gan et al 2015 for the upper amu darya basin hagg et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2012 and for the chu catchment changkun et al 2015 in general there are not many studies dedicated to climate change impact assessment on water resources in the region the majority of them are for only one river catchment so that it is not possible to see a pattern for the whole region the aim of the current study is the assessment of the climate change impacts on water availability in the selected river basins in central asia by employing the eco hydrological model swim set up calibrated and validated for each of the considered river basins driven by bias corrected gcms global climate models under two rcps representative concentration pathway scenarios until the end of the century the selected catchments across central asia were chosen to cover the whole region representing different climate conditions and different countries in order to get more robust trends of future changes it was decided to use an ensemble of five bias corrected gcm scenarios under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2 study area for assessment of climate change impacts on water resources eight pilot hydrological river basins situated within six central asian countries were selected fig 1 the river basins are located in different natural zones have different sizes and different flow regimes nival nivo glacial or glacio nival the zhabay and bukhtarma river catchments which belong to the ertis river basin are located in the northern part of the region within kazakhstan both catchments have low mean annual temperatures 2 9 c in the zhabay catchment and 3 2 c in the bukhtarma catchment the next five catchments are all located in the central part of the region three of them belong to the amu darya basin kafirnigan tupalangdarya tupalang and zeravshan one to syr darya isfara and one to the chu river basin aspara all catchments originate in the high mountains except zhabay and are fed mainly by snow and glaciers melt carec 2014a b the most southern pilot catchment is murghab which originates in the highlands of afghanistan and flows into the karakum desert this catchment has the driest and the hottest climate conditions among our river catchments under study the main characteristics of the catchments are presented in table 1 the range of climate conditions in the case study area is reflected by the difference in mean annual temperatures which is 16 c between the bukhtarma 3 2 c and murghab 12 8 c catchments the seasonal distribution of precipitation also has some regional aspects depending on the catchment in the zhabay and bukhtarma river catchment the highest precipitation occurs in summer july in the murghab in february march and in the rest of the catchments during the spring months elevation and geographical aspect have a significant influence on the hydrological cycle and conditions of the river catchments for example kafirnigan river originates on the hissor range where borders with zeravshan but the kafirnigan catchment has a southerly aspect causing higher temperature and precipitation the kafirnigan has a nivo glacial flow regime the zeravshan catchment has a northerly aspect and comparably less precipitation lower mean temperature and glacio nival regime of the river flow on the other hand within the zhabay catchment which is located in the north of the region the range between minimum and maximum altitudes within the catchment does not exceed 500 m nevertheless all catchments have strong river discharge seasonality with high flows in spring or summer depending on the main river flow regime shults 1965 according to the natural and socio economic conditions water use in the region is in high demand after the soviet union collapsed the designed water infrastructure system that focused on serving the cotton production and was an economic basis of the region became ineffective due to new economic priorities of newly independent countries new water management national plans of central asian countries conflict with each other russell 2018 weinthal 2006 due to low amount of precipitation in the major parts of central asia the world bank group 2016 water is used mainly for irrigation in the agriculture sector and upstream situated tajikistan and kyrgyzstan aim to develop their hydroelectrical potential through the construction of new dams russell 2018 3 methodology 3 1 swim model description the soil and water integrated model swim is a continuous time semi distributed process based eco hydrological model the model is based on previously developed models swat and matsalu and integrates hydrological processes vegetation growth sediment transport and nutrient cycling n and p swim uses a three level spatial disaggregation scheme basin sub basins hydrotopes or hydrologic response units hrus the model operates on a daily time step and is driven by precipitation temperature average maximum and minimum air humidity wind speed and solar radiation also swim requires a land use map a digital elevation model a soil map vegetation and soil parameters as input more detailed information on that can be found in krysanova et al 2000 the model was successfully applied in numerous catchments at different scales and with different natural conditions within europe asia america and africa didovets et al 2019 koch et al 2013 liersch et al 2018 lobanova et al 2018 3 2 model setup calibration and validation to set up the swim model a digital elevation model dem soil map with parameterization land use map and climate data are needed as input due to the lack of local data covering the pilot regions it was necessary to retrieve them from the global databases a dem is available over the entire globe from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar database this dataset is available on the cgiar website cgiar csi 2017 it was initially produced by nasa and has a resolution of 90 90 m at the equator the globeland30 dataset contains land cover information over the entire globe with the 30 m resolution data also covering the pilot areas of this study the dataset was carried out by the ministry of science and technology of china and the mapping product was derived from remote sensing images in 2010 the dataset has ten land cover types cultivated land forest grassland shrubland wetland water bodies tundra artificial surfaces bare land and permanent snow and ice chen et al 2014 national geomatics center of china 2014 soil information with a resolution of 1000 1000 m from the harmonized world soil database fao70 fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 panagos et al 2012 created by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations is available over the entire globe this database does not include all soil parameters needed for swim but the missing parameters were estimated using the method of pedotransfer functions the regional or local soil maps and parameterizations were not available for this study swim uses daily precipitation average minimum and maximum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity as meteorological input data frequently the density of meteorological stations appears to be unsatisfactory for hydrological modelling or data series have serious gaps in records or some needed parameters do not exist at all therefore it was decided to use the watch era 40 1901 2001 re analysis dataset weedon et al 2010 or wfdei 1979 2013 weedon et al 2014 as climate input depending on the river catchment the dataset is based on era 40 re analysis uppala et al 2005 and covers all needed climate fields at a spatial resolution of 0 5 degree the river discharge data for five river catchments zhabay bukhtarma zeravshan kafirnigan and murghab which are needed for the model calibration and validation were received from the national hydrometeorological agencies in kazakhstan tajikistan uzbekistan and turkmenistan in addition some missing observational data isfara and tupalang on discharge were retrieved from grdc global runoff data center grdc 56068 koblenz 2017 monthly time series were available for isfara zeravshan tupalang and murghab and daily for zhabay bukhtarma and kafirnigan for the aspara river catchment no observed discharge was available due to the lack of information about water management and operation of reservoirs it was not possible to include water management in the model simulations therefore it was decided to focus on water accumulation zones in the upper parts of the catchments that are not regulated or only moderately regulated and have close to pristine conditions the climate simulations for the historical period were not compared to observations due to lack of observed data for the mountainous areas nevertheless as already have been mentioned gcms were bias corrected to reanalysis data in advance in order to decrease the deviations also the study by lobanova et al 2017 included such a comparison for a part of our study area which showed low deviations of the isimip simulations for the historical period in the isfara and aspara catchments 3 3 climate scenarios for this study all five cmip5 gcm simulations adapted for the project isimip isimip the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project 2019 were chosen gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem noresm1 m the projections were previously bi linearly interpolated to a 0 5 degree resolution and bias adjusted to the watch era40 data for the period from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 1999 the bias adjustment approach used for the isimip assumes preservation of the long term trend of the simulated climate variables temperature radiation precipitation wind more detailed information about the bias correction method can be found in hempel et al 2013 in this study it was decided to include the moderate and high emission scenarios until the end of the 21st century for this purpose all projections were run under the rcp 4 5 moderate emissions scenario and rcp 8 5 high emissions scenario concentration pathways for the period from 1950 to 2100 3 4 data analysis to analyse the projected changes in climate parameters and river discharge three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 2070 2100 later named as near mid and far future periods were considered and compared with the reference period of 1981 2010 the multi model median was used to calculate 30 years average values of climate and river discharge variables for each period changes in temperature were considered in absolute values c and precipitation changes were estimated and presented as relative values the river discharge was simulated with the swim model calibrated and validated for each basin in advance and driven by five gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios until the end of the century for the analysis of future changes the simulations were divided in 30 year periods and compared to those in the reference period more information and results are presented in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation the results of calibration and validation of the swim model in terms of criteria of fit together with the graphs comparing the observed and simulated river discharges are presented in table 2 fig 2 for seven river catchments under study the swim model was manually calibrated for all river basins under study except for the aspara basin due to missing data due to differences in discharge data availability daily or monthly and no data for the aspara and different time periods of available data the model was calibrated and validated for each river catchment separately the observed time series for the murghab river catchment were limited to 6 years only which were used for the model calibration and validation was omitted the observation data for the bukhtarma kafirnigan and zhabay catchments were available with daily time step appendix 1 and the isfara zeravshan and tupalang catchments with the monthly time step all seven catchment were calibrated and validated with monthly time step for the aspara catchment the calibration parameters of the isfara river were used conditions in both are similar during the calibration the most important parameters for all study regions were related to snow and routing processes also for the mountainous catchments with glaciers a simple glacier module was used which helped to improve the performance of the model there the glacier module uses a degree day method to simulate glacier melt and glacier water accumulation on a daily basis the annual mass balance is calculated at the hydrotope level huang et al 2013 the ranges of the major model parameters used for the swim model calibration across study catchment are presented in appendix 2 the swim model considers input climate parameters as being constant at the sub basin scale in order to downscale the large scale climate input in the high mountainous areas additional adjustment of temperature and precipitation with altitude was applied during the calibration process at the hydrotope level this approach integrated into the model assumes linear dependencies on elevation to estimate the model performance the nse pbias and r2 criteria were calculated for the calibration and validation periods the obtained calibration results for the majority of catchments correspond from satisfactory to very good according to moriasi et al 2015 the lowest nse value was obtained for the murghab river catchment it can be explained by extensive water management activities upstream the gauging station which were not represented in the model due to missing data and lack of other local input data 4 2 analysis of changes in precipitation and temperature according to climate scenarios from the five isimip models the annual mean temperature t increases in all catchments under both rcp scenarios from 1 2 c in the near future up to 6 4 c in the far future with higher changes under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 the highest t rise is projected for the zhabay catchment with up to 3 9 c under rcp 4 5 and up to 6 4 c under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century for other catchments the projected changes are within the range of 3 c 3 3 c under rcp 4 5 and 5 3 c 5 9 c under rcp 8 5 in the far future period appendix 3 and table 3 the projected changes in annual precipitation are qualitative different between the eight regions as in temperature with some increase in the northern and decrease in the southern and central catchments the zhabay catchment has a distinct trend towards a moderate increase in all periods and rcps up to 11 5 by the end of the century similar tendency but with lower magnitude changes is projected for the bukhtarma and aspara catchments under rcp 4 5 a clear negative trend in annual precipitation is projected for the most southern catchment murghab under both rcps up to 15 1 under rcp 8 5 in the far future only minor changes are projected for the rest of the catchments in the central part of the study region the projected changes in the long term monthly mean precipitation for the catchments are shown in fig 3 as a general pattern precipitation increases in most cases in winter and decreases in summer and this trend is more pronounced under rcp8 5 higher warming the projected results for the zhabay and bukhtarma catchment show an increase of precipitation in the majority of periods and months under both rcps except some late summer and early fall months the greatest changes are expected in winter and spring months by the end of the century and can reach up to 37 the mean monthly changes for the period from november to april show an increase by 18 under rcp 4 5 and 25 under rcp 8 5 the rest of the catchments located in the central and southern parts except murghab have some tendency to an increase in precipitation in february march and a decrease in summer months except august under rcp 4 5 under rcp 8 5 the projected precipitation decrease is higher and also extends to autumn months similar to the annual mean changes the highest negative monthly changes during the year are projected for the murghab catchment under both rcps in general the highest decreases are expected for catchments in the central part in july and september in the mid future and in june july in the far future under rcp 8 5 as well as for the murghab in summer months all periods both rcps 4 3 projected impacts on river discharge changes in the mean annual discharge for three future periods in the eight river catchments under study are presented in table 4 the biggest positive changes in all periods are projected for the zhabay river catchment north with more than 30 increase by the end of the century under both rcps changes in river discharge for the bukhtarma catchment are positive but negligibly small 5 the highest negative changes in the mean annual discharge are projected for the murghab catchment south for both rcps in all periods reaching 40 under rcp 8 5 in the far future according to the projections river discharge will also decrease in the isfara catchment in all three periods in both rcps especially under rcp 8 5 where the decrease is higher than 30 in the far future period the simulated strong negative changes in discharge in these cases can be explained mainly by an increase of mean annual temperature table 3 which is projected to rise by more than 5 c under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century changes in the other catchments are negligible 5 or small negative from 5 to 11 under both rcps the simulated long term mean monthly discharge in the reference period and in three future periods is presented in figs 4 and 5 for eight basins under two rcps only the medians from the multi model runs swim driven by five gcms are shown here the projections of the long term monthly mean river discharge show a strong increase in the zhabay catchment north in the mid and far future periods under both rcps except may when a decrease by 12 is projected under rcp 4 5 in the near future the river discharge will slightly decrease in the majority of months under rcp 4 5 a decreasing trend can be anticipated in the murghab catchment south the long term mean monthly river discharge is decreasing in all periods under both rcps during the whole year the highest decrease is projected for the far future period under rcp 8 5 when river discharge decreases by more than 40 in all months for the bukhtarma catchment north a small increase from november to march is projected a strong increase in april and a decrease from may to september in all three periods under both rcps in the aspara isfara and zeravshan catchments with the exception of small to moderate increase in the spring months related to peak shifts river discharge is projected to decrease in the rest of the season in all three periods under both rcps the highest decrease is in summer months and can reach up to 60 figs 4 and 5 results for the tupalang and kafirnigan show a similar tendency with an increase of discharge in spring months and decrease in summer and early fall months however the increase in discharge in winter months in the tupalang catchment is relatively higher under rcp 4 5 compared to rcp 8 5 a clear tendency of shifting peaks in river discharge to an earlier period up to one month as a result of temperature increase and more intensive snowmelt processes has been found for six catchments under study except zhabay and murghab the shifts are larger under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 figs 4 5 and appendix 4 also there is a clear pattern of decrease in river discharge from june to september for all catchments in all future periods under both rcps except zhabay spreads in the model outputs in future periods for the majority of catchments are on the same level as in the reference period under both rcps figs 6 and 7 however for the zeravshan kafirnigan and tupalang the uncertainty is increasing to the end of the century the murghab catchment is characterized by a strong interannual variability of annual discharge driven by different scenarios in all periods and under both rcps we also analyzed changes in snow cover in the catchments under climate warming as an example fig 8 shows the mean monthly snow cover in the kafirnigan catchment in winter months for the reference 1981 2010 and far future period 2071 2100 under rcp 8 5 in all three months the snow cover is projected to decline in fig 8 also the mean annual snowmelt from 1950 to 2100 is displayed showing a reduction to the end of the century this can be explained by the projected temperature rise in the cold season and a reduction of snow accumulation processes 5 discussion and comparison of the obtained results with other studies our results based on gcms show an increase of annual mean temperature in all catchments under study until the end of the century temperature increase under rcp 8 5 in some basins can be higher than 6 c our findings are also confirmed by other studies gan et al 2015 ozturk et al 2017 the temperature increase leads to a reduction of snow accumulation during the cold season and higher evapotranspiration during summer in some regions that kind of changes can be beneficial for agriculture production due to prolongation of vegetation period lobanova et al 2021 on the other hand an increase of potential evapotranspiration as a result of temperature rise with the same level of actual evapotranspiration which is limited by water availability could lead to an increase of water demand in the region shortage of snow accumulation period during the year and reduction of water volume accumulated as snow means less water available during vegetation period and irrigation in general clear trend in temperature increase in the region with the snow and glacier fed rivers plays a big role for potential changes of river runoff in the majority of the catchments under study notable seasonal changes in river discharge were found a shift of the peak discharge up to one month earlier was projected which was also confirmed by other studies gan et al 2015 hagg et al 2013 reyer et al 2015 in general regarding projected changes the case study basins can be divided into three groups north south and central in the north in kazakhstan there is a clear trend to increase in temperature and precipitation as well as river discharge during the year this group is represented by the zhabay and partly the bukhtarma catchments in the central part all mountainous catchments have clear seasonal changes in river discharge and shift of the peak discharge to an earlier period as mentioned above in the south in the arid zone within afghanistan and turkmenistan there are opposite decreasing trends in precipitation and river discharge in all months in all three future time periods and under both climate projections as demonstrated for the murghab river catchment case study the projected results on climate change impacts are associated with uncertainties due to uncertainty of climate projections the uncertainty of input data based on observations and also due to water management in the region of central asia which may alter river discharge and influence the simulated results the highest uncertainty in impact assessment usually results from climate models vetter et al 2017 and improvements in this direction together with adjustments to specific regional conditions can help to reduce the uncertainty in future the central asian countries are characterized by a low density of the climate station network increasing the number of long term meteorological measurements in the region can be helpful to increase the significance of future studies the river discharge for model calibration was used mainly with the monthly time step and the daily data were available only for a few catchments like bukhtarma kafirnigan and zhabay the central asian river catchments are mainly driven by snow and glaciers melt and it is vitally important to consider these processes in the modelling more thoroughly the swim model integrates a snow module and two glacier modules which allows to improve the modelling of these processes assuming that observational data is available the simple glacier module was used in this study instead of the more complex approach mainly due to the lack of observations the region is characterized by intensive water management with a dense irrigation network but because of limited information about water abstraction and reservoir operation it was not possible to include water management in the modelling therefore only the upper parts of the river catchments including water accumulation areas where river runoff is practically not regulated were considered in this study in order to improve the model results and reduce the related uncertainty the following can be recommended for future studies a to use better climate projections designed for the central asian region b to use long time series of climate and hydrological observations together with detailed information on the management practices c to implement more precisely the glacier melt process by using observational data and a more complex glacier module d to integrate water management in the modelling where necessary besides agriculture hydropower electricity production is a potentially important sector for the economic development of central asian countries especially tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in this respect the assessment of climate change impacts on electricity production for the existing and planned hydropower plants is essential for those countries another focus can be put on the extreme events especially on spring floods which are quite important for example for the zhabay kazakhstan and kafirnigan tajikistan catchments as well as for tajikistan in general 6 conclusions one of the main issues for societies and economies in central asia is water availability climate change impact anticipates potential threats and benefits for the socio economic and environmental sectors changes in climate conditions already have an impact on agriculture with a decrease in productivity for water related sectors perelet 2007 possible future changes in climate may have serious impacts on natural conditions water resources and economic development of the central asian countries therefore a complex assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation measures is essential for the region this study aims to assess potential climate change impacts on water resources in central asia by focusing on eight river catchments with diverse natural conditions and located in different countries the climate projections show an increase of mean annual temperature in all catchments under both rcp scenarios until the end of the century temperature is projected to rise from 3 3 c to 3 9 c under rcp 4 5 and from 5 3 c to 6 4 c under rcp 8 5 at the end of the century the highest changes are expected in the zhabay catchment up to 6 4 c under rcp 8 5 the annual precipitation shows clear trends in two catchments increase up to 11 5 in the north zhabay and decrease up to 15 1 in the south murghab for all periods under both rcps in the other six catchments smaller changes were found considering seasonal changes in precipitation trends are similar to that of annual precipitation an increase of precipitation in the zhabay catchment and a decrease in the murghab catchment almost throughout the year the six centrally located catchments have a clear pattern characterized mainly by an increase of precipitation in winter and early spring and a decrease in summer under both rcps the projected changes under rcp 8 5 are more pronounced and show a reduction of mean monthly precipitation up to 78 from may to october except august in all three future periods considered the projected changes in mean annual river discharge for the zhabay and murghab catchments are following the precipitation trends in the zhabay catchment river discharge is expected to increase up to 32 in all periods under both rcps in the murghab and isfara catchments river discharge is projected to decrease up to 40 and 30 respectively in all periods under both rcps for the mountainous catchments the results show a shift in the peak discharge up to one month earlier and mainly decrease in summer and autumn months a shortage of the snow accumulation period and a reduction of the mean annual snowmelt rate were projected especially at the low altitudes the signals of changes found in this study confirm that changes in the hydrological regime are expected in the majority of central asian catchments to the end of the century this is a clear sign of the importance of climate impact assessment for the development of adaptation strategies and cooperation of the central asian countries in

in turkmenistan where agriculture plays an essential role in the economy of the countries water is demanded for crops irrigation russell 2018 the share of annual freshwater withdrawals for agriculture exceeds 90 in most central asian countries except kazakhstan the world bank group 2019a the limited amount of transboundary water resources is already an issue for cooperation between the countries in the region and information about the future changes of water availability is vitally important for sustainable development of the central asian countries the unequal distribution of water resources in the region and in particular the low availability of internal renewable water resources in the downstream countries like turkmenistan 257 m3 per capita and uzbekistan 531 m3 per capita the world bank group 2019b together with inefficient water use can be a source of potential conflicts in central asian region weinthal 2006 the natural conditions of the region are characterized by an uneven distribution of the river network which is determined by orographic features and dominant atmospheric circulation patterns shults 1965 the major part of central asia has a continental type of climate with strong intraannual variability kottek et al 2006 manning et al 2018 this type of regional climate a result of its deep inland location and the lowland area in the north determines hot summers and cold winters in the major part of central asia the lowland area is characterized by a low density of river network low amount of precipitation and often appears as a water dissemination zone of the river catchment through evaporation infiltration and intensive water use for agriculture in opposite to the lowlands the mountainous areas due to high elevation and higher amount of precipitation have a highly dense river network and act as an accumulation zone of water resources for the whole central asian region shults 1965 the abovementioned features indicate a prominent role of precipitation and temperature and explain the important role of the mountainous areas being a major source of water for river basins of central asia therefore future climate changes will affect all countries in the region which are highly dependent on water resources the problem of climate change impact is crucial for the future development of the central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan tajikistan and turkmenistan up to now there has been a limited amount of studies that looked into ongoing and future changes of climate in central asia and their impacts on water resources hijioka et al 2014 saibnazarova 2015 agaltseva et al 2011 savitskiy et al 2008 which significantly limits understanding of future changes for specific regions most of the studies confirm a general temperature increase in the central asian region during the 20th century with an acceleration since the 1970s the mean annual temperature raised from 0 18 to 0 42 c per decade during the last 60 years and at the same time no clear trends were found for annual precipitation hijioka et al 2014 the future changes of mean annual temperature over central asia are projected to be higher compared to the global mean with an increase by more than 5 c to the end of the century and up to 6 5 c in summer months under rcp 8 5 reyer et al 2015 white et al 2014 the projected changes in precipitation have no clear trend several studies for the amu darya basin suggest an uncertain or small increasing tendency for example in the study of hagg et al 2013 for the upper amu darya basin show a small increase from 3 to 4 by 2050 also the results of gan et al 2015 for the naryn catchment a tributary of the syr darya the annual precipitation is projected to change from 7 4 to 2 3 under different climate projections by the end of the century as a result of the expected temperature increase and glaciers reduction a slight decrease in mean annual river discharge is projected for the central asian region gan et al 2015 hagg et al 2013 reyer et al 2015 white et al 2014 seasonal changes of river discharge are characterized by a shift of timing of peak runoff to an earlier period as was shown for the naryn catchment gan et al 2015 for the upper amu darya basin hagg et al 2013 immerzeel et al 2012 and for the chu catchment changkun et al 2015 in general there are not many studies dedicated to climate change impact assessment on water resources in the region the majority of them are for only one river catchment so that it is not possible to see a pattern for the whole region the aim of the current study is the assessment of the climate change impacts on water availability in the selected river basins in central asia by employing the eco hydrological model swim set up calibrated and validated for each of the considered river basins driven by bias corrected gcms global climate models under two rcps representative concentration pathway scenarios until the end of the century the selected catchments across central asia were chosen to cover the whole region representing different climate conditions and different countries in order to get more robust trends of future changes it was decided to use an ensemble of five bias corrected gcm scenarios under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 2 study area for assessment of climate change impacts on water resources eight pilot hydrological river basins situated within six central asian countries were selected fig 1 the river basins are located in different natural zones have different sizes and different flow regimes nival nivo glacial or glacio nival the zhabay and bukhtarma river catchments which belong to the ertis river basin are located in the northern part of the region within kazakhstan both catchments have low mean annual temperatures 2 9 c in the zhabay catchment and 3 2 c in the bukhtarma catchment the next five catchments are all located in the central part of the region three of them belong to the amu darya basin kafirnigan tupalangdarya tupalang and zeravshan one to syr darya isfara and one to the chu river basin aspara all catchments originate in the high mountains except zhabay and are fed mainly by snow and glaciers melt carec 2014a b the most southern pilot catchment is murghab which originates in the highlands of afghanistan and flows into the karakum desert this catchment has the driest and the hottest climate conditions among our river catchments under study the main characteristics of the catchments are presented in table 1 the range of climate conditions in the case study area is reflected by the difference in mean annual temperatures which is 16 c between the bukhtarma 3 2 c and murghab 12 8 c catchments the seasonal distribution of precipitation also has some regional aspects depending on the catchment in the zhabay and bukhtarma river catchment the highest precipitation occurs in summer july in the murghab in february march and in the rest of the catchments during the spring months elevation and geographical aspect have a significant influence on the hydrological cycle and conditions of the river catchments for example kafirnigan river originates on the hissor range where borders with zeravshan but the kafirnigan catchment has a southerly aspect causing higher temperature and precipitation the kafirnigan has a nivo glacial flow regime the zeravshan catchment has a northerly aspect and comparably less precipitation lower mean temperature and glacio nival regime of the river flow on the other hand within the zhabay catchment which is located in the north of the region the range between minimum and maximum altitudes within the catchment does not exceed 500 m nevertheless all catchments have strong river discharge seasonality with high flows in spring or summer depending on the main river flow regime shults 1965 according to the natural and socio economic conditions water use in the region is in high demand after the soviet union collapsed the designed water infrastructure system that focused on serving the cotton production and was an economic basis of the region became ineffective due to new economic priorities of newly independent countries new water management national plans of central asian countries conflict with each other russell 2018 weinthal 2006 due to low amount of precipitation in the major parts of central asia the world bank group 2016 water is used mainly for irrigation in the agriculture sector and upstream situated tajikistan and kyrgyzstan aim to develop their hydroelectrical potential through the construction of new dams russell 2018 3 methodology 3 1 swim model description the soil and water integrated model swim is a continuous time semi distributed process based eco hydrological model the model is based on previously developed models swat and matsalu and integrates hydrological processes vegetation growth sediment transport and nutrient cycling n and p swim uses a three level spatial disaggregation scheme basin sub basins hydrotopes or hydrologic response units hrus the model operates on a daily time step and is driven by precipitation temperature average maximum and minimum air humidity wind speed and solar radiation also swim requires a land use map a digital elevation model a soil map vegetation and soil parameters as input more detailed information on that can be found in krysanova et al 2000 the model was successfully applied in numerous catchments at different scales and with different natural conditions within europe asia america and africa didovets et al 2019 koch et al 2013 liersch et al 2018 lobanova et al 2018 3 2 model setup calibration and validation to set up the swim model a digital elevation model dem soil map with parameterization land use map and climate data are needed as input due to the lack of local data covering the pilot regions it was necessary to retrieve them from the global databases a dem is available over the entire globe from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar database this dataset is available on the cgiar website cgiar csi 2017 it was initially produced by nasa and has a resolution of 90 90 m at the equator the globeland30 dataset contains land cover information over the entire globe with the 30 m resolution data also covering the pilot areas of this study the dataset was carried out by the ministry of science and technology of china and the mapping product was derived from remote sensing images in 2010 the dataset has ten land cover types cultivated land forest grassland shrubland wetland water bodies tundra artificial surfaces bare land and permanent snow and ice chen et al 2014 national geomatics center of china 2014 soil information with a resolution of 1000 1000 m from the harmonized world soil database fao70 fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 panagos et al 2012 created by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations is available over the entire globe this database does not include all soil parameters needed for swim but the missing parameters were estimated using the method of pedotransfer functions the regional or local soil maps and parameterizations were not available for this study swim uses daily precipitation average minimum and maximum temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity as meteorological input data frequently the density of meteorological stations appears to be unsatisfactory for hydrological modelling or data series have serious gaps in records or some needed parameters do not exist at all therefore it was decided to use the watch era 40 1901 2001 re analysis dataset weedon et al 2010 or wfdei 1979 2013 weedon et al 2014 as climate input depending on the river catchment the dataset is based on era 40 re analysis uppala et al 2005 and covers all needed climate fields at a spatial resolution of 0 5 degree the river discharge data for five river catchments zhabay bukhtarma zeravshan kafirnigan and murghab which are needed for the model calibration and validation were received from the national hydrometeorological agencies in kazakhstan tajikistan uzbekistan and turkmenistan in addition some missing observational data isfara and tupalang on discharge were retrieved from grdc global runoff data center grdc 56068 koblenz 2017 monthly time series were available for isfara zeravshan tupalang and murghab and daily for zhabay bukhtarma and kafirnigan for the aspara river catchment no observed discharge was available due to the lack of information about water management and operation of reservoirs it was not possible to include water management in the model simulations therefore it was decided to focus on water accumulation zones in the upper parts of the catchments that are not regulated or only moderately regulated and have close to pristine conditions the climate simulations for the historical period were not compared to observations due to lack of observed data for the mountainous areas nevertheless as already have been mentioned gcms were bias corrected to reanalysis data in advance in order to decrease the deviations also the study by lobanova et al 2017 included such a comparison for a part of our study area which showed low deviations of the isimip simulations for the historical period in the isfara and aspara catchments 3 3 climate scenarios for this study all five cmip5 gcm simulations adapted for the project isimip isimip the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project 2019 were chosen gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem noresm1 m the projections were previously bi linearly interpolated to a 0 5 degree resolution and bias adjusted to the watch era40 data for the period from 1 january 1960 to 31 december 1999 the bias adjustment approach used for the isimip assumes preservation of the long term trend of the simulated climate variables temperature radiation precipitation wind more detailed information about the bias correction method can be found in hempel et al 2013 in this study it was decided to include the moderate and high emission scenarios until the end of the 21st century for this purpose all projections were run under the rcp 4 5 moderate emissions scenario and rcp 8 5 high emissions scenario concentration pathways for the period from 1950 to 2100 3 4 data analysis to analyse the projected changes in climate parameters and river discharge three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 2070 2100 later named as near mid and far future periods were considered and compared with the reference period of 1981 2010 the multi model median was used to calculate 30 years average values of climate and river discharge variables for each period changes in temperature were considered in absolute values c and precipitation changes were estimated and presented as relative values the river discharge was simulated with the swim model calibrated and validated for each basin in advance and driven by five gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios until the end of the century for the analysis of future changes the simulations were divided in 30 year periods and compared to those in the reference period more information and results are presented in section 4 2 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation the results of calibration and validation of the swim model in terms of criteria of fit together with the graphs comparing the observed and simulated river discharges are presented in table 2 fig 2 for seven river catchments under study the swim model was manually calibrated for all river basins under study except for the aspara basin due to missing data due to differences in discharge data availability daily or monthly and no data for the aspara and different time periods of available data the model was calibrated and validated for each river catchment separately the observed time series for the murghab river catchment were limited to 6 years only which were used for the model calibration and validation was omitted the observation data for the bukhtarma kafirnigan and zhabay catchments were available with daily time step appendix 1 and the isfara zeravshan and tupalang catchments with the monthly time step all seven catchment were calibrated and validated with monthly time step for the aspara catchment the calibration parameters of the isfara river were used conditions in both are similar during the calibration the most important parameters for all study regions were related to snow and routing processes also for the mountainous catchments with glaciers a simple glacier module was used which helped to improve the performance of the model there the glacier module uses a degree day method to simulate glacier melt and glacier water accumulation on a daily basis the annual mass balance is calculated at the hydrotope level huang et al 2013 the ranges of the major model parameters used for the swim model calibration across study catchment are presented in appendix 2 the swim model considers input climate parameters as being constant at the sub basin scale in order to downscale the large scale climate input in the high mountainous areas additional adjustment of temperature and precipitation with altitude was applied during the calibration process at the hydrotope level this approach integrated into the model assumes linear dependencies on elevation to estimate the model performance the nse pbias and r2 criteria were calculated for the calibration and validation periods the obtained calibration results for the majority of catchments correspond from satisfactory to very good according to moriasi et al 2015 the lowest nse value was obtained for the murghab river catchment it can be explained by extensive water management activities upstream the gauging station which were not represented in the model due to missing data and lack of other local input data 4 2 analysis of changes in precipitation and temperature according to climate scenarios from the five isimip models the annual mean temperature t increases in all catchments under both rcp scenarios from 1 2 c in the near future up to 6 4 c in the far future with higher changes under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 the highest t rise is projected for the zhabay catchment with up to 3 9 c under rcp 4 5 and up to 6 4 c under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century for other catchments the projected changes are within the range of 3 c 3 3 c under rcp 4 5 and 5 3 c 5 9 c under rcp 8 5 in the far future period appendix 3 and table 3 the projected changes in annual precipitation are qualitative different between the eight regions as in temperature with some increase in the northern and decrease in the southern and central catchments the zhabay catchment has a distinct trend towards a moderate increase in all periods and rcps up to 11 5 by the end of the century similar tendency but with lower magnitude changes is projected for the bukhtarma and aspara catchments under rcp 4 5 a clear negative trend in annual precipitation is projected for the most southern catchment murghab under both rcps up to 15 1 under rcp 8 5 in the far future only minor changes are projected for the rest of the catchments in the central part of the study region the projected changes in the long term monthly mean precipitation for the catchments are shown in fig 3 as a general pattern precipitation increases in most cases in winter and decreases in summer and this trend is more pronounced under rcp8 5 higher warming the projected results for the zhabay and bukhtarma catchment show an increase of precipitation in the majority of periods and months under both rcps except some late summer and early fall months the greatest changes are expected in winter and spring months by the end of the century and can reach up to 37 the mean monthly changes for the period from november to april show an increase by 18 under rcp 4 5 and 25 under rcp 8 5 the rest of the catchments located in the central and southern parts except murghab have some tendency to an increase in precipitation in february march and a decrease in summer months except august under rcp 4 5 under rcp 8 5 the projected precipitation decrease is higher and also extends to autumn months similar to the annual mean changes the highest negative monthly changes during the year are projected for the murghab catchment under both rcps in general the highest decreases are expected for catchments in the central part in july and september in the mid future and in june july in the far future under rcp 8 5 as well as for the murghab in summer months all periods both rcps 4 3 projected impacts on river discharge changes in the mean annual discharge for three future periods in the eight river catchments under study are presented in table 4 the biggest positive changes in all periods are projected for the zhabay river catchment north with more than 30 increase by the end of the century under both rcps changes in river discharge for the bukhtarma catchment are positive but negligibly small 5 the highest negative changes in the mean annual discharge are projected for the murghab catchment south for both rcps in all periods reaching 40 under rcp 8 5 in the far future according to the projections river discharge will also decrease in the isfara catchment in all three periods in both rcps especially under rcp 8 5 where the decrease is higher than 30 in the far future period the simulated strong negative changes in discharge in these cases can be explained mainly by an increase of mean annual temperature table 3 which is projected to rise by more than 5 c under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century changes in the other catchments are negligible 5 or small negative from 5 to 11 under both rcps the simulated long term mean monthly discharge in the reference period and in three future periods is presented in figs 4 and 5 for eight basins under two rcps only the medians from the multi model runs swim driven by five gcms are shown here the projections of the long term monthly mean river discharge show a strong increase in the zhabay catchment north in the mid and far future periods under both rcps except may when a decrease by 12 is projected under rcp 4 5 in the near future the river discharge will slightly decrease in the majority of months under rcp 4 5 a decreasing trend can be anticipated in the murghab catchment south the long term mean monthly river discharge is decreasing in all periods under both rcps during the whole year the highest decrease is projected for the far future period under rcp 8 5 when river discharge decreases by more than 40 in all months for the bukhtarma catchment north a small increase from november to march is projected a strong increase in april and a decrease from may to september in all three periods under both rcps in the aspara isfara and zeravshan catchments with the exception of small to moderate increase in the spring months related to peak shifts river discharge is projected to decrease in the rest of the season in all three periods under both rcps the highest decrease is in summer months and can reach up to 60 figs 4 and 5 results for the tupalang and kafirnigan show a similar tendency with an increase of discharge in spring months and decrease in summer and early fall months however the increase in discharge in winter months in the tupalang catchment is relatively higher under rcp 4 5 compared to rcp 8 5 a clear tendency of shifting peaks in river discharge to an earlier period up to one month as a result of temperature increase and more intensive snowmelt processes has been found for six catchments under study except zhabay and murghab the shifts are larger under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 4 5 figs 4 5 and appendix 4 also there is a clear pattern of decrease in river discharge from june to september for all catchments in all future periods under both rcps except zhabay spreads in the model outputs in future periods for the majority of catchments are on the same level as in the reference period under both rcps figs 6 and 7 however for the zeravshan kafirnigan and tupalang the uncertainty is increasing to the end of the century the murghab catchment is characterized by a strong interannual variability of annual discharge driven by different scenarios in all periods and under both rcps we also analyzed changes in snow cover in the catchments under climate warming as an example fig 8 shows the mean monthly snow cover in the kafirnigan catchment in winter months for the reference 1981 2010 and far future period 2071 2100 under rcp 8 5 in all three months the snow cover is projected to decline in fig 8 also the mean annual snowmelt from 1950 to 2100 is displayed showing a reduction to the end of the century this can be explained by the projected temperature rise in the cold season and a reduction of snow accumulation processes 5 discussion and comparison of the obtained results with other studies our results based on gcms show an increase of annual mean temperature in all catchments under study until the end of the century temperature increase under rcp 8 5 in some basins can be higher than 6 c our findings are also confirmed by other studies gan et al 2015 ozturk et al 2017 the temperature increase leads to a reduction of snow accumulation during the cold season and higher evapotranspiration during summer in some regions that kind of changes can be beneficial for agriculture production due to prolongation of vegetation period lobanova et al 2021 on the other hand an increase of potential evapotranspiration as a result of temperature rise with the same level of actual evapotranspiration which is limited by water availability could lead to an increase of water demand in the region shortage of snow accumulation period during the year and reduction of water volume accumulated as snow means less water available during vegetation period and irrigation in general clear trend in temperature increase in the region with the snow and glacier fed rivers plays a big role for potential changes of river runoff in the majority of the catchments under study notable seasonal changes in river discharge were found a shift of the peak discharge up to one month earlier was projected which was also confirmed by other studies gan et al 2015 hagg et al 2013 reyer et al 2015 in general regarding projected changes the case study basins can be divided into three groups north south and central in the north in kazakhstan there is a clear trend to increase in temperature and precipitation as well as river discharge during the year this group is represented by the zhabay and partly the bukhtarma catchments in the central part all mountainous catchments have clear seasonal changes in river discharge and shift of the peak discharge to an earlier period as mentioned above in the south in the arid zone within afghanistan and turkmenistan there are opposite decreasing trends in precipitation and river discharge in all months in all three future time periods and under both climate projections as demonstrated for the murghab river catchment case study the projected results on climate change impacts are associated with uncertainties due to uncertainty of climate projections the uncertainty of input data based on observations and also due to water management in the region of central asia which may alter river discharge and influence the simulated results the highest uncertainty in impact assessment usually results from climate models vetter et al 2017 and improvements in this direction together with adjustments to specific regional conditions can help to reduce the uncertainty in future the central asian countries are characterized by a low density of the climate station network increasing the number of long term meteorological measurements in the region can be helpful to increase the significance of future studies the river discharge for model calibration was used mainly with the monthly time step and the daily data were available only for a few catchments like bukhtarma kafirnigan and zhabay the central asian river catchments are mainly driven by snow and glaciers melt and it is vitally important to consider these processes in the modelling more thoroughly the swim model integrates a snow module and two glacier modules which allows to improve the modelling of these processes assuming that observational data is available the simple glacier module was used in this study instead of the more complex approach mainly due to the lack of observations the region is characterized by intensive water management with a dense irrigation network but because of limited information about water abstraction and reservoir operation it was not possible to include water management in the modelling therefore only the upper parts of the river catchments including water accumulation areas where river runoff is practically not regulated were considered in this study in order to improve the model results and reduce the related uncertainty the following can be recommended for future studies a to use better climate projections designed for the central asian region b to use long time series of climate and hydrological observations together with detailed information on the management practices c to implement more precisely the glacier melt process by using observational data and a more complex glacier module d to integrate water management in the modelling where necessary besides agriculture hydropower electricity production is a potentially important sector for the economic development of central asian countries especially tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in this respect the assessment of climate change impacts on electricity production for the existing and planned hydropower plants is essential for those countries another focus can be put on the extreme events especially on spring floods which are quite important for example for the zhabay kazakhstan and kafirnigan tajikistan catchments as well as for tajikistan in general 6 conclusions one of the main issues for societies and economies in central asia is water availability climate change impact anticipates potential threats and benefits for the socio economic and environmental sectors changes in climate conditions already have an impact on agriculture with a decrease in productivity for water related sectors perelet 2007 possible future changes in climate may have serious impacts on natural conditions water resources and economic development of the central asian countries therefore a complex assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation measures is essential for the region this study aims to assess potential climate change impacts on water resources in central asia by focusing on eight river catchments with diverse natural conditions and located in different countries the climate projections show an increase of mean annual temperature in all catchments under both rcp scenarios until the end of the century temperature is projected to rise from 3 3 c to 3 9 c under rcp 4 5 and from 5 3 c to 6 4 c under rcp 8 5 at the end of the century the highest changes are expected in the zhabay catchment up to 6 4 c under rcp 8 5 the annual precipitation shows clear trends in two catchments increase up to 11 5 in the north zhabay and decrease up to 15 1 in the south murghab for all periods under both rcps in the other six catchments smaller changes were found considering seasonal changes in precipitation trends are similar to that of annual precipitation an increase of precipitation in the zhabay catchment and a decrease in the murghab catchment almost throughout the year the six centrally located catchments have a clear pattern characterized mainly by an increase of precipitation in winter and early spring and a decrease in summer under both rcps the projected changes under rcp 8 5 are more pronounced and show a reduction of mean monthly precipitation up to 78 from may to october except august in all three future periods considered the projected changes in mean annual river discharge for the zhabay and murghab catchments are following the precipitation trends in the zhabay catchment river discharge is expected to increase up to 32 in all periods under both rcps in the murghab and isfara catchments river discharge is projected to decrease up to 40 and 30 respectively in all periods under both rcps for the mountainous catchments the results show a shift in the peak discharge up to one month earlier and mainly decrease in summer and autumn months a shortage of the snow accumulation period and a reduction of the mean annual snowmelt rate were projected especially at the low altitudes the signals of changes found in this study confirm that changes in the hydrological regime are expected in the majority of central asian catchments to the end of the century this is a clear sign of the importance of climate impact assessment for the development of adaptation strategies and cooperation of the central asian countries in

8251,study region old las salinas spring in medina del campo duero river basin central spain study focus medina del campo groundwater body mcgwb is a multilayer semiconfined aquifer subject to intensive pumping since the 1970 s where the current existence of spas where there used to be traditional baths could confirm the existence of deep groundwater flow paths the old spring of las salinas osls is a saline anomaly in an aquifer with predominance of caco3h waters whose occurrence has not yet been formally explained long term geological geophysical hydrogeological and hydrochemical records were integrated and complemented with field work to clarify its existence new hydrological insights for the region outcomes led to the conclusion that the hydrochemistry of the olmedo and palacio de las salinas salt baths is associated with the existence of a major threshold in the impervious basement of the aquifer which intercepted deep regional groundwater flow and caused upwelling to the surface under unperturbed conditions these results allow for the development of a conceptual flow model at the regional scale that explains the changes in natural water chemistry that have been identified in recent decades keywords spa deep groundwater flows sustainable groundwater abstraction water security intensive groundwater exploitation assessment medina del campo 1 introduction saline springs are common in geological environments where rocks contribute soluble salts to groundwater however they are especially infrequent in non saline geological environments such as the one presented in this paper in these cases saline groundwater is an exception rather than the norm and is sometimes attributed to long flowpaths and residence times the hydrogeological literature classifies groundwater by its origin and contact time with the aquifer into different types congenital waters trapped at the time of sediment formation fossil waters trapped under ground for thousands of years migrated waters i e congenital waters that are displaced and accumulate in other materials where they can suffer a greater or lesser mixture with other waters and mineral waters with a varied chemical composition characterized by the presence of solutes in notable or large concentrations that normal vadose waters do not have custodio and llamas 1983 1033 the work carried out in the framework of the

declaration bocyl 2006 therefore both spas present in common the hydrochemical facies differences in thermal classification are however striking in addition the waters of the original las salinas spring are extremely saline brine type waters similar to sea water although previous works refer to a hypothetical threshold of the basement to explain the upwelling of osls baeza rodríguez caro et al 2001 corral lledó et al 2010 the literature does not explain the reasons for these high salinity content nor does it relate the occurrences of both spas the aim of this research is to construct a comprehensive and rational conceptual model to explain the occurrence of saline waters in both springs the analysis of the factors that could be involved in the genesis of the upwelling of the osls led us to four areas of work with their specific objectives 1 lithological exploring the presence of geological materials that could provide salts to the groundwaters 2 geophysical define the structure of the basement in the area 3 hydrogeological characterize the hydrodynamic conditions of the groundwater flow with particular emphasis on hydraulic transfers governed by vertical flows and 4 characterize the hydrochemical conditions of groundwater it was not an easy task since the mcgwb was a little known area of the territory having been integrated in the central sector of the so called los arenales aquifer fig 1a whose eastern sector has been densely studied in the previous literature as focus of recent and successful artificial recharge operations current los arenales gwb fig 1c a common feature to detrital aquifers in large sedimentary basins is that the structure of the basement typically presents structural discontinuities structural factors play an important role in rock water interaction and give rise to complex flow patterns between the fractures of the basement and the sedimentary materials these geological contexts typically give rise to geothermal processes in which the mobilization of warmer fluids controls the dissolution of mineral species into groundwater webster and nordstrom 2003 the duero sedimentary basin central spain is not exempt from these giménez forcada et al 2017 and giménez and smedley 2014 reported the existence of metalloids associated with inflows of oxidizing alkaline groundwaters near the duero basin boundaries this was attributed to the existence of major faults in the basement the cenozoic sedimentary area of the duero and tagus rivers is associated with the spanish central system both basins present similar characteristics in the materials and structure of their aquifers formed by permeable materials wrapped in a less permeable matrix they differ in their dimensions given that the tagus basin is longer and deeper than the duero basin investigations to characterize the groundwater flow geochemistry of the tagus basin show the existence of saline waters in specific sectors where there are no lithological sources of salt lópez vera and gómez artola 1984 as el pradillo i and tres cantos the chloride concentration in these analyses extracted from samples taken between 3000 and 3600 m deep ranges between 117 000 and 123 000 mg l the integration of these results has allowed us to establish a hypothetical conceptual flow model that explains the saline anomaly of the osls and the olmedo thermal borehole otb in advance both spas owe their origin to a rise of the paleozoic basement in the medina olmedo area where the southernmost fault is located geophysical work carried out in the field electromagnetic soundings and vertical electrical soundings together with the compilation processing and analysis of previous geophysical data gravimetry have allowed us to define and locate the structural discontinuity however it will be necessary to use tools methods of greater penetration to characterize the geometry of deep formations such as the basal marine cretaceous in the eastern half of the gwb as well as to map the northern fault the implications of the knowledge of the deep aquifer of the mcgwb are of interest in the fields of geothermal energy health associated tourism spas and groundwater management the mcgwb is a multilayer semiconfined detrital aquifer igme 1982a b 1983 and whose hydrogeological knowledge is still limited it is known to exceed 2500 m in depth and to be constituted by a superposition of subaquifers whose hydraulic heads vary with depth intensive exploitation of groundwater in this region since the 1970s has caused a progressive decrease in piezometric levels fig 1e this trend is especially evident in the deep boreholes 200 m which have traditionally been more exploited due to the greater piezometric head in the deeper parts of the aquifer giménez forcada et al 2017 214 groundwater flow patterns have been altered as a result which has had impacts both on the local and regional scales this impact has affected the integrity of the groundwater resource both in terms of quantity extracting groundwater from a confined or semiconfined aquifer reduces hydrostatic pressure and induces a change in vertical gradients gejl et al 2019 and quality showing clear symptoms of water insecurity as shown in the following pages this could lead to sustainability issues in the future 2 study region the study area is located in the southern half of the duero basin central spain fig 1 the northern half of the study area corresponds to the south of the province of valladolid and the southern half to the north of the province of ávila la moraña region several tributaries to river duero traverse the mcgwb from south to north these are from east to west the adaja 163 km long the zapardiel 93 km the trabancos 88 km and the guareña streams 61 km the area presents a cold steppe arid climate classified as bsk based on the köppen geiger system this is characterized by warm and dry summers and cold winters rainfall takes place mostly in autumn and early winter as well as during the spring mean annual rainfall between 1981 and 2010 was 351 mm the mean annual temperature was 12 9 c while potential evapotranspiration amounted to 730 mm nafría garcía et al 2013 the medina del campo weather station presents continuous rainfall records for the 1932 2000 period an acceptable correlation exists between these and those of the valladolid weather station which presents the longest rainfall series in the vicinity of the study region 1851 2019 fig 2 2 1 geology the duero catchment is an intraplate basin generated during the alpine orogeny as a result of the convergence of the eurasian iberian and african plates filled by cenozoic sediments that exceed 2500 m in thickness towards the east and which wedge into the west and south of the basin casas sainz and de vicente 2009 santisteban et al 1996 gómez ortiz et al 2005 the western border of the duero basin is tectonically characterized by highs and depressions in favor of ne sw late hercinic faults that were reactivated during the paleogene and miocene de vicente et al 2007 in the southern basin border alpine compression caused the e w thrusting of the central system over the basin fig 1b its substratum is composed by palaeozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks outcropping at the western and southern border areas and mesozoic sedimentary rocks related with the rifting alpine cycles sánchez moya and sopeña 2004 triassic jurasic and cretaceous paleocene rocks outcrop towards the eastern border whereas only outcrops of the latter are found towards the western border in the area of interest fig 3 outcropping cenozoic sediments are composed by alternating cycles of gravels sands and muds of arkosic greywackic or sublithic composition derived from the igneous and metamorphic rocks of the central system pineda et al 2007 the gravel fraction is composed mainly of quartz and quartzite clasts while sand and mud fractions are dominated by quartz potassic feldspar and lithic fragments of igneous and metamorphic origin accompanied by clays smectite illite carbonate minerals calcite and or dolomite can be present as cement or forming crusts these sediments were deposited during cenozoic in low sinuosity alluvial fan systems la seca borehole fig 1c drilled in the northern part of the study area martínez abad and querol muller 1990 provides information about the stratigraphic series from bottom to top the borehole reached paleozoic metamorphic rocks at a depth of 1188 m fig 3 there is no record of triassic or jurassic rocks whose nearest evidences are located 100 km eastwards and northwards and which are composed by a thin triassic siliciclastic series muñoz et al 1995 the paleozoic metamorphic substratum is covered by 35 m of upper cretaceous white yellowish arkosic sands sometimes cemented by silica and kaolinite or iron rich levels these sediments are overlain by 120 m of limestones and dolostones of upper cretaceous age and some marls at the bottom of the series equivalent rocks crop out around 50 km south eastwards in the vicinity of santa maría la real de nieva where the lower part of this series is richer in gravel and the carbonated part is richer in dolostones and show frequent siliciclastic units martínez salanova et al 1991 the uppermost 1033 m of the la seca borehole include siliciclastic cenozoic sediments increasing in sandy beds to the top the base is composed of upper cretaceous to paleocene iron rich and kaolinite rich siliciclastics gravels sands and muds characterized by the presence of silica cements and iron crusts blanco et al 1982 santisteban et al 1996 alonso gavilán et al 2004 and are overlaid by matrix rich arkosic gravels and sands attributed to the paleogene neogene these rocks crop out along the southern border of the basin martínez salanova et al 1991 santisteban et al 1991 1996 martín serrano et al 1996 alonso gavilán et al 2004 muddy beds are thicker and more frequent in la seca borehole than in the outcrops and that can be related to the more distal position of the borehole in relation to the southern border of the basin in any case there are no evaporite layers as those typical of the basin centre interbedded neither in the surface nor subsurface sediments 2 2 hydrogeology from a hydrogeological standpoint the region has been described by igme 1970 pias 1977 igme 1980 1982a b 1983 1991 2008 and further characterized more recently by igme dga 2010a b the study area corresponds to the contact of mcgwb with los arenales groundwater body both are essentially the same aquifer although some differences are observed los arenales is formed by 1 an upper unconfined aquifer 130 m including the first few tens of meters corresponding to the quaternary 2 an intermediate and discontinuous silt clay level around 130 200 m and 3 a deep semi confined aquifer closely linked to the basement which is affected by local and regional faults and by a weathering layer in the upper zones where comes in contact with tertiary sediments 200 m meanwhile the medina del campo aquifer presents a wedging of the intermediate facies to the west that disappear in the half east of the mcgwb in such a way that the upper unconfined aquifer rest directly on the deep semi confined aquifer de la hera portillo et al 2020a the multilayer detrital aquifer behaves as a three dimensional semiconfined system igme dga 2010a b and is made up of permeable lenses of conglomerates and sands embedded in a semi permeable sandy silt matrix igme 2008 permeable materials present limited spatial continuity and are randomly distributed in the vertical dimension showing a high anisotropy the impervious basement is made up of the same igneous and metamorphic materials that conform the gredos range the principal recharge to the aquifer is by meteoric infiltration while additional inflow is received across surface and subsurface runoff under natural conditions the main discharge is the river duero situated towards the north of the study zone and this explains why the main direction of flow is from south to north this general scheme is affected by the basement morphology which is compartmentalized into horst and grabens and by significant abstractions of water in this area the bicarbonate ion predominates although sulphated and even chlorinated facies occur among the cations calcium is usually dominant although in some central and even northern areas relevant concentrations of alkalines appear chd 2015 81 this has been recently justified by giménez forcada et al 2017 as the effect of cold hydrothermal inflows associated with the water rock interactions in the fissured aquifer media igneous and metasedimentary bedrock and in the sedimentary environment of the duero basin groundwater flows from the main recharge areas located towards the south to the areas in an around the duero river fig 1b which behaves as the main discharge axis throughout the entire basin lópez geta and ramírez ortega 2015 surface water courses act as outflow mechanisms for sub superficial groundwater as well as for surface runoff murillo 2013 the majority of them have been mostly inactive for years with the exception of the arevalillo and adaja streams the latter is regulated by the cogotas reservoir previous works establish a difference between deep groundwater flow beneath a depth of 130 m and intermediate flow above 200 m tragsatec 1996 jcl 2002 giménez forcada et al 2017 to avoid confusion we will refer to deep groundwater flow as the flow travelling by the bottom of the aquifer isotopic dating in los arenales aquifer reveals that the age of deep groundwater is of more than 1000 years plata bedmar et al 1996 from the late 1960s this area experienced a considerable growth of groundwater based agriculture and most groundwater extractions took place in the la moraña area igme 1991 jcl 2002 groundwater extraction for the 2011 2018 period was estimated at 272 mm3 yr chd 2017 2018 2019 2020 in contrast the aquifer s natural replenishment rate has been quantified at 149 mm3 yr igme dga 2010a however current and historical extraction records are generally poor this is a key aspect to plan groundwater exploitation in the short middle and long term six decades of groundwater pumping caused the water table to drop by an average of 28 m between 1972 and 2020 mayor et al 2020 fig 1d e the entire groundwater body is affected by overexploitation except for a narrow band of municipalities located towards the border the greater decreases are observed between the years 1970 and 2000 since 2001 a change in the slope has been observed in the deepening of the levels without ceasing to descend in a generic way throughout the groundwater body but entering a stabilization phase mirame chd 2020 the available groundwater resources is 149 million m3 year mirame chd 2020 there is not available aquifer budget to contrast and compare the functioning of the system before and after intensive exploitation an approach is provided in table 1 for the current state 2 3 spas the existence of two spas points to the presence of saline anomalies in the study area geological data suggests that there could be a basement threshold that causes deep upwelling this is consistent with the morphology of certain surface streams these are typically straight except that there is a marked change of direction towards medina del campo simplón and aguililla streams which could be associated with the tectonic structure of the basement pias 1977 evidence of old salt production facilities in the area more specifically where las salinas spa currently is reinforces the hypothesis of deep groundwater discharge in the area historical data of the osls collected before the inauguration of the spa reveals that waters were extremely saline 1 g l data from 1892 points at a salinity in excess of 72 g l ministerio de fomento 1892 this is probably attributable to a combination of factors take for instance hydrodynamic conditions long flow paths and residence times which cause groundwater to become saturated first in hco3 then in so4 and finally in cl furthermore evaporation can increase saline concentration substantially as spring waters reach the ground smedley and kinniburgh 2002 las salinas spa was inaugurated in 1891 bobo díez 1912 igme 1913 1947 sánchez ferre 1992 its name stems from the presence of saline deposits in ephemeral wetlands the spa originally had four wells within a radius of 150 m as well as 53 ponds for the elaboration of saline waters ministerio de fomento 1892 ministerio de la gobernación 1893 341 this process consisted in increasing the concentration of nacl by exposing the water to evaporation the main well was located 45 m away from the spa igme 2010 the well s original flow rate was 6000 l h and it yielded sulphurous sodium chlorinated water i br variety with an average temperature of 13

nahco3 waters linked to the deep confined aquifer in the south part of the duero basin giménez forcada and smedley 2014 giménez forcada et al 2017 nevertheless our hypothesis is that in las salinas location there were cold hydrothermal nacl waters at the priminegio spring and currently they have been replacement to nahco3 surface waters as consequence of the intensive exploitation the olmedo spa is more recent it was built in 2005 on the ruins of a 12th century monastery its waters were declared mineral medicinal in 2006 boe 2006 their composition is cl na f with strong mineralization dry

near the premises the absence of saline lithology in the superficial part of the sedimentary log suggests that water salinity is associated with deep groundwater flow and long residence times 3 materials and methods 3 1 time frame the ensuing analyses focuses on three historical benchmarks 1 before intensive aquifer use begun early 1970s 2 the moment of maximum perturbation due to overdraft 2001 and 3 the current situation 2019 20 note that the choice of benchmark number 2 is debatable as the highest yearly pumping on record is 2005 chd personal communication the year 2001 was picked instead because this is the year with the largest number hydrochemical analyses in the database of the geological survey of spain piezometric data stems from two major sources namely the geological survey of spain 1970 2001 with 954 wells and the duero basin authority 2006 2018 with 58 boreholes water quality analyses were obtained from the database of the geological survey of spain for the 1970 2001 period updated data for spa samples were collected during field campaigns in 2019 and 2020 3 2 lithological study the lithological study consisted of the analysis of borehole logs of groundwater wells and oil boreholes as well as geological maps magna geode this information was integrated into a gis database with arcgis v10 6 1 3 3 geophysical study a 3d model was built with geomodeller

term piezometric records 1971 2001 and 58 piezometric records from the 2006 2018 period the older piezometric records served the purpose of a identifying former flowing wells and when these stopped being so and b analyzing pairs of wells with different depths located to less than 5 km in order to make an estimation of the variation of the vertical hydraulic gradient and its evolution over time the same was applied to eight piezometric nests 16 piezometers of the newer group the others were discarded due to the well screens being located at different depths 3 5 water quality data hydrochemical data includes analyses carried out for 115 wells between 1970 and 2001 obtained from the igme database these were all collected and analyzed by the geological survey of spain and present an ionic balance discrepancy of less than 5 a further analyses for the wells use currently for the palacio de las salinas and olmedo spas was carried out between 2019 and 2020 water samples were

for the las salinas spa waters years 1893 1989 1997 and 2005 and for the olmedo spa waters 2007 2009 2016 2019 three additional minero medicinal springs existed in the study area aside from the palacio de las salinas and olmedo springs chucho 1 and chucho 2 were both located approximately 3 km to the sw of the las salinas springs and presented ca hco3 waters in turn chucho 3 presented nacl facies igme 2001 233 all three of them were located in the el campillo municipality and are poorly documented 4 results and discussion 4 1 lithological records three sectors have been differentiated fig 4 a the southern sector is characterized by the outcrop of the paleozoic basement it constitutes the contact zone of the central system with the cenozoic basin of the duero if present cretaceous materials underlying the paleogene must be of reduced thickness paleogene materials present a lower thickness than miocene materials unlike in the central sector where the latter are the dominant formation the basal cretaceous it likely to exceed these in thickness but data is insufficient to determine its depth in the future it will be necessary to address the characterization of this basal cretaceous aquifer the sedimentary fill reaches powers greater than 2100 m not including the cretaceous consisting mainly of miocene and paleogene formations the northern sector is characterized by a larger basal cretaceous than in the previous sectors the thickness of the paleogene and miocene formations averages 1000 m 4 2 3d geological model the depth contour map of the paleozoic basement fig 4b shows a structured basin with highs and depressions trending e w to en e wsw the maximum depths of the basement are located se of medina del campo and south of valladolid cities where they reach to a depth of more than 2000 m near the medina del campo area there is an e w basement high distribution at about 1000 m depth in the sw sector the miocene and paleogene sediments located between the alba villoria fault and the diego álvaro thrust reach a thickness of about 1000 m east of zamora in the nw sector of the study area the basement top is shallower with only 200 m depth the 3d geological model exhibits differences in thickness of the paleogene sediments and particularly in the miocene ones fig 5 while the thickness of paleogene in the basin is relatively constant at 500 m the thickness of miocene is highly variable reaching 1500 m these variations are interpreted as a consequence of pop up and pop down tectonic structures associated to e w to en e wsw reverse faults on the other hand the ne sw faults such as the alba villoria fault must play an important role in the development of the basin with important vertical displacement 4 3 piezometric logs 4 3 1 flowing wells only 10 out of the 81 points of the older set were originally flowing wells fig 1f ts1 most ceased to flow in between the 1970s and the early 1980s the only exception is well 1516 2 0001 which lasted until 1992 this is the only one well in the set with a hydrochemical analysis for year 2001 ts5 which resulted in cl na waters 4 3 2 long term piezometric records as explained earlier the purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the evolution of the vertical groundwater gradient over time this is done by comparing the long term record of shallow wells with nearby deeper ones in the case of the 1972 2001 period five suitable well pairs were identified fig 6 whereas a further eight piezometric nests fig 1d were used for the 2006 2018 interval figs 7 and 8 the 1972 2001 period shows that the groundwater head oscillates significantly with head and spatial location fig 6 in certain years 1983 85 head in the deeper parts of the aquifer drop until they reach the level in the upper part the eight nests show groundwater head differences for the 2009 2018 interval fig 8 flow direction is from the upper to the lower aquifer in most of the nests with different hydraulic gradient according to location medina del campo boreholes fig 8a separated by 3 5 km present a higher hydraulic head in the deeper aquifer the same behavior is observed in the serrada valdestillas and mojados well pairs fig 8b and c whereas the matapozuelos ventosa de la cuesta fig 8d and aldeaseca de la frontera fig 8e wells show a descending flow from the upper to the lower part of the aquifer in general terms groundwater levels are observed to drop over the three decades the deeper aquifer exhibits greater drawdowns which is coherent with a semiconfined behavior the area to the east of the adaja stream presents the greater head differences with an upward groundwater gradient in the aldeaseca area towards the south deep and shallow groundwater present a similar level all this suggests that the northern part of the system was characterized by upward flow during the 1972 2001 period this is consistent with toth s classic conceptual model for large sedimentary basins toth 1962 1963 1999 according to this the southern area close to the gredos range is the main recharge area while the main axis of the duero valley makes up the deep discharge zone of the system piezometric evolution over the 2006 2018 is assessed by means of piezometric nests which were purposefully built to observe the vertical gradient as they present screens at different depths fig 9 the medina del campo area presents a downward gradient nest a figs 1d and 8 a this is the closest nest to the palacio de las salinas spa and reveals a change in the groundwater head of the deepest part of the aquifer a drop of several meters is observed and is possibly associated with groundwater extractions during the irrigation season april to november this also explains why the area s springs and wetlands are no longer active nest b located on the left bank of the adaja stream presents a downward flow this is consistent with this area being a recharge zone of the aquifer fig 8b the same is observed in nests c e f and h fig 8c e f h in contrast nests d and g present an upward gradient the deep part of the aquifer presents greater hydraulic potential in the western part of the mc figure 9 gwb around the zapardiel and trabancos sub basins which results in upward groundwater flow this however appears to be more related to the spatial configuration of permeability and internal hydraulic transferences than to the impervious basement the fontiveros nest is the one that presents the greater head difference between the deep piezometer and the shallow one 32 m on average this corresponds with an upward flow the opposite case in the carpio nest where there is downward flow and an average head differential of 9 m interestingly the horcajo and carpio nests only 17 km apart present a different hydraulic behavior 4 4 groundwater quality 4 4 1 medina del campo gwb most of the 85 analyses for the 1970 2001 period resulted in na hco3 or ca hco3 waters but with a predominant of the latter this is consistent with the literature igme dga 2010a lópez geta and ramírez ortega 2015 piper diagrams are presented for years 1977 and 2001 figs 9 and 10 na cl waters were however identified in the northern half of the aquifer to the south of medina del campo and olmedo towns also the analyzes of the years 1977 and 2001 reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate waters in the northeast quadrant of the mcgwb fig 9 there were 16 water analytics for 1977 out of which 13 present an acceptable ionic balance discrepancy 10 these are all of the hco3 facies there were also 20 analytics for year 2001 all of which present an acceptable ionic discrepancy wells presenting na cl waters 1617 1 14 in 1977 and 1516 2 0001 and 1616 3 0003 in 2001 have in contrast very different depths 4 5 190 and 95 3 m respectively for the deep confined aquifer the representation of the chemical analysis for the 9 wells with chemical analysis samples from 1982 to 2001 are shown in fig 11 these boreholes range from 505 m depth to 255 m depths ts6 without considering the recent spa analysis samples 1 3 results show that a 50 of the analysis are cahco3 waters a 30 are nahco3 waters and a 20 are clna samples 4 and 5 which are representative of the deep groundwater flow the presence of sodium bicarbonate waters is reported by some authors at the border of contact between the cenozoic basin of the duero and the central system giménez forcada et al 2017 attributed to cold water thermal phenomena cold hydrothermal inflows in the basement water rock interaction however its presence in the northeastern half of the mcgwb had not been reported as such but rather as a zone of complex waters at the adaja duero confluence igme 1980 the sample from the olmedo spa is very similar to sample 5 obtained near the confluence of the trabancos river with the duero which we interpret as having responded 1987 to a deep underground discharge of the more saline flow of the aquifer the fact that wells 4 and 5 present chlorinated sodium waters reveals that the waters that circulate through the paleogene reached heights of 350 m above sea level in the vicinity of the duero channel in 2000 we do not have data that allow us to know whether today day there are springs that reach this salinity in this stretch of the duero basin it would be necessary to carry out a detailed study to discriminate regional discharge in the whole of the flow that the duero receives in the section between valladolid and toro however given the current degree of exploitation of the aquifer the groundwater discharge to the duero likely occurs in the section between the trabancos duero and toro confluence where the aquifer considerably reduces its thickness 4 4 2 spas old hydrochemical analyses for the palacio de las salinas spa refer to wells that have long since disappeared table 3 hydrochemical facies vary significantly from well to well even though these are located in close proximity to each other the oldest analysis dated from ministerio de fomento 1892 reports that anhydrous salts in 1 l water sample contain 0 0496 g of sodium sulfide 0 0045 g of sodium bromide 55 9419 g of sodium chloride 4 9789 g of magnesia chloride 4 9020 g of soda sulfate 2 5980 g of lime sulfate 0 030 g of organic matter which sum a total of 72 6541 g of anhydrous salts a comparison with sea water average salt concentration 38 g l shows that this sample doubles the salt concentration the ensuing analyses date from 1927 1989 1997 and 2005 table 3 well 1 tenacidad rendered cl so4 na waters whereas well 2 anita was cl na ca and well 3 manolito hco3 na mg in the absence of further information variations in hydrochemical composition could mean that each well captured a different aquifer layer the fact that analyses were spaced several years and that they were carried out in different laboratories could also explain discrepancies to some extent the more recent analyses table 4 were from samples taken in the current well for spa uses and an abandoned spring for which there is no reference to relate with the osls so we assume it is a different water point fig 12 show the representation of these analyses in piper diagram including a sample from the sea in contrast olmedo waters present a constant cl na facies since the spa first became operational 2005 table 5 electric conductivity shows a gradual decrease while temperature increases slowly between 2010 and 2018 and sharply between 2018 and 2019 the reduction in saline content could be attributed to the wells tapping a greater share of shallow groundwater hco3 facies in fact while na and k concentration dropped between 2016 and 2019 ca was observed to slowly increase nitrate concentration could be used as a proxy to evaluate the infiltration of shallow groundwater to the deeper parts of the aquifer cgs 2000 however this is considered outside the scope of this paper the current waters of the palacio de las salinas spa should be mixed waters of deep saline waters and local waters of a calcium bicarbonate character or even somewhat deeper with sulphated facies no chemical data are available in the mcgwb at depths greater than 500 m for this reason as an approximation tool we have made a reasonable comparison with a section of the tagus basin lithologically similar to the sedimentary fill present in the central sector of medina del campo 2000 m depth of aquifer using the data from the pradillo 1 survey extracted from lópez vera and gómez artola 1984 we have calculated the concentration of the water mixture that would explain the saline concentration of the upwelling of the oslsosls and the concentrations of the olmedo spa based on the conservative nature of the chloride ion the water obtained at any of these two points will present a c content that will be a mixture of two other c1 and c2 contents c1 c c2 and there will be a fraction x of water 1 and 1 x of water 2 it must be fulfilled that custodio and llamas 1983 i 1036 c c1 x c2 1 x where fig 13 c mixing water las salinas and olmedo c1 saline water pradillo 1 c2 freshwater representative of the aquifer ca0247041 nava del rey sample 2 is considered representative of the non saline waters of this aquifer with calcium bicarbonate facies and electrical conductivity around 300 μs cm the waters of the original spring las salinas are representative of extremely saline waters with electrical conductivities of the order of those of sea water for the pradillo 1 sample the average of the three results obtained by lópez vera and gómez artola 1984 has been calculated for the three samples taken between 3000 and 3300 m depth ep 1 3112 m ep 1 3197 m sample taken at 3251 m the concentrations and calculations are shown in table 6 these are very different waters which implies that if the hypothesis is confirmed the waters of the original las salinas spring are highly evolved waters which respond to a long transit time within the aquifer most of the samples from the two spas present sodium as the dominant cation and chloride as the dominant anion with the exception of the most recent samples taken in las salinas which present either so4 2 or co3h as dominant results indicate that the waters that currently feed the well of the balneario de las salinas receive very little inflow from the deep aquifer 6 3 this contribution is greater in the olmedo spa but represents a scarce 2 of the total volume of water that receives the borehole this all suggests that the hydraulic potential of the deep aquifer has undergone a downward evolution which has resulted in the disappearance of the osls and subsequently in changes in the water quality of the las salinas spa from 1927 to the present day these have evolved from a predominantly sodium chlorinated composition to calcium sodium sulphated and recently to sodium calcium bicarbonate basement uplift in the southern area of medina del campo makes it possible for the olmedo borehole to capture the deepest waters of the known aquifer located between the lower miocene paleogene igme 2001 these waters are very saline reaching electrical conductivities of the order of 8000 μs cm according to a measurement made in situ on 08 26 2020 consistent with previous references lópez geta and ramírez ortega 2015 igme 1980 in fact the chemical composition is very close to that of sea water avrahamov et al 2010 boe 2011 for the osls there are two relevant data associated with this observation i the high salinity of the osls higher than sea water the use of the br cl relation as isochemical tracers could provide some light on this custodio and herrera 2000 and ii the fact that osls was declared as variety iodine brominated waters both facts are a clear indication of the marine origin however the available data does not allow to go ahead to define whether they are fossil migrant or congenital waters it would be needed to make an isotopical study to determine the age of the water pumped in olmedo spa and in the abandoned spring of the palacio de las salinas spa to shed further light on this matter 5 conclusions the original las salinas spring was a regional aquifer discharge point not identified as such in previous works analysis of the hydraulic potential in the pairs of wells and piezometers analyzed within the mcgwb reveals that the multilayer aquifer formations of the study area present a leaky behaviour saline concentrations found in the osls are similar to those of sea water without any lithologies present in the subsoil to justify this saline anomalies in an aquifer which mostly presents mostly calcium bicarbonate waters are possibly due to a structural discontinuity in the palaeozoic basement this threshold modifies groundwater flow patterns by acting as a hydraulic barrier thus groundwater that would be expected to discharge in the duero river upwelled into the former las salinas spring despite the fact that there is no continuous information on the evolution of this spring from the early records to the present day the available data implies that a the original saline spring disappeared decades ago b a variation is observed in the chemical species of the groundwater in the las salinas area from sodium chloride facies to sulphated facies and bicarbonate facies c the temporal evolution of the piezometric level of the aquifers subject to pumping shows that withdrawals affect both the surface and the confined aquifers piezometric evolutions are largely parallel the greater drawdowns being observed in the irrigation season d the relationship of the hydraulic potential between different aquifers levels reveals that vertical flows have changed over time in the area near the osls medina del campo the vertical gradient was ascending and increasing until 2001 from 2006 to the present however it is observed that the flow is descending so there may have been a reversal of flow also striking is the fact that in the municipality of mojados located 25 km east of medina del campo although there is an upward flow the vertical gradient shows a decreasing trend in the 2006 2019 period e the hydrochemical data show an evolution of the groundwater in the las salinas area from sodium chloride waters to sodium calcium sulphated waters to warm sodium bicarbonate waters these facts may be interpreted as a consequence of intensive groundwater pumping which has caused a a drop in the water table in the unconfined perched aquifers b a decrease in the piezometric level in the confined aquifers c an increase in recharge as a result of the increase in vertical hydraulic gradient all this means that the loss of the hydraulic potential of the confined aquifers translates into a lower inflow into the overlying ones these results show mixing processes in a complex groundwater flow system that is not yet completely understood unresolved aspects include the characterization of the deep groundwater aquifer the dimensioning of the regional aquifer

8251,study region old las salinas spring in medina del campo duero river basin central spain study focus medina del campo groundwater body mcgwb is a multilayer semiconfined aquifer subject to intensive pumping since the 1970 s where the current existence of spas where there used to be traditional baths could confirm the existence of deep groundwater flow paths the old spring of las salinas osls is a saline anomaly in an aquifer with predominance of caco3h waters whose occurrence has not yet been formally explained long term geological geophysical hydrogeological and hydrochemical records were integrated and complemented with field work to clarify its existence new hydrological insights for the region outcomes led to the conclusion that the hydrochemistry of the olmedo and palacio de las salinas salt baths is associated with the existence of a major threshold in the impervious basement of the aquifer which intercepted deep regional groundwater flow and caused upwelling to the surface under unperturbed conditions these results allow for the development of a conceptual flow model at the regional scale that explains the changes in natural water chemistry that have been identified in recent decades keywords spa deep groundwater flows sustainable groundwater abstraction water security intensive groundwater exploitation assessment medina del campo 1 introduction saline springs are common in geological environments where rocks contribute soluble salts to groundwater however they are especially infrequent in non saline geological environments such as the one presented in this paper in these cases saline groundwater is an exception rather than the norm and is sometimes attributed to long flowpaths and residence times the hydrogeological literature classifies groundwater by its origin and contact time with the aquifer into different types congenital waters trapped at the time of sediment formation fossil waters trapped under ground for thousands of years migrated waters i e congenital waters that are displaced and accumulate in other materials where they can suffer a greater or lesser mixture with other waters and mineral waters with a varied chemical composition characterized by the presence of solutes in notable or large concentrations that normal vadose waters do not have custodio and llamas 1983 1033 the work carried out in the framework of the european project naiad 2021 on the medina del campo groundwater body mcgwb hereon have led us to an interesting aspect the proximity of two spas separated by a distance of scarcely 25 km both of sodium chloride waters armijo et al 2018 in a region of predominantly though not exclusively calcium bicarbonate waters while previous references refer to a horst and graven basement tragsatec 1996 jcl 2002 the available geological data was too limited to explain the effect of this arrangement on groundwater flow paths our observations have focused on the morphology of the river channels in the medina olmedo axis fig 1 b which seemed to be directly related to tectonic activity igme 1998 the original spring of las salinas osls hereon has been studied and documented since the 17th century it was declared a mineral medicinal water spring in 1892 ministerio de fomento 1892 ministerio de la gobernación 1893 el castellano 1893 with more recent references in castells and ballespí 1913 goebame 1927 siemcalsa 2007 its waters were described then as cold sodium chloride iodine brominated the olmedo spa was inaugurated much more recently in 2005 and its waters present a thermal sodium chloride declaration bocyl 2006 therefore both spas present in common the hydrochemical facies differences in thermal classification are however striking in addition the waters of the original las salinas spring are extremely saline brine type waters similar to sea water although previous works refer to a hypothetical threshold of the basement to explain the upwelling of osls baeza rodríguez caro et al 2001 corral lledó et al 2010 the literature does not explain the reasons for these high salinity content nor does it relate the occurrences of both spas the aim of this research is to construct a comprehensive and rational conceptual model to explain the occurrence of saline waters in both springs the analysis of the factors that could be involved in the genesis of the upwelling of the osls led us to four areas of work with their specific objectives 1 lithological exploring the presence of geological materials that could provide salts to the groundwaters 2 geophysical define the structure of the basement in the area 3 hydrogeological characterize the hydrodynamic conditions of the groundwater flow with particular emphasis on hydraulic transfers governed by vertical flows and 4 characterize the hydrochemical conditions of groundwater it was not an easy task since the mcgwb was a little known area of the territory having been integrated in the central sector of the so called los arenales aquifer fig 1a whose eastern sector has been densely studied in the previous literature as focus of recent and successful artificial recharge operations current los arenales gwb fig 1c a common feature to detrital aquifers in large sedimentary basins is that the structure of the basement typically presents structural discontinuities structural factors play an important role in rock water interaction and give rise to complex flow patterns between the fractures of the basement and the sedimentary materials these geological contexts typically give rise to geothermal processes in which the mobilization of warmer fluids controls the dissolution of mineral species into groundwater webster and nordstrom 2003 the duero sedimentary basin central spain is not exempt from these giménez forcada et al 2017 and giménez and smedley 2014 reported the existence of metalloids associated with inflows of oxidizing alkaline groundwaters near the duero basin boundaries this was attributed to the existence of major faults in the basement the cenozoic sedimentary area of the duero and tagus rivers is associated with the spanish central system both basins present similar characteristics in the materials and structure of their aquifers formed by permeable materials wrapped in a less permeable matrix they differ in their dimensions given that the tagus basin is longer and deeper than the duero basin investigations to characterize the groundwater flow geochemistry of the tagus basin show the existence of saline waters in specific sectors where there are no lithological sources of salt lópez vera and gómez artola 1984 as el pradillo i and tres cantos the chloride concentration in these analyses extracted from samples taken between 3000 and 3600 m deep ranges between 117 000 and 123 000 mg l the integration of these results has allowed us to establish a hypothetical conceptual flow model that explains the saline anomaly of the osls and the olmedo thermal borehole otb in advance both spas owe their origin to a rise of the paleozoic basement in the medina olmedo area where the southernmost fault is located geophysical work carried out in the field electromagnetic soundings and vertical electrical soundings together with the compilation processing and analysis of previous geophysical data gravimetry have allowed us to define and locate the structural discontinuity however it will be necessary to use tools methods of greater penetration to characterize the geometry of deep formations such as the basal marine cretaceous in the eastern half of the gwb as well as to map the northern fault the implications of the knowledge of the deep aquifer of the mcgwb are of interest in the fields of geothermal energy health associated tourism spas and groundwater management the mcgwb is a multilayer semiconfined detrital aquifer igme 1982a b 1983 and whose hydrogeological knowledge is still limited it is known to exceed 2500 m in depth and to be constituted by a superposition of subaquifers whose hydraulic heads vary with depth intensive exploitation of groundwater in this region since the 1970s has caused a progressive decrease in piezometric levels fig 1e this trend is especially evident in the deep boreholes 200 m which have traditionally been more exploited due to the greater piezometric head in the deeper parts of the aquifer giménez forcada et al 2017 214 groundwater flow patterns have been altered as a result which has had impacts both on the local and regional scales this impact has affected the integrity of the groundwater resource both in terms of quantity extracting groundwater from a confined or semiconfined aquifer reduces hydrostatic pressure and induces a change in vertical gradients gejl et al 2019 and quality showing clear symptoms of water insecurity as shown in the following pages this could lead to sustainability issues in the future 2 study region the study area is located in the southern half of the duero basin central spain fig 1 the northern half of the study area corresponds to the south of the province of valladolid and the southern half to the north of the province of ávila la moraña region several tributaries to river duero traverse the mcgwb from south to north these are from east to west the adaja 163 km long the zapardiel 93 km the trabancos 88 km and the guareña streams 61 km the area presents a cold steppe arid climate classified as bsk based on the köppen geiger system this is characterized by warm and dry summers and cold winters rainfall takes place mostly in autumn and early winter as well as during the spring mean annual rainfall between 1981 and 2010 was 351 mm the mean annual temperature was 12 9 c while potential evapotranspiration amounted to 730 mm nafría garcía et al 2013 the medina del campo weather station presents continuous rainfall records for the 1932 2000 period an acceptable correlation exists between these and those of the valladolid weather station which presents the longest rainfall series in the vicinity of the study region 1851 2019 fig 2 2 1 geology the duero catchment is an intraplate basin generated during the alpine orogeny as a result of the convergence of the eurasian iberian and african plates filled by cenozoic sediments that exceed 2500 m in thickness towards the east and which wedge into the west and south of the basin casas sainz and de vicente 2009 santisteban et al 1996 gómez ortiz et al 2005 the western border of the duero basin is tectonically characterized by highs and depressions in favor of ne sw late hercinic faults that were reactivated during the paleogene and miocene de vicente et al 2007 in the southern basin border alpine compression caused the e w thrusting of the central system over the basin fig 1b its substratum is composed by palaeozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks outcropping at the western and southern border areas and mesozoic sedimentary rocks related with the rifting alpine cycles sánchez moya and sopeña 2004 triassic jurasic and cretaceous paleocene rocks outcrop towards the eastern border whereas only outcrops of the latter are found towards the western border in the area of interest fig 3 outcropping cenozoic sediments are composed by alternating cycles of gravels sands and muds of arkosic greywackic or sublithic composition derived from the igneous and metamorphic rocks of the central system pineda et al 2007 the gravel fraction is composed mainly of quartz and quartzite clasts while sand and mud fractions are dominated by quartz potassic feldspar and lithic fragments of igneous and metamorphic origin accompanied by clays smectite illite carbonate minerals calcite and or dolomite can be present as cement or forming crusts these sediments were deposited during cenozoic in low sinuosity alluvial fan systems la seca borehole fig 1c drilled in the northern part of the study area martínez abad and querol muller 1990 provides information about the stratigraphic series from bottom to top the borehole reached paleozoic metamorphic rocks at a depth of 1188 m fig 3 there is no record of triassic or jurassic rocks whose nearest evidences are located 100 km eastwards and northwards and which are composed by a thin triassic siliciclastic series muñoz et al 1995 the paleozoic metamorphic substratum is covered by 35 m of upper cretaceous white yellowish arkosic sands sometimes cemented by silica and kaolinite or iron rich levels these sediments are overlain by 120 m of limestones and dolostones of upper cretaceous age and some marls at the bottom of the series equivalent rocks crop out around 50 km south eastwards in the vicinity of santa maría la real de nieva where the lower part of this series is richer in gravel and the carbonated part is richer in dolostones and show frequent siliciclastic units martínez salanova et al 1991 the uppermost 1033 m of the la seca borehole include siliciclastic cenozoic sediments increasing in sandy beds to the top the base is composed of upper cretaceous to paleocene iron rich and kaolinite rich siliciclastics gravels sands and muds characterized by the presence of silica cements and iron crusts blanco et al 1982 santisteban et al 1996 alonso gavilán et al 2004 and are overlaid by matrix rich arkosic gravels and sands attributed to the paleogene neogene these rocks crop out along the southern border of the basin martínez salanova et al 1991 santisteban et al 1991 1996 martín serrano et al 1996 alonso gavilán et al 2004 muddy beds are thicker and more frequent in la seca borehole than in the outcrops and that can be related to the more distal position of the borehole in relation to the southern border of the basin in any case there are no evaporite layers as those typical of the basin centre interbedded neither in the surface nor subsurface sediments 2 2 hydrogeology from a hydrogeological standpoint the region has been described by igme 1970 pias 1977 igme 1980 1982a b 1983 1991 2008 and further characterized more recently by igme dga 2010a b the study area corresponds to the contact of mcgwb with los arenales groundwater body both are essentially the same aquifer although some differences are observed los arenales is formed by 1 an upper unconfined aquifer 130 m including the first few tens of meters corresponding to the quaternary 2 an intermediate and discontinuous silt clay level around 130 200 m and 3 a deep semi confined aquifer closely linked to the basement which is affected by local and regional faults and by a weathering layer in the upper zones where comes in contact with tertiary sediments 200 m meanwhile the medina del campo aquifer presents a wedging of the intermediate facies to the west that disappear in the half east of the mcgwb in such a way that the upper unconfined aquifer rest directly on the deep semi confined aquifer de la hera portillo et al 2020a the multilayer detrital aquifer behaves as a three dimensional semiconfined system igme dga 2010a b and is made up of permeable lenses of conglomerates and sands embedded in a semi permeable sandy silt matrix igme 2008 permeable materials present limited spatial continuity and are randomly distributed in the vertical dimension showing a high anisotropy the impervious basement is made up of the same igneous and metamorphic materials that conform the gredos range the principal recharge to the aquifer is by meteoric infiltration while additional inflow is received across surface and subsurface runoff under natural conditions the main discharge is the river duero situated towards the north of the study zone and this explains why the main direction of flow is from south to north this general scheme is affected by the basement morphology which is compartmentalized into horst and grabens and by significant abstractions of water in this area the bicarbonate ion predominates although sulphated and even chlorinated facies occur among the cations calcium is usually dominant although in some central and even northern areas relevant concentrations of alkalines appear chd 2015 81 this has been recently justified by giménez forcada et al 2017 as the effect of cold hydrothermal inflows associated with the water rock interactions in the fissured aquifer media igneous and metasedimentary bedrock and in the sedimentary environment of the duero basin groundwater flows from the main recharge areas located towards the south to the areas in an around the duero river fig 1b which behaves as the main discharge axis throughout the entire basin lópez geta and ramírez ortega 2015 surface water courses act as outflow mechanisms for sub superficial groundwater as well as for surface runoff murillo 2013 the majority of them have been mostly inactive for years with the exception of the arevalillo and adaja streams the latter is regulated by the cogotas reservoir previous works establish a difference between deep groundwater flow beneath a depth of 130 m and intermediate flow above 200 m tragsatec 1996 jcl 2002 giménez forcada et al 2017 to avoid confusion we will refer to deep groundwater flow as the flow travelling by the bottom of the aquifer isotopic dating in los arenales aquifer reveals that the age of deep groundwater is of more than 1000 years plata bedmar et al 1996 from the late 1960s this area experienced a considerable growth of groundwater based agriculture and most groundwater extractions took place in the la moraña area igme 1991 jcl 2002 groundwater extraction for the 2011 2018 period was estimated at 272 mm3 yr chd 2017 2018 2019 2020 in contrast the aquifer s natural replenishment rate has been quantified at 149 mm3 yr igme dga 2010a however current and historical extraction records are generally poor this is a key aspect to plan groundwater exploitation in the short middle and long term six decades of groundwater pumping caused the water table to drop by an average of 28 m between 1972 and 2020 mayor et al 2020 fig 1d e the entire groundwater body is affected by overexploitation except for a narrow band of municipalities located towards the border the greater decreases are observed between the years 1970 and 2000 since 2001 a change in the slope has been observed in the deepening of the levels without ceasing to descend in a generic way throughout the groundwater body but entering a stabilization phase mirame chd 2020 the available groundwater resources is 149 million m3 year mirame chd 2020 there is not available aquifer budget to contrast and compare the functioning of the system before and after intensive exploitation an approach is provided in table 1 for the current state 2 3 spas the existence of two spas points to the presence of saline anomalies in the study area geological data suggests that there could be a basement threshold that causes deep upwelling this is consistent with the morphology of certain surface streams these are typically straight except that there is a marked change of direction towards medina del campo simplón and aguililla streams which could be associated with the tectonic structure of the basement pias 1977 evidence of old salt production facilities in the area more specifically where las salinas spa currently is reinforces the hypothesis of deep groundwater discharge in the area historical data of the osls collected before the inauguration of the spa reveals that waters were extremely saline 1 g l data from 1892 points at a salinity in excess of 72 g l ministerio de fomento 1892 this is probably attributable to a combination of factors take for instance hydrodynamic conditions long flow paths and residence times which cause groundwater to become saturated first in hco3 then in so4 and finally in cl furthermore evaporation can increase saline concentration substantially as spring waters reach the ground smedley and kinniburgh 2002 las salinas spa was inaugurated in 1891 bobo díez 1912 igme 1913 1947 sánchez ferre 1992 its name stems from the presence of saline deposits in ephemeral wetlands the spa originally had four wells within a radius of 150 m as well as 53 ponds for the elaboration of saline waters ministerio de fomento 1892 ministerio de la gobernación 1893 341 this process consisted in increasing the concentration of nacl by exposing the water to evaporation the main well was located 45 m away from the spa igme 2010 the well s original flow rate was 6000 l h and it yielded sulphurous sodium chlorinated water i br variety with an average temperature of 13

nahco3 waters linked to the deep confined aquifer in the south part of the duero basin giménez forcada and smedley 2014 giménez forcada et al 2017 nevertheless our hypothesis is that in las salinas location there were cold hydrothermal nacl waters at the priminegio spring and currently they have been replacement to nahco3 surface waters as consequence of the intensive exploitation the olmedo spa

near the premises the absence of saline lithology in the superficial part of the sedimentary log suggests that water salinity is associated with deep groundwater flow and long residence times 3 materials and methods 3 1 time frame the ensuing analyses focuses on three historical benchmarks 1 before intensive aquifer use begun early 1970s 2 the moment of maximum perturbation due to overdraft 2001 and 3 the current situation 2019 20 note that the choice of benchmark number 2 is debatable as the highest yearly pumping on record is 2005 chd personal communication the year 2001 was picked

survey of spain 1970 2001 with 954 wells and the duero basin authority 2006 2018 with 58 boreholes water quality analyses were obtained from the database of the geological survey of spain for the 1970

a depth of more than 2000 m near the medina del campo area there is an e w basement high distribution at about 1000 m depth in the sw sector the miocene and paleogene sediments located between the alba villoria fault and the diego álvaro thrust reach a thickness of about 1000 m east of zamora in the nw sector of the study area the basement top is shallower with only 200 m depth the 3d geological model exhibits differences in thickness of the paleogene sediments and particularly in the miocene ones fig 5 while the thickness of paleogene in the basin is relatively constant at 500 m the thickness of miocene is highly variable reaching 1500 m these variations are interpreted as a consequence of pop up and pop down tectonic structures associated to e w to en e wsw reverse faults on the other hand the ne sw faults such as the alba villoria fault must play an important role in the development of the basin with important vertical displacement 4 3 piezometric logs 4 3 1 flowing wells only 10 out of the 81 points of the older set were originally flowing wells fig 1f ts1 most ceased to flow in between the 1970s and the early 1980s the only exception is well 1516 2 0001 which lasted until 1992 this is the only one well in the set with a hydrochemical analysis for year 2001 ts5 which resulted in cl na waters 4 3 2 long term piezometric records as explained earlier the purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the evolution of the vertical groundwater gradient over time this is done by comparing the long term record of shallow wells with nearby deeper ones in the case of the 1972 2001 period five suitable well pairs were identified fig 6 whereas a further eight piezometric nests fig 1d were used for the 2006 2018 interval figs 7 and 8 the 1972 2001 period shows that the groundwater head oscillates significantly with head and spatial location fig 6 in certain years 1983 85 head in the deeper parts of the aquifer drop until they reach the level in the upper part the eight nests show groundwater head differences for the 2009 2018 interval fig 8 flow direction is from the upper to the lower aquifer in most of the nests with different hydraulic gradient according to location medina del campo boreholes fig 8a separated by 3 5 km present a higher hydraulic head in the deeper aquifer the same behavior is observed in the serrada valdestillas and mojados well pairs fig 8b and c whereas the matapozuelos ventosa de la cuesta fig 8d and aldeaseca de la frontera fig 8e wells show a descending flow from the upper to the lower part of the aquifer in general terms groundwater levels are observed to drop over the three decades the deeper aquifer exhibits greater drawdowns which is coherent with a semiconfined behavior the area to the east of the adaja stream presents the greater head differences with an upward groundwater gradient in the aldeaseca area towards the south deep and shallow groundwater present a similar level all this suggests that the northern part of the system was characterized by upward flow during the 1972 2001 period this is consistent with toth s classic conceptual model for large sedimentary basins toth 1962 1963 1999 according to this the southern area close to the gredos range is the main recharge area while the main axis of the duero valley makes up the deep discharge zone of the system piezometric evolution over the 2006 2018 is assessed by means of piezometric nests which were purposefully built to observe the vertical gradient as they present screens at different depths fig 9 the medina del campo area presents a downward gradient nest a figs 1d and 8 a this is the closest nest to the palacio de las salinas spa and reveals a change in the groundwater head of the deepest part of the aquifer a drop of several meters is observed and is possibly associated with groundwater extractions during the irrigation season april to november this also explains why the area s springs and wetlands are no longer active nest b located on the left bank of the adaja stream presents a downward flow this is consistent with this area being a recharge zone of the aquifer fig 8b the same is observed in nests c e f and h fig 8c e f h in contrast nests d and g present an upward gradient the deep part of the aquifer presents greater hydraulic potential in the western part of the mc figure 9 gwb around the zapardiel and trabancos sub basins which results in upward groundwater flow this however appears to be more related to the spatial configuration of permeability and internal hydraulic transferences than to the impervious basement the fontiveros nest is the one that presents the greater head difference between the deep piezometer and the shallow one 32 m on average this corresponds with an upward flow the opposite case in the carpio nest where there is downward flow and an average head differential of 9 m interestingly the horcajo and carpio nests only 17 km apart present a different hydraulic behavior 4 4 groundwater quality 4 4 1 medina del campo gwb most of the 85 analyses for the 1970 2001 period resulted in na hco3 or ca hco3 waters but with a predominant of the latter this is consistent with the literature igme dga 2010a lópez geta and ramírez ortega 2015 piper diagrams are presented for years 1977 and 2001 figs 9 and 10 na cl waters were however identified in the northern half of the aquifer to the south of medina del campo and olmedo towns also the analyzes of the years 1977 and 2001 reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate waters in the northeast quadrant of the mcgwb fig 9 there were 16 water analytics for 1977 out of which 13 present an acceptable ionic balance discrepancy 10 these are all of the hco3 facies there were also 20 analytics for year 2001 all of which present an acceptable ionic discrepancy wells presenting na cl waters 1617 1 14 in 1977 and 1516 2 0001 and 1616 3 0003 in 2001 have in contrast very different depths 4 5 190 and 95 3 m respectively for the deep confined aquifer the representation of the chemical analysis for the 9 wells with chemical analysis samples from 1982 to 2001 are shown in fig 11 these boreholes range from 505 m depth to 255 m depths ts6 without considering the recent spa analysis samples 1 3 results show that a 50 of the analysis are cahco3 waters a 30 are nahco3 waters and a 20 are clna samples 4 and 5 which are representative of the deep groundwater flow the presence of sodium bicarbonate waters is reported by some authors at the border of contact between the cenozoic basin of the duero and the central system giménez forcada et al 2017 attributed to cold water thermal phenomena cold hydrothermal inflows in the basement water rock interaction however its presence in the northeastern half of the mcgwb had not been reported as such but rather as a zone of complex waters at the adaja duero confluence igme 1980 the sample from the olmedo spa is very similar to sample 5 obtained near the confluence of the trabancos river with the duero which we interpret as having responded 1987 to a deep underground discharge of the more saline flow of the aquifer the fact that wells 4 and 5 present chlorinated sodium waters reveals that the waters that circulate through the paleogene reached heights of 350 m above sea level in the vicinity of the duero channel in 2000 we do not have data that allow us to know whether today day there are springs that reach this salinity in this stretch of the duero basin it would be necessary to carry out a detailed study to discriminate regional discharge in the whole of the flow that the duero receives in the section between valladolid and toro however given the current degree of exploitation of the aquifer the groundwater discharge to the duero likely occurs in the section between the trabancos duero and toro confluence where the aquifer considerably reduces its thickness 4 4 2 spas old hydrochemical analyses for the palacio de las salinas spa refer to wells that have long since disappeared table 3 hydrochemical facies vary significantly from well to well even though these are located in close proximity to each other the oldest analysis dated from ministerio de fomento 1892 reports that anhydrous salts in 1 l water sample contain 0 0496 g of sodium sulfide 0 0045 g of sodium bromide 55 9419 g of sodium chloride 4 9789 g of magnesia chloride 4 9020 g of soda sulfate 2 5980 g of lime sulfate 0 030 g of organic matter which sum a total of 72 6541 g of anhydrous salts a comparison with sea water average salt concentration 38 g l shows that this sample doubles the salt concentration the ensuing analyses date from 1927 1989 1997 and 2005 table 3 well 1 tenacidad rendered cl so4 na waters whereas well 2 anita was cl na ca and well 3 manolito hco3 na mg in the absence of further information variations in hydrochemical composition could mean that each well captured a different aquifer layer the fact that analyses were spaced several years and that they were carried out in different laboratories could also explain discrepancies to some extent the more recent analyses table 4 were from samples taken in the current well for spa uses and an abandoned spring for which there is no reference to relate with the osls so we assume it is a different water point fig 12 show the representation of these analyses in piper diagram including a sample from the sea in contrast olmedo waters present a constant cl na facies since the spa first became operational 2005 table 5 electric conductivity shows a gradual decrease while temperature increases slowly between 2010 and 2018 and sharply between 2018 and 2019 the reduction in saline content could be attributed to the wells tapping a greater share of shallow groundwater hco3 facies in fact while na and k concentration dropped between 2016 and 2019 ca was observed to slowly increase nitrate concentration could be used as a proxy to evaluate the infiltration of shallow groundwater to the deeper parts of the aquifer cgs 2000 however this is considered outside the scope of this paper the current waters of the palacio de las salinas spa should be mixed waters of deep saline waters and local waters of a calcium bicarbonate character or even somewhat deeper with sulphated facies no chemical data are available in the mcgwb at depths greater than 500 m for this reason as an approximation tool we have made a reasonable comparison with a section of the tagus basin lithologically similar to the sedimentary fill present in the central sector of medina del campo 2000 m depth of aquifer using the data from the pradillo 1 survey extracted from lópez vera and gómez artola 1984 we have calculated the concentration of the water mixture that would explain the saline concentration of the upwelling of the oslsosls and the concentrations of the olmedo spa based on the conservative nature of the chloride ion the water obtained at any of these two points will present a c content that will be a mixture of two other c1 and c2 contents c1 c c2 and there will be a fraction x of water 1 and 1 x of water 2 it must be fulfilled that custodio and llamas 1983 i 1036 c c1 x c2 1 x where fig 13 c mixing water las salinas and olmedo c1 saline water pradillo 1 c2 freshwater representative of the aquifer ca0247041 nava del rey sample 2 is considered representative of the non saline waters of this aquifer with calcium bicarbonate facies and electrical conductivity around 300 μs cm the waters of the original spring las salinas are representative of extremely saline waters with electrical conductivities of the order of those of sea water for the pradillo 1 sample the average of the three results obtained by lópez vera and gómez artola 1984 has been calculated for the three samples taken between 3000 and 3300 m depth ep 1 3112 m ep 1 3197 m sample taken at 3251 m the concentrations and calculations are shown in table 6 these are very different waters which implies that if the hypothesis is confirmed the waters of the original las salinas spring are highly evolved waters which respond to a long transit time within the aquifer most of the samples from the two spas present sodium as the dominant cation and chloride as the dominant anion with the exception of the most recent samples taken in las salinas which present either so4 2 or co3h as dominant results indicate that the waters that currently feed the well of the balneario de las salinas receive very little inflow from the deep aquifer 6 3 this contribution is greater in the olmedo spa but represents a scarce 2 of the total volume of water that receives the borehole this all suggests that the hydraulic potential of the deep aquifer has undergone a downward evolution which has resulted in the disappearance of the osls and subsequently in changes in the water quality of the las salinas spa from 1927 to the present day these have evolved from a predominantly sodium chlorinated composition to calcium sodium sulphated and recently to sodium calcium bicarbonate basement uplift in the southern area of medina del campo makes it possible for the olmedo borehole to capture the deepest waters of the known aquifer located between the lower miocene paleogene igme 2001 these waters are very saline reaching electrical conductivities of the order of 8000 μs cm according to a measurement made in situ on 08 26 2020 consistent with previous references lópez geta and ramírez ortega 2015 igme 1980 in fact the chemical composition is very close to that of sea water avrahamov et al 2010 boe 2011 for the osls there are two relevant data associated with this observation i the high salinity of the osls higher than sea water the use of the br cl relation as isochemical tracers could provide some light on this custodio and herrera 2000 and ii the fact that osls was declared as variety iodine brominated waters both facts are a clear indication of the marine origin however the available data does not allow to go ahead to define whether they are fossil migrant or congenital waters it would be needed to make an isotopical study to determine the age of the water pumped in olmedo spa and in the abandoned spring of the palacio de las salinas spa to shed further light on this matter 5 conclusions the original las salinas spring was a regional aquifer discharge point not identified as such in previous works analysis of the hydraulic potential in the pairs of wells and piezometers analyzed within the mcgwb reveals that the multilayer aquifer formations of the study area present a leaky behaviour saline concentrations found in the osls are similar to those of sea water without any lithologies present in the subsoil to justify this saline anomalies in an aquifer which mostly presents mostly calcium bicarbonate waters are possibly due to a structural discontinuity in the palaeozoic basement this threshold modifies groundwater flow patterns by acting as a hydraulic barrier thus groundwater that would be expected to discharge in the duero river upwelled into the former las salinas spring despite the fact that there is no continuous information on the evolution of this spring from the early records to the present day the available data implies that a the original saline spring disappeared decades ago b a variation is observed in the chemical species of the groundwater in the las salinas area from sodium chloride facies to sulphated facies and bicarbonate facies c the temporal evolution of the piezometric level of the aquifers subject to pumping shows that withdrawals affect both the surface and the confined aquifers piezometric evolutions are largely parallel the greater drawdowns being observed in the irrigation season d the relationship of the hydraulic potential between different aquifers levels reveals that vertical flows have changed over time in the area near the osls medina del campo the vertical gradient was ascending and increasing until 2001 from 2006 to the present however it is observed that the flow is descending so there may have been a reversal of flow also striking is the fact that in the municipality of mojados located 25 km east of medina del campo although there is an upward flow the vertical gradient shows a decreasing trend in the 2006 2019 period e the hydrochemical data show an evolution of the groundwater in the las salinas area from sodium chloride waters to sodium calcium sulphated waters to warm sodium bicarbonate waters these facts may be interpreted as a consequence of intensive groundwater pumping which has caused a a drop in the water table in the unconfined perched aquifers b a decrease in the piezometric level in the confined aquifers c an increase in recharge as a result of the increase in vertical hydraulic gradient all this means that the loss of the hydraulic potential of the confined aquifers translates into a lower inflow into the overlying ones these results show mixing processes in a

delta 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial resource for natural drinking water agriculture industry and various human development activities especially in arid and semi arid areas groundwater resources rely primarily on the recharge process tilahun and merkel 2009 which is composed mainly of infiltrating rain and residual percolated water from irrigation de vries and simmers 2002 barron et al 2012 consequently recharge rates to the aquifer are an inevitable requirement to set a reliable strategy for sustainable use of the groundwater and control the adverse environmental impacts that emerge from excessive pumping sharma 1986 different parameters such as land use climate geological structures soil type surface cover vegetation topography land slope and surface water canals affect the groundwater recharge rates kalaidzidou paikou et al 1997 tang and mays 1998 barron et al 2012 liu et al 2013 albuquerque et al 2013 goodarzi et al 2016 the weighting values for each parameter are set according to their possible relationships and to their degree of impact on the recharge process assessing the recharge rates to aquifers is a major challenge korkmaz 1988 and they are commonly calculated with approximate procedures scanlon et al 2006 ghouili et al 2017 techniques used to estimate groundwater recharge in arid and semiarid regions are based on several approaches such as isotopic geochemical water balance temperature profiles physical measurements and electromagnetic ping et al 2014 gidafie et al 2016 different surplus methods are also available which are based on water table fluctuation darcy s law base flow tracer techniques mathematical models and other combinations of these methods butterworth et al 1999 healy and cook 2002 ebrahimi et al 2016 the selection of the correct method for determining recharge rates is still a difficult step many factors may contribute to the selection of the most reliable method such as time and space scales and the validity

franssen et al 2009 karlsen et al 2012 ebrahimi et al 2016 on the other hand many studies in hydrological analysis have used artificial neural networks ann as a prediction tool for example french et

groundwater aquifers has been proposed by borah and bhattacharjya 2016 using the ann a modular three dimensional multispecies transport model mt3dms and the genetic algorithm in the second section of the present paper the study area is explored sources of available data are presented and a brief description of the problem is illustrated in subsection 2 3 the simulation model and the minimization problem used to calibrate the recharge rates are illustrated then the cfnn with four training methods are introduced in subsection 2 4 different results are presented in section 3 as follows 1 sensitivity analysis of the control variables within the pso and calibrated recharge rates at 2005 2 accuracy comparison between the four methods used to train the cfnn sensitivity analysis to the number of neurons adopted by the cfnn and statistical performance for different transfer functions and 3 validating the hydraulic heads at 2015 finally the conclusions are presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and available data the qaend at egypt occupies an area of about 12 284 km2 as shown in fig 1 the groundwater layer of the study area belongs mainly to the quaternary pleistocene deposits the thickness of this aquifer varies from 100 m at the south to 900 m near the north at the mediterranean sea the qaend structure consists of several discontinuous horizontal layers see fig 2 the aquifer layers are composed of six types of soil namely clay fine sand sandy clay coarse sand sand and gravel and limestone a 390 borehole lithology data collected from the literature were used to estimate the horizontal extensions and the depths associated with each layer within the qaend structure more details could be found at ezzeldin et al 2018 the data related to the study area are presented in table 1 precipitation p interception i and actual evapotranspiration aet are obtained from the food and agriculture organization water productivity open access portal wapor the land slope

2005 and 2015 different multiplication factors with aet are considered to estimate the irrigation rates ir for the aquifer including 1 coarse sand and gravel with clay lenses 2 coastal sand dunes 3 el manzala lake 4 miocene fiuviomarine sediments 5 nile silt and clay and 6 sabkha deposits with values equal to 2 2 1 9 1 3 1 8 1 25 and 1 15 respectively 2 2 problem definition the purpose of the present paper is to construct relationships between the available geomorphological and hydrogeological characteristics at any year and the unknown annual net recharge rates to the groundwater table of the qaend the present work handles this problem through two steps the first step is to estimate the yearly recharge rate at any location within the qaend region using the known hydraulic heads hydraulic properties and boundary conditions in 2005 the indirect inverse groundwater simulation model is adopted to calibrate the recharge rates pso coupled with the groundwater simulation model mfusg is used to minimize iteratively the mean square error mse between observed and simulated hydraulic heads sensitivity analysis is used in advance to tune up the control parameters of the pso the second step is training and validating the cfnn to construct reliable implicit relationships between the obtained recharge rates and the available hydrogeological and geomorphological data in 2005 four different optimization methods i e deterministic and or stochastic are used to train the cfnn 1 pso 2 levenberg marquart lm 3 lm bayesian regularization br and 4 pso lm br sensitivity analysis is carried first to select the suitable cfaa structure once the best trained algorithm is specified the performance of using different transfer functions is examined with the taylor diagram then the developed cfaa model is used to estimate the recharge rates within the transient simulation of the aquifer between 2005 and 2015 finally the predicted and observed hydraulic heads are compared and analyzed 2 3 simulation optimization s o model the groundwater flow is simulated with mfusg which is based on the control volume finite difference cvfd formulation panday et al 2013 the governing equation is written as 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z ω s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are hydraulic conductivities in cartesian coordinates x y and z respectively h is the hydraulic head ω is the sink and or the source term ss is the specific storage and t is the time the qaend is considered as a heterogeneous anisotropic aquifer i e within every element kxx kyy are considered the same value while kzz is less the conventional modflow models simulate the 3d domain with structured stratified continuous layers of grids this distorts the accurate representation of the geological formation of the aquifer i e discontinued layers cannot be handled exactly consequently an inaccurate response to the model can be expected an updated version named modflow usg mfusg is used to handle this problem the mfusg constructs an unstructured grid with the versatility of the element sides which easily enables sharp dips and discontinuities in this study voronoi polygon grids are used to discretize the qaend aquifer as they give great versatility to refine around template features voronoi polygon elements have higher quality and greater consistency than the rectangular ones the evolutionary optimization method pso is combined with the mfusg is used to calibrate the unknown recharge rates in 2005 boundary conditions and locations of observed hydraulic heads are shown in fig 3 due to the limited number of the observed hydraulic heads 127 the kriging method i e the best linear unbiased estimator method is used to represent the hydraulic head field with an exponential semi variogram superimposed to a nugget then the kriging method crates additional new interpolated hydraulic heads at locations that spread uniformly over the qaend see fig 3b both the observed and the interpolated data 944 are handled in the remaining of the paper as observed data and used to calibrate the unknown recharge rates that process is necessary to assure the effectiveness of the observed hydraulic head data at far grids the objective function adopted by the s o scheme is the minimization of the mean square errors mse between simulated and observed hydraulic heads as 2 m i n i m i z e o b j m s e 1 n n 1 n h n o b h n s i 2 with the constraints 3 q i r i p i i r i s i e t i i i 1 2 n e 4 q i max q e i 1 d i x 0 i 1 2 n e where obj is the objective function h n o b is the observed head h n s i is the simulated head n is the number of observed and interpolated hydraulic heads r i is the net recharge rate at the groundwater table i is the number of the grid element n e is the number of mesh elements discretize the aquifer area p is the annual precipitation ir is the amount of water given from irrigation s is the surface runoff eti is the sum of the actual evapotranspiration and intercepted water by leaves q is the volumetric evaporation rate from the ground surface qe is the rate of evaporation flux times the element area di is the depth of the water table below the ground surface and x is the maximum root depth instead of equating the recharge rate for any cell with the right hand side of eq 3 it is settled between upper and lower limits for the following reasons 1 the ignored effect of the covered drain network which traps a significant amount of r to control the groundwater table level in the agriculture lands simulation of that network requires huge data and finer discretization of qaend that rise up the computational cost to unrealistic levels during the calibration process 2 uncertainty and different degrees of error that may be embedded for different components of the right hand side of eq 3 and 3 the negative charge out of any cell cannot be lower than maximum evaporation 2 4 artificial neural network model the cfnn is like the feed forward networks except that each neuron receives weighted information directly from the total neurons in all previous layers lashkarbolooki et al 2013 the cfnn architecture consists of l four layers the first one is the input layer and the lth one is the output layer and two hidden layers every layer except the output one has an additional bias neuron with an input value equals to one the input data at each cell are hydrological data depth of actual evapotranspiration and interception precipitation depth surface runoff depth irrigated water depth and groundwater depth and geomorphological data land slope land use soil type longitudinal coordinate and latitude coordinate three transfer functions are considered 1 linear f x x purelin 2 sigmoid logistic f x 1 1 e x logsig and 3 tanh f x 2 1 e 2 x tansig the output o from any node is represented as 5 o k l f k w k 1 b k l b k 1 i 1 k 1 i j 1 n i w i j k l o i j k 2 l l 1 2 n k where ok l is is the output from neuron l in layer number k fk is the transfer function at layer k w i j k l is the weight multiplied by the output transferred from neuron j in layer i to neuron l in layer k ni n k are the total number of neurons in layer i and bk 1 is the attached bias at layer k 1 and equal to 1 cfnn is trained to minimize the square error se between the known recharge rates in 2005 and the outputs the backpropagation algorithm is used to train the cfnn with four different algorithms as mentioned in the subsequent subsections 2 4 1 particle swarm optimization pso is used twice the first time with mfusg to calibrate the unknown recharge rates in 2005 while the second to train the cfnn the process is initialized by creating a population swarm composed of n number of particles birds each bird is associated with two vectors x values of the decision variables and v velocities change with dimension d number of decision variables vector x also represents the weights of the cfnn both the x and v vectors are randomly initialized within the prespecified upper and lower limits and their corresponding fitness values are calculated then the global best bird gbest is identified for the next generations the velocity component in different directions for every bird is updated as robinson and rahmat samii 2004 6 v i j k 1 w v i j k c 1 r 1 p b e s t i j k x i j k c 2 r 2 g b e s t j x i j k i 1 2 n j 1 2 d where xi j k vi j k are magnitude and velocity of decision variable j for bird i within the generation k respectively pbesti j k represents the jth element of the best location of bird i till generation k gbestj represents the jth element of the ever best bird up to the current iteration c 1 and c 2 are two positive control parameters called acceleration factors of learning r 1 and r 2 are two uniform random values in the range 0 1 and w is a control parameter named the inertia weight that is compromised between recent and updated velocities of birds shi and eberhart 1998 the new location of a given bird is determined as 7 x i j k 1 x i j k v i j k 1 the new bird xi k 1 must replace the old one xi k and p b e s t i k 1 only if it has better fitness after repeating the previous process to the whole population of birds the fittest bird is identified and replaces the gbest if it has better fitness this operation is repeated until a termination criterion is achieved fig 4 a shows the flow chart for the pso 2 4 2 levenberg marquardt algorithm the lm algorithm has a great ability to handle nonlinear optimization problems nguyen truong and le 2015 lm exploits both

iteration process is continued until it reaches its maximum number or the objective function is not improved for a prespecified number of successive iterations fig 4b shows the flow chart for the lm algorithm 2 4 3 bayesian regularization for a complex high dimensional solution space the lm algorithm has a severe disadvantage that is sticking to the nearest local minima training the cfnn to the deepest point in the local minima i e that is catching near zeros for all components of the jacobean matrix almost leads to overfitting combining both br and lm algorithms tackle that problem khan and coulibaly 2006 the idea is to add a penalty proportional to the weights of the cfnn in the objective function this enforces the weights to be smaller and consequently the predicted output should be smoother the adapted objective function f can be represented as titterington 2004 okut et al 2013 9 f β f d α f w β i 1 m o i r i 2 α i 1 n w i 2 where fw is the sum of square weights wi αfw is the

i for the hessian matrix 2jtj that is constructed within the lm using fd as the objective function fig 4b shows a flow chart for the algorithm 2 4 4 implementation of the hybrid pso lm br algorithm lm br algorithm has a strong ability to explore the local zone around the initial start but its ability to find results for the whole global search space especially in complex multidimensional ones is limited the pso is a population based global search algorithm that has a high opportunity in finding the valley at the best minima combining both the pso with the lm br a new hybrid algorithm is formulated pso lm br allows us to explore deeply and precisely more various valleys without overtraining the pso begins the search process from the creation of a random population birds for every bird from the population a new corresponding one is generated using eqs 6 and 7 and then used as an initial guess for the lm br algorithm to find the most probable minimum around it if the optimized bird reaches better fitness than the bird selected from the population its velocity vector is adapted eq 7 and replaces this bird the advantage of that hybrid algorithm is performing both global searches using the pso along with a local and deep search using the lm br the flow chart of the hybrid pso lm br algorithm is illustrated in fig 4b 3 results and discussions 3 1 recharge rate calibration the multilayer aquifer qaend is discretized with 235 893 voronoi elements the mfusg model is used to calibrate the unknown recharge rates for the top 24 990 cells of the grid that represents the qaend lower and upper limits of the allowable recharge are estimated from eq 3 sensitivity analysis is applied to tune up the four control parameters of the pso i e the number of generations the number of birds per generation the inertia weight factor and the acceleration constants precise sensitivity analysis by fixing three parameters and vary the fourth leads to the fantastic not possible computational effort thus the maximum number of generations is fixed to 700 for all runs and initially acceleration constants and the number of birds are fixed at 2 2 and 100 respectively to study the inertia weight effect two states for the inertia weight factor w are considered 1 constant w 0 75 and 2 linear decreasing within the range wmax wmin as the iteration progresses different inertia weight ranges are examined as 0 9 0 25 0 9 0 4 0 8 0 6 1 4 0 0 1 0 0 5 1 4 1 0 1 2 0 8 1 2 0 4 and 0 7 0 3 for any generation the variable w can be calculated as robinson and rahmat samii 2004 11 w w m a x i w m a x w m i n m a x n u m b e r o f g e n e r a t i o n s the sensitivity analysis terminates after 100 generations only best performance is found for wmax 0 9 and wmin 0 25 as shown in fig 5 a these values are fixed for the remaining of the sensitivity study the acceleration constants are studied for c 1 0 5 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and c 1 1 0 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and c 1 1 5 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and c 1 2 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 acceleration constants c 1 1 5 and c 2 2 0 produced the best results after 100 iterations see fig 5b finally the number of population birds is considered as 100 500 1000 and 1500 while the best performance is achieved at 1000 the termination criterion in this s o model is based on two rules the first one is reaching 700 generations while the second is the relative changes in optimal solution is less than 0 0001 for ten consecutive generations from fig 6 the mfusg pso model can achieve a fairly good solution for rmse 0 1085 m after only 500 generations then it converges slowly to the optimal value of 0 105 m at the last one from fig 7 a low recharge rates 0 01 mm day are located at the north and this is due to the presence of a clay cap at the upper layer with a thickness varying between 15 30 m the maximum recharge rate 0 6 mm day is obtained in the middle east and southeast of the study area the recharge rates vary from 0 01 to 0 6 mm day in the traditional agriculture area good matching between observed and estimated groundwater hydraulic heads in 2005 as shown in fig 7b six statistical efficiency indices are used to assure the reliability of estimating the groundwater hydraulic heads see table 2 coefficient of determination r 2 as converges to 1 the dispersions of obtained and observed values are going to be equal nse has achieved the same performance i e 0 9992 and measures the sum of square errors normalized to the observed variance the index of agreement d is very good as it approaches 1 the mean absolute error mae equals 6 97 cm the percent bias pbias informs that the model in general underestimates the relatively calculated heads with a ratio equal to 0 0345 overall it can be concluded that the mfusg pso model can predict unknown groundwater recharges with fair accuracy hence the calibrated results of the recharge rates are acceptable and can be used for the training of the cfnn model table 3 represents the water budget components within the steady state simulation of the aquifer in the study area the major inflow components are net recharges and river leakage with percentages of 50 4 and 42 respectively from the total inflow on the other hand the well discharge represents 70 7 of the total outflow the main drawback of the calibration process is its computational cost mfusg pso model spent 77 days 18 h and 40 min as a computational time to solve the qaend recharge recognition problem the simulation is performed on a cpu e5 2620 2 30 ghz 20 cores with 128 gb ram 3 2 learning cfnn the cfnn model is trained to generate a relationship between the geomorphological and hydrological data and the net recharge rates for the qaend region the characteristics of input and test data sets for the year 2005 are listed in table 4 all input and output data are prepared as raster images each one consists of 225 550 pixels with dimension 250 m 250 m data within the regular pixels are redistributed on the unstructured elements by averaging the pixel data which are lying in any specified element then 80 of the data are used for training while 20 are used for testing since there are no specific rules for designing a cfnn architecture a trial and error technique is used gaur et al 2013 the cfnn architecture is selected from four layers i e the input layer two hidden layers and the output layer with the number of neurons in the input layer equal to n1 10 n2 and n3 for hidden layers and n4 1 for the output layer additional unit bias is added to each of the first three layers consequently the total number of the required adjusted weights for any cfnn architecture is n n1 1 n2 n1 n2 1 n3 n1 n2 n3 1 n4 transfer functions are selected as tanh function tansig for both the two hidden layers and linear purelin function for the output layer the smallest number of weights which stills can offer good fitting accuracy and explore well is selected at the end table 5 summarizes the control parameters used for the four different training algorithms fig 8 shows the minimum rmse achieved for several runs with an increasing number of weights for the different training methods all runs have the same start seed number results of the pso algorithm are achieved values for the rmse 0 3915 mm day for all algorithms the rmse is decreasing with increasing the number of weights but after 707 neurons n2 18 n3 16 no significant improvement can be considered the number of effective parameters γ is a little bit smaller than the number of neurons until n reaches 707 then for higher values of n γ remains fixed about 698 consequently the solution space has 698 dimensions and the best performance with minimum computational effort can be obtained by considering the number of weights equals 707 it is noted that while the initial seed number is the same for all runs the lm behaves worse than the other two methods that means despite the lm reaches the most likelihood local minimum nearest the initial search point the lm br prevents the algorithm from steeping down quickly and explores the local domain around the starting point that enables it in catching a most probable solution better than the nearest local minimum achieved by the lm this note is an indication of the severe complexity and the zigzag sharp terrain of the solution space surface as a logical consequence for the hard nonlinearity and a large number of the decision variables that indication is assured for the whole solution space as the global hybrid algorithm lm br pso reached better results of rmse the best training algorithm lm br pso is remodelled repeatedly with all possible arrangements of the three transfer functions at the two hidden and the output layers all models are initiated with the same seed number taylor s diagram is used to evaluate the twelve models see fig 9 the correlation coefficient r measures only the degree of similarity between dispersions of obtained and calibrated net recharge rates around their means with identical parallel dispersions at r 1 the root means square error differences rmse is used as a complementary criterion to assist in evaluating the convergence level between these means the standard deviation of the calibrated recharge rate data is 0 654 mm day and is settled at the horizontal axis and performance of any model is presented by setting point with radial distance from the origin equal to the standard deviation of the obtained data and the azimuthal position equal to the correlation coefficient r between obtained and calibarted data sets the best performed model uses the transfer function tanh for both hidden and output layers to check the performance of the four training algorithms using only the tanh transfer functions multiple runs are performed with a total number of function evaluations for each algorithm equal to 15 106 see table 5 statistical analysis of the rmse results of the different runs is represented in table 6 results for both the two deterministic training methods lm and lm br are varied from very good to poor depending on the starting seed number with a small computational time about 3 s for each run these fast methods cannot achieve a reliable solution from only one run but the repetition of the inexpensive runs with different seed numbers enhances the chance of catching better solutions combining br with lm improves all the statistical parameters the thirty runs of the pso resulted in more stable values of the rmse with a limited variation but with expensive computational cost per run and outperformed the deterministic methods combining both the pso and the lm br in a hybrid method enhances the results in a great manner the worst rmse value achieved by the hybrid method 0 0161 mm day is at least 270 better than the best obtained one for any of the remaining three methods the hybrid method has a lesser standard deviation and converges to the minimum more rapidly with respect to the use of the pso only the quality of the four training algorithms is studied by measuring their accuracies in validating the test data set of the recharge rates in the year 2005 fig 10 visual inspection and different statistical criteria are used to evaluate the training algorithm quality in predicting the recharge rates the pso algorithm trained the cfnn badly and significant overfitting can be observed for predicted recharge rates less than 0 1 mm day also the bias percentage is considerably high best quality associated with the hybrid algorithm pso lm br but still there is a significant deviation for the validated recharge rates that have values less than 0 02 mm day this due to the weak contribution for the square roots of these minor recharge rates in the magnitude of the objective function fig 11 a shows good matching between the simulated hydraulic heads using the predicted recharge rates by the cfnn which is trained by pso lm br and the observed data correlation between net recharge depth and different input data for the first layer of cfnn are presented in table 7 the most important input data that are directly proportional to the net recharge rate is soil type and irrigation rates unexpectedly precipitation is inversely proportional with r this is due to the decrease in the precipitation rates from the north where the topsoil is clay with low hydraulic conductivity to the south where the topsoil is sand with high hydraulic conductivity and a consequent high percolation and net recharge rates thus it can be concluded that the irrigation rate is the major source of the recharge see also table 4 that conclusion is reliable from observing the increase in hydraulic heads within the reclaimed south of the qaend during the last two decades due to cultivation 3 3 validating the cfnn in predicting future recharge rates transient simulation of groundwater flow is carried out from 2005 to 2015 using the recharge rates predicted from the trained cfnn and the available annual input data from wapor every year is considered as a stress period with 365 time steps the water budget from 2005 to 2015 are shown in fig 12 with a linear change in the pumping rates from 2005 to 2015 and constant levels of water in the irrigation system total recharge volume increased from 2005 to 2015 by 12 due to the increase in cultivation good matching can be observed between the simulated hydraulic heads and the observed wells as shown in fig 11b the mean absolute error between simulated and observed hydraulic heads is equal to 0 2703 m in 2015 against 0 1857 m in 2005 thus it can be concluded that the cfnn can predict the recharge rates for future years accurately the recharge rates map in 2015 and the differences between net recharge rates in 2005 and 2015 are presented in fig 13 a and b respectively with a mean increase equal to 0 037 mm day the net recharge is mainly increased in cultivated land in the south where the network drainage system is not yet completely furnished 4 conclusions this paper presents a novel model to connect both the available geomorphological and hydrogeological data and the recharge rates for the qaend the first step is calibrating the recharge rates at 2005 using the mfusg pso model with an indirect simulation optimization process for the inversion of the groundwater flow problem the second step is connecting the calibrated recharge rates in 2005 with the free available geomorphological and hydrogeological data to create interrelationships by training a cfnn model four algorithms are used to train the cfnn model the first one is stochastic pso the second and the third are deterministic lm and lm br and the fourth is hybrid pso lm br which needs more computational effort than the first three algorithms but it reaches a better performance the hybrid algorithm is used here for the first time for predicting the recharge rates lm is always stuck to the nearest local minima from the starting point while lm br explores the local domain around the local minima more precisely by implementing one run of the hybrid method a better result can be achieved than any of the results of total previous runs for the three methods taylor diagram is efficient in comparing accuracies of different cfnn transfer functions with the best achieved performance from using the tanh functions between all cfnn layers the trained cfnn can predict the unknown recharge rates at any year in insignificant computational time thus there is no need to collect the observed hydraulic heads needed to calibrate the recharge rates every year both hydraulic heads and net recharge rates are increased from 2005 to 2015 in newly cultivated lands in the southeast of the qaend which enhances the necessity of constructing a network drain system on the other hand building a monitoring system for the qaend region and associated irrigation system with a specified protocol for collecting the data will increase the reliability of the calibration process and consequently the management of the aquifer the present work can be adapted to any aquifer using the fao platform wapor which offers available updated remote sensing data for

delta 1 introduction groundwater is a crucial resource for natural drinking water agriculture industry and various human development activities especially in arid and semi arid areas groundwater resources rely primarily on the recharge process tilahun and merkel 2009 which is composed mainly of infiltrating rain and residual percolated water from irrigation de vries and simmers 2002 barron et al 2012 consequently recharge rates to the aquifer are an inevitable requirement to set a reliable strategy for sustainable use of the groundwater and control the adverse environmental impacts that emerge from excessive pumping sharma 1986 different parameters such as land use climate geological structures soil type surface cover vegetation topography land slope and surface water canals affect the groundwater recharge rates kalaidzidou paikou et al 1997 tang and mays 1998 barron et al 2012 liu et al 2013 albuquerque et al 2013 goodarzi et al 2016 the weighting values for each parameter are set according to their possible relationships and to their degree of impact on the recharge process assessing the recharge rates to aquifers is a major challenge korkmaz 1988 and they are commonly calculated with approximate procedures scanlon et al 2006 ghouili et al 2017 techniques used to estimate groundwater recharge in arid and semiarid regions are based on several approaches such as isotopic geochemical water balance temperature profiles physical measurements and electromagnetic ping et al 2014 gidafie et al 2016 different surplus methods are also available which are based on water table fluctuation darcy s law base flow tracer techniques mathematical models and other combinations of these methods butterworth et al 1999 healy and cook 2002 ebrahimi et al 2016 the selection of the correct method for determining recharge rates is still a difficult step many factors may contribute to the selection of the most reliable method such as time and space scales and the validity

al 2013 used the ann with the particle swarm optimization pso for the management of groundwater of the dore river basin in france also an approach for detecting the unknown pollution causes in groundwater aquifers has been proposed by borah and bhattacharjya 2016 using the ann a modular three dimensional multispecies transport model mt3dms and the genetic algorithm in the second section of the present paper the study area is explored sources of available data are presented and a brief description of the problem is illustrated in subsection 2 3 the simulation model and the minimization problem used to calibrate the recharge rates are illustrated then the cfnn with four training methods are introduced in subsection 2 4 different results are presented in section 3 as follows 1 sensitivity analysis of the control variables within the pso and calibrated recharge rates at 2005 2 accuracy comparison between the four methods used to train the cfnn sensitivity analysis to the number of neurons adopted by the cfnn and statistical performance for different transfer functions and 3 validating the hydraulic heads at 2015 finally the conclusions are presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and available data the qaend at egypt occupies an area of about 12 284 km2 as shown in fig 1 the groundwater layer of the study area belongs mainly to the quaternary pleistocene deposits the thickness of this aquifer varies from 100 m at the south to 900 m near the north at the mediterranean sea the qaend structure consists of several discontinuous horizontal layers see fig 2 the aquifer layers are composed of six types of soil namely clay fine sand sandy clay coarse sand sand and gravel and limestone a 390 borehole lithology data collected from the literature were used to estimate the horizontal extensions and the depths associated with each layer within the qaend structure more details could be found at ezzeldin et al 2018 the data related to the study area are presented in table 1 precipitation p interception i and actual evapotranspiration aet are obtained from the food and agriculture organization water productivity open access portal wapor the land slope

2005 and 2015 different multiplication factors with aet are considered to estimate the irrigation rates ir for the aquifer including 1 coarse sand and gravel with clay lenses 2 coastal sand dunes 3 el manzala lake 4 miocene fiuviomarine sediments 5 nile silt and clay and 6 sabkha deposits with values equal to 2 2 1 9 1 3 1 8 1 25 and 1 15 respectively 2 2 problem definition the purpose of the present paper is to construct relationships between the available geomorphological and hydrogeological characteristics at any year and the unknown annual net recharge rates to the groundwater table of the qaend the present work handles this problem through two steps the first step is to estimate the yearly recharge rate at any location within the qaend region using the known hydraulic heads hydraulic properties and boundary conditions in 2005 the indirect inverse groundwater simulation model is adopted to calibrate the recharge rates pso coupled with the groundwater simulation model mfusg is used to minimize iteratively the mean square error mse between observed and simulated hydraulic heads sensitivity analysis is used in advance to tune up the control parameters of the pso the second step is training and validating the cfnn to construct reliable implicit relationships between the obtained recharge rates and the available hydrogeological and geomorphological data in 2005 four different optimization methods i e deterministic and or stochastic are used to train the cfnn 1 pso 2 levenberg marquart lm 3 lm bayesian regularization br and 4 pso lm br sensitivity analysis is carried first to select the suitable cfaa structure once the best trained algorithm is specified the performance of using different transfer functions is examined with the taylor diagram then the developed cfaa model is used to estimate the recharge rates within the transient simulation of the aquifer between 2005 and 2015 finally the predicted and observed hydraulic heads are compared and analyzed 2 3 simulation optimization s o model the groundwater flow is simulated with mfusg which is based on the control volume finite difference cvfd formulation panday et al 2013 the governing equation is written as 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z ω s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are hydraulic conductivities in cartesian coordinates x y and z respectively h is the hydraulic head ω is the sink and or the source term ss is the specific storage and t is the time the qaend is considered as a heterogeneous anisotropic aquifer i e within every element kxx kyy are considered the same value while kzz is less the conventional modflow models simulate the 3d domain with structured stratified continuous layers of grids this distorts the accurate representation of the geological formation of the aquifer i e discontinued layers cannot be handled exactly consequently an inaccurate response to the model can be expected an updated version named modflow usg mfusg is used to handle this problem the mfusg constructs an unstructured grid with the versatility of the element sides which easily enables sharp dips and discontinuities in this study voronoi polygon grids are used to discretize the qaend aquifer as they give great versatility to refine around template features voronoi polygon elements have higher quality and greater consistency than the rectangular ones the evolutionary optimization method pso is combined with the mfusg is used to calibrate the unknown recharge rates in 2005 boundary conditions and locations of observed hydraulic heads are shown in fig 3 due to the limited number of the observed hydraulic heads 127 the kriging method i e the best linear unbiased estimator method is used to represent the hydraulic head field with an exponential semi variogram superimposed to a nugget then the kriging method crates additional new interpolated hydraulic heads at locations that spread uniformly over the qaend see fig 3b both the observed and the interpolated data 944 are handled in the remaining of the paper as observed data and used to calibrate the unknown recharge rates that process is necessary to assure the effectiveness of the observed hydraulic head data at far grids the objective function adopted by the s o scheme is the minimization of the mean square errors mse between simulated and observed hydraulic heads as 2 m i n i m i z e o b j m s e 1 n n 1 n h n o b h n s i 2 with the constraints 3 q i r i p i i r i s i e t i i i 1 2 n e 4 q i max q e i 1 d i x 0 i 1 2 n e where obj is the objective function h n o b is the observed head h n s i is the simulated head n is the number of observed and interpolated hydraulic heads r i is the net recharge rate at the groundwater table i is the number of the grid element n e is the number of mesh elements discretize the aquifer area p is the annual precipitation ir is the amount of water given from irrigation s is the surface runoff eti is the sum of the actual evapotranspiration and intercepted water by leaves q is the volumetric evaporation rate from the ground surface qe is the rate of evaporation flux times the element area di is the depth of the water table below the ground surface and x is the maximum root depth instead of equating the recharge rate for any cell with the right hand side of eq 3 it is settled between upper and lower limits for the following reasons 1 the ignored effect of the covered drain network which traps a significant amount of r to control the groundwater table level in the agriculture lands simulation of that network requires huge data and finer discretization of qaend that rise up the computational cost to unrealistic levels during the calibration process 2 uncertainty and different degrees of error that may be embedded for different components of the right hand side of eq 3 and 3 the negative charge out of any cell cannot be lower than maximum evaporation 2 4 artificial neural network model the cfnn is like the feed forward networks except that each neuron receives weighted information directly from the total neurons in all previous layers lashkarbolooki et al 2013 the cfnn architecture consists of l four layers the first one is the input layer and the lth one is the output layer and two hidden layers every layer except the output one has an additional bias neuron with an input value equals to one the input data at each cell are hydrological data depth of actual evapotranspiration and interception precipitation depth surface runoff depth irrigated water depth and groundwater depth and geomorphological data land slope land use soil type longitudinal coordinate and latitude coordinate three transfer functions are considered 1 linear f x x purelin 2 sigmoid logistic f x 1 1 e x logsig and 3 tanh f x 2 1 e 2 x tansig the output o from any node is represented as 5 o k l f k w k 1 b k l b k 1 i 1 k 1 i j 1 n i w i j k l o i j k 2 l l 1 2 n k where ok l is is the output from neuron l in layer number k fk is the transfer function at layer k w i j k l is the weight multiplied by the output transferred from neuron j in layer i to neuron l in layer k ni n k are the total number of neurons in layer i and bk 1 is the attached bias at layer k 1 and equal to 1 cfnn is trained to minimize the square error se between the known recharge rates in 2005 and the outputs the backpropagation algorithm is used to train the cfnn with four different algorithms as mentioned in the subsequent subsections 2 4 1 particle swarm optimization pso is used twice the first time with mfusg to calibrate the unknown recharge rates in 2005 while the second to train the cfnn the process is initialized by creating a population swarm composed of n number of particles birds each bird is associated with two vectors x values of the decision variables and v velocities change with dimension d number of decision variables vector x also represents the weights of the cfnn both the x and v vectors are randomly initialized within the prespecified upper and lower limits and their corresponding fitness values are calculated then the global best bird gbest is identified for the next generations the velocity component in different directions for every bird is updated as robinson and rahmat samii 2004 6 v i j k 1 w v i j k c 1 r 1 p b e s t i j k x i j k c 2 r 2 g b e s t j x i j k

i till generation k gbestj represents the jth element of the ever best bird up to the current iteration c 1 and c 2 are two positive control parameters called acceleration factors of learning r 1 and r 2 are two uniform random values in the range 0 1 and w is a control parameter named the inertia weight that is compromised between recent and updated velocities of birds shi and eberhart 1998 the new location of a given bird is determined as 7 x i j k 1 x i j k v i j k 1 the new bird xi k 1 must replace the old one xi k and p b e s t i k 1 only if it has better fitness after repeating the previous process to the whole population of birds the fittest bird is identified and replaces the gbest if it has better fitness this operation is repeated until a termination criterion is achieved fig 4 a shows the flow chart for the pso 2 4 2 levenberg marquardt algorithm the lm algorithm has a great ability to handle nonlinear optimization problems nguyen truong and le 2015 lm exploits both of stability of the steepest descent method and the convergence speed of the gauss newton method the unknown gradient step that is must be considered by the steepest descent method in every iteration is replaced with the inverse of summation both hessian matrix h 2jtj and λ i where λ is a factor and i is the identity matrix depending on λ lm moves between the steepest descent method for large λ and the gauss newton method for very small λ muslim et al 2017 as 8 δ n i k 1 j n m t i k j m n i k λ i k i n n 1 j n m t i k e m i k where m is the total number of the output data from all input

iteration process is continued until it reaches its maximum number or the objective function is not improved for a prespecified number of successive iterations fig 4b shows the flow chart for the lm algorithm 2 4 3 bayesian regularization for a complex high dimensional solution space the lm algorithm has a severe disadvantage that is sticking to the nearest local minima training the cfnn to the deepest point in the local minima i e that is catching near zeros for all components of the jacobean matrix almost leads to overfitting combining both br and lm algorithms tackle that problem khan and coulibaly 2006 the idea is to add a penalty proportional to the weights of the cfnn in the objective function this enforces the weights to be smaller and consequently the predicted output should be smoother the adapted objective function f can be represented as titterington 2004 okut et al 2013 9 f β f d α f w β i 1 m o i r i 2 α i 1 n w i 2 where fw is the sum of square weights wi αfw is the

number of effective weights that steers the cfnn results tr h 1 is the trace of the matrix h 1 and equal to the summation of the eigenvalues of the matrix μi is the reciprocal of the eigenvalue number i for the hessian matrix 2jtj that is constructed within the lm using fd as the objective function fig 4b shows a flow chart for the algorithm 2 4 4 implementation of the hybrid pso lm br algorithm lm br algorithm has a strong ability to explore the local zone around the initial start but its ability to find results for the whole global search space especially in complex multidimensional ones is limited the pso is a population based global search algorithm that has a high opportunity in finding the valley at the best minima combining both the pso with the lm br a new hybrid algorithm is formulated pso lm br allows us to explore deeply and precisely more various valleys without overtraining the pso begins the search process from the creation of a random population birds for every bird from the population a new corresponding one is generated using eqs 6 and 7 and then used as an initial guess for the lm br algorithm to find the most probable minimum around it if the optimized bird reaches better fitness than the bird selected from the population its velocity vector is adapted eq 7 and replaces this bird the advantage of that hybrid algorithm is performing both global searches using the pso along with a local and deep search using the lm br the flow chart of the hybrid pso lm br algorithm is illustrated in fig 4b 3 results and discussions 3 1 recharge rate calibration the multilayer aquifer qaend is discretized with 235 893 voronoi elements the mfusg model is used to calibrate the unknown recharge rates for the top 24 990 cells of the grid that represents the qaend lower and upper limits of the allowable recharge are estimated from eq 3 sensitivity analysis is applied to tune up the four control parameters of the pso i e the number of generations the number of birds per generation the inertia weight factor and the acceleration constants precise sensitivity analysis by fixing three parameters and vary the fourth leads to the fantastic not possible computational effort thus the maximum number of generations is fixed to 700 for all runs and initially acceleration constants and the number of birds are fixed at 2 2 and 100 respectively to study the inertia weight effect two states for the inertia weight factor w are considered 1 constant w 0 75 and 2 linear decreasing within the range wmax wmin as the iteration progresses different inertia weight ranges are examined as 0 9 0 25 0 9 0 4 0 8 0 6 1 4 0 0 1 0 0 5 1 4 1 0 1 2 0 8 1 2 0 4 and 0 7 0 3 for any generation the variable w can be calculated as robinson and rahmat samii 2004 11 w w m a x i w m a x w m i n m a x n u m b e r o f g e n e r a t i o n s the sensitivity analysis terminates after 100 generations only best performance is found for wmax 0 9 and wmin 0 25 as shown in fig 5 a these values are fixed for the remaining of the sensitivity study the acceleration constants are studied for c 1 0 5 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and c 1 1 0 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and c 1 1 5 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and c 1 2 c 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 acceleration constants c 1 1 5 and c 2 2 0 produced the best results after 100 iterations see fig 5b finally the number of population birds is considered as 100 500 1000 and 1500 while the best performance is achieved at 1000 the termination criterion in this s o model is based on two rules the first one is reaching 700 generations while the second is the relative changes in optimal solution is less than 0 0001 for ten consecutive generations from fig 6 the mfusg pso model can achieve a fairly good solution for rmse 0 1085 m after only 500 generations then it converges slowly to the optimal value of 0 105 m at the last one from fig 7 a low recharge rates 0 01 mm day are located at the north and this is due to the presence of a clay cap at the upper layer with a thickness varying between 15 30 m the maximum recharge rate 0 6 mm day is obtained in the middle east and southeast of the study area the recharge rates vary from 0 01 to 0 6 mm day in the traditional agriculture area good matching between observed and estimated groundwater hydraulic heads in 2005 as shown in fig 7b six statistical efficiency indices are used to assure the reliability of estimating the groundwater hydraulic heads see table 2 coefficient of determination r 2 as converges to 1 the dispersions of obtained and observed values are going to be equal nse has achieved the same performance i e 0 9992 and measures the sum of square errors normalized to the observed variance the index of agreement d is very good as it approaches 1 the mean absolute error mae equals 6 97 cm the percent bias pbias informs that the model in general underestimates the relatively calculated heads with a ratio equal to 0 0345 overall it can be concluded that the mfusg pso model can predict unknown groundwater recharges with fair accuracy hence the calibrated results of the recharge rates are acceptable and can be used for the training of the cfnn model table 3 represents the water budget components within the steady state simulation of the aquifer in the study area the major inflow components are net recharges and river leakage with percentages of 50 4 and 42 respectively from the total inflow on the other hand the well discharge represents 70 7 of the total outflow the main drawback of the calibration process is its computational cost mfusg pso model spent 77 days 18 h and 40 min as a computational time to solve the qaend recharge recognition problem the simulation is performed on a cpu e5 2620 2 30 ghz 20 cores with 128 gb ram 3 2 learning cfnn the cfnn model is trained to generate a relationship between the geomorphological and hydrological data and the net recharge rates for the qaend region the characteristics of input and test data sets for the year 2005 are listed in table 4 all input and output data are prepared as raster images each one consists of 225 550 pixels with dimension 250 m 250 m data within the regular pixels are redistributed on the unstructured elements by averaging the pixel data which are lying in any specified element then 80 of the data are used for training while 20 are used for testing since there are no specific rules for designing a cfnn architecture a trial and error technique is used gaur et al 2013 the cfnn architecture is selected from four layers i e the input layer two hidden layers and the output layer with the number of neurons in the input layer equal to n1 10 n2 and n3 for hidden layers and n4 1 for the output layer additional unit bias is added to each of the first three layers consequently the total number of the required adjusted weights for any cfnn architecture is n n1 1 n2 n1 n2 1 n3 n1 n2 n3 1 n4 transfer functions are selected as tanh function tansig for both the two hidden layers and linear purelin function for the output layer the smallest number of weights which stills can offer good fitting accuracy and explore well is selected at the end table 5 summarizes the control parameters used for the four different training algorithms fig 8 shows the minimum rmse achieved for several runs with an increasing number of weights for the different training methods all runs have the same start seed number results of the pso algorithm are achieved values for the rmse 0 3915 mm day for all algorithms the rmse is decreasing with increasing the number of weights but after 707 neurons n2 18 n3 16 no significant improvement can be considered the number of effective parameters γ is a little bit smaller than the number of neurons until n reaches 707 then for higher values of n γ remains fixed about 698 consequently the solution space has 698 dimensions and the best performance with minimum computational effort can be obtained by considering the number of weights equals 707 it is noted that while the initial seed number is the same for all runs the lm behaves worse than the other two methods that means despite the lm reaches the most likelihood local minimum nearest the initial search point the lm br prevents the algorithm from steeping down quickly and explores the local domain around the starting point that enables it in catching a most probable solution better than the nearest local minimum achieved by the lm this note is an indication of the severe complexity and the zigzag sharp terrain of the solution space surface as a logical consequence for the hard nonlinearity and a large number of the decision variables that indication is assured for the whole solution space as the global hybrid algorithm lm br pso reached better results of rmse the best training algorithm lm br pso is remodelled repeatedly with all possible arrangements of the three transfer functions at the two hidden and the output layers all models are initiated with the same seed number taylor s diagram is used to evaluate the twelve models see fig 9 the correlation coefficient r measures only the degree of similarity between dispersions of obtained and calibrated net recharge rates around their means with identical parallel dispersions at r 1 the root means square error differences rmse is used as a complementary criterion to assist in evaluating the convergence level between these means the standard deviation of the calibrated recharge rate data is 0 654 mm day and is settled at the horizontal axis and performance of any model is presented by setting point with radial distance from the origin equal to the standard deviation of the obtained data and the azimuthal position equal to the correlation coefficient r between obtained and calibarted data sets the best performed model uses the transfer function tanh for both hidden and output layers to check the performance of the four training algorithms using only the tanh transfer functions multiple runs are performed with a total number of function evaluations for each algorithm equal to 15 106 see table 5 statistical analysis of the rmse results of the different runs is represented in table 6 results for both the two deterministic training methods lm and lm br are varied from very good to poor depending on the starting seed number with a small computational time about 3 s for each run these fast methods cannot achieve a reliable solution from only one run but the repetition of the inexpensive runs with different seed numbers enhances the chance of catching better solutions combining br with lm improves all the statistical parameters the thirty runs of the pso resulted in more stable values of the rmse with a limited variation but with expensive computational cost per run and outperformed the deterministic methods combining both the pso and the lm br in a hybrid method enhances the results in a great manner the worst rmse value achieved by the hybrid method 0 0161 mm day is at least 270 better than the best obtained one for any of the remaining three methods the hybrid method has a lesser standard deviation and converges to the minimum more rapidly with respect to the use of the pso only the quality of the four training algorithms is studied by measuring their accuracies in validating the test data set of the recharge rates in the year 2005 fig 10 visual inspection and different statistical criteria are used to evaluate the training algorithm quality in predicting the recharge rates the pso algorithm trained the cfnn badly and significant overfitting can be observed for predicted recharge rates less than 0 1 mm day also the bias percentage is considerably high best quality associated with the hybrid algorithm pso lm br but still there is a significant deviation for the validated recharge rates that have values less than 0 02 mm day this due to the weak contribution for the square roots of these minor recharge rates in the magnitude of the objective function fig 11 a shows good matching between the simulated hydraulic heads using the predicted recharge rates by the cfnn which is trained by pso lm br and the observed data correlation between net recharge depth and different input data for the first layer of cfnn are presented in table 7 the most important input data that are directly proportional to the net recharge rate is soil type and irrigation rates unexpectedly precipitation is inversely proportional with r this is due to the decrease in the precipitation rates from the north where the topsoil is clay with low hydraulic conductivity to the south where the topsoil is sand with high hydraulic conductivity and a consequent high percolation and net recharge rates thus it can be concluded that the irrigation rate is the major source of the recharge see also table 4 that conclusion is reliable from observing the increase in hydraulic heads within the reclaimed south of the qaend during the last two decades due to cultivation 3 3 validating the cfnn in predicting future recharge rates transient simulation of groundwater flow is carried out from 2005 to 2015 using the recharge rates predicted from the trained cfnn and the available annual input data from wapor every year is considered as a stress period with 365 time steps the water budget from 2005 to 2015 are shown in fig 12 with a linear change in the pumping rates from 2005 to 2015 and constant levels of water in the irrigation system total recharge volume increased from 2005 to 2015 by 12 due to the increase in cultivation good matching can be observed between the simulated hydraulic heads and the observed wells as shown in fig 11b the mean absolute error between simulated and observed hydraulic heads is equal to 0 2703 m in 2015 against 0 1857 m in 2005 thus it can be concluded that the cfnn can predict the recharge rates for future years accurately the recharge rates map in 2015 and the differences between net recharge rates in 2005 and 2015 are presented in fig 13 a and b respectively with a mean increase equal to 0 037 mm day the net recharge is mainly increased in cultivated land in the south where the network drainage system is not yet completely furnished 4 conclusions this paper presents a novel model to connect both the available geomorphological and hydrogeological data and the recharge rates for the qaend the first step is calibrating the recharge rates at 2005 using the mfusg pso model with an indirect simulation optimization process for the inversion of the groundwater flow problem the second step is connecting the calibrated recharge rates in 2005 with the free available geomorphological and hydrogeological data to create interrelationships by training a cfnn model four algorithms are used to train the cfnn model the first one is stochastic pso the second and the third are deterministic lm and lm br and the fourth is hybrid pso lm br which needs more computational effort than the first three algorithms but it reaches a better performance the hybrid algorithm is used here for the first time for predicting the recharge rates lm is always stuck to the nearest local minima from the starting point while lm br explores the local domain around the local minima more precisely by implementing one run of the hybrid method a better result can be achieved than any of the results of total previous runs for the three methods taylor diagram is efficient in comparing accuracies of different cfnn transfer functions with the best achieved performance from using the tanh functions between all cfnn layers the trained cfnn can predict the unknown recharge rates at any year in insignificant computational time thus there is no need to collect the observed hydraulic heads needed to calibrate the recharge rates every year both hydraulic heads and net recharge rates are increased from 2005 to 2015 in newly cultivated lands in the southeast of the qaend which enhances the necessity of constructing a network drain system on the other hand building a monitoring system for the qaend region and associated irrigation system with a specified protocol for collecting the data will increase the reliability of the calibration process and consequently the management of the aquifer the present work can be adapted to any aquifer using the fao platform wapor which offers available updated remote sensing data for

8253,study region buda thermal karst system hungary study focus the pilot area has high geothermal potential characterized by prominent thermal anomalies such as thermal springs and spas which tap the triassic carbonate aquifers therefore numerical simulations were carried out to examine the temperature field and flow pattern considering three successive heat transport mechanisms thermal conduction forced and mixed thermal convection in order to highlight the role of different driving forces of groundwater flow in the buda thermal karst new hydrological insights for the region compared to thermal conduction topography driven heat advection increases the surface heat flux the superimposed effect of free thermal convection facilitates the formation of time dependent mixed thermal convection from the deep carbonate layers the nusselt number varied between nu 1 56 and 5 25 while the recharge rate r ranged from r 178 mm yr to 250 mm yr radiogenic heat production and hydraulically conductive faults have only a minor influence on the basin scale temperature field and flow pattern boundary conditions prescribed on the temperature and pressure can considerably affect the numerical

is of interest for supplying electrical and heating cooling demands due to decreasing fossil resources and increasing greenhouse gases in general deep or shallow power plants borehole heat exchangers bhes enhanced geothermal systems egss and numerous other techniques are used to develop and exploit geothermal energy for the optimal operation of these systems the effects of various heat transport mechanisms in the subsurface must be understood e g arola et al 2014 however using the local scale approximation might not always be an adequate method to study groundwater flow and heat transport mechanisms for instance in the case of a regional scale aquifer system basin scale groundwater flow can be induced by the combined effect of different driving forces including water table

lenkey 1993 were investigated separately in theoretical models if both forced and free thermal convection are acting on a flow system the complex phenomenon is referred to as a mixed thermal convection e g cserepes and lenkey 2004 yang et al 2010 etc in this case the non dimensional rayleigh number cannot be used alone to describe the dynamics of the flow system in a previous synthetic simulation study szijártó et al 2019 revealed that appearance of time dependent mixed thermal convection in a flow system depends on the non dimensional rayleigh and the modified péclet number as functions of the model geometry the permeability anisotropy the water table slope and the geothermal gradient although higher geothermal gradients zt 30 c km can facilitate the concurrent existence of heat advection and thermal buoyancy a controversial question has remained partly open can mixed thermal convection evolve in real groundwater flow systems and if so under what circumstances effects of heat transport mechanisms have already been investigated in different types of aquifers using numerical simulations and field observation data a regional scale conductive transfer mechanism for example was shown in the deeper parts of the german molasse basin przybycin et al 2017 however the role of heat advection is more significant in highly permeable sediments in the siliciclastic aquifers of the rheingraben mainly topography driven forced thermal convection was suggested by clauser and villinger 1990 in the north german basin forced thermal convection was shown to drive the flow in the near surface aquifers while the additional effect of free thermal convection caused only local scale temperature anomalies in thick sediments kaiser et al 2011 2013 noack et al 2013 evidence for thermal convection was presented in the deep confined carbonate aquifer of the po plain italy pasquale et al 2013 in the deep carbonate platform of luttelgeest in the netherlands lipsey

lake chad basin where the blocks of the basin are separated by faults nevertheless the intensity and the location of mixed thermal convection is influenced to varying degrees by faults fractures e g

in different evolutionary stages of the btk based on simplified geology from the late miocene to present time havril et al 2016 havril 2018 according to these studies time dependent mixed thermal convection was noticed in the earliest stage when the triassic carbonate was fully confined however comprehensive numerical simulations including coupled fluid flow and heat transport for the real hydrogeological settings have not yet been carried out in the region of the buda thermal karst system of hungary over the course of our numerical simulations the effects of three heat transport

at the ne edge of the dominantly mesozoic carbonate system of the transdanubian range it is situated within and in the surroundings of budapest the capital of hungary csepregi 2007 erőss et al 2012 mádl szőnyi et al 2017 the topography of the study area varies as it includes lowlands and highlands fig 1 the eastern region of the transdanubian range is the buda hills 559 masl to the west of the danube river on the opposite side of the river to the east the pest plain average elevation 210 masl and gödöllő hills 344 masl can be found fig 2 a the annual mean temperature is 9 5 10 c and annual

the second can be found between the danube and the gödöllő hills moreover the geology of these two half basins can be simplified into two main groups of hydrostratigraphic units 1 an unconfined

focused on the understanding of basin scale flow patterns and heat transport processes therefore the equivalent porous media epm approach was used e g long et al 1982 scanlon et al 2003 abusaada and sauter 2012 havril et al 2016 havril 2018 assuming isotropic hydraulic conductivity in all hydrostratigraphic units the water table configuration follows the elevation of the topography on the eastern

km in the buda thermal karst in order to quantify the surface heat transfer the results were compared to the conductive model by the non dimensional nusselt number e g white 1988 6 n u q t h s q c h s where qths and qchs are the total and the conductive heat flux on the surface respectively the side walls were assumed to be thermally insulated in the base model m1 the two dimensional model was discretized by triangular and non uniform finite elements fig 3b where the maximum element size was 100 m within the model domain which was reduced to 20 m along the outer boundaries the final mesh consisted of 201 799 finite elements within the elements the solution was approximated by quadratic and linear functions for darcy s law p and the heat transport equation t respectively although in the conductive and forced thermal convection models the numerical simulations produced steady state solutions the additional effect of thermal buoyancy resulted in transient groundwater flow and heat transport in the system e g kaiser et al 2011 havril et al 2016 przybycin 2017 havril 2018 szijártó et al 2019 a total simulation time of 300 kyr was used to ensure that the system reached a quasi stationary solution at the beginning of the simulations t 1 kyr the maximum time step increased exponentially but thereafter remained constant at 100 yr the time dependent calculation for a given model required approx 1 14 days cpu time and 10 20 gb memory on an intel 2 79 ghz processor based workstation with 24 cores 3 2 base simulation scenarios three main types of physical phenomena were examined to investigate the interaction of different driving forces in the btk hungary first only conductive heat transport simulation 1 s1 was studied in order to quantify the additional effects of advection and thermal buoyancy in the transport processes second the combined effect of topography driven groundwater flow and advective heat transport simulation 2 s2 was investigated forced thermal convection e g clauser and villinger 1990 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 an et al 2015 etc in the third run mixed thermal convection simulation 3 s3 caused by the interaction of forced and free thermal convection was simulated e g kaiser et al 2013 havril et al 2016 lopez et al 2016 havril 2018 etc where eqs 1 3 were fully coupled by the darcy flux q and the water density ρ w t p in this case the initial condition for the pressure was generated by the steady state solution of the purely topography driven groundwater flow equations eqs 1 and 2 with constant water density while the initial temperature distribution was defined by the solution of the conductive heat transport equation eq 3 without heat advection by the same token the artificial effects of the pre defined boundary conditions as well as the influence of hydraulically conductive faults and radiogenic heat production as natural effects were also tested in the numerical models 3 3 further model scenarios in addition to the investigation of the combined effect of driving forces further numerical calculations were carried out to reveal the importance of natural m2 m3 and artificial effects m4a 4c on regional groundwater flow patterns and temperature distribution in the numerical model these results were separately compared to the base model m1 eventually six models m1 4c were investigated in the cases of heat conduction s1 forced s2 and mixed thermal convection s3 table 3 thus a total of 18 simulations were carried out 3 3 1 hydraulically conductive faults in addition to the equivalent porous media epm approximation several methods have been established to study groundwater flow in fractured and karstified media including deterministic numerical models and some stochastic methods for developing fracture or pipe networks e g berre et al 2019 applying the hybrid conception berre et al 2019 darcy s law and the heat transport equation were also solved within the conductive faults fig 2c 7 q k f ρ w g t p ρ w g z 8 φ f ρ w c w 1 φ f ρ f c f t t ρ w c w q t t t φ f λ w 1 φ f λ f t t where t denotes the tangential derivation and the parameters characterizing the faults are listed in table 4 we assume that the hydraulic conductivity of the faults was higher by one order of magnitude than in the surrounding medium m2 therefore two different values were prescribed in the unconfined kf uc 10 4 m s and the confined kf c 10 7 m s part of the btk 3 3 2 radiogenic heat production the influence of radiogenic heat production was also considered in the numerical simulation m3 the values of radioactive heat production established for the cenozoic qr 1 0 1 5 μw m3 hs1 hs7 and the mesozoic qr 0 5 μw m3 layers hs8 hs11 fig 2 dövényi and horváth 1988 békési et al 2018 were integrated into the numerical model table 1 3 3 3 boundary conditions as bottom thermal boundary conditions either constant temperature tb or heat flux qhb are usually applied in numerical calculations in order to investigate the effects of the bottom thermal boundary on basin scale heat transport processes two other scenarios were studied a constant bottom heat flux qhb 100 mw m2 m4a and an internal condition m4b in the latter model an extra layer with a thickness of 2 km is set beneath the original model as a basement paleozoic metamorphic rock table 5 in this model the temperature of the isothermal bottom boundary was tb z 7000 masl 315 c the artificial influence of the side walls was also investigated using two scenarios a no flow insulated m1 and a hydrostatic pressure conductive temperature m4c boundary condition table 3 4 results and interpretation first results from the numerical solution of the base model s1 3 m1 are presented to highlight the role of the governing transport mechanisms of heat conduction forced and mixed thermal convection in the buda thermal karst btk second the effects of the hydraulically conductive faults m2 and radioactive heat production m3 on the temperature field and groundwater flow pattern are investigated finally the influence of artificial boundary conditions is studied m4a 4c 4 1 thermal conduction the pure conductive heat transport mechanism was first investigated in the two dimensional numerical model fig 4 in this simplest case heat flow is disturbed neither by advective heat transport due to water table variations nor by thermal buoyancy due to water density variation regarding the minor difference in thermal conductivities of the hydrostratigraphic units λ ma 1 8 2 6 w m k the simulated vertical temperature profile closely follows a linear distribution in the base model s1 m1 the average value of the total surface heat flux is qchs 80 86 mw m2 which is used as a standard for calculating the non dimensional nusselt number eq 6 4 2 forced thermal convection in the base model the influence of forced thermal convection s2 m1 which includes the superposition of the advective and the conductive heat transfer mechanisms on the temperature distribution is displayed in fig 5 a because of the isothermal boundary condition on the top of the model water enters the system at the temperature of ts 10 c in the areas with high water table elevation one of the most significant cooling effects is found beneath the unconfined karstified carbonate x 8 26 km where the cold water can directly infiltrate to 3 and 4 km deep and towards the discharge areas this effect is owing to the high hydraulic conductivity of the triassic aquifers hs8 hs9 hs10 and the high hydraulic gradient due to water table configuration h 130 masl on the eastern side of the model x 47 63 8 km the temperature distribution is also influenced by advective cooling due to the topography driven groundwater flow and the deep position of the low permeability hydrostratigraphic unit hs6 on the other hand a positive temperature anomaly evolves in the main discharge area near the danube river x 26 28 km where the thermal water approaches the top of the model at a temperature of t 70 80 c the conductive temperature field is less perturbed between x 0 and 8 km as well as between x 33 and 47 km where the intensity of the topography driven groundwater flow decreases with depth fig 5b in the steady state numerical model the magnitude of the darcy flux q varies within a range of 10 12 and 10 6 m s fig 5b due to the elevated fluid potential and the high hydraulic conductivity of the triassic aquifers hs8 hs9 hs10 the darcy flux in this area exceeds 10 9 m s the fluid potential maximum in the siliciclastic gödöllő hills induces intensive local groundwater flow in the upper part of the model x 48 51 km however the intensity of the groundwater flow is two orders of magnitude lower in the confining sedimentary cover hs1 hs2 hs5 hs6 hs7 and in the lower triassic and paleozoic aquitard hs11 compared to the triassic aquifers figs 2c and 5 b in the case of forced thermal convection s2 the hydraulic head distribution was calculated from the simulated pressure p according to the following formula 9 h f c p ρ w t s 10 c p g z using the pressure dependent water density at the surface temperature of ts 10 c fig 5c illustrates the hydraulic head distribution within a range of hfc 100 masl and 170 masl the groundwater flow pattern is characterized by streamlines moreover recharge r or discharge d zones are indicated with red and blue colors respectively non uniform and not magnitude controlled streamlines were used to visualize the groundwater direction in the entire model domain as a result of this steady state simulation three main groundwater systems evolve in the numerical model with two directions denoted by magenta from east to west and yellow from west to east on the western side a recharge area is noted from x 11 km 20 5 km where the cold water can infiltrate into the deeper parts due to the unconfined triassic carbonate with high hydraulic conductivity hs8 hs9 hs10 fig 2c from this recharge area two groundwater flow systems evolve which are separated by a divergent stagnation zone at x 14 km and at a depth of 5 km fig 5b c the entire eastern side of the model is identified as a recharge area where the surface water infiltrates moderately except for a valley in the gödöllő hills x 50 km where a relatively more intense local groundwater flow system forms beneath the main discharge area near the danube river the two groundwater flow systems originating from the west and the east are mixing through the total depth of the model fig 5c this indicates a convergent stagnation point these stagnation zones are consequences of the bottom boundary condition and they are revealed in fig 5b where the darcy flux decreases below q 10 11 m s as a result of the advective heat transport mechanism the non dimensional nusselt number increased to nu 1 66 i e the total surface heat flux increased by 66 compared to conductive heat flow and the calculated average recharge rate was r 157 mm yr in the base model s2 m1 4 3 mixed thermal convection in the third case the combined effect of the three transport mechanisms was studied in the base model s3 m1 heat conduction topography driven forced thermal convection and buoyancy driven free thermal convection were investigated as a fully coupled physical problem over the entire model domain the non dimensional rayleigh number e g nield and bejan 2017 exceeds its critical value ra 4700 racr 4π2 while the modified péclet number szijártó et al 2019 reaches pe 42 5 at these values time dependent mixed thermal convection is expected based on former theoretical model calculations szijártó et al 2019 which underlines the importance of thermal buoyancy forces in the btk system the influence of mixed thermal convection is displayed on the temperature distribution in fig 6 which shows temperature snapshots from t 100 300 kyr as a result of mixed thermal convection a time dependent flow system forms in the base model s3 m1 the change in temperature field fig 6a e indicates non stationary flow on the unconfined side significant advective cooling can be noticed within the range of x 7 km and 27 km in the triassic carbonates hs8 hs9 hs10 in fig 2c which overlaps with the results from the forced thermal convection model fig 5a however weaker plumes evolve from the bottom of the unconfined western side of the model which are swept towards the discharge area beneath the danube river thermal buoyancy is thus superimposed on forced thermal convection these plumes are able to reach the near surface region at the discharge area within a temperature range of t 40 60 c under the siliciclastic covers of the eastern side further convection cells develop in the triassic aquifer hs8 because of the lower hydraulic conductivities of the triassic paleozoic aquitard hs11 and the sedimentary covers hs2 hs5 hs6 hs7 a large hot upwelling forms beneath the pest plain x 33 48 km where the thermal water t 100 120 c moves directly toward the main discharge zone at the danube river this hot upwelling upheld by forced thermal convection remains in a stable position an animation in appendix b presents the time dependent behavior of the temperature field in mixed thermal convection system from t 150 300 kyr the distributions of the darcy flux and the hydraulic head with streamlines are illustrated in fig 7 at time t 300 kyr parallel to fig 6e the increased darcy flux shows the position of the hot plumes in the deeper part of the numerical model and in the hydrostratigraphic units with high hydraulic conductivities hs8 and hs7 fig 7a in the middle part of the model the location of groundwater flow mixing shifted east to x 41 km figs 6e and 7 b compared to the forced thermal convection model x 28 km figs 5a and 5 c the flow directions indicated by yellow display the penetration of recharging water from buda under the pest side time dependent stagnation zones q 10 11 m s evolve between the depths of 4 5 and 5 km the hydraulic head was calculated for the fully coupled mixed thermal convection model s3 using the temperature and pressure dependent water density 10 h m c p ρ w t p g z the high anomalies in hydraulic heads hmc 400 masl are the consequences of the significant density decrease in the thermal boundary layer and in the stable large hot upwellings fig 7b we note that hmc includes the temperature dependence of water density while hfc in eq 9 is calculated from constant temperature ts 10 c the analyses of the time series for different models s3 are shown over a time interval of t 0 300 kyr in fig 8 where the base model m1 is illustrated by a black line after the transient behavior of the system t 150 kyr when the initial conductive temperature field was strongly modified by the mixed heat transfer mechanism the monitoring parameters tended to a quasi stationary solution with a characteristic time period of approx τ 10 100 kyr fig 8 as a result of the additional free thermal convection s3 m1 the non dimensional nusselt number nu varied between 3 5 and 5 5 while the calculated recharge rate r was within a range of r 235 mm yr and 265 mm yr in appendix a supplementary data the time dependence of the temperature field and hydraulic head distribution is illustrated at 8 near surface probe points as a result a longer τi 40 50 kyr and a shorter characteristic time scale τii 1 2 kyr were noticed from the examined temperature and hydraulic head time series the animation of the temperature field can improve the understanding of the characteristic behavior of mixed thermal convection appendix b supplementary data the results for model 1 in fig 9 show the time averaged value of the nusselt number and the recharge rate in the cases of pure heat conduction blue s1 forced green s2 and mixed thermal convection red s3 the recharge rate was normalized by the estimated annual recharge r r in the base model s3 m1 the intensive hot upwellings induced an enhanced heat flux on the surface thus the nusselt number was almost three times greater than that under forced thermal convection nu 1 66 in the cases of forced s2 m1 and mixed thermal convection s3 m1 the normalized recharge rates r r were 54 and 85 respectively fig 9b based on these numerical results the existence of free thermal convection can be expected in the buda thermal karst due to the high geothermal gradient and hydraulic conductivity of the triassic aquifers hs8 hs9 hs10 and the reduced water table slope fig 2 time dependent mixed thermal convection developed in the base model s3 m1 fig 8 where hot plumes were continuously evolving from the thermal boundary layer ascend and are swept towards the regional discharge area fig 6e 4 4 further model scenarios 4 4 1 effects of hydraulically conductive faults in the heterogeneous base model m1 an equivalent porous media epm approximation was applied in the homogeneous isotropic hydrostratigraphic units table 1 this model was modified to a hybrid model m2 in order to investigate the effect of hydraulically conductive faults on the groundwater flow system fig 2c because of the large difference between the characteristic length scale of the flow system l 2 32 km and the thickness of the conductive faults df 5 m this modification does not induce notable changes in the temperature fig 10 a and the darcy flux distribution fig 11 a compared to the base model s3 m1 figs 6e and 7 a in the case of forced thermal convection s2 m2 the non dimensional nusselt number decreased by 7 fig 9 with mixed thermal convection the non dimensional nusselt number increased by 21 while the normalized recharge rate decreased by 10 compared to the base model s3 m1 the movement of hot upwellings is facilitated by hydraulically and thus thermally conductive faults towards the near surface zone which can locally influence the extent of the recharge and the discharge areas consequently the conductive faults are also able to influence the heat flux and the recharge rate fig 9 but this impact seems insignificant on the regional scale temperature and darcy flux fields figs 10a and 11 a 4 4 2 effects of radiogenic heat production an additional numerical model scenario was developed to investigate the effect of radiogenic heat production table 1 in the heat conduction model the surface heat flux increases by only 2 mw m2 due to this added heat production mechanism s1 m3 in the forced thermal convection model s2 m3 neither the nusselt number nor the recharge rate are disturbed by the additional effect of radiogenic heat compared to the base model fig 9 apparent variations due to buoyancy forces cannot be noticed qualitatively in the temperature and the darcy flux in figs 10b and 11 b respectively s3 m3 the changes in the time averaged value of the nusselt number and the normalized recharge rate remains below 2 fig 9 which is also shown by the time series in fig 8 in general the additional effect of the radiogenic heat production is negligible 4 4 3 effects of boundary conditions in this part differences in the numerical results due to the boundary conditions are investigated compared to the base model having an isothermal bottom boundary tb 225 c in model 4a a constant heat flux of qhb 100 mw m2 was prescribed along the bottom boundary in the cases of heat conduction s1 m4a and forced thermal convection s2 m4a the non dimensional nusselt number increased by 24 compared to the conductive base model s1 m1 fig 9 owing to the ratio of bottom heat fluxes qhb qchs 100 80 86 1 237 focusing on the mixed convection simulations the discrepancy between model 1 fig 6e and model 4a fig 10c is the lack of the bottom thermal boundary layer thus the temperature significantly decreases in the triassic and lower paleozoic aquitard hs11 although the additional effect of free thermal convection weakens the main hot upwellings stay in stable positions in the deeper parts of the model domain the change in the bottom thermal boundary condition resulted in 64 and 28 drops in the nusselt number and the recharge rate respectively due to the less intensive heat transport in model 4a s3 m4a in addition an internal thermal boundary condition was tested by a lower quasi impermeable domain with a thickness of 2 km in order to reveal the influence of assuming that neither the temperature nor the heat flux is constant at a depth of 5 km although a strong thermal boundary layer is not formed along the bottom of model 4b fig 10d the thermal anomalies become stronger in the deeper regions compared to model 4a fig 10c this internal thermal boundary condition is therefore between the two types of conventionally applied boundary conditions constant temperature fig 6e and constant heat flux fig 10c compared to the base model s3 m1 the nusselt number is reduced by 8 and 42 in the advective s2 m4b and in the fully coupled s3 m4b heat transfer simulations respectively fig 9a furthermore the normalized recharge rate r r decreased by 11 permitting free thermal convection s3 m4b fig 9b finally the influence of the side walls as a no flow thermally insulated fig 6e versus a hydrostatic pressure conductive temperature boundary condition fig 10e was investigated table 3 these conditions are consistent with the initial thermal and flow fields in the case of mixed thermal convection s3 m1 the no flow thermally insulated boundary condition stabilizes the flow and the temperature field near the walls so upwelling hot plumes are facilitated fig 6e however the hydrostatic pressure conductive temperature condition s3 m4c allows groundwater flow through the side walls figs 10e and 11 e thus the vertical boundary conditions of model 4c do not favor any upwellings along the side walls fig 10e in contrast to model 1 figs 6e and 7 a in this case the applied boundary conditions influence the temperature and darcy flux distribution in the vicinity approx 5 km of the side walls the time series of nu and r are illustrated in fig 8 by magenta curves which do not significantly deviate from the base model black in this scenario s3 m4c the time averaged value of the nusselt number decreased by 11 while the normalized recharge rate decreased by 1 5 compared to the base model s3 m1 fig 9 consequently the studied boundary conditions affect the flow and the temperature field near the side walls nevertheless independently of the investigated boundary conditions along the bottom and the side walls time dependent mixed thermal convection evolved in each numerical model 5 discussion in this study a finite element numerical method was applied to understand the basin scale flow system and temperature distribution for an area with complex geology in cases of three coherent heat transport mechanisms which were 1 heat conduction s1 2 forced thermal convection s2 i e advective and conductive heat transport mechanisms and 3 mixed thermal convection s3 i e conduction and advection with thermal buoyancy based on our numerical results presented above the existence of free thermal convection superimposed on forced thermal convection cannot be excluded from the transport mechanism in the buda thermal karst btk system of hungary three vertical temperature t z profiles were extracted from the base model m1 and compared to well observation data during the application of the basin scale data evaluation method e g tóth 2009 three interpreted temperature profiles telki danube isaszeg were presented by máld szőnyi et al 2019 and mádl szőnyi 2019 in the different parts of the btk figs 4 5a and 6 e show the position of the t z profiles where the centres of the interpreted areas were at x 6 km telki x 28 km danube and x 56 km isaszeg in fig 12 the simulated and measured temperatures are illustrated with the calculated geothermal gradients the reliable measured temperature data are above the elevation of z 1500 masl so the geothermal gradients from the numerical models ztn and from the observations ztm are presented only within this interval profiles obtained from the conduction forced and mixed thermal convection models s1 s2 s3 m1 are denoted by blue green and red colors respectively first the numerical results and the measured temperature data were compared beneath the telki x 6 km observation area fig 12a d g although the geothermal gradient calculated by the measured data z tm 39 4 c km is close to a conductive temperature profile z tnc 46 c km fig 12a a discharge area was noticed in the cases of both forced fig 5c and mixed thermal convection fig 7b the purely advective heat transport cases s2 m1 induce an increase in the geothermal gradient near the surface ztnf 1 z 140 masl 66 9 c km and a decrease between the elevation of z 140 masl and 970 masl ztnf 2 140 masl z 970 masl 14 3 c km fig 12d beneath the elevation of z 1000 masl the geothermal gradient changed to close to the conductive value in the case of mixed thermal convection s3 m1 the simulated geothermal gradients seem to be exaggerated compared to the observations fig 12g second the temperature profiles were compared beneath the danube river fig 12b e h the measured temperature data are much higher than the results from the conductive model simulation s1 m1 fig 12b and the difference in the geothermal gradients reaches 10 c km near the surface the geothermal gradient obtained from the advective numerical simulation s2 m1 increased above the elevation of z 640 masl due to topography driven forced thermal convection fig 12e the forced convection case is also characterized by a steady state hot upwelling beneath the regional discharge area fig 5a however the negative geothermal gradient obtained from temperature observations between z 830 masl and 1150 masl can be interpreted only by the existence of time dependent free thermal convection s3 m3 with inclined hot plumes fig 12h in this case the location of the groundwater mixing zone was shifted toward the confined part by approx 10 15 km fig 7b this model result coincides with previous studies in which the temperature and the geochemical properties of springs were analysed in the btk mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádl szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi 2019 máld szőnyi et al 2019 erőss 2010 erőss et al 2012 etc third the temperatures from the numerical simulations and from the observations were compared beneath isaszeg x 56 km fig 12c f and i to examine the effect of heat transport processes in a typical recharge area the numerical simulations showed a considerable cooling effect of advective heat transport figs 5a and 6 e which overwrote the initial conductive temperature distribution fig 4 however a noticeable correspondence between the simulated ztnc 1 44 9 c km and the measured ztm 1 49 3 c km geothermal gradients was found in the case of pure heat conduction fig 12c therefore a less intensive groundwater flow component can be established under the eastern confined part of the buda thermal karst system owing to for instance the higher hydraulic anisotropy of the cenozoic layers finally a two dimensional temperature field was calculated from the geothermal database of hungary dövényi 1994 along a section fig 1c to display the measured temperature data the measured temperature data were projected using a space interval with a width of 10 km fig 1c a gaussian regression interpolation method was applied on the temperature data with different locations and elevations 200 masl z 1500 masl in order to set up a two dimensional temperature section fig 13 on the western side of the temperature section x 10 km a significant cooling effect due to advective heat transport is noted above the elevation of z 750 masl a large scale heating effect of forced or mixed thermal convection was noted beneath the regional discharge area the danube river 24 km x 33 km fig 13b there the negative temperature anomaly might also have evolved due to the time dependent mixed thermal convection which was suggested by the numerical simulations on the eastern side of the studied section x 40 km a shallow advective cooling effect is identified z 400 masl which changes to a mainly conductive temperature field with depth due to the possible anisotropy of the miocene aquifers hs1 and hs2 garamhegyi et al 2020 in addition a former study which focused on changes in the temperature field and flow pattern using a simplified geology of the btk from the late miocene to present day revealed periodic temperature oscillations in the groundwater flow system within a range of 15 kyr and 40 kyr havril 2018 according to a comprehensive field observation and description and subsequent petrographic mineralogic and isotopic analyses of speleothems in the caves of btk water level fluctuations and groundwater temperatures were reconstructed for the last 500 kyr virág 2019 the position and different forms of calcite rafts cave popcorns and cauliflower coatings revealed a water table rise of 5 7 m in the period of 300 280 kyr ago simultaneously the carbonate precipitates indicated an increase in groundwater temperature from 28 c to 48 c then a gradual decline of the water table 10 m and cooling of groundwater 30 c were recorded by the speleothems in the following 130 kyr the time dependent quasi periodic behavior of mixed thermal convection might be one of the feasible explanations for the mentioned observations in the buda thermal karst appendix a and b supplementary data 6 summary and conclusions finite element numerical simulations were performed to investigate the role of heat conduction advection and thermal buoyancy as physical mechanisms in the groundwater flow system and temperature distribution of the well studied area of the buda thermal karst of hungary in addition to three basic scenarios s1 3 m1 five further models m2 m4c were tested to study the additional effects of natural phenomena and of the effects the boundary conditions table 3 in the discussion the results from the numerical simulations were compared to measured temperatures in wells the non dimensional nusselt number nu and the recharge rate r were calculated to compare the results from different numerical models compared to conductive models advective heat transport increased the total heat flux on the surface shown by the nusselt number nu 1 23 1 69 in the base model m1 significant cooling effects were noticed due to topography driven advective heat transfer beneath the recharge area of the western part but this effect was less evident in the eastern part of the numerical model at the main regional discharge area which is located near the danube river a steady state hot upwelling plume approaches the surface within a temperature range of t 70 c and 80 c this result is consistent with the balneological features around budapest where several thermal spas have been established which are characterized by these highest temperatures in the steady state solutions the calculated recharge rate was constant r 157 mm yr which is approximately half of the maximum recharge rate estimated from precipitation r r 54 the superimposed effect of thermal buoyancy was evident from the non dimensional rayleigh and the modified péclet numbers which were estimated at ra 4700 and at pe 42 5 respectively szijártó et al 2019 owing to the fully coupled mixed thermal convection the numerical simulation led to a time dependent quasi stationary t 150 kyr and weakly periodic solution the time dependence of the temperature field and hydraulic head was investigated in the supplementary data appendix a the complementary effect of free thermal convection facilitated the evolution of hot upwelling from the thermal boundary layer which intensified the heat and the mass flux compared to advective heat transport thus the nusselt number varied between nu 1 56 and 5 25 while the recharge rate was within a range of r 178 mm yr r r 61 s3 m4a and 250 mm yr 86 s3 m1 fig 9 by means of accessory scenarios we investigated the effect of hydraulically conductive faults m2 and radiogenic heat production within the hydrostratigraphic units m3 as a conclusion the studied natural features induce mainly local anomalies in the numerical model their influence on the basin scale groundwater flow pattern and the temperature field is not significant in the btk finally we tested the artificial effects of the boundary conditions prescribed along the bottom m4a m4b and the side walls m4c it was established that neither the constant bottom temperature nor the constant heat flux is a perfect condition to imitate the nature of the real system using an internal thermal condition m4b might be an appropriate method to minimize the artificial effect of the bottom boundary conditions the studied boundary condition on the side walls can affect the temperature field and the flow pattern m4c especially near the boundaries however this effect causes only marginal changes in the main part of the numerical model based on the comparison of the numerical results and the observation data dövényi 1994 mádl szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi 2019 a weak shallow advective cooling effect is produced on the recharge area of the confined eastern side of the btk fig 13 however the main heat transport mechanism is conductive due to the anisotropy of the miocene hydrostratigraphic units which can moderate the vertical flow in the deeper zones z 400 masl beneath the danube river a clear appearance of the advective heat transfer mechanism is noticed which was also supported by previous conceptional models and geochemical interpretations mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádl szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi 2019 máld szőnyi et al 2019 erőss 2010 erőss et al 2012 etc nevertheless the superimposed buoyancy forces seem to be strong enough to induce time dependent mixed thermal convection the calculated geothermal gradients fig 12 the negative temperature anomaly beneath the danube river due to inclined hot plumes fig 13 can be explained by the additional effect of free thermal convection in addition the quasi periodic changes in both the temperature field and the hydraulic head distribution appendix a supplementary data might explain the temperature and water level fluctuations observed from speleothems in caves of btk virág 2019 in this basin scale simulation the cave systems and the preferential flow patterns caused by karstification which are mainly located in the near surface area were neglected however the manifestations of karsification processes can be significant in local scale flow systems the isotropic approach is appropriate in the hydraulically conductive triassic aquifers hs8 hs10 using the epm approximation as a limitation of the model the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity was neglected in the neogene oligocene and eocene hydrostratigraphic units hs1 hs7 however the changes in hydraulic conductivities were examined in appendix a supplementary data clearly the numerical model outcomes substantial uncertainties caused due to e g the unknown physical properties of the hydrostratigraphic units as the most hydrogeological models do mishra et al 2009 foglia et al 2013 song et al 2015 etc although accomplishing a global sensitivity analysis gsa was not the purpose of the paper influence of the hydraulic and the thermal conductivity was examined on the temperature field and on the monitoring parameters it was established that the numerical results are influenced by the changes in hydraulic k and thermal λ conductivities nevertheless mixed thermal convection evolved in each numerical model within a range of analysed parameters appendix a supplementary data this study draws attention to the importance of different driving forces of groundwater flow especially in deep carbonate sequences and adjoining sedimentary basins such as the buda thermal karst of hungary globally this hydrogeological situation is not unique as many other systems are also characterized by similar geological settings for

8253,study region buda thermal karst system hungary study focus the pilot area has high geothermal potential characterized by prominent thermal anomalies such as thermal springs and spas which tap the triassic carbonate aquifers therefore numerical simulations were carried out to examine the temperature field and flow pattern considering three successive heat transport mechanisms thermal conduction forced and mixed thermal convection in order to highlight the role of different driving forces of groundwater flow in the buda thermal karst new hydrological insights for the region compared to thermal conduction topography driven heat advection increases the surface heat flux the superimposed effect of free thermal convection facilitates the formation of time dependent mixed thermal convection from the deep carbonate layers the nusselt number varied between nu 1 56 and 5 25 while the recharge rate r ranged from r 178 mm yr to 250 mm yr radiogenic heat production and hydraulically conductive faults have only a minor influence on the basin scale temperature field and flow pattern boundary conditions prescribed on the temperature and pressure can considerably affect the numerical

karst system keywords heat transport mechanisms mixed thermal convection time dependent thermal convection deep carbonate system finite element numerical modeling 1 introduction today renewable energy is of interest for supplying electrical and heating cooling demands due to decreasing fossil resources and increasing greenhouse gases in general deep or shallow power plants borehole heat exchangers bhes enhanced geothermal systems egss and numerous other techniques are used to develop and exploit geothermal energy for the optimal operation of these systems the effects of various heat transport mechanisms in the subsurface must be understood e g arola et al 2014 however using the local scale approximation might not always be an adequate method to study groundwater flow and heat transport mechanisms for instance in the case of a regional scale aquifer system basin scale groundwater flow can be induced by the combined effect of different driving forces including water table

modeling was used to focus on the interaction of topography and thermal buoyancy driven groundwater flow while the effects of other driving forces were not considered in the evaluation of heat transport processes the role of topography driven heat advection forced thermal convection e g domenico and palciauskas 1973 an et al 2015 and thermal buoyancy free thermal convection e g lapwood 1948 lenkey 1993 were investigated separately in theoretical models if both forced and free thermal convection are acting on a flow system the complex phenomenon is referred to as a mixed thermal convection e g cserepes and lenkey 2004 yang et al 2010 etc in this case the non dimensional rayleigh number cannot be used alone to describe the dynamics of the flow system in a previous synthetic simulation study szijártó et al 2019 revealed that appearance of time dependent mixed thermal convection in a flow system depends on the non dimensional rayleigh and the modified péclet number as functions of the model geometry the permeability anisotropy the water table slope and the geothermal gradient although higher geothermal gradients zt 30 c km can facilitate the concurrent existence of heat advection and thermal buoyancy a controversial question has remained partly open can mixed thermal convection evolve in real groundwater flow systems and if so under what circumstances effects of heat transport mechanisms have already been investigated in different types of aquifers using numerical simulations and field observation data a regional scale conductive transfer mechanism for example was shown in the deeper parts of the german molasse basin przybycin et al 2017 however the role of heat advection is more significant in highly permeable sediments in the siliciclastic aquifers of the rheingraben mainly topography driven forced thermal convection was suggested by clauser and villinger 1990 in the north german basin forced thermal convection was shown to drive the flow in the near surface aquifers while the additional effect of free thermal convection caused only local scale temperature anomalies in thick sediments kaiser et al 2011 2013 noack et al 2013 evidence for thermal convection was presented in the deep confined carbonate aquifer of the po plain italy pasquale et al 2013 in the deep carbonate platform of luttelgeest in the netherlands lipsey et al 2016 and in the geothermal carbonate reservoir of hainaut in belgium licour 2014 the existence of mixed thermal convection was revealed by lopez et al 2016 in the siliciclastic formation of the lake chad basin where the blocks of the basin are separated by faults nevertheless the intensity and the location of mixed thermal convection is influenced to varying degrees by faults fractures e g yang et al 2004 malkovsky and magri 2016 przybycin et al 2017 and by the hydrogeological geothermal properties e g dobson et al 2003 the flow processes of the buda thermal karst btk system in hungary

found in thermal springs of the study area erőss 2010 erőss et al 2012 in addition to the significant effect of forced thermal convection an important contribution of free thermal convection was also proposed in the conceptual model of mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 thermal convection was assumed important due to 1 the thickness of the carbonate aquifers 500 3000 m goldscheider et al 2010 mádl szőnyi

fluctuation in thermal water level in the caves of the btk virág 2019 as a next step transient modeling was carried out to investigate the groundwater flow patterns and the temperature distributions in different evolutionary stages of the btk based on simplified geology from the late miocene to present time havril et al 2016 havril 2018 according to these studies time dependent mixed thermal convection was noticed in the earliest stage when the triassic carbonate was fully confined however comprehensive numerical simulations including coupled fluid flow and heat transport for the real hydrogeological settings have not yet been carried out in the region of the buda thermal karst system of hungary over the course of our numerical simulations the effects of three heat transport mechanisms on the groundwater flow pattern and the temperature distribution in the btk were investigated using real hydrostratigraphic settings 1 heat conduction 2 forced convection and 3 mixed thermal convection further scenarios were also set up to examine the effect of hydraulically conductive faults radiogenic heat production and boundary conditions on the temperature and fluid flow distribution the recharge rate and the non dimensional nusselt number were calculated during the simulations in order to compare the numerical model with the measured precipitation and surface heat flux finally the results of the numerical simulations were discussed and compared with the observed temperature data dövényi 1994 using the approach suggested by mádl szőnyi 2019 and other flow

at the ne edge of the dominantly mesozoic carbonate system of the transdanubian range it is situated within and in the surroundings of budapest the capital of hungary csepregi 2007 erőss et al 2012 mádl szőnyi et al 2017 the topography of the study area varies as it includes lowlands and highlands fig 1 the eastern region of the transdanubian range is the buda hills 559 masl to the west of the danube river on the opposite side of the river to the east the pest plain average elevation 210 masl and gödöllő hills 344 masl can be found fig 2 a the annual mean temperature is 9 5 10 c and annual rainfall is 500 600 mm marosi and somogyi 1990 mersich et al 2003 the geometry of the simulated area is separated into two opposing half basins the first is located to the west of the danube river and the second can be found between the danube and the gödöllő hills moreover the geology of these two half basins can be simplified into two main groups of hydrostratigraphic units 1 an unconfined mesozoic mainly triassic carbonate sequence which is downfaulted and extends to the east and becomes 2 confined with a thick neogene siliciclastic sedimentary cover haas 1988 2013 haas et al 2000 2014 fodor 2011 fig 2 for the goals of the numerical simulations the complex geology and different lithological units were converted to 11 hydrostratigraphic units hs on the basis of a priori data and previous studies these units were characterized by the necessary input physical parameters for the simulations fig 2b and c bodri 1981 dövényi and horváth 1988 rman and tóth 2011 t jam project mádl

focused on the understanding of basin scale flow patterns and heat transport processes therefore the equivalent porous media epm approach was used e g long et al 1982 scanlon et al 2003 abusaada and sauter 2012 havril et al 2016 havril 2018 assuming isotropic hydraulic conductivity in all hydrostratigraphic units the water table configuration follows the elevation of the topography on the eastern side of the area while it is characterized by the karst water level on the western unconfined side thus the maxima of the water table elevation are 130 masl and 170 masl in the buda hills and in the gödöllő hills respectively máld szőnyi et al 2019 mádl szőnyi 2019 the margin of the groundwater flow system is designated by the danube river which determines the regional minimum of the fluid potential h 100 masl in the study area fig 2c the flow field is influenced and modified by normal reverse and strike slip faults both in the carbonates and the clastics fodor 2011 erhardt et al 2017 máld szőnyi et al 2019 3 numerical model 3 1 model description the two dimensional coupled fluid and heat transport simulations were carried out using the comsol multiphysics finite element simulation platform version 5 2a zimmermann 2006 in order to investigate the interaction of different driving forces in the buda thermal karst btk system the groundwater problem is described by the partial differential equation system including mass conservation darcy s law and the heat transport equation e g nield and bejan 2017 which are given by 1 φ ρ w t ρ w q 0 2 q k ρ w g p ρ w g z 3 φ ρ w c w 1 φ ρ m a c m a t t ρ w c w q t φ λ w 1 φ λ m a t q r where q p and t are the unknown darcy flux pressure and temperature respectively the physical parameters of the hydrostratigraphic units are listed in table 1 while other model parameters are set out in table 2 although the uncertainties in the applied parameters can affect the results of the numerical simulations mishra et al 2009 foglia et al 2013 song et al 2015 a global sensitivity analysis of input parameters cannot be carried out within the framework of the current study nevertheless a simplified sensitivity analysis for the hydraulic and thermal conductivities is presented in appendix a supplementary data the water density ρ w t p depends on the temperature and the pressure magri 2009 the geometry of the numerical model is shown in fig 3 a thickness d 5100 5170 m width l 63 8 km including the boundary conditions applied in the base model model 1 m1 the upper boundary condition for the flow system is a steady state water table configuration hwt dirichlet type which was defined based on tomographic potentiometric fluid potential maps obtained from observation data máld szőnyi et al 2019 mádl szőnyi 2019 in order to validate the numerical results the calculated recharge rate r was compared to the estimated annual recharge r defined by sehgal 1973 in inch yr 4 r 2 5 p 0 6 where p 21 6 inch yr 550 mm yr denotes the annual precipitation mersich et al 2003 it results in the maximum value of the annual recharge r 11 47 inch yr 291 mm yr which was used as an upper limit during the simulations in this study the recharge rate was calculated along the top of the numerical model given by 5 r q z q z 0 d x q z 0 d x where qz denotes the vertical darcy flux the line integration was carried out on the recharge area of the model surface where the vertical component of the darcy flux points downward qz 0 in the base model m1 the boundary conditions for flow were no flow on the sides and bottom boundaries fig 3a for the goals of the heat transport simulations isothermal boundaries m1 were described on the top ts 10 c and along the bottom tb 225 c in agreement with the average value of the geothermal gradient zt 45 c km in the buda thermal karst in order to quantify the surface heat transfer the results were compared to the conductive model by the non dimensional nusselt number e g white 1988 6 n u q t h s q c h s where qths and qchs are the total and the conductive heat flux on the surface respectively the side walls were assumed to be thermally insulated in the base model m1 the two dimensional model was discretized by triangular and non uniform finite elements fig 3b where the maximum element size was 100 m within the model domain which was reduced to 20 m along the outer boundaries the final mesh consisted of 201 799 finite elements within the elements the solution was approximated by quadratic and linear functions for darcy s law p and the heat transport equation t respectively although in the conductive and forced thermal convection models the numerical simulations produced steady state solutions the additional effect of thermal buoyancy resulted in transient groundwater flow and heat transport in the system e g kaiser et al 2011 havril et al 2016 przybycin 2017 havril 2018 szijártó et al 2019 a total simulation time of 300 kyr was used to ensure that the system reached a quasi stationary solution at the beginning of the simulations t 1 kyr the maximum time step increased exponentially but thereafter remained constant at 100 yr the time dependent calculation for a given model required approx 1 14 days cpu time and 10 20 gb memory on an intel 2 79 ghz processor based workstation with 24 cores 3 2 base simulation scenarios three main types of physical phenomena were examined to investigate the interaction of different driving forces in the btk hungary first only conductive heat transport simulation 1 s1 was studied in order to quantify the additional effects of advection and thermal buoyancy in the transport processes second the combined effect of topography driven groundwater flow and advective heat transport simulation 2 s2 was investigated forced thermal convection e g clauser and villinger 1990 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 an et al 2015 etc in the third run mixed thermal convection simulation 3 s3 caused by the interaction of forced and free thermal convection was simulated e g kaiser et al 2013 havril et al 2016 lopez et al 2016 havril 2018 etc where eqs 1 3 were fully coupled by the darcy flux q and the water density ρ w t p in this case the initial condition for the pressure was generated by the steady state solution of the purely topography driven groundwater flow equations eqs 1 and 2 with constant water density while the initial temperature distribution was defined by the solution of the conductive heat transport equation eq 3 without heat advection by the same token the artificial effects of the pre defined boundary conditions as well as the influence of hydraulically conductive faults and radiogenic heat production as natural effects were also tested in the numerical models 3 3 further model scenarios in addition to the investigation of the combined effect of driving forces further numerical calculations were carried out to reveal the importance of natural m2 m3 and artificial effects m4a 4c on regional groundwater flow patterns and temperature distribution in the numerical model these results were separately compared to the base model m1 eventually six models m1 4c were investigated in the cases of heat conduction s1 forced s2 and mixed thermal convection s3 table 3 thus a total of 18 simulations were carried out 3 3 1 hydraulically conductive faults in addition to the equivalent porous media epm approximation several methods have been established to study groundwater flow in fractured and karstified media including deterministic numerical models and some stochastic methods for developing fracture or pipe networks e g berre et al 2019 applying the hybrid conception berre et al 2019 darcy s law and the heat transport equation were also solved within the conductive faults fig

table 4 we assume that the hydraulic conductivity of the faults was higher by one order of magnitude than in the surrounding medium m2 therefore two different values were prescribed in the unconfined kf uc 10 4 m s and the confined kf c 10 7 m s part of the btk 3 3 2 radiogenic heat production the influence of radiogenic heat production was also considered in the numerical simulation m3 the values of radioactive heat production established for the cenozoic qr 1 0 1 5 μw m3 hs1 hs7 and the mesozoic qr 0 5 μw m3 layers hs8 hs11 fig 2 dövényi and horváth 1988 békési et al 2018 were integrated into the numerical model table 1 3 3 3 boundary conditions as bottom thermal boundary conditions either constant temperature tb or heat flux qhb are usually applied in numerical calculations in order to investigate the effects of the bottom thermal boundary on basin scale heat transport processes two other scenarios were studied a constant bottom heat flux qhb 100 mw m2 m4a and an internal condition m4b in the latter model an extra layer with a thickness of 2 km is set beneath the original model as a basement paleozoic metamorphic rock table 5 in this model the temperature of the isothermal bottom boundary was tb z 7000 masl 315 c the artificial influence of the side walls was also investigated using two scenarios a no flow insulated m1 and a hydrostatic pressure conductive temperature m4c boundary condition table 3 4 results and interpretation first results from the numerical solution of the base model s1 3 m1 are presented to highlight the role of the governing transport mechanisms of heat conduction forced and mixed thermal convection in the buda thermal karst btk second the effects of the hydraulically conductive faults m2 and radioactive heat production m3 on the temperature field and groundwater flow pattern are investigated finally the influence of artificial boundary conditions is studied m4a 4c 4 1 thermal conduction the pure conductive heat transport mechanism was first investigated in the two dimensional numerical model fig 4 in this simplest case heat flow is disturbed neither by advective heat transport due to water table variations nor by thermal buoyancy due to water density variation regarding the minor difference in thermal conductivities of the hydrostratigraphic units λ ma 1 8 2 6 w m k the simulated vertical temperature profile closely follows a linear distribution in the base model s1 m1 the average value of the total surface heat flux is qchs 80 86 mw m2 which is used as a standard for calculating the non dimensional nusselt number eq 6 4 2 forced thermal convection in the base model the influence of forced thermal convection s2 m1 which includes the superposition of the advective and the conductive heat transfer mechanisms on the temperature distribution is displayed in fig 5 a because of the isothermal boundary condition on the top of the model water enters the system at the temperature of ts 10 c in the areas with high water table elevation one of the most significant cooling effects is found beneath the unconfined karstified carbonate x 8 26 km where the cold water can directly infiltrate to 3 and 4 km deep and towards the discharge areas this effect is owing to the high hydraulic conductivity of the triassic aquifers hs8 hs9 hs10 and the high hydraulic gradient due to water table configuration h 130 masl on the eastern side of the model x 47 63 8 km the temperature distribution is also influenced by advective cooling due to the topography driven groundwater flow and the deep position of the low permeability hydrostratigraphic unit hs6 on the other hand a positive temperature anomaly evolves in the main discharge area near the danube river x 26 28 km where the thermal water approaches the top of the model at a temperature of t 70 80 c the conductive temperature field is less perturbed between x 0 and 8 km as well as between x 33 and 47 km where the intensity of the topography driven groundwater flow decreases with depth fig 5b in the steady state numerical model the magnitude of the darcy flux q varies within a range of 10 12 and 10 6 m s fig 5b due to the elevated fluid potential and the high hydraulic conductivity of the triassic aquifers hs8 hs9 hs10 the darcy flux in this area exceeds 10 9 m s the fluid potential maximum in the siliciclastic gödöllő hills induces intensive local groundwater flow in the upper part of the model x 48 51 km however the intensity of the groundwater flow is two orders of magnitude lower in the confining sedimentary cover hs1 hs2 hs5 hs6 hs7 and in the lower triassic and paleozoic aquitard hs11 compared to the triassic aquifers figs 2c and 5 b in the case of forced thermal convection s2 the hydraulic head distribution was calculated from the simulated pressure p according to the following formula 9 h f c p ρ w t s 10 c p g z using the pressure dependent water density at the surface temperature of ts 10 c fig 5c illustrates the hydraulic head distribution within a range of hfc 100 masl and 170 masl the groundwater flow pattern is characterized by streamlines moreover recharge r or discharge d zones are indicated with red and blue colors respectively non uniform and not magnitude controlled streamlines were used to visualize the groundwater direction in the entire model domain as a result of this steady state simulation three main groundwater systems evolve in the numerical model with two directions denoted by magenta from east to west and yellow from west to east on the western side a recharge area is noted from x 11 km 20 5 km where the cold water can infiltrate into the deeper parts due to the unconfined triassic carbonate with high hydraulic conductivity hs8 hs9 hs10 fig 2c from this recharge area two groundwater flow systems evolve which are separated by a divergent stagnation zone at x 14 km and at a depth of 5 km fig 5b c the entire eastern side of the model is identified as a recharge area where the surface water infiltrates moderately except for a valley in the gödöllő hills x 50 km where a relatively more intense local groundwater flow system forms beneath the main discharge area near the danube river the two groundwater flow systems originating from the west and the east are mixing through the total depth of the model fig 5c this indicates a convergent stagnation point these stagnation zones are consequences of the bottom boundary condition and they are revealed in fig 5b where the darcy flux decreases below q 10 11 m s as a result of the advective heat transport mechanism the non dimensional nusselt number increased to nu 1 66 i e the total surface heat flux increased by 66 compared to conductive heat flow and the calculated average recharge rate was r 157 mm yr in the base model s2 m1 4 3 mixed thermal convection in the third case the combined effect of the three transport mechanisms was studied in the base model s3 m1 heat conduction topography driven forced thermal convection and buoyancy driven free thermal convection were investigated as a fully coupled physical problem over the entire model domain the non dimensional rayleigh number e g nield and bejan 2017 exceeds its critical value ra 4700 racr 4π2 while the modified péclet number szijártó et al 2019 reaches pe 42 5 at these values time dependent mixed thermal convection is expected based on former theoretical model calculations szijártó et al 2019 which underlines the importance of thermal buoyancy forces in the btk system the influence of mixed thermal convection is displayed on the temperature distribution in fig 6 which shows temperature snapshots from t 100 300 kyr as a result of mixed thermal convection a time dependent flow system forms in the base model s3 m1 the change in temperature field fig 6a e indicates non stationary flow on the unconfined side significant advective cooling can be noticed within the range of x 7 km and 27 km in the triassic carbonates hs8 hs9 hs10 in fig 2c which overlaps with the results from the forced thermal convection model fig 5a however weaker plumes evolve from the bottom of the unconfined western side of the model which are swept towards the discharge area beneath the danube river thermal buoyancy is thus superimposed on forced thermal convection these plumes are able to reach the near surface region at the discharge area within a temperature range of t 40 60 c under the siliciclastic covers of the eastern side further convection cells develop in the triassic aquifer hs8 because of the lower hydraulic conductivities of the triassic paleozoic aquitard hs11 and the sedimentary covers hs2 hs5 hs6 hs7 a large hot upwelling forms beneath the pest plain x 33 48 km where the thermal water t 100 120 c moves directly toward the main discharge zone at the danube river this hot upwelling upheld by forced thermal convection remains in a stable position an animation in appendix b presents the time dependent behavior of the temperature field in mixed thermal convection system from t 150 300 kyr the distributions of the darcy flux and the hydraulic head with streamlines are illustrated in fig 7 at time t 300 kyr parallel to fig 6e the increased darcy flux shows the position of the hot plumes in the deeper part of the numerical model and in the hydrostratigraphic units with high hydraulic conductivities hs8 and hs7 fig 7a in the middle part of the model the location of groundwater flow mixing shifted east to x 41 km figs 6e and 7 b compared to the forced thermal convection model x 28 km figs 5a and 5 c the flow directions indicated by yellow display the penetration of recharging water from buda under the pest side time dependent stagnation zones q 10 11 m s evolve between the depths of 4 5 and 5 km the hydraulic head was calculated for the fully coupled mixed thermal convection model s3 using the temperature and pressure dependent water density 10 h m c p ρ w t p g z the high anomalies in hydraulic heads hmc 400 masl are the consequences of the significant density decrease in the thermal boundary layer and in the stable large hot upwellings fig 7b we note that hmc includes the temperature dependence of water density while hfc in eq 9 is calculated from constant temperature ts 10 c the analyses of the time series for different models s3 are shown over a time interval of t 0 300 kyr in fig 8 where the base model m1 is illustrated by a black line after the transient behavior of the system t 150 kyr when the initial conductive temperature field was strongly modified by the mixed heat transfer mechanism the monitoring parameters tended to a quasi stationary solution with a characteristic time period of approx τ 10 100 kyr fig 8 as a result of the additional free thermal convection s3 m1 the non dimensional nusselt number nu varied between 3 5 and 5 5 while the calculated recharge rate r was within a range of r 235 mm yr and 265 mm yr in appendix a supplementary data the time dependence of the temperature field and hydraulic head distribution is illustrated at 8 near surface probe points as a result a longer τi 40 50 kyr and a shorter characteristic time scale τii 1 2 kyr were noticed from the examined temperature and hydraulic head time series the animation of the temperature field can improve the understanding of the characteristic behavior of mixed thermal convection appendix b supplementary data the results for model 1 in fig 9 show the time averaged value of the nusselt number and the recharge rate in the cases of pure heat conduction blue s1 forced green s2 and mixed thermal convection red s3 the recharge rate was normalized by the estimated annual recharge r r in the base model s3 m1 the intensive hot upwellings induced an enhanced heat flux on the surface thus the nusselt number was almost three times greater than that under forced thermal convection nu 1 66 in the cases of forced s2 m1 and mixed thermal convection s3 m1 the normalized recharge rates r r were 54 and 85 respectively fig 9b based on these numerical results the existence of free thermal convection can be expected in the buda thermal karst due to the high geothermal gradient and hydraulic conductivity of the triassic aquifers hs8 hs9 hs10 and the reduced water table slope fig 2 time dependent mixed thermal convection developed in the base model s3 m1 fig 8 where hot plumes were continuously evolving from the thermal boundary layer ascend and are swept towards the regional discharge area fig 6e 4 4 further model scenarios 4 4 1 effects of hydraulically conductive faults in the heterogeneous base model m1 an equivalent porous media epm approximation was applied in the homogeneous isotropic hydrostratigraphic units table 1 this model was modified to a hybrid model m2 in order to investigate the effect of hydraulically conductive faults on the groundwater flow system fig 2c because of the large difference between the characteristic length scale of the flow system l 2 32 km and the thickness of the conductive faults df 5 m this modification does not induce notable changes in the temperature fig 10 a and the darcy flux distribution fig 11 a compared to the base model s3 m1 figs 6e and 7 a in the case of forced thermal convection s2 m2 the non dimensional nusselt number decreased by 7 fig 9 with mixed thermal convection the non dimensional nusselt number increased by 21 while the normalized recharge rate decreased by 10 compared to the base model s3 m1 the movement of hot upwellings is facilitated by hydraulically and thus thermally conductive faults towards the near surface zone which can locally influence the extent of the recharge and the discharge areas consequently the conductive faults are also able to influence the heat flux and the recharge rate fig 9 but this impact seems insignificant on the regional scale temperature and darcy flux fields figs 10a and 11 a 4 4 2 effects of radiogenic heat production an additional numerical model scenario was developed to investigate the effect of radiogenic heat production table 1 in the heat conduction model the surface heat flux increases by only 2 mw m2 due to this added heat production mechanism s1 m3 in the forced thermal convection model s2 m3 neither the nusselt number nor the recharge rate are disturbed by the additional effect of radiogenic heat compared to the base model fig 9 apparent variations due to buoyancy forces cannot be noticed qualitatively in the temperature and the darcy flux in figs 10b and 11 b respectively s3 m3 the changes in the time averaged value of the nusselt number and the normalized recharge rate remains below 2 fig 9 which is also shown by the time series in fig 8 in general the additional effect of the radiogenic heat production is negligible 4 4 3 effects of boundary conditions in this part differences in the numerical results due to the boundary conditions are investigated compared to the base model having an isothermal bottom boundary tb 225 c in model 4a a constant heat flux of qhb 100 mw m2 was prescribed along the bottom boundary in the cases of heat conduction s1 m4a and forced thermal convection s2 m4a the non dimensional nusselt number increased by 24 compared to the conductive base model s1 m1 fig 9 owing to the ratio of bottom heat fluxes qhb qchs 100 80 86 1 237 focusing on the mixed convection simulations the discrepancy between model 1 fig 6e and model 4a fig 10c is the lack of the bottom thermal boundary layer thus the temperature significantly decreases in the triassic and lower paleozoic aquitard hs11 although the additional effect of free thermal convection weakens the main hot upwellings stay in stable positions in the deeper parts of the model domain the change in the bottom thermal boundary condition resulted in 64 and 28 drops in the nusselt number and the recharge rate respectively due to the less intensive heat transport in model 4a s3 m4a in addition an internal thermal boundary condition was tested by a lower quasi impermeable domain with a thickness of 2 km in order to reveal the influence of assuming that neither the temperature nor the heat flux is constant at a depth of 5 km although a strong thermal boundary layer is not formed along the bottom of model 4b fig 10d the thermal anomalies become stronger in the deeper regions compared to model 4a fig 10c this internal thermal boundary condition is therefore between the two types of conventionally applied boundary conditions constant temperature fig 6e and constant heat flux fig 10c compared to the base model s3 m1 the nusselt number is reduced by 8 and 42 in the advective s2 m4b and in the fully coupled s3 m4b heat transfer simulations respectively fig 9a furthermore the normalized recharge rate r r decreased by 11 permitting free thermal convection s3 m4b fig 9b finally the influence of the side walls as a no flow thermally insulated fig 6e versus a hydrostatic pressure conductive temperature boundary condition fig 10e was investigated table 3 these conditions are consistent with the initial thermal and flow fields in the case of mixed thermal convection s3 m1 the no flow thermally insulated boundary condition stabilizes the flow and the temperature field near the walls so upwelling hot plumes are facilitated fig 6e however the hydrostatic pressure conductive temperature condition s3 m4c allows groundwater flow through the side walls figs 10e and 11 e thus the vertical boundary conditions of model 4c do not favor any upwellings along the side walls fig 10e in contrast to model 1 figs 6e and 7 a in this case the applied boundary conditions influence the temperature and darcy flux distribution in the vicinity approx 5 km of the side walls the time series of nu and r are illustrated in fig 8 by magenta curves which do not significantly deviate from the base model black in this scenario s3 m4c the time averaged value of the nusselt number decreased by 11 while the normalized recharge rate decreased by 1 5 compared to the base model s3 m1 fig 9 consequently the studied boundary conditions affect the flow and the temperature field near the side walls nevertheless independently of the investigated boundary conditions along the bottom and the side walls time dependent mixed thermal convection evolved in each numerical model 5 discussion in this study a finite element numerical method was applied to understand the basin scale flow system and temperature distribution for an area with complex geology in cases of three coherent heat transport mechanisms which were 1 heat conduction s1 2 forced thermal convection s2 i e advective and conductive heat transport mechanisms and 3 mixed thermal convection s3 i e conduction and advection with thermal buoyancy based on our numerical results presented above the existence of free thermal convection superimposed on forced thermal convection cannot be excluded from the transport mechanism in the buda thermal karst btk system of hungary three vertical temperature t z profiles were extracted from the base model m1 and compared to well observation data during the application of the basin scale data evaluation method e g tóth 2009 three interpreted temperature profiles telki danube isaszeg were presented by máld szőnyi et al 2019 and mádl szőnyi 2019 in the different parts of the btk figs 4 5a and 6 e show the position of the t z profiles where the centres of the interpreted areas were at x 6 km telki x 28 km danube and x 56 km isaszeg in fig 12 the simulated and measured temperatures are illustrated with the calculated geothermal gradients the reliable measured temperature data are above the elevation of z 1500 masl so the geothermal gradients from the numerical models ztn and from the observations ztm are presented only within this interval profiles obtained from the conduction forced and mixed thermal convection models s1 s2 s3 m1 are denoted by blue green and red colors respectively first the numerical results and the measured temperature data were compared beneath the telki x 6 km observation area fig 12a d g although the geothermal gradient calculated by the measured data z tm 39 4 c km is close to a conductive temperature profile z tnc 46 c km fig 12a a discharge area was noticed in the cases of both forced fig 5c and mixed thermal convection fig 7b the purely advective heat transport cases s2 m1 induce an increase in the geothermal gradient near the surface ztnf 1 z 140 masl 66 9 c km and a decrease between the elevation of z 140 masl and 970 masl ztnf 2 140 masl z 970 masl 14 3 c km fig 12d beneath the elevation of z 1000 masl the geothermal gradient changed to close to the conductive value in the case of mixed thermal convection s3 m1 the simulated geothermal gradients seem to be exaggerated compared to the observations fig 12g second the temperature profiles were compared beneath the danube river fig 12b e h the measured temperature data are much higher than the results from the conductive model simulation s1 m1 fig 12b and the difference in the geothermal gradients reaches 10 c km near the surface the geothermal gradient obtained from the advective numerical simulation s2 m1 increased above the elevation of z 640 masl due to topography driven forced thermal convection fig 12e the forced convection case is also characterized by a steady state hot upwelling beneath the regional discharge area fig 5a however the negative geothermal gradient obtained from temperature observations between z 830 masl and 1150 masl can be interpreted only by the existence of time dependent free thermal convection s3 m3 with inclined hot plumes fig 12h in this case the location of the groundwater mixing zone was shifted toward the confined part by approx 10 15 km fig 7b this model result coincides with previous studies in which the temperature and the geochemical properties of springs were analysed in the btk mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádl szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi 2019 máld szőnyi et al 2019 erőss 2010 erőss et al 2012 etc third the temperatures from the numerical simulations and from the observations were compared beneath isaszeg x 56 km fig 12c f and i to examine the effect of heat transport processes in a typical recharge area the numerical simulations showed a considerable cooling effect of advective heat transport figs 5a and 6 e which overwrote the initial conductive temperature distribution fig 4 however a noticeable correspondence between the simulated ztnc 1 44 9 c km and the measured ztm 1 49 3 c km geothermal gradients was found in the case of pure heat conduction fig 12c therefore a less intensive groundwater flow component can be established under the eastern confined part of the buda thermal karst system owing to for instance the higher hydraulic anisotropy of the cenozoic layers finally a two dimensional temperature field was calculated from the geothermal database of hungary dövényi 1994 along a section fig 1c to display the measured temperature data the measured temperature data were projected using a space interval with a width of 10 km fig 1c a gaussian regression interpolation method was applied on the temperature data with different locations and elevations 200 masl z 1500 masl in order to set up a two dimensional temperature section fig 13 on the western side of the temperature section x 10 km a significant cooling effect due to advective heat transport is noted above the elevation of z 750 masl a large scale heating effect of forced or mixed thermal convection was noted beneath the regional discharge area the danube river 24 km x 33 km fig 13b there the negative temperature anomaly might also have evolved due to the time dependent mixed thermal convection which was suggested by the numerical simulations on the eastern side of the studied section x 40 km a shallow advective cooling effect is identified z 400 masl which changes to a mainly conductive temperature field with depth due to the possible anisotropy of the miocene aquifers hs1 and hs2 garamhegyi et al 2020 in addition a former study which focused on changes in the temperature field and flow pattern using a simplified geology of the btk from the late miocene to present day revealed periodic temperature oscillations in the groundwater flow system within a range of 15 kyr and 40 kyr havril 2018 according to a comprehensive field observation and description and subsequent petrographic mineralogic and isotopic analyses of speleothems in the caves of btk water level fluctuations and groundwater temperatures were reconstructed for the last 500 kyr virág 2019 the position and different forms of calcite rafts cave popcorns and cauliflower coatings revealed a water table rise of 5 7 m in the period of 300 280 kyr ago simultaneously the carbonate precipitates indicated an increase in groundwater temperature from 28 c to 48 c then a gradual decline of the water table 10 m and cooling of groundwater 30 c were recorded by the speleothems in the following 130 kyr the time dependent quasi periodic behavior of mixed thermal convection might be one of the feasible explanations for the mentioned observations in the buda thermal karst appendix a and b supplementary data 6 summary and conclusions finite element numerical simulations were performed to investigate the role of heat conduction advection and thermal buoyancy as physical mechanisms in the groundwater flow system and temperature distribution of the well studied area of the buda thermal karst of hungary in addition to three basic scenarios s1 3 m1 five further models m2 m4c were tested to study the additional effects of natural phenomena and of the effects the boundary conditions table 3 in the discussion the results from the numerical simulations were compared to measured temperatures in wells the non dimensional nusselt number nu and the recharge rate r were calculated to compare the results from different numerical models compared to conductive models advective heat transport increased the total heat flux on the surface shown by the nusselt number nu 1 23 1 69 in the base model m1 significant cooling effects were noticed due to topography driven advective heat transfer beneath the recharge area of the western part but this effect was less evident in the eastern part of the numerical model at the main regional discharge area which is located near the danube river a steady state hot upwelling plume approaches the surface within a temperature range of t 70 c and 80 c this result is consistent with the balneological features around budapest where several thermal spas have been established which are characterized by these highest temperatures in the steady state solutions the calculated recharge rate was constant r 157 mm yr which is approximately half of the maximum recharge rate estimated from precipitation r r 54 the superimposed effect of thermal buoyancy was evident from the non dimensional rayleigh and the modified péclet numbers which were estimated at ra 4700 and at pe 42 5 respectively szijártó et al 2019 owing to the fully coupled mixed thermal convection the numerical simulation led to a time dependent quasi stationary t 150 kyr and weakly periodic solution the time dependence of the temperature field and hydraulic head was investigated in the supplementary data appendix a the complementary effect of free thermal convection facilitated the evolution of hot upwelling from the thermal boundary layer which intensified the heat and the mass flux compared to advective heat transport thus the nusselt number varied between nu 1 56 and 5 25 while the recharge rate was within a range of r 178 mm yr r r 61 s3 m4a and 250 mm yr 86 s3 m1 fig 9 by means of accessory scenarios we investigated the effect of hydraulically conductive faults m2 and radiogenic heat production within the hydrostratigraphic units m3 as a conclusion the studied natural features induce mainly local anomalies in the numerical model their influence on the basin scale groundwater flow pattern and the temperature field is not significant in the btk finally we tested the artificial effects of the boundary conditions prescribed along the bottom m4a m4b and the side walls m4c it was established that neither the constant bottom temperature nor the constant heat flux is a perfect condition to imitate the nature of the real system using an internal thermal condition m4b might be an appropriate method to minimize the artificial effect of the bottom boundary conditions the studied boundary condition on the side walls can affect the temperature field and the flow pattern m4c especially near the boundaries however this effect causes only marginal changes in the main part of the numerical model based on the comparison of the numerical results and the observation data dövényi 1994 mádl szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi 2019 a weak shallow advective cooling effect is produced on the recharge area of the confined eastern side of the btk fig 13 however the main heat transport mechanism is conductive due to the anisotropy of the miocene hydrostratigraphic units which can moderate the vertical flow in the deeper zones z 400 masl beneath the danube river a clear appearance of the advective heat transfer mechanism is noticed which was also supported by previous conceptional models and geochemical interpretations mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádl szőnyi et al 2018 mádl szőnyi 2019 máld szőnyi et al 2019 erőss 2010 erőss et al 2012 etc nevertheless the superimposed buoyancy forces seem to be strong enough to induce time dependent mixed thermal convection the calculated geothermal gradients fig 12 the negative temperature anomaly beneath the danube river due to inclined hot plumes fig 13 can be explained by the additional effect of free thermal convection in addition the quasi periodic changes in both the temperature field and the hydraulic head distribution appendix a supplementary data might explain the temperature and water level fluctuations observed from speleothems in caves of btk virág 2019 in this basin scale simulation the cave systems and the preferential flow patterns caused by karstification which are mainly located in the near surface area were neglected however the manifestations of karsification processes can be significant in local scale flow systems the isotropic approach is appropriate in the hydraulically conductive triassic aquifers hs8 hs10 using the epm approximation as a limitation of the model the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity was neglected in the neogene oligocene and eocene hydrostratigraphic units hs1 hs7 however the changes in hydraulic conductivities were examined in appendix a supplementary data clearly the numerical model outcomes substantial uncertainties caused due to e g the unknown physical properties of the hydrostratigraphic units as the most hydrogeological models do mishra et al 2009 foglia et al 2013 song et al 2015 etc although accomplishing a global sensitivity analysis gsa was not the purpose of the paper influence of the hydraulic and the thermal conductivity was examined on the temperature field and on the monitoring parameters it was established that the numerical results are influenced by the changes in hydraulic k and thermal λ conductivities nevertheless mixed thermal convection evolved in each numerical model within a range of analysed parameters appendix a supplementary data this study draws attention to the importance of different driving forces of groundwater flow especially in deep carbonate sequences and adjoining sedimentary basins such as the buda thermal karst of hungary globally this hydrogeological situation is not unique as many other systems are also characterized by similar geological settings for example the upper floridan aquifer system in west central florida usa gulley et al 2014 the jinan karst aquifer system in east china wang et al 2015 the frasassi anticline on the eastern slope of the apennine mountain chain in italy galdenzi et al 2008 as well as the black hills in south dakota usa palmer and palmer 2000 the applied systematic numerical approach and thorough comparison of the

8254,study region oceania south pacific polynesia study focus changing climates have the potential to significantly impact global water resources availability on many volcanic islands groundwater is the primary drinking water source thereby making it essential to manage this limited resource carefully in this study we developed high temporal and spatial resolution groundwater recharge estimates for the island of tutuila american samoa using the soil water balance 2 swb2 model additionally we predicted future recharge by running the calibrated model with combinations of dynamically downscaled general circulation climate model gcm predictions and future land cover scenarios developed collectively with local stakeholder groups new hydrological insights present day results indicate 57 of tutuila s rainfall becomes groundwater recharge 8 evaporates from the canopy 15 evapotranspires and 20 discharges as stormflow runoff future climate scenarios suggest recharge may increase by 8 or 14 depending on global emissions land cover was a less significant driver of hydrologic change although increases in impervious surfaces showed a negative impact on recharge this work is maintained as an active open source project on github the world s leading software development platform thereby enhancing transparency reproducibility and participation from stakeholders and managers in american samoa this study is the first of its kind from a location within the south pacific convergence zone and provides insights into how human activities on global and local levels affect the future sustainability of essential resources keywords groundwater recharge climate change island sustainability land cover natural resource management scenario planning 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of drinking water on most volcanic islands and tutuila the main island in the u s territory of american samoa is no exception e g peterson 1972 izuka et al 2007 join et al 2016 in these isolated locations the importance of limited water resources necessitates their careful management because drinking water availability is fundamentally controlled by groundwater recharge in these settings accurate recharge estimates are essential for developing well informed water resources management strategies e g falkland and brunel 1993 gingerich and oki 2000 xu and singh 2004 in a changing world sustainable resource management must also consider drivers of future resource availability such as changes in climate and land cover american samoa has already begun to measurably experience effects of climate change the number of days above 32 c has increased by over 240 since the 1960 s and the frequency of extreme rainfall events has increased and is projected to increase even more in years to come menne et al 2012 keener et al 2018 in addition to climatic drivers changes in land cover resulting from american samoa s continued economic development could also influence groundwater recharge rates in american samoa a remote island archipelago in the south pacific groundwater meets the domestic needs of over 90 of the island s residents shuler and eyre 2018 however this supply is subject to numerous stressors including saltwater intrusion from over pumping high losses caused by leaky water mains and surface water contamination in the island s highest producing aquifers izuka 1999 asepa 2014 shuler et al 2019 therefore water managers critically need the best available information to make proactive rather than reactive planning decisions unfortunately accurate assessment of groundwater availability is often limited by uncertainty or poor discretization in recharge because this parameter is difficult if not impossible to directly measure scanlon et al 2002 this makes detailed quantification and spatial mapping of inputs to and outputs from the groundwater system essential for informed water management and guiding planning and policy into the future common approaches for quantifying groundwater recharge include analytical regression equations e g shade and nichols 1996 surface water models e g arnold et al 1998 coupled saturated unsaturated zone models e g brunner and simmons 2012 and water budget models such as the soil water balance swb method amongst others e g westenbroek et al 2010 for regional scale groundwater management studies the swb method is generally considered to be reliable due to its versatility across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and the method has been widely used to assess future water availability through climate scenarios and assessment of change in other water budget drivers scanlon et al 2002 xu and singh 2004 healy 2010 brewington et al 2019 the swb method integrates long term climate records with geospatial data and is particularly effective for modeling tropical islands with high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation and other hydrologic processes e g mair et al 2013 engott et al 2017 westenbroek et al 2018 a significant challenge for predicting future climate impacts on small scale features such as high oceanic islands is the fact that global scale general circulation models gcms are not resolved enough to represent the climate patterns and steep orographic rainfall gradients that drive island scale climate variability schroeder 1993 daly et al 2006 for example over a distance of 4 km between tutuila s highest point and pago pago airport annual rainfall more than doubles from 275 cm to 575 cm in comparison most gcms have cell size resolutions on the order of 50 100 km a distance that exceeds the diameter of most basaltic islands timm and diaz 2009 therefore to be useful in these settings climate predictions must be downscaled using dynamical or statistical methods to more accurately represent the significant climatic variability of high basaltic islands e g elison timm et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 wang and zhang 2016 until recently no downscaled climate models have been available for the samoan region however wang and zhang 2016 produced the first high resolution dynamically downscaled climate products for american samoa which now provide the opportunity to assess the effects of future climate on water resources at a highly resolved scale another challenge in modeling future water resources is uncertainty in land cover change humans have dramatically affected the hydrologic cycle through land cover alteration abbott et al 2019 in pacific islands anthropogenic land cover change has been linked to disruption of hydrologic processes such as stream baseflow cloud water interception infiltration soil moisture parameters and surface water runoff loague et al 1996 ziegler and giambelluca 1998 kagawa et al 2009 takahashi et al 2011 perkins et al 2012 izuka et al 2018 expansion of impervious surfaces associated with human development increases surface runoff thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and other water budget components e g nhep 2007 chithra et al 2015 increasing population and development pressure in american samoa makes continued landscape change all but inevitable crews and lawson 2015 however development patterns are difficult to predict as they are tied to a multitude of social environmental and economic factors veldkamp and lambin 2001 han et al 2015 therefore scenario based approaches to modeling land cover change are commonly used to account for this uncertainty and to create informed products that are reflective of potential management actions hulse et al 2004 soliva et al 2008 kepner et al 2012 brewington et al 2017 to consolidate rich and varied ideas from multiple sets of participants scenario planning often organizes individual predictions into sets of stories or narratives that are plausible thought provoking relevant and different enough from each other to facilitate meaningful comparison nps 2013 participatory development of scenarios with relevant stakeholder groups helps to not only produce well informed predictions but also increases stakeholder engagement and acceptance of the products argent and grayson 2003 in this study we produced the first high resolution data driven assessment of island wide groundwater recharge on a high basaltic island within the south pacific convergence zone spcz prior to this study only speculative estimates of groundwater recharge have been available for islands in the south pacific nullet 1987 döll and fiedler 2008 and these are generally based on global scale climatic parameters thereby disregarding local scale orographic effects we developed recharge and water budget estimates for tutuila island with the soil water balance 2 swb2 water budget model by incorporating up to date high resolution input data within a reproducible and open source modeling framework by substituting dynamically downscaled end of century climate predictions into the model we also assessed how projected changes in rainfall and temperature may directly affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of groundwater recharge in addition we worked with stakeholders in american samoa to develop future land cover narratives based on their understanding of present and future economic and environmental drivers we then used geospatial land cover expansion and contraction algorithms to produce a set of possible future land cover scenario maps representing each narrative future climate and land cover scenarios were combined to produce eleven possible groundwater recharge futures these scenarios help to frame the likely extreme cases in groundwater recharge by the end of the century this study is the first of its kind to undertake such a comprehensive approach to modeling water resources availability in the present and future within the south pacific region 1 1 study area the island of tutuila fig 1 located near 14 s and 170 w is the main population center of american samoa and at 142 km2 is the third largest island in the samoan hot spot island chain due to its position within the south pacific convergence zone the island experiences abundant year round rainfall with increased precipitation during the wet season from october to may monthly average rainfall in the wet season is roughly twice that of the dry season s still significant rainfall amounts rainfall varies considerably with location and elevation and ranges between 175 cm yr near the tafuna airport up to more than 500 cm yr along the crest of the highest mountains nws 2000 daly et al 2006 strong tropical storms and hurricanes also influence the region about once every other year and an average of 25 30 significant thunderstorms affect the island annually kennedy and chilton consulting engineers 1987 tutuila consists of two distinct regions 1 the tafuna leone plain a highly permeable rejuvenated phase lava delta which due to its low slope contains concentrated human development and 2 the remainder of the island a mountainous assemblage of pleistocene age shield volcanoes that generally consist of lower permeability rock stearns 1944 2 methods 2 1 swb2 water budget model to develop spatially and temporally distributed estimates of groundwater recharge we used the u s geological survey usgs swb2 model an open source code based on a modified thornthwaite and mather 1955 soil water balance approach westenbroek et al 2010 2018 the swb2 model is particularly suitable for sites on tropical basaltic islands such as tutuila westenbroek et al 2018 the model applies a rectangular gridded approach and uses a daily time step for soil moisture processing though due to input data resolution outputs are limited to monthly or annual time steps for this project we implemented our modeling framework with jupyter notebooks kluyver et al 2016 for the purpose of making the results and methodology open and as reproducible as possible all of the model input data code and output files are open source under the gnu general public license v3 0 and archived permanently on github shuler et al 2020 users familiar with the python environment can download and run the model with minimal effort major benefits of developing scientific models within the open source paradigm include enhanced reproducibility and transparency as well as providing the opportunity for end users to modify or substitute different input datasets assess different scenarios or change the cell size resolution as desired 2 2 input datasets all input datasets were collected from existing publications or documented resources and are described below with references to their sources provided an expanded version of the methods we used is available in section 2 of this manuscript s supplementary material 2 2 1 precipitation the swb2 model requires spatially distributed precipitation data in a gridded format while the model runs on a daily time step to account for antecedent soil moisture conditions daily resolution precipitation datasets are uncommon for isolated oceanic islands this problem was handled by applying the method of fragments oki 2002 westenbroek et al 2018 which disaggregates monthly gridded rainfall data by allocating fractions of monthly precipitation totals into individual days based on observed daily rainfall patterns from rain gauge records for the present day precipitation we used 90 m by 90 m gridded monthly rainfall data covering the entire island of tutuila daly et al 2006 we applied the method of fragments by supplying the model with daily precipitation records from 18 distinct rain gauging stations scattered throughout tutuila nws 2000 shuler and mariner 2019 2 2 2 evapotranspiration we used island wide monthly resolution potential evapotranspiration pet data developed by izuka et al 2005 by using the penman 1948 method actual evapotranspiration rates aet were calculated by the swb2 model using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 2 2 3 land cover and soil types site specific land cover parameters were assigned via a high resolution wildlife habitat map meyer et al 2016 developed using an object based remote sensing approach on high resolution orthoimagery and island wide lidar data water budget parameters including rooting zone depth canopy storage capacity trunk storage capacity stem flow fractions and curve numbers associated with each land cover type were parameterized using a tabular lookup table from westenbroek et al 2018 which provided equivalent parameters for the island of maui hawaii as there are no known site specific studies constraining these parameters for american samoa table 1 an island wide soil study of tutuila was completed by nakamura 1984 and includes descriptions of each soil type predictions of soil behavior suitability of each soil type for specified uses and hydrologic soil groupings we used these data to develop gridded datasets of hydrologic soil groups and soil moisture capacity 2 2 4 direct infiltration anthropogenic activities can significantly affect the spatial distribution of water balance components through irrigation infrastructure leakage and wastewater disposal while no crop irrigation is documented on tutuila a large fraction of water in the municipal delivery system is lost to underground water leakage termed non revenue water nrw we estimated island wide nrw from american samoa power authority aspa records to be approximately 23 ml d or about 56 of all water produced from pumping wells on tutuila shuler and eyre 2018 no data were available on the distribution of water line leakage so we included nrw in the model as direct infiltration by equally distributing 23 ml d across all model cells that intersected with water main locations as provided by aspa in addition to nwr direct infiltration from on site wastewater disposal system osds leachate was also added to the model using data from local stakeholders as doc 2009 and methods based on those used by shuler et al 2017 2 2 5 mountain front recharge infiltration on the tafuna leone plain is enhanced by the process of mountain front recharge mfr where surface waters and overland runoff from watersheds above the plain infiltrate into streambeds or soil once reaching a more permeable geologic substrate this process is analogous to the mfr frequently observed in arid climates wilson and guan 2004 and its occurrence on tutuila has been previously described for this study we used the previously constrained information from izuka et al 2007 and perreault 2010 to determine the spatial extent and estimated magnitude of mfr on the tafuna leone plain 2 2 6 surface runoff the swb2 model provides two options for quantifying surface runoff the curve number cn method cronshey 1986 and an externally supplied runoff ratio method with the cn method swb2 performs an internal calculation of surface runoff woodward et al 2003 this method relies on supplying the model with cns which are typically looked up from published values based on soil type and vegetation cover because published cns exist for most general land cover and soil types this method can be applied quickly and broadly however published cns are a generalization and can only approximate actual runoff conditions at field sites and very few studies have actually developed cns specifically for volcanic island sites cooley and lane 1982 swb2 also provides the option of using measured runoff to rainfall ratios r r ratios as determined for individual watersheds through analysis of field data while r r ratios are based on directly measured field data this method s limitation is the difficulty and cost of measuring streamflow and precipitation across the entire landscape which for tutuila would equate to continuously gauging at least 83 perennial streams for this study we used data from current and historical gauges wong 1996 usgs 2018 shuler and el kadi 2018 shuler and mariner 2019 to calculate monthly r r ratios for 15 basins throughout tutuila ratios from gauged watersheds can be interpolated or mapped to ungauged watersheds through regression equations but this technique is limited in its accuracy and lack of validation making surface runoff one of the most difficult parts of the water budget method to constrain engott et al 2017 2 3 model calibration and sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 curve number calibration to address the limitations of each of the runoff calculation methods mentioned above we developed a procedure to benefit from the strengths of both we first ran the swb2 model using the r r ratio method for the fifteen watersheds where continuous record streamflow data was available we then extracted the mean annual groundwater recharge from each basin area to be used as calibration data for optimizing cns in these watersheds we then switched the swb2 model to run using the cn method and wrapped the whole model into a single python function with the cns as free parameters we applied an optimization function to calibrate each of the cns for each land cover type the calibrated cns were then applied to the island wide model for the final model runs the resulting tutuila specific cn values are shown in table 1 overall the calibrated cns for tutuila were lower than the initial from maui cns for most of the human impacted land cover types developed lands and cultivated areas and were higher for grassland and native forest land covers this is reasonable and reflects the generally more rural nature of tutuila as compared to maui 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of different input parameters on model outputs we conducted a sensitivity analysis on both the tabular parameters associated with different land covers as well as those spatial parameters with numerical as opposed to geographic uncertainty sensitivity test parameters included precipitation pet maximum and minimum daily temperatures direct infiltration from anthropogenic sources cns rooting depth canopy storage capacity trunk storage capacity and stemflow fraction each of the model input parameters were multiplied by six different test factors 50 75 90 110 125 and 150 the model was run repeatedly changing each parameter by each test factor to assess how the primary model output parameter island wide groundwater recharge was affected by relative change in each input parameter effects of using different fragment sets for daily rainfall distributions was also tested by running the model with five unique fragment sets which yielded a mean difference from the base case of 3 4 all other sensitivity analysis results are shown in table 2 2 4 future climate and land cover scenarios 2 4 1 dynamically downscaled climate projections wang and zhang 2016 produced dynamically downscaled mid and late 21st century climate projection datasets for tutuila at an 800m 800m grid resolution their projections included three scenarios 1 modeled present day climate calculated for the years 1990 2009 2 future climate 2080 2099 reflecting a lower carbon emissions scenario rcp4 5 and 3 future climate 2080 2099 climate reflecting a higher emissions scenario rcp8 5 overall both of the future climate scenarios indicated projected increases in temperature as well as significant increases in precipitation island wide future climate scenarios were incorporated in the tutuila swb2 model by substituting the original monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature grids with grids from wang and zhang 2016 the swb2 evapotranspiration method was also changed to internally calculate pet with the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 so the effects of air temperature change could be considered 2 5 development of participatory land cover change narratives the process of developing future land cover change narratives started with interviewing over twenty representatives from seven government and educational agencies on tutuila interviews were conducted with staff at the american samoa environmental protection agency asepa the american samoa community college ascc the american samoa power authority aspa the department of public works dpw the american samoa department of commerce asdoc the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s coastal zone management program noaa czmp and the coral reef advisory group crag interviewees were presented with information about the project and were asked to discuss the specific drivers of land cover change on the island and their thoughts and assumptions regarding what future economic and land cover decisions were likely to be made in the future we compiled all notes from these discussions and organized them into three specific themes related by likely drivers of change each is represented by one of the three separate land cover narratives detailed below we then developed geospatial land cover change algorithms to automatically modify the meyer et al 2016 land cover map into scenario maps that represented each of the three narratives to assess effects of future climate and land cover together we then ran the swb2 model using all 12 combinations of present and future land cover and climate scenarios each of which is summarized in table 3 2 5 1 geospatial land cover change algorithms to produce future land cover maps representing changes outlined in the future land cover narratives we developed a series of geospatial algorithms within jupyter notebooks to modify the original meyer et al 2016 land cover map via a series of computational steps enacted through the use of an expansion function that redistributed the proportion of land under different land cover types this method was designed to make the process more reproducible and transparent than methods that use direct editing of features and it also preserved the existing distribution of land cover types across the island to avoid bias inherent in manual edits fig 2 shows static maps of land cover change scenarios and animated high resolution land cover change maps are provided as supplementary material figs 1 3 and in this project s associated github repository https github com cshuler tutuila swb scenarios 2 5 2 land cover change narrative 1 economic boom and unrestricted growth the unrestricted growth narrative represents a possible future where socio economic conditions lead to an increase in population and development which is allowed to proceed without zoning or regulation fig 2 the stakeholders identified potential drivers of this change including 1 new telework jobs from improved telecommunications infrastructure 2 increased growth driven by the tourism sector 3 geopolitical conditions resulting in increased immigration specific land cover changes included 1 new development on the now forested aasu uplands fig 1 2 an increase in island wide impervious surfaces by 96 from 8 3 km2 to 16 3 km2 including a 13 0 8 km2 loss of developed open space and 63 3 3 km2 loss of developed woodlands surrounding residential and commercial areas 3 an island wide increase in agroforestry plantations by 44 from 8 1 km2 to 11 8 km2 4 an increase in cultivated land of 7 from 10 9 km2 to 11 8 km2 5 expansion of developed land covers into adjacent undeveloped areas with slopes 25 resulting in reduction of lowland rainforest by 7 or 6 1 km2 6 infiltration from osds units was increased by 96 7 in addition to scenario specific drivers effects of 1 m of sea level rise slr were included in the algorithm by changing all coastal land covers that intersected with 1 m slr flood zones noaa ocm 2016 except for bare rock to mangrove land cover 2 5 3 land cover change narrative 2 population attrition this narrative represents a future of economic contraction that causes tutuila s population to shrink fig 2 specific drivers discussed with stakeholders included 1 shutdown of the tuna cannery the island s largest private employer 2 increase in natural disasters such as coastal flooding and severe cyclones due to climate change and 3 reduction in economic opportunity due to losses of external funding and reduction in government jobs changes to the land cover map included 1 a 52 reduction in cultivated land from 11 0 km2 to 5 2 km2 and a 11 reduction in agroforestry plantations from 8 2 km2 to 7 2 km2 island wide 2 an island wide decrease in impervious surfaces by 33 from 8 3 km2 to 5 6 km2 and a decrease in open space by 35 from 6 9 km2 to 4 5 km2 3 direct net infiltration from osds units was decreased by 33 4 reduced population pressure may reduce the need for residents to live in areas prone to flooding to represent migration away from these areas we identified all structures and impervious surfaces within 4 m of a stream and changed these land cover types to open space in addition all land covers except for bare rock within the 1 m slr flood zone on the coastline were converted to mangroves as described in narrative 1 2 5 4 land cover change narrative 3 population boom with enhanced zoning and management the managed growth narrative represents growth conditions as described in the unrestricted growth narrative but with additional controls on development through new zoning and land management regulations fig 2 possible regulatory actions we considered were identified through discussions with stakeholders and included 1 designation of new or enforcement of existing special management areas smas designed to protect and enlarge ecologically significant remnant areas of native ecosystems 2 protection of existing undeveloped lowland rainforest 3 management of riparian corridors 4 support for more agroforestry plantations and 4 development of green infrastructure and buffer zones in areas vulnerable to coastal flooding the land cover change algorithm for this narrative reflected these activities by 1 delineation of smas and conversion of land cover in smas to native lowland forest specifically smas included a the sparsely developed malaeimi valley area b lowland rainforest on the tafuna plain c the aasu uplands fig 1 and d all existing wetland areas 2 all existing lowland rainforest was preserved this plus conservation of smas resulted in an increase in rainforest by 0 3 85 8 km2 to 86 1 km2 3 agroforestry plantations were increased by 52 from 8 2 km2 to 12 5 km2 4 riparian development buffers were represented by converting all buildings and impervious surfaces within 5 m of a stream into open space 5 coastal flooding buffer zones were created by replacing all land cover types except for bare rock in the 2 m slr flood zones noaa ocm 2016 with mangroves 6 population expansion was accommodated through densification of existing land cover represented by an island wide increase in impervious surfaces of 64 from 8 3 km2 to 13 7 km2 and decreases in open space and developed woodlands by 20 6 9 km2 to 5 5 km2 and 65 5 3 km2 to 1 9 km2 respectively 7 direct net infiltration from osds units was increased by 64 3 results 3 1 present day water budget summarized at an island wide scale mean annual groundwater recharge calculated by the present day base case swb2 model was 884 ml d total mean annual island wide water inputs included precipitation 1490 ml d and direct infiltration from water lines osds 38 ml d groundwater recharge was the largest output component of the water budget representing 57 of the total mean annual island wide water inputs other water budget components on the output side included canopy interception and actual evapotranspiration representing 125 ml d or 8 and 228 ml d or 15 of total water inputs respectively island wide runoff was initially calculated to be 313 ml d or 21 of total water inputs of which 19 ml d was captured and re introduced to the model as mfr thereby reducing the amount of surface runoff lost to the sea to 294 ml d or 20 of water inputs fig 3 water inputs totaled 1 528 ml d which accounted for 99 8 of the 1 531 ml d of summed water outputs thereby leaving a model mass balance error of less than 0 3 likely due to rounding or differences in resolution during post processing while we primarily report results at an annual island wide resolution swb2 produces finely resolved netcdf outputs that can be summarized at higher temporal and spatial resolutions watershed scale and monthly resolution results are available within this project s associated github repository https github com cshuler tutuila swb scenarios monthly resolution outputs were also examined to assess seasonal patterns predictably the annual distributions of recharge et and runoff followed the same pattern as rainfall with the absolute magnitude of all water budget components falling in the dry season austral winter and rising in the wet season fig 4 a however different patterns emerged when comparing the fraction of total precipitation allocated to each water budget component fig 4 b in dry season months et generally exceeded surface runoff but the model predicted the reverse during the wet season recharge dominated the water budget all year but the ratio of recharge over monthly precipitation in the dry season was somewhat higher than during the wet season these patterns may be caused by changes in rainfall intensity throughout the year as tutuila receives more intense convective storms in the austral summer 3 2 results future climate scenarios on the average annual scale both the high and moderate emissions future climate scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 project significant island wide increases in annual precipitation on the order of 11 and 18 respectively because precipitation is the main driver of the water budget island wide annual groundwater recharge totals showed a commensurate increase of 8 and 14 for the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively fig 5 annual island wide et increased from the base case only marginally by 0 6 and 1 1 but annual surface runoff increased dramatically by 31 and 49 which drove a corresponding increase in mfr of 11 and 17 for the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively monthly resolution downscaled projections showed an interesting result where the present day wet and dry season precipitation signals were absent from the downscaled model s monthly totals with precipitation varying fairly randomly throughout the year supplementary material figs 4 and 5 prepetition totals for all future projected months were always above the present day monthly totals but the additional amounts varied significantly tropical cyclones are one major driver of precipitation in tutuila s wet season and wang and zhang 2016 call attention to their projections showing a significantly decreased frequency of weak and strong tropical cyclones over american samoa this might account for at least part of the decay of the typical seasonal rainfall signal 3 3 results future land cover scenarios effects of changes in land cover alone without climate scenarios were most pronounced at the sub watershed scale whereas a large proportion of individual model cells showed increases or decreases in key water balance components of over 20 fig 6 however once the differences were summed at the watershed scale these patchwork changes balanced out to the point where the greatest predicted change in groundwater recharge for any of the land cover scenarios was about 3 seen in three to five of the island s most affected watersheds for each scenario at the island wide scale the changes averaged out even more yielding annual recharge percent differences difference between the present day and future land cover scenarios of 0 35 0 59 and 0 66 for the unrestricted growth scenario the population attrition scenario and the managed growth scenarios respectively table 3 while quite small these changes nonetheless followed an expected pattern where both of the growth scenarios predicted slightly less recharge and the population attrition scenario predicted a slight increase in recharge the magnitudes of change in whole island aet and surface runoff were more significant with aet decreasing by 11 in the attrition scenario and increasing by 8 and 0 5 for the two growth scenarios runoff increased by 3 0 6 and 5 3 for the unrestricted growth the population attrition and the managed growth scenarios respectively nonetheless despite the limited change in recharge on watershed or larger scales we were also able to isolate the effects from changing each land cover type to any of the other types in isolation by analyzing the scenario results on a cell by cell basis this was done by filtering only those individual cells that were assigned a specific land cover type in the base case and were then changed to another land cover type in one of the future scenarios this analysis essentially provided a controlled experiment to assess the effects of changes driven only by varying a single land cover in isolation we processed 132 of these experiments for each of the three scenarios 12 land cover types that can change to one of the 11 other types and in summary found that the most impactful changes in recharge were generally seen when more vegetated land covers such as cultivated or forested land were changed to a developed land cover type such as impervious surfaces most notably and considering results of all three scenarios when native lowland forest was changed to impervious surfaces recharge was generally reduced by about 20 changing lowland forest to open space or developed woodlands also reduced recharge by about 6 and 12 respectively generally conversion of lowland rainforest to agroforest or cultivated land generally only produced reductions in recharge on the order of 1 3 and sometimes even increased recharge by a small amount when future land cover and future climate scenarios were combined the effects of the dramatic increase in island wide precipitation was the strongest driver of change the magnitude of recharge and aet in the combined scenarios were approximately the same as the additive effects of the climate and land cover scenarios alone however it is interesting to note that for all scenario combinations the model predicted small but significant increases in runoff beyond the additive impacts of the climate or land cover scenarios alone with these additional differences ranging between 0 3 and 3 3 more surface runoff 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to other water budget studies although this study details the first known island wide high resolution groundwater recharge estimate conducted for tutuila a former usgs study authored by izuka et al 2007 developed a similar water budget for just the western portion of tutuila using the hawaii water budget code comparison between our study and the izuka et al 2007 work showed reasonably similar results based on calculation of water budget components within the equivalent area of western tutuila specifically our annual resolution water fluxes in w tutuila were within 2 difference for precipitation 12 difference for runoff 14 difference for et and 15 difference for recharge with negative values indicating comparatively more water calculated by the izuka model part of the difference between the models can be attributed to the fact that the izuka et al 2007 study did not include additional recharge contributed by direct net infiltration from osds units or leaking water lines which our study calculated to be about 4 of the total swb2 calculated recharge another difference can be attributed to our use of calibrated cns whereas the previous work used a single runoff to rainfall ratio to parameterize runoff across the entire model domain regardless comparison between the two studies helps to support the reasonableness of our swb2 calculated water budget estimates as well as those produced by the izuka et al group comparison between tutuila s water budget and water budgets of similar island environments can also be useful for examining differences between the large scale hydrology of different regions to do this we consolidated as many other water budget studies as possible from other high basaltic islands in the pacific basin we considered only those studies that used high resolution spatially distributed models to calculate island wide water budgets one obvious difference between tutuila and other islands is the large 50 fraction of precipitation that our and the izuka et al 2007 models allocated to groundwater recharge table 4 shows these differences by normalizing major water budget components by island wide volumetric precipitation on most of the hawaiian islands jeju island and guam aet is the dominant water budget output whereas aet only represented about a quarter of the water budget output on tutuila this is likely due to tutuila s location within the spcz which is characteristically cloudy and rainy as a result of the prevalence of large scale convective systems vincent 1994 whereas the other islands in this comparison all lie outside of the spcz and itcz salinger et al 2014 on average tutuila receives nearly twice the rainfall of the other islands in this comparison with the rainier western portion of the tutuila receiving a region wide annual average of 458 cm of rainfall according to izuka et al 2007 the larger number of cloudy days on tutuila also serves to reduce incoming net radiation a key driver of pet this in conjunction with frequent year round rainfall events keeps soil moisture availability high thereby driving aet to approximate pet on tutuila much of the time izuka et al 2007 with available radiative energy limiting the amount of water that can be evaporated it is reasonable for tutuila s surface runoff and groundwater recharge to be higher than in other islands such as guam where average solar radiation is higher kabir et al 2017 however we calculated tutuila s recharge to be nearly three times larger than surface runoff and proportionally tutuila s recharge was the highest of any of the other islands examined this might be explained by tutuila s hydrogeology whereas a relatively large portion of the island the tafuna leone plain is composed of young highly permeable lava flows the plain makes up about 22 of the island s land mass and as izuka et al 2007 states is devoid of drainage features indicating very little of the rainfall or surface runoff from the mountains above actually makes it to the sea this is analogous to the leeward side of the big island of hawaii where young permeable lavas also reduce surface runoff fractions to minimal amounts indeed the water budget for the big island indicates higher relative recharge and lower relative surface runoff fractions compared to the other islands engott 2011 these differences show how other hydrologic factors besides precipitation amounts can influence the overall availability of water resources on different islands understanding water resources availability at this scale is useful for water managers to compare policies and regulations between different jurisdictions for example in the state of hawaii water resource managers are currently very interested in constraining the effects of invasive vegetation on hydrologic variables which specifically relates to modification of aet since different plant species utilize water from different depths and with different efficiencies cavaleri et al 2014 brewington et al 2017 on the island of oahu where et makes up 55 of the total water budget management of invasive forest species may prove to be a useful practice for increasing groundwater recharge and thus groundwater availability however on tutuila this practice is likely to be less impactful considering that aet typically already matches pet and also considering that a much smaller fraction of tutuila s total rainfall is evapotranspired in comparison to oahu 4 2 effects of land cover and climate change scenarios a caveat that must be considered before examining the future climate and land cover scenario results is that the climate projections we used here wang and zhang 2016 are only representative of a single regional climate model result developed with a single downscaling technique different climate projections and gcms can vary widely in part reflecting the inherent uncertainty between different downscaling methods brewington et al 2019 mair et al 2019 for example in hawaii comparison between statistically downscaled climate models timm and diaz 2009 elison timm et al 2015 and dynamically downscaled models zhang et al 2016 shows strongly divergent rainfall trends in certain parts of the islands however for tutuila the wang and zhang 2016 projections are the only downscaled gcm results available for the region at this time additional limitations and assumptions of the swb2 model and future scenarios are detailed in section 3 of the supplementary material when considering future land cover results it should also be remembered that the future land cover maps were produced by expanding or reducing the existing footprints of present day land cover types but not significantly modifying their locations while it is reasonable to assume that large shifts in the mixture and the locations of particular land covers are unlikely to occur it is possible that large swaths of land could one day be subject to a drastic change in their land cover makeup which would not be represented by our land cover scenarios with these considerations in mind the most apparent change seen in all the scenarios was the overwhelming effect of projected future precipitation increases sensitivity tests showed that rainfall was the most important driver of the water budget table 2 so this finding can easily be expected in a broad sense increases in precipitation would be a major boon to water resources managers as the availability of groundwater and surface water should significantly increase increases in groundwater recharge would also help to mitigate drinking water salinity issues in areas affected by upcoming from excessive groundwater withdrawal rates however a more nuanced analysis of our scenarios showed possible implications that may be less welcome whereas the increase in future groundwater recharge was predicted to be about equivalent to the increase in precipitation increases in surface runoff were significantly higher up to 50 more than present day surface runoff on an island wide annual scale and often more than double present day surface runoff magnitudes on monthly scales sensitivity testing corroborated the large impact that runoff and specifically cns have on groundwater recharge considering the model was found to be about as sensitive to the cns as it was to precipitation with increased surface runoff comes increased flooding which is already a major issue in tutuila s present day landscape leta et al 2017 because the finest temporal resolution our water budget approach allows for is monthly the model cannot provide assessment of event scale effects or changes in precipitation intensity however these sub daily factors most certainly have a significant impact on the overall water budget as well and should be explored more thoroughly with other types of hydrologic models in the future interestingly the model predicted that aet would not be much higher in any of the future scenarios likely due to the fact that even in the present day scenario tutuila s already high rainfall provides ample soil moisture driving aet to approximate pet most of the time as has been seen in other tropical high rainfall areas bidlake et al 1993 izuka et al 2005 sensitivity test results suggested that air temperatures were likely to be the most important parameter controlling evaporative losses especially because canopy interception parameters had very little effect 3 on recharge however it should also be noted that air temperature values examined in sensitivity tests were much larger than the changes predicted by the gsm climate models which only predicted increases of 3 4 in maximum and minimum average monthly temperatures for both of the emissions scenarios examining the effects of land cover scenarios alone without future climate change provided insight into how effective land cover management activities might be in influencing groundwater recharge rates interestingly we found that despite the fairly significant changes in recharge caused by conversion of various land cover types to other types on local cell by cell scales the effects on recharge under the land cover change narratives were limited one reason these scenarios did not show much island wide impact is the prevalence of very steep forested land on tutuila that is costly to develop for any human use these areas are also where the island experiences its highest precipitation rates and thus its highest groundwater recharge because these steep mountainous areas will probably always remain undeveloped only the lower elevation areas with less influence on recharge are able to drive change another reason for the small simulated changes in recharge was the broad mixture of different and potentially competing effects bundled within each of the land cover change scenarios for example the footprint of impervious surfaces increased dramatically in both of the growth scenarios scenarios 1 and 3 but these scenarios also included increases in agroforest land cover which grew at the expense of developed woodlands and open space land covers both of which produce relatively less recharge than agroforest therefore in these scenarios a decrease in recharge from more impervious surfaces was offset by an increase in recharge from changing less recharge efficient land covers to more efficient agroforest or cultivated land the socio economic driver of both these changes was the same this being the conversion of low economic value land cover types such as open space to higher value ones either for residential purposes buildings roads or economic ones development in the agricultural sector this result also demonstrated the importance of maintaining cultural practices such as traditional samoan agroforestry and indicated that economic development does not always necessitate environmental degradation from a water resources perspective while the interactions between different land cover changes can convolute the water budget effects of each one these complex interactions nonetheless provided a more nuanced and likely depiction of future conditions based on current trends and existing socioeconomic drivers we contend this method is preferable to the alternative of arbitrarily changing land cover parameters and running the model repeatedly without incorporating the valuable knowledge and experience of local stakeholders and water resources managers 5 conclusions this study details the first high resolution water budget model developed for an entire high basaltic island within the south pacific convergence zone this in addition to application of the model to project future conditions under both climate change and land cover change scenarios make this project one of the more rigorous assessments of present and future water resources availability in the south pacific region to date because the model was developed with the goal of stakeholder engagement and use in mind we applied a participatory approach to developing future land cover scenarios and we constructed and hosted the model on an open source software development platform to make results available and reproducible present day model results indicate that of tutuila s annual average of 1 490 ml d of precipitation 23 was lost to evaporation 21 was discharged as surface runoff and 56 or 827 ml d plus another 57 ml d of direct infiltration became groundwater recharge comparison to water budget studies from similar islands showed that tutuila had a higher rate of recharge relative to precipitation which we attributed to higher rainfall amounts and intensities found in the spcz relative to other regions also tutuila s unique geology which imparts very high permeabilities to parts of the island may contribute to this effect as well the dynamically downscaled gcm projections we used indicate an increase in annual average precipitation of 11 and 18 in their rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively by the end of century this translated to island wide groundwater recharge increases of 8 and 14 respectively while increases in recharge roughly mirrored increases in precipitation showing that precipitation is a primary driver of groundwater recharge increases in surface runoff were significantly higher on the order of 50 more for the future scenarios this indicated that while water resources availability may increase in the future it will not be without consequences likely in the form of increased flooding land cover scenarios showed how conversion of vegetated types to more urbanized types could result in localized reductions in recharge of up to 20 however on an island wide scale we found our stakeholder informed land cover change narratives caused only limited effects on groundwater recharge this result could be partially attributed to the offsetting effects of increases in urbanization with concurrent increases in cultivated land and agroforest which served to increase recharge relative to developed land

8254,study region oceania south pacific polynesia study focus changing climates have the potential to significantly impact global water resources availability on many volcanic islands groundwater is the primary drinking water source thereby making it essential to manage this limited resource carefully in this study we developed high temporal and spatial resolution groundwater recharge estimates for the island of tutuila american samoa using the soil water balance 2 swb2 model additionally we predicted future recharge by running the calibrated model with combinations of dynamically downscaled general circulation climate model gcm predictions and future land cover scenarios developed collectively with local stakeholder groups new hydrological insights present day results indicate 57 of tutuila s rainfall becomes groundwater recharge 8 evaporates from the canopy 15 evapotranspires and 20 discharges as stormflow runoff future climate scenarios suggest recharge may increase by 8 or 14 depending on global emissions land cover was a less significant driver of hydrologic change although increases in impervious surfaces showed a negative impact on recharge this work is maintained as an active open source project on github the world s leading software development platform thereby enhancing transparency reproducibility and participation from stakeholders and managers in american samoa

sustainability of essential resources keywords groundwater recharge climate change island sustainability land cover natural resource management scenario planning 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of drinking water on most volcanic islands and tutuila the main island in the u s territory of american samoa is no exception e g peterson 1972 izuka et al 2007 join et al 2016 in these isolated locations the importance of limited water resources necessitates their careful management because drinking water availability is fundamentally controlled by groundwater recharge in these settings accurate recharge estimates are essential for developing well informed water resources management strategies e g falkland and brunel 1993 gingerich and oki 2000 xu and singh 2004 in a changing world sustainable resource management must also consider drivers of future resource availability such as changes in climate and land cover american samoa has already begun to measurably experience effects of climate change the number of days above 32 c has increased by over 240 since the 1960 s and the frequency of extreme rainfall events has increased and is projected to increase even more in years to come menne et al 2012 keener et al 2018 in addition to climatic drivers changes in land cover resulting from american samoa s continued economic development could also influence groundwater recharge rates in american samoa a remote island archipelago in the south pacific groundwater meets the domestic needs of over 90 of the island s residents shuler and eyre 2018 however this supply is subject to numerous stressors including saltwater intrusion from over pumping high losses caused by leaky water mains and surface water contamination in the island s highest producing aquifers izuka 1999 asepa 2014 shuler et al 2019 therefore water managers critically need the best available information to make proactive rather than reactive planning decisions unfortunately accurate assessment of groundwater availability is often limited by uncertainty or poor discretization in recharge because this parameter is difficult if not impossible to directly measure scanlon et al 2002 this makes detailed quantification and spatial mapping of inputs to and outputs from the groundwater system essential for informed water management and guiding planning and policy into the future common approaches for quantifying groundwater recharge include analytical regression equations e g shade and nichols 1996 surface water models e g arnold et al 1998 coupled saturated unsaturated zone models e g brunner and simmons 2012 and water budget models such as the soil water balance swb method amongst others e g westenbroek et al 2010 for regional scale groundwater management studies the swb method is generally considered to be reliable due to its versatility across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and the method has been widely used to assess future water availability through climate scenarios and assessment of change in other water budget drivers scanlon et al 2002 xu and singh 2004 healy 2010 brewington et al 2019 the swb method integrates long term climate records with geospatial data and is particularly effective for modeling tropical islands with high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation and other hydrologic processes e g mair et al 2013 engott et al 2017 westenbroek et al 2018 a significant challenge for predicting future climate impacts on small scale features such as high oceanic islands is the fact that global scale general circulation models gcms are not resolved enough to represent the climate patterns and steep orographic rainfall gradients that drive island scale climate variability schroeder 1993 daly et al 2006 for example over a distance of 4 km between tutuila s highest point and pago pago airport annual rainfall more than doubles from 275 cm to 575 cm in comparison most gcms have cell size resolutions on the order of 50 100 km a distance that exceeds the diameter of most basaltic islands timm and diaz 2009 therefore to be useful in these settings climate predictions must be downscaled using dynamical or statistical methods to more accurately represent the significant climatic variability of high basaltic islands e g elison timm et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 wang and zhang 2016 until recently no downscaled climate models have been available for the samoan region however wang and zhang 2016 produced the first high resolution dynamically downscaled climate products for american samoa which now provide the opportunity to assess the effects of future climate on water resources at a highly resolved scale another challenge in modeling future water resources is uncertainty in land cover change humans have dramatically affected the hydrologic cycle through land cover alteration abbott et al 2019 in pacific islands anthropogenic land cover change has been linked to disruption of hydrologic processes such as stream baseflow cloud water interception infiltration soil moisture parameters and surface water runoff loague et al 1996 ziegler and giambelluca 1998 kagawa et al 2009 takahashi et al 2011 perkins et al 2012 izuka et al 2018 expansion of impervious surfaces associated with human development increases surface runoff thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and other water budget components e g nhep 2007 chithra et al 2015 increasing population and development pressure in american samoa makes continued landscape change all but inevitable crews and lawson 2015 however development patterns are difficult to predict as they are tied to a multitude of social environmental and economic factors veldkamp and lambin 2001 han et al 2015 therefore scenario based approaches to modeling land cover change are commonly used to account for this uncertainty and to create informed products that are reflective of potential management actions hulse et al 2004 soliva et al 2008 kepner et al 2012 brewington et al 2017 to consolidate rich and varied ideas from multiple sets of participants scenario planning often organizes individual predictions into sets of stories or narratives that are plausible thought provoking relevant and different enough from each other to facilitate meaningful comparison nps 2013 participatory development of scenarios with relevant stakeholder groups helps to not only produce well informed predictions but also increases stakeholder engagement and acceptance of the products argent and grayson 2003 in this study we produced the first high resolution data driven assessment of island wide groundwater recharge on a high basaltic island within the south pacific convergence zone spcz prior to this study only speculative estimates of groundwater recharge have been available for islands in the south pacific nullet 1987 döll and fiedler 2008 and these are generally based on global scale climatic parameters thereby disregarding local scale orographic effects we developed recharge and water budget estimates for tutuila island with the soil water balance 2 swb2 water budget model by incorporating up to date high resolution input data within a reproducible and open source modeling framework by substituting dynamically downscaled end of century climate predictions into the model we also assessed how projected changes in rainfall and temperature may directly affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of groundwater recharge in addition we worked with stakeholders in american samoa to develop future land cover narratives based on their understanding of present and future economic and environmental drivers we then used geospatial land cover expansion and contraction algorithms to produce a set of possible future land cover scenario maps representing each narrative future climate and land cover scenarios were combined to produce eleven possible groundwater recharge futures these scenarios help to frame the likely extreme cases in groundwater recharge by the end of the century this study is the first of its kind to undertake such a comprehensive approach to modeling water resources availability in the present and future within the south pacific region 1 1 study area the island of tutuila fig 1 located near 14 s and 170 w is the main population center of american samoa and at 142 km2 is the third largest island in the samoan hot spot island chain due to its position within the south pacific convergence zone the island experiences abundant year round rainfall with increased precipitation during the wet season from october to may monthly average rainfall in the wet season is roughly twice that of the dry season s still significant rainfall amounts rainfall varies considerably with location and elevation and ranges between 175 cm yr near the tafuna airport up to more than 500 cm yr along the crest of the highest mountains nws 2000 daly et al 2006 strong tropical storms and hurricanes also influence the region about once every other year and an average of 25 30 significant thunderstorms affect the island annually kennedy and chilton consulting engineers 1987 tutuila consists of two distinct regions 1 the tafuna leone plain a highly permeable rejuvenated phase lava delta which due to its low slope contains concentrated human development and 2 the remainder of the island a mountainous assemblage of pleistocene age shield volcanoes that generally consist of lower permeability rock stearns 1944 2 methods 2 1 swb2 water budget model to develop spatially and temporally distributed estimates of groundwater recharge we used the u s geological survey usgs swb2 model an open source code based on a modified thornthwaite and mather 1955 soil water balance approach westenbroek et al 2010 2018 the swb2 model is particularly suitable for sites on tropical basaltic islands such as tutuila westenbroek et al 2018 the model applies a rectangular gridded approach and uses a daily time step for soil moisture processing though due to input data resolution outputs are limited to monthly or annual time steps for this project we implemented our modeling framework with jupyter notebooks kluyver et al 2016 for the purpose of making the results and methodology open and as reproducible as possible all of the model input data code and output files are open source under the gnu general public license v3 0 and archived permanently on github shuler et al 2020 users familiar with the python environment can download and run the model with minimal effort major benefits of developing scientific models within the open source paradigm include enhanced reproducibility and transparency as well as providing the opportunity for end users to modify or substitute different input datasets assess different scenarios or change the cell size resolution as desired 2 2 input datasets all input datasets were collected from existing publications or documented resources and are described below with references to their sources provided an expanded version of the methods we used is available in section 2 of this manuscript s supplementary material 2 2 1 precipitation the swb2 model requires spatially distributed precipitation data in a gridded format while the model runs on a daily time step to account for antecedent soil moisture conditions daily resolution precipitation datasets are uncommon for isolated oceanic islands this problem was handled by applying the method of fragments oki 2002 westenbroek et al 2018 which disaggregates monthly gridded rainfall data by allocating fractions of monthly precipitation totals into individual days based on observed daily rainfall patterns from rain gauge records for the present day precipitation we used 90 m by 90 m gridded monthly rainfall data covering the entire island of tutuila daly et al 2006 we applied the method of fragments by supplying the model with daily precipitation records from 18 distinct rain gauging stations scattered throughout tutuila nws 2000 shuler and mariner 2019 2 2 2 evapotranspiration we used island wide monthly resolution potential evapotranspiration pet data developed by izuka et al 2005 by using the penman 1948 method actual evapotranspiration rates aet were calculated by the swb2 model using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 2 2 3 land cover and soil types site specific land cover parameters were assigned via a high resolution wildlife habitat map meyer et al 2016 developed using an object based remote sensing approach on high resolution orthoimagery and island wide lidar data water budget parameters including rooting zone depth canopy storage capacity trunk storage capacity stem flow fractions and curve numbers associated with each land cover type were parameterized using a tabular lookup table from westenbroek et al 2018 which provided equivalent parameters for the island of maui hawaii as there are no known site specific studies constraining these parameters for american samoa table 1 an island wide soil study of tutuila was completed by nakamura 1984 and includes descriptions of each soil type predictions of soil behavior suitability of each soil type for specified uses and hydrologic soil groupings we used these data to develop gridded datasets of hydrologic soil groups and soil moisture capacity 2 2 4 direct infiltration anthropogenic activities can significantly affect the spatial distribution of water balance components through irrigation infrastructure leakage and wastewater disposal while no crop irrigation is documented on tutuila a large fraction of water in the municipal delivery system is lost to underground water leakage termed non revenue water nrw we estimated island wide nrw from american samoa power authority aspa records to be approximately 23 ml d or about 56 of all water produced from pumping wells on tutuila shuler and eyre 2018 no data were available on the distribution of water line leakage so we included nrw in the model as direct infiltration by equally distributing 23 ml d across all model cells that intersected with water main locations as provided by aspa in addition to nwr direct infiltration from on site wastewater disposal system osds leachate was also added to the model using data from local stakeholders as doc 2009 and methods based on those used by shuler et al 2017 2 2 5 mountain front recharge infiltration on the tafuna leone plain is enhanced by the process of mountain front recharge mfr where surface waters and overland runoff from watersheds above the plain infiltrate into streambeds or soil once reaching a more permeable geologic substrate this process is analogous to the mfr frequently observed in arid climates wilson and guan 2004 and its occurrence on tutuila has been previously described for this study we used the previously constrained information from izuka et al 2007 and perreault 2010 to determine the spatial extent and estimated magnitude of mfr on the tafuna leone plain 2 2 6 surface runoff the swb2 model provides two options for quantifying surface runoff the curve number cn method cronshey 1986 and an externally supplied runoff ratio method with the cn method swb2 performs an internal calculation of surface runoff woodward et al 2003 this method relies on supplying the model with cns which are typically looked up from published values based on soil type and vegetation cover because published cns exist for most general land cover and soil types this method can be applied quickly and broadly however published cns are a generalization and can only approximate actual runoff conditions at field sites and very few studies have actually developed cns specifically for volcanic island sites cooley and lane 1982 swb2 also provides the option of using measured runoff to rainfall ratios r r ratios as determined for individual watersheds through analysis of field data while r r ratios are based on directly measured field data this method s limitation is the difficulty and cost of measuring streamflow and precipitation across the entire landscape which for tutuila would equate to continuously gauging at least 83 perennial streams for this study we used data from current and historical gauges wong 1996 usgs 2018 shuler and el kadi 2018 shuler and mariner 2019 to calculate monthly r r ratios for 15 basins throughout tutuila ratios from gauged watersheds can be interpolated or mapped to ungauged watersheds through regression equations but this technique is limited in its accuracy and lack of validation making surface runoff one of the most difficult parts of the water budget method to constrain engott et al 2017 2 3 model calibration and sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 curve number calibration to address the limitations of each of the runoff calculation methods mentioned above we developed a procedure to benefit from the strengths of both we first ran the swb2 model using the r r ratio method for the fifteen watersheds where continuous record streamflow data was available we then extracted the mean annual groundwater recharge from each basin area to be used as calibration data for optimizing cns in these watersheds we then switched the swb2 model to run using the cn method and wrapped the whole model into a single python function with the cns as free parameters we applied an optimization function to calibrate each of the cns for each land cover type the calibrated cns were then applied to the island wide model for the final model runs the resulting tutuila specific cn values are shown in table 1 overall the calibrated cns for tutuila were lower than the initial from maui cns for most of the human impacted land cover types developed lands and cultivated areas and were higher for grassland and native forest land covers this is reasonable and reflects the generally more rural nature of tutuila as compared to maui 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of different input parameters on model outputs we conducted a sensitivity analysis on both the tabular parameters associated with different land covers as well as those spatial parameters with numerical as opposed to geographic uncertainty sensitivity test parameters included precipitation pet maximum and minimum daily temperatures direct infiltration from anthropogenic sources cns rooting depth canopy storage capacity trunk storage capacity and stemflow fraction each of the model input parameters were multiplied by six different test factors 50 75 90 110 125 and 150 the model was run repeatedly changing each parameter by each test factor to assess how the primary model output parameter island wide groundwater recharge was affected by relative change in each input parameter effects of using different fragment sets for daily rainfall distributions was also tested by running the model with five unique fragment sets which yielded a mean difference from the base case of 3 4 all other sensitivity analysis results are shown in table 2 2 4 future climate and land cover scenarios 2 4 1 dynamically downscaled climate projections wang and zhang 2016 produced dynamically downscaled mid and late 21st century climate projection datasets for tutuila at an 800m 800m grid resolution their projections included three scenarios 1 modeled present day climate calculated for the years 1990 2009 2 future climate 2080 2099 reflecting a lower carbon emissions scenario rcp4 5 and 3 future climate 2080 2099 climate reflecting a higher emissions scenario rcp8 5 overall both of the future climate scenarios indicated projected increases in temperature as well as significant increases in precipitation island wide future climate scenarios were incorporated in the tutuila swb2 model by substituting the original monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature grids with grids from wang and zhang 2016 the swb2 evapotranspiration method was also changed to internally calculate pet with the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 so the effects of air temperature change could be considered 2 5 development of participatory land cover change narratives the process of developing future land cover change narratives started with interviewing over twenty representatives from seven government and educational agencies on tutuila interviews were conducted with staff at the american samoa environmental protection agency asepa the american samoa community college ascc the american samoa power authority aspa the department of public works dpw the american samoa department of commerce asdoc the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s coastal zone management program noaa czmp and the coral reef advisory group crag interviewees were presented with information about the project and were asked to discuss the specific drivers of land cover change on the island and their thoughts and assumptions regarding what future economic and land cover decisions were likely to be made in the future we compiled all notes from these discussions and organized them into three specific themes related by likely drivers of change each is represented by one of the three separate land cover narratives detailed below we then developed geospatial land cover change algorithms to automatically modify the meyer et al 2016 land cover map into scenario maps that represented each of the three narratives to assess effects of future climate and land cover together we then ran the swb2 model using all 12 combinations of present and future land cover and climate scenarios each of which is summarized in table 3 2 5 1 geospatial land cover change algorithms to produce future land cover maps representing changes outlined in the future land cover narratives we developed a series of geospatial algorithms within jupyter notebooks to modify the original meyer et al 2016 land cover map via a series of computational steps enacted through the use of an expansion function that redistributed the proportion of land under different land cover types this method was designed to make the process more reproducible and transparent than methods that use direct editing of features and it also preserved the existing distribution of land cover types across the island to avoid bias inherent in manual edits fig 2 shows static maps of land cover change scenarios and animated high resolution land cover change maps are provided as supplementary material figs 1 3 and in this project s associated github repository https github com cshuler tutuila swb scenarios 2 5 2 land cover change narrative 1 economic boom and unrestricted growth the unrestricted growth narrative represents a possible future where socio economic conditions lead to an increase in population and development which is allowed to proceed without zoning or regulation fig 2 the stakeholders identified potential drivers of this change including 1 new telework jobs from improved telecommunications infrastructure 2 increased growth driven by the tourism sector 3 geopolitical conditions resulting in increased immigration specific land cover changes included 1 new development on the now forested aasu uplands fig 1 2 an increase in island wide impervious surfaces by 96 from 8 3 km2 to 16 3 km2 including a 13 0 8 km2 loss of developed open space and 63 3 3 km2 loss of developed woodlands surrounding residential and commercial areas 3 an island wide increase in agroforestry plantations by 44 from 8 1 km2 to 11 8 km2 4 an increase in cultivated land of 7 from 10 9 km2 to 11 8 km2 5 expansion of developed land covers into adjacent undeveloped areas with slopes 25 resulting in reduction of lowland rainforest by 7 or 6 1 km2 6 infiltration from osds units was increased by 96 7 in addition to scenario specific drivers effects of 1 m of sea level rise slr were included in the algorithm by changing all coastal land covers that intersected with 1 m slr flood zones noaa ocm 2016 except for bare rock to mangrove land cover 2 5 3 land cover change narrative 2 population attrition this narrative represents a future of economic contraction that causes tutuila s population to shrink fig 2 specific drivers discussed with stakeholders included 1 shutdown of the tuna cannery the island s largest private employer 2 increase in natural disasters such as coastal flooding and severe cyclones due to climate change and 3 reduction in economic opportunity due to losses of external funding and reduction in government jobs changes to the land cover map included 1 a 52 reduction in cultivated land from 11 0 km2 to 5 2 km2 and a 11 reduction in agroforestry plantations from 8 2 km2 to 7 2 km2 island wide 2 an island wide decrease in impervious surfaces by 33 from 8 3 km2 to 5 6 km2 and a decrease in open space by 35 from 6 9 km2 to 4 5 km2 3 direct net infiltration from osds units was decreased by 33 4 reduced population pressure may reduce the need for residents to live in areas prone to flooding to represent migration away from these areas we identified all structures and impervious surfaces within 4 m of a stream and changed these land cover types to open space in addition all land covers except for bare rock within the 1 m slr flood zone on the coastline were converted to mangroves as described in narrative 1 2 5 4 land cover change narrative 3 population boom with enhanced zoning and management the managed growth narrative represents growth conditions as described in the unrestricted growth narrative but with additional controls on development through new zoning and land management regulations fig 2 possible regulatory actions we considered were identified through discussions with stakeholders and included 1 designation of new or enforcement of existing special management areas smas designed to protect and enlarge ecologically significant remnant areas of native ecosystems 2 protection of existing undeveloped lowland rainforest 3 management of riparian corridors 4 support for more agroforestry plantations and 4 development of green infrastructure and buffer zones in areas vulnerable to coastal flooding the land cover change algorithm for this narrative reflected these activities by 1 delineation of smas and conversion of land cover in smas to native lowland forest specifically smas included a the sparsely developed malaeimi valley area b lowland rainforest on the tafuna plain c the aasu uplands fig 1 and d all existing wetland areas 2 all existing lowland rainforest was preserved this plus conservation of smas resulted in an increase in rainforest by 0 3 85 8 km2 to 86 1 km2 3 agroforestry plantations were increased by 52 from 8 2 km2 to 12 5 km2 4 riparian development buffers were represented by converting all buildings and impervious surfaces within 5 m of a stream into open space 5 coastal flooding buffer zones were created by replacing all land cover types except for bare rock in the 2 m slr flood zones noaa ocm 2016 with mangroves 6 population expansion was accommodated through densification of existing land cover represented by an island wide increase in impervious surfaces of 64 from 8 3 km2 to 13 7 km2 and decreases in open space and developed woodlands by 20 6 9 km2 to 5 5 km2 and 65 5 3 km2 to 1 9 km2 respectively 7 direct net infiltration from osds units was increased by 64 3 results 3 1 present day water budget summarized at an island wide scale mean annual groundwater recharge calculated by the present day base case swb2 model was 884 ml d total mean annual island wide water inputs included precipitation 1490 ml d and direct infiltration from water lines osds 38 ml d groundwater recharge was the largest output component of the water budget representing 57 of the total mean annual island wide water inputs other water budget components on the output side included canopy interception and actual evapotranspiration representing 125 ml d or 8 and 228 ml d or 15 of total water inputs respectively island wide runoff was initially calculated to be 313 ml d or 21 of total water inputs of which 19 ml d was captured and re introduced to the model as mfr thereby reducing the amount of surface runoff lost to the sea to 294 ml d or 20 of water inputs fig 3 water inputs totaled 1 528 ml d which accounted for 99 8 of the 1 531 ml d of summed water outputs thereby leaving a model mass balance error of less than 0 3 likely due to rounding or differences in resolution during post processing while we primarily report results at an annual island wide resolution swb2 produces finely resolved netcdf outputs that can be summarized at higher temporal and spatial resolutions watershed scale and monthly resolution results are available within this project s associated github repository https github com cshuler tutuila swb scenarios monthly resolution outputs were also examined to assess seasonal patterns predictably the annual distributions of recharge et and runoff followed the same pattern as rainfall with the absolute magnitude of all water budget components falling in the dry season austral winter and rising in the wet season fig 4 a however different patterns emerged when comparing the fraction of total precipitation allocated to each water budget component fig 4 b in dry season months et generally exceeded surface runoff but the model predicted the reverse during the wet season recharge dominated the water budget all year but the ratio of recharge over monthly precipitation in the dry season was somewhat higher than during the wet season these patterns may be caused by changes in rainfall intensity throughout the year as tutuila receives more intense convective storms in the austral summer 3 2 results future climate scenarios on the average annual scale both the high and moderate emissions future climate scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 project significant island wide increases in annual precipitation on the order of 11 and 18 respectively because precipitation is the main driver of the water budget island wide annual groundwater recharge totals showed a commensurate increase of 8 and 14 for the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively fig 5 annual island wide et increased from the base case only marginally by 0 6 and 1 1 but annual surface runoff increased dramatically by 31 and 49 which drove a corresponding increase in mfr of 11 and 17 for the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively monthly resolution downscaled projections showed an interesting result where the present day wet and dry season precipitation signals were absent from the downscaled model s monthly totals with precipitation varying fairly randomly throughout the year supplementary material figs 4 and 5 prepetition totals for all future projected months were always above the present day monthly totals but the additional amounts varied significantly tropical cyclones are one major driver of precipitation in tutuila s wet season and wang and zhang 2016 call attention to their projections showing a significantly decreased frequency of weak and strong tropical cyclones over american samoa this might account for at least part of the decay of the typical seasonal rainfall signal 3 3 results future land cover scenarios effects of changes in land cover alone without climate scenarios were most pronounced at the sub watershed scale whereas a large proportion of individual model cells showed increases or decreases in key water balance components of over 20 fig 6 however once the differences were summed at the watershed scale these patchwork changes balanced out to the point where the greatest predicted change in groundwater recharge for any of the land cover scenarios was about 3 seen in three to five of the island s most affected watersheds for each scenario at the island wide scale the changes averaged out even more yielding annual recharge percent differences difference between the present day and future land cover scenarios of 0 35 0 59 and 0 66 for the unrestricted growth scenario the population attrition scenario and the managed growth scenarios respectively table 3 while quite small these changes nonetheless followed an expected pattern where both of the growth scenarios predicted slightly less recharge and the population attrition scenario predicted a slight increase in recharge the magnitudes of change in whole island aet and surface runoff were more significant with aet decreasing by 11 in the attrition scenario and increasing by 8 and 0 5 for the two growth scenarios runoff increased by 3 0 6 and 5 3 for the unrestricted growth the population attrition and the managed growth scenarios respectively nonetheless despite the limited change in recharge on watershed or larger scales we were also able to isolate the effects from changing each land cover type to any of the other types in isolation by analyzing the scenario results on a cell by cell basis this was done by filtering only those individual cells that were assigned a specific land cover type in the base case and were then changed to another land cover type in one of the future scenarios this analysis essentially provided a controlled experiment to assess the effects of changes driven only by varying a single land cover in isolation we processed 132 of these experiments for each of the three scenarios 12 land cover types that can change to one of the 11 other types and in summary found that the most impactful changes in recharge were generally seen when more vegetated land covers such as cultivated or forested land were changed to a developed land cover type such as impervious surfaces most notably and considering results of all three scenarios when native lowland forest was changed to impervious surfaces recharge was generally reduced by about 20 changing lowland forest to open space or developed woodlands also reduced recharge by about 6 and 12 respectively generally conversion of lowland rainforest to agroforest or cultivated land generally only produced reductions in recharge on the order of 1 3 and sometimes even increased recharge by a small amount when future land cover and future climate scenarios were combined the effects of the dramatic increase in island wide precipitation was the strongest driver of change the magnitude of recharge and aet in the combined scenarios were approximately the same as the additive effects of the climate and land cover scenarios alone however it is interesting to note that for all scenario combinations the model predicted small but significant increases in runoff beyond the additive impacts of the climate or land cover scenarios alone with these additional differences ranging between 0 3 and 3 3 more surface runoff 4 discussion 4 1 comparison to other water budget studies although this study details the first known island wide high resolution groundwater recharge estimate conducted for tutuila a former usgs study authored by izuka et al 2007 developed a similar water budget for just the western portion of tutuila using the hawaii water budget code comparison between our study and the izuka et al 2007 work showed reasonably similar results based on calculation of water budget components within the equivalent area of western tutuila specifically our annual resolution water fluxes in w tutuila were within 2 difference for precipitation 12 difference for runoff 14 difference for et and 15 difference for recharge with negative values indicating comparatively more water calculated by the izuka model part of the difference between the models can be attributed to the fact that the izuka et al 2007 study did not include additional recharge contributed by direct net infiltration from osds units or leaking water lines which our study calculated to be about 4 of the total swb2 calculated recharge another difference can be attributed to our use of calibrated cns whereas the previous work used a single runoff to rainfall ratio to parameterize runoff across the entire model domain regardless comparison between the two studies helps to support the reasonableness of our swb2 calculated water budget estimates as well as those produced by the izuka et al group comparison between tutuila s water budget and water budgets of similar island environments can also be useful for examining differences between the large scale hydrology of different regions to do this we consolidated as many other water budget studies as possible from other high basaltic islands in the pacific basin we considered only those studies that used high resolution spatially distributed models to calculate island wide water budgets one obvious difference between tutuila and other islands is the large 50 fraction of precipitation that our and the izuka et al 2007 models allocated to groundwater recharge table 4 shows these differences by normalizing major water budget components by island wide volumetric precipitation on most of the hawaiian islands jeju island and guam aet is the dominant water budget output whereas aet only represented about a quarter of the water budget output on tutuila this is likely due to tutuila s location within the spcz which is characteristically cloudy and rainy as a result of the prevalence of large scale convective systems vincent 1994 whereas the other islands in this comparison all lie outside of the spcz and itcz salinger et al 2014 on average tutuila receives nearly twice the rainfall of the other islands in this comparison with the rainier western portion of the tutuila receiving a region wide annual average of 458 cm of rainfall according to izuka et al 2007 the larger number of cloudy days on tutuila also serves to reduce incoming net radiation a key driver of pet this in conjunction with frequent year round rainfall events keeps soil moisture availability high thereby driving aet to approximate pet on tutuila much of the time izuka et al 2007 with available radiative energy limiting the amount of water that can be evaporated it is reasonable for tutuila s surface runoff and groundwater recharge to be higher than in other islands such as guam where average solar radiation is higher kabir et al 2017 however we calculated tutuila s recharge to be nearly three times larger than surface runoff and proportionally tutuila s recharge was the highest of any of the other islands examined this might be explained by tutuila s hydrogeology whereas a relatively large portion of the island the tafuna leone plain is composed of young highly permeable lava flows the plain makes up about 22 of the island s land mass and as izuka et al 2007 states is devoid of drainage features indicating very little of the rainfall or surface runoff from the mountains above actually makes it to the sea this is analogous to the leeward side of the big island of hawaii where young permeable lavas also reduce surface runoff fractions to minimal amounts indeed the water budget for the big island indicates higher relative recharge and lower relative surface runoff fractions compared to the other islands engott 2011 these differences show how other hydrologic factors besides precipitation amounts can influence the overall availability of water resources on different islands understanding water resources availability at this scale is useful for water managers to compare policies and regulations between different jurisdictions for example in the state of hawaii water resource managers are currently very interested in constraining the effects of invasive vegetation on hydrologic variables which specifically relates to modification of aet since different plant species utilize water from different depths and with different efficiencies cavaleri et al 2014 brewington et al 2017 on the island of oahu where et makes up 55 of the total water budget management of invasive forest species may prove to be a useful practice for increasing groundwater recharge and thus groundwater availability however on tutuila this practice is likely to be less impactful considering that aet typically already matches pet and also considering that a much smaller fraction of tutuila s total rainfall is evapotranspired in comparison to oahu 4 2 effects of land cover and climate change scenarios a caveat that must be considered before examining the future climate and land cover scenario results is that the climate projections we used here wang and zhang 2016 are only representative of a single regional climate model result developed with a single downscaling technique different climate projections and gcms can vary widely in part reflecting the inherent uncertainty between different downscaling methods brewington et al 2019 mair et al 2019 for example in hawaii comparison between statistically downscaled climate models timm and diaz 2009 elison timm et al 2015 and dynamically downscaled models zhang et al 2016 shows strongly divergent rainfall trends in certain parts of the islands however for tutuila the wang and zhang 2016 projections are the only downscaled gcm results available for the region at this time additional limitations and assumptions of the swb2 model and future scenarios are detailed in section 3 of the supplementary material when considering future land cover results it should also be remembered that the future land cover maps were produced by expanding or reducing the existing footprints of present day land cover types but not significantly modifying their locations while it is reasonable to assume that large shifts in the mixture and the locations of particular land covers are unlikely to occur it is possible that large swaths of land could one day be subject to a drastic change in their land cover makeup which would not be represented by our land cover scenarios with these considerations in mind the most apparent change seen in all the scenarios was the overwhelming effect of projected future precipitation increases sensitivity tests showed that rainfall was the most important driver of the water budget table 2 so this finding can easily be expected in a broad sense increases in precipitation would be a major boon to water resources managers as the availability of groundwater and surface water should significantly increase increases in groundwater recharge would also help to mitigate drinking water salinity issues in areas affected by upcoming from excessive groundwater withdrawal rates however a more nuanced analysis of our scenarios showed possible implications that may be less welcome whereas the increase in future groundwater recharge was predicted to be about equivalent to the increase in precipitation increases in surface runoff were significantly higher up to 50 more than present day surface runoff on an island wide annual scale and often more than double present day surface runoff magnitudes on monthly scales sensitivity testing corroborated the large impact that runoff and specifically cns have on groundwater recharge considering the model was found to be about as sensitive to the cns as it was to precipitation with increased surface runoff comes increased flooding which is already a major issue in tutuila s present day landscape leta et al 2017 because the finest temporal resolution our water budget approach allows for is monthly the model cannot provide assessment of event scale effects or changes in precipitation intensity however these sub daily factors most certainly have a significant impact on the overall water budget as well and should be explored more thoroughly with other types of hydrologic models in the future interestingly the model predicted that aet would not be much higher in any of the future scenarios likely due to the fact that even in the present day scenario tutuila s already high rainfall provides ample soil moisture driving aet to approximate pet most of the time as has been seen in other tropical high rainfall areas bidlake et al 1993 izuka et al 2005 sensitivity test results suggested that air temperatures were likely to be the most important parameter controlling evaporative losses especially because canopy interception parameters had very little effect 3 on recharge however it should also be noted that air temperature values examined in sensitivity tests were much larger than the changes predicted by the gsm climate models which only predicted increases of 3 4 in maximum and minimum average monthly temperatures for both of the emissions scenarios examining the effects of land cover scenarios alone without future climate change provided insight into how effective land cover management activities might be in influencing groundwater recharge rates interestingly we found that despite the fairly significant changes in recharge caused by conversion of various land cover types to other types on local cell by cell scales the effects on recharge under the land cover change narratives were limited one reason these scenarios did not show much island wide impact is the prevalence of very steep forested land on tutuila that is costly to develop for any human use these areas are also where the island experiences its highest precipitation rates and thus its highest groundwater recharge because these steep mountainous areas will probably always remain undeveloped only the lower elevation areas with less influence on recharge are able to drive change another reason for the small simulated changes in recharge was the broad mixture of different and potentially competing effects bundled within each of the land cover change scenarios for example the footprint of impervious surfaces increased dramatically in both of the growth scenarios scenarios 1 and 3 but these scenarios also included increases in agroforest land cover which grew at the expense of developed woodlands and open space land covers both of which produce relatively less recharge than agroforest therefore in these scenarios a decrease in recharge from more impervious surfaces was offset by an increase in recharge from changing less recharge efficient land covers to more efficient agroforest or cultivated land the socio economic driver of both these changes was the same this being the conversion of low economic value land cover types such as open space to higher value ones either for residential purposes buildings roads or economic ones development in the agricultural sector this result also demonstrated the importance of maintaining cultural practices such as traditional samoan agroforestry and indicated that economic development does not always necessitate environmental degradation from a water resources perspective while the interactions between different land cover changes can convolute the water budget effects of each one these complex interactions nonetheless provided a more nuanced and likely depiction of future conditions based on current trends and existing socioeconomic drivers we contend this method is preferable to the alternative of arbitrarily changing land cover parameters and running the model repeatedly without incorporating the valuable knowledge and experience of local stakeholders and water resources managers 5 conclusions this study details the first high resolution water budget model developed for an entire high basaltic island within the south pacific convergence zone this in addition to application of the model to project future conditions under both climate change and land cover change scenarios make this project one of the more rigorous assessments of present and future water resources availability in the south pacific region to date because the model was developed with the goal of stakeholder engagement and use in mind we applied a participatory approach to developing future land cover scenarios and we constructed and hosted the model on an open source software development platform to make results available and reproducible present day model results indicate that of tutuila s annual average of 1 490 ml d of precipitation 23 was lost to evaporation 21 was discharged as surface runoff and 56 or 827 ml d plus another 57 ml d of direct infiltration became groundwater recharge comparison to water budget studies from similar islands showed that tutuila had a higher rate of recharge relative to precipitation which we attributed to higher rainfall amounts and intensities found in the spcz relative to other regions also tutuila s unique geology which imparts very high permeabilities to parts of the island may contribute to this effect as well the dynamically downscaled gcm projections we used indicate an increase in annual average precipitation of 11 and 18 in their rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios respectively by the end of century this translated to island wide groundwater recharge increases of 8 and 14 respectively while increases in recharge roughly mirrored increases in precipitation showing that precipitation is a primary driver of groundwater recharge increases in surface runoff were significantly higher on the order of 50 more for the future scenarios this indicated that while water resources availability may increase in the future it will not be without consequences likely in the form of increased flooding land cover scenarios showed how conversion of vegetated types to more urbanized types could result in localized reductions in recharge of up to 20 however on an island wide scale we found our stakeholder informed land cover change narratives caused only limited effects on groundwater recharge this result could be partially attributed to the offsetting effects of increases in urbanization with concurrent increases in cultivated land and agroforest which served to increase recharge relative to developed land
