of mfcs and after continuous operation for 330 days the efficiency of removal of 10 mg l oxytetracycline in mfcs increased to 99 00 in 78 h whereas removal efficiency of only 58 26 was achieved in microbial controls compared to microbial controls higher atp concentration and persistent electrical stimulation mainly contributed to bioelectrochemical reactions more rapidly to enhance oxytetracycline removal in mfcs in addition the analysis of bacterial communities revealed that eubacterium spp as the main functional bacterial genus responsible for oxytetracycline biodegradation

concentration in the influent and abundance of args in effluent from mfcs nevertheless tp614 a transposase gene was found to be enriched in both mfcs and microbial reactors suggesting that it may be a common challenge for different biological processes for wastewater treatment this study therefore showed a lower probability of upregulation and transmission of args in mfcs when compared to a

received more attention during these biological treatments especially during long term operation positive correlations have been found between different args and between args and mobile genetic

solution ph 7 0 both the anolyte and catholyte were refreshed biweekly in batch mode and the maximum voltage reached 0 6 0 7 v after approximately 1 month when the mfcs were regarded as successfully developed then oxytetracycline served as a carbon source instead of sodium acetate in the anolyte and its concentration has been gradually increased from 0 5 to 10 mg l for the next 10 months all the reactors were kept in a dark incubator lrh 500f keerlrein instrument co ltd shanghai china to avoid photodegradation of oxytetracycline 2 4 analytical methods the analysis of high oxytetracycline

rarefaction curves were obtained by mothur analysis schloss et al 2011 the taxonomic identities of sequences were assigned on the qiime platform via the rdp classifier at a confidence level of 70 based on the bayesian algorithm wang et al 2007 2 7 ht qpcr this analysis of args was performed to measure the diversity and abundance of args using a smartchip real time pcr machine warfergen inc usa as described elsewhere with a modification su et al 2015 a total of 57 primer sets table s1 were used including one targeting the 16s rrna gene ten targeting mobile genetic elements containing eight transposase genes and two class i integrase genes seven targeting sulfonamides genes and 39 targeting tetracyclines genes the following thermal cycling conditions were set up initial denaturation at

data of averages standard deviations and fold changes of args were organized in excel 2010 microsoft usa args were considered statistically significantly enriched or depleted if the range consisting of three standard deviations of the mean fold change was entirely 1 0 or 1 0 respectively su et al 2015 principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance and a heatmap were generated by r language version 3 1 0 the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size algorithm lefse was applied to explore the statistically significantly features of microbial communities between different samples segata et al 2011 other plots were performed in origin pro 9 1 software originlab usa 3 result and discussion 3 1 removal of oxytetracycline the changes in oxytetracycline concentration after 1 month acclimation are illustrated in fig 1 a no obvious change in oxytetracycline concentration was observed in the abiotic control suggesting that carbon felt adsorption and oxytetracycline self degradation were negligible it was observed that after the 1 month acclimation the efficiency of removal of 0 6 mg l oxytetracycline by mfcs in 6 days was nearly 85 a little higher than that in the microbial control by contrast the oxytetracycline removal rate increased obviously after 10 month acclimation fig 1b the removal efficiency rates in the mfcs and in the microbial control were 99 00 and 58 30 respectively in contrast oxytetracycline concentration barely changed in the abiotic controls hence the decrease in oxytetracycline concentration in mfcs and in the microbial controls must be due at least in part to biodegradation and after long term acclimation bioelectrochemical reactions in mfcs apparently enhanced the oxytetracycline removal the results of the antibacterial assay of the effluents from mfcs by means of escherichia coli dh5α and shewanella oneidensis mr 1 revealed that the antibacterial ability of oxytetracycline parent modules and its metabolites were eliminated successfully after the bioreactor treatment fig s3 in mfcs the anode acted as an insoluble electron acceptor to quickly receive electrons generated by anodophilic bacteria the persistent electrical stimulation on the one hand promoted the growth and metabolic activity of exoelectrogenic bacteria that were involved in oxytetracycline metabolism and on the other hand might have made mfcs more suitable niches for the oxytetracycline degradation by increasing the metabolic reaction rates of microbes on the anode similar findings have been obtained in other studies cao et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 this function did not work in microbial controls and this is one of the reasons why mfcs showed higher removal efficiency than the microbial controls did in addition voltage output as an important indicator of the performance of mfcs was recorded during the 330 day operation fig s2 the voltage decreased sharply with oxytetracycline substitution for acetate as a substrate but gradually recovered during the acclimation process indicating that anodic microorganisms in mfcs could metabolize oxytetracycline to grow and to yield electricity with prolongation of the operation the microbes in mfcs colonized the electrodes tightly formed a solid network connected by nanowire like matrices fig s4 and showed higher microbial activity than that seen in microbial controls figs s5 and s6 the results therefore indicated that microbes in mfcs were more active at utilizing oxytetracycline for their reproduction than those in microbial controls 3 2 characterization of bacterial communities after the long term operation the succession of microbes played an indispensable role in enhancing oxytetracycline biodegradation in mfcs a total of 498 017 high quality sequences were recovered from all 13 samples which were clustered into 2674 otus at a similarity level of 97 00 table s2 the coverage indices and the flat rarefaction curves confirmed that most microbes were covered in this sequencing analysis fig s7 chao1 simpson and shannon indices suggested that long term oxytetracycline processing significantly reduced the microbial community richness and diversity especially in mfcs these data indicated that the role of anaerobic conditions coupled with electrical stimulation had a more profound selection effect on specializing functional species than that seen in microbial controls only under anaerobic conditions pcoa indicated that the substrate and operation mode both contributed to the shifts in the bacterial community fig 2 as confirmed by pcoa of weighted and unweighted unifrac distances fig s8 in depth analysis of the predominant taxa that illustrates the main differences between mfcs and microbial controls at different acclimation time points was carried out by the lefse algorithm fig 3 judging by statistically significant differences 32 biomarkers were found at an lda threshold of 4 0 fig 3b at the phylum level an obvious distinction between mfcs and microbial controls at two acclimation time points was observed and confirmed the conclusion about the effect of the carbon source and operation mode on microbial communities compared to other samples firmicutes as the dominant phylum was found to be greatly enriched to 94 70 in oxytetracycline fed mfcs fig s9 some studies on the microbial communities in mfcs fed different fermentation end products have shown that firmicutes play a vital role in the processing of complex substances kiely et al 2011 in addition our data are in agreement with other studies showing that firmicutes become the dominant phylum under long term antibiotic selection pressure li et al 2011 qiu et al 2013 the structure of the microbial communities at the class level manifested variation during the 330 day operation although lefse analysis did not yield this result the relative abundance of clostridia in oxytetracycline fed mfcs one of the most strictly anaerobic classes increased obviously from 71 0 to 93 6 fig s9 it has been reported that the peak voltage and charge in mfcs were tightly associated with the abundances of clostridiaceae lachnospiraceae and peptostreptococcaceae all belonging to clostridia implying that the clostridia class played a significant role in power generation in mfcs jiang et al 2016 in addition many bacteria belonging to clostridia can degrade a large array of complex carbohydrates to produce a wide range of simple metabolites like ethanol elsden et al 1976 gu et al 2014 it was noticeable here that α β and γ proteobacteria in oxytetracycline fed mfcs accounting for 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 and 0 8 1 6 respectively were still not eliminated after a long period of operation recent studies on removal of the chloramphenicol antibiotic by a biocathode revealed that α β and γ proteobacteria perform a significant function in the degradation of chloramphenicol liang et al 2013 in addition research has revealed that bacteria belonging to β and γ proteobacteria dominated in anoxic or aerobic membrane bioreactors processing oxytetracycline tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole xia et al 2012 next a comparison of the microbial communities at the genus level was conducted lefse analysis revealed that eubacterium spp in oxytetracycline fed mfcs manifested a remarkable difference from other samples its relative abundance underwent a noteworthy increase from merely 0 0 in raw pig manure to 91 8 fig s10 an exoelectrogenic bacterium belonging to eubacterium spp was isolated from soil and the maximum power density of an mfc generated by this isolate was about 19 mw m2 jiang et al 2016 these results indicated that this member of eubacterium spp played a role in electron transfer and power generation in mfcs additionally qiu et al have reported that a eubacterium sp was identified as a functional species during biodegradation of the berberine antibiotic whose molecular structure is similar to that of oxytetracycline qiu et al 2013 some species of eubacterium have also been reported to be responsible for anaerobically transforming various oxygen containing heterocyclic and methoxylated aromatic compounds mountfort et al 1988 zeng et al 2017 eubacterium sp strain sdg 2 possess abilities of heterocyclic ring cleavage and p dihydroxylation split in the aromatic rings of catechins wang et al 2000 2001 eubacterium ramulus is capable of cleaving oxygen containing heterocyclic ring system of various flavonoids under anaerobic condition schneider and blaut 2000 furthermore some members of eubacterium sp could secrete enzymes to catalyze metabolic processes including demethylation dehydroxylation ring cleavage and oxidation of complex compounds for example by the action of a four component o demethylase eubacterium limosum zl ii could convert secoisolariciresinol to its demethylating products which were easily oxidized due to their low redox potentials chen et al 2016 and methyltransferase secreted form eubacterium sp arc 2 facilitating the metabolic reaction of demethylating arctigenin was also found jin et al 2007 besides phenolic hydroxyl and methyl groups as well as heterocyclic aromatic rings are present in the chemical structure of oxytetracycline therefore taken together the data on quick and efficient antibiotic removal after long term acclimation and results of the above mentioned studies suggest that eubacterium is the main functional bacterial genus biodegrading oxytetracycline and its metabolites 3 3 variation in args in biofilms during long term operation long term antibiotic treatment means that microbes are subjected to stressful selective pressure to increase the dissemination of args which is a common challenge in all biological systems designed for removal of antibiotics mckinney et al 2010 miller et al 2016 hence it is important to evaluate the fate of args in mfcs and in microbial controls during 330 day oxytetracycline processing the overall pcoa pattern based on args in all 13 samples is illustrated in fig 4 a the samples from the same experimental group could be easily assigned to the same group in the pcoa pattern indicating good reproducibility of the experiments pco1 separated the samples of mfcs from the samples of microbial controls this finding indicated that the operational mode may be the most influential factor for the arg profile the samples from mfcs fed with acetate and oxytetracycline were clustered into two close knit groups by pco2 in arg profiles whereas the samples of oc naac and oc otc were separated substantially these results revealed that the substrate replacement had a big impact on the arg profile in the traditional anaerobic reactor but barely in mfcs that is to say the type of args i e the pattern of args present in mfcs is more stable a total of 56 unique args mainly conferring resistance to tetracyclines and sulfonamides were analyzed in all samples in sample rpm 32 args were detected which were assumed to come from inoculation sources and from the total original args fig 4b these 32 args included six transposase genes and one integron gene regarded as horizontal transfer genes implying that raw pig manure is a possible reservoir of args and may cause horizontal transfer of args if handled inappropriately zhu et al 2013 nevertheless arg abundance levels in all the reactors sharply decreased as compared to raw pig manure in particular the integron gene was not detected no matter what substrates were fed to biofilms the total arg types in oxytetracycline fed mfcs declined to one third of that in rpm and was also the lowest among all the samples this result may be mainly related to the noteworthy reduction in the bacterial communities diversity in these mfcs in other words eubacterium spp as the sole dominant genus in mfcs may not acquire or upregulate various types of args under oxytetracycline pressure fig s10 to evaluate relative abundance of args in all the samples all arg abundance levels were normalized to the single cell level fig 4c klappenbach et al 2001 stalder et al 2013 in sample rpm the normalized copy number of mobile genetic elements exceeded 1 00 and this value for args surpassed 2 50 suggesting that each bacterial cell harbored at least 1 00 mobile genetic element and possessed a certain potential for horizontal gene transfer the normalized copy numbers of all args from the bacterial communities fed with acetate in both mfcs and in microbial controls were much lower than those of biofilms fed with oxytetracycline this finding confirmed that the substrate can influence the fate of args and biological reactors containing antibiotics may facilitate the proliferation of args to some extent nonetheless except for sulfonamide related args the normalized copy numbers of the other classes of args in mfcs were much lower than those in rpm even though anodic biofilms of mfcs were under long term oxytetracycline pressure moreover the normalized copy numbers of mobile genetic elements and sulfonamide related and tetracycline related args in mfcs were 0 0064 1 16 and 0 57 respectively which were much lower than those of microbial controls 0 16 2 13 and 2 16 respectively this result implies that mfcs may be a more favorable approach to decreasing the dissemination of args in biofilms in comparison with microbial controls representing the traditional anaerobic systems that is mfcs may decrease oxytetracycline pressure more effectively by selecting a stand alone functional microbial taxon more rapidly thereby reducing the variety of args and their abundance in addition it has been reported that anaerobic systems are favorable for the removal of args diehl and lapara 2010 pei et al 2007 and in this regard mfcs constructed on the basis of anaerobic conditions may be superior to traditional biological processes 3 4 the changes of args in effluents the diversity and abundance of args in effluents of mfcs as a technology for wastewater treatment has remained obscure to date to study the effect of different initial oxytetracycline concentrations on the fate of args in effluents arg enrichment as compared to sample rpm was next analyzed and presented as a heatmap fig 5 among the 56 target args most args showed extensive depletion but 16 args including twelve tetracycline related args one sulfonamide related arg and three mobile genetic elements were enriched in all the samples on the other hand no clear cut correlation was found between environmental factors such as the treatment method or antibiotic concentration and the enrichment of args pcoa analysis based on arg distribution in effluents confirmed this result fig s11 where all samples were distributed randomly aside from grouping in specific clusters by treatment method and by antibiotic concentration of note not all tetracycline related args were enriched in effluents under long term oxytetracycline pressure furthermore args in the same reactor at different concentrations or in different reactors at the same concentration of oxytetracycline did not yield a positive correlation for example in the mfc tnpa 04 was depleted almost 1000 fold during 5 and 10 mg l oxytetracycline treatment but sul2 was the most depleted gene in the samples corresponding to 0 5 and 3 mg l oxytetracycline almost 100 fold and 1000 fold respectively notably inti 1 as an integron gene has been reported to be enriched by biological treatments according to conventional qpcr yuan et al 2016 but appears to be depleted in mfcs and microbial controls in this study by contrast tp614 as a transposase gene was enriched from 13 and 103 fold to 77 and 802 fold in different reactors with different oxytetracycline concentrations this result is mainly associated with the functional microbes eubacterium spp belonging to gram positive bacteria in this system it has been reported that transposons are important determinants of antibiotic resistance especially in gram positive bacteria on the contrary integrons appear more frequently in gram negative bacteria jr scott and churchward 1995 in addition transposons commonly carry a tetracycline resistance gene encoding an efflux pump for tetracycline and transposons abundance levels are positively associated with oxytetracycline concentration zhu et al 2013 as for integrons they most commonly contain resistance cassettes carrying the sul2 gene singh et al 2005 which appeared to be depleted in this study the above result also confirms that the emergence of args is associated with transposases and integrons binh et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 given that tp614 was enriched in both mfcs and microbial controls it represents a common challenge for different biological processes for wastewater treatment 4 conclusion this study showed the feasibility of using mfcs to enhance degradation of oxytetracycline and eliminate its antibacterial activity continuous electrical stimulation and higher atp concentration mainly contributed to bioelectrochemical reactions more rapidly to enhance oxytetracycline removal in mfcs the number of args and the normalized copy number of args in biofilms of mfcs were both lower than those in microbial reactors representing conventional anaerobic treatment hence such a process may have its advantage over traditional wastewater treatment process on the minimization of args horizontal transfer and the evolution of novel args through enriching more quickly eubacterium spp as sole functional bacteria nevertheless tp614 as a transposase gene was enriched in both mfcs and microbial reactors reveling that it may be a common challenge for biological treatment acknowledgments this study was supported by grants from the national natural science

elements such as plasmids integrons and transposons zhang et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 hence the research on args should not be limited to individual args relevant to antibiotics with the aid of high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr a deep insight into the dissemination of args has been acquired hu et al 2017 xie et al 2016 xu et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 to better assess whether the bioelectrochemical system is a promising alternative for enhancing antibiotic removal in terms of the fate of args it is important to investigate the fate of a board range of args under different operating conditions in the present study microbial fuel cell mfc as one of typical bioelectrochemical systems was chosen and high throughput sequencing and ht qpcr were employed to investigate the changes in bacterial communities and arg profiles in mfcs during long term oxytetracycline degradation the main objectives of this study were 1 to characterize the dynamics of oxytetracycline removal in mfcs during 330 day operation 2 to reveal the succession of the bacterial community during the long term processing of oxytetracycline 3 to investigate the effects of oxytetracycline on args in biofilms and effluents these findings can systematically elucidate the biodegradation of oxytetracycline in mfcs and the fate of args during long term treatment of oxytetracycline contaminated

into a hollow rectangular block 7 0 5 0 4 0 cm the mfcs were constructed according to our previous studies wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2013 2016 a cation exchange membrane zhejiang qianqiu water treatment co ltd china was used to separate the anode and cathode chamber the anodes and cathodes were made of carbon felts 4 4 0 5 cm haoshi carbon fiber co ltd china which were pretreated by steeping in acetone for 48 h and then immersing in deionized water for 24 h titanium wire 1 mm in diameter was employed to connect the electrodes and the external load was a resistor of 500 ω but the anode and cathode were disconnected when they served as microbial controls i e mfcs in an open circuit state the output voltage values of mfcs were recorded by a digital multimeter keithley

contained a buffering solution 1 g l sodium acetate and 50 mmol l phosphate ph 7 0 lovley and phillips 1988 xiao et al 2013 the catholyte contained 100 mmol l k3 fe cn 6 and 50 mmol l phosphate buffer solution ph 7 0 both the anolyte and catholyte were refreshed biweekly in batch mode and the maximum voltage reached 0 6 0 7 v after approximately 1 month when the mfcs were regarded as successfully developed then oxytetracycline served as a carbon source instead of sodium acetate in the anolyte and its concentration has been gradually increased from 0 5 to 10 mg l for the next 10 months all the reactors were kept in a dark incubator lrh 500f keerlrein instrument co ltd shanghai china to avoid photodegradation of oxytetracycline 2 4 analytical methods the analysis of high oxytetracycline concentrations was accomplished by means of a hitachi l 2000 series hplc system hitachi japan equipped with a diode array detector and column oven an agilent column zorbax eclipse plus c18 4 6 250 mm

region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 purified quantified pooled and sequenced pcr was conducted on a transstart fastpfu dna polymerase system the 20 μl pcr mixture was prepared in accordance with our previous studies xiao et al 2016 the pcrs were run on an abi geneamp 9700 pcr instrument with the

majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china on the miseq pe platform illumina usa sequences shorter than 20 bp and with a quality score of lower than 30 were removed from the data sequences with over 97 identity were clustered into one operational taxonomic unit otu in the usearch software version 7 1 edgar 2013 community richness chao1 richness estimates ace and shannon indices and rarefaction curves were obtained by mothur analysis schloss et al 2011 the taxonomic identities of sequences were assigned on the qiime platform via the rdp classifier at a confidence level of 70 based on the bayesian algorithm wang et al 2007 2 7 ht qpcr this analysis of args was performed to measure the diversity and abundance of args using a smartchip real time pcr machine warfergen inc usa as described elsewhere with a modification su et al 2015 a total of 57 primer sets table s1 were used including one targeting the 16s rrna gene ten targeting mobile genetic elements containing eight transposase genes and two class i integrase genes seven targeting sulfonamides genes and 39 targeting tetracyclines genes the following thermal cycling conditions were set up initial denaturation at 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s and annealing at 60 c for 30 s ending with a melting curve analysis automatically generated by the program for each primer set amplification was conducted in triplicate and a nontemplate control was included the results of ht qpcr were analyzed in the smartchip qpcr software version 2 7 0 1 wells with multiple melting peaks were discarded as well as wells with amplification efficiency outside the range of 1 8 2 2 threshold cycle c t 31 served as the detection limit and only samples with three replicates showing successful amplification were regarded as yielding a positive result the relative copy number was calculated according to another study eq 1 looft et al 2012 besides another method eq 2 was applied to figure out args fold changes fc values in effluent samples compared to the raw pig manure schmittgen and livak 2008 1 gene copy number 10 31 c t 10 3 δ c t c t a r g c t 16 s 2 δδ c t δ c t t a r g e

the 16s rrna gene assay δ c t target corresponds to the difference value between the threshold cycle of the experimental sample and the threshold cycle of its 16s rrna gene assay δ c t ref is the difference value between the threshold cycle of the reference sample and the threshold cycle of its 16s rrna gene assay and fc is the fold change of an arg copy number 2 8 statistical analysis the data of averages standard deviations and fold changes of args were organized in excel 2010 microsoft usa args were considered statistically significantly enriched or depleted if the range consisting of three standard deviations of the mean fold change was entirely 1 0 or 1 0 respectively su et al 2015 principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance and a heatmap were generated by r language version 3 1 0 the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size algorithm lefse was applied to explore the statistically significantly features of microbial communities between different samples segata et al 2011 other plots were performed in origin pro 9 1 software originlab usa 3 result and discussion 3 1 removal of oxytetracycline the changes in oxytetracycline concentration after 1 month acclimation are illustrated in fig 1 a no obvious change in oxytetracycline concentration was observed in the abiotic control suggesting that carbon felt adsorption and oxytetracycline self degradation were negligible it was observed that after the 1 month acclimation the efficiency of removal of 0 6 mg l oxytetracycline by mfcs in 6 days was nearly 85 a little higher than that in the microbial control by contrast the oxytetracycline removal rate increased obviously after 10 month acclimation fig 1b the removal efficiency rates in the mfcs and in the microbial control were 99 00 and 58 30 respectively in contrast oxytetracycline concentration barely changed in the abiotic controls hence the decrease in oxytetracycline concentration in mfcs and in the microbial controls must be due at least in part to biodegradation and after long term acclimation bioelectrochemical reactions in mfcs apparently enhanced the oxytetracycline removal the results of the antibacterial assay of the effluents from mfcs by means of escherichia coli dh5α and shewanella oneidensis mr 1 revealed that the antibacterial ability of oxytetracycline parent modules and its metabolites were eliminated successfully after the bioreactor treatment fig s3 in mfcs the anode acted as an insoluble electron acceptor to quickly receive electrons generated by anodophilic bacteria the persistent electrical stimulation on the one hand promoted the growth and metabolic activity of exoelectrogenic bacteria that were involved in oxytetracycline metabolism and on the other hand might have made mfcs more suitable niches for the oxytetracycline degradation by increasing the metabolic reaction rates of microbes on the anode similar findings have been obtained in other studies cao et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 this function did not work in microbial controls and this is one of the reasons why mfcs showed higher removal efficiency than the microbial controls did in addition voltage output as an important indicator of the performance of mfcs was recorded during the 330 day operation fig s2 the voltage decreased sharply with oxytetracycline substitution for acetate as a substrate but gradually recovered during the acclimation process indicating that anodic microorganisms in mfcs could metabolize oxytetracycline to grow and to yield electricity with prolongation of the operation the microbes in mfcs colonized the electrodes tightly formed a solid network connected by nanowire like matrices fig s4 and showed higher microbial activity than that seen in microbial controls figs s5 and s6 the results therefore indicated that microbes in mfcs were more active at utilizing oxytetracycline for their reproduction than those in microbial controls 3 2 characterization of bacterial communities after the long term operation the succession of microbes played an indispensable role in enhancing oxytetracycline biodegradation in mfcs a total of 498 017 high quality sequences were recovered from all 13 samples which were clustered into 2674 otus at a similarity level of 97 00 table s2 the coverage indices and the flat rarefaction curves confirmed that most microbes were covered in this sequencing analysis fig s7 chao1 simpson and shannon indices suggested that long term oxytetracycline processing significantly reduced the microbial community richness and diversity especially in mfcs these data indicated that the role of anaerobic conditions coupled with electrical stimulation had a more profound selection effect on specializing functional species than that seen in microbial controls only under anaerobic conditions pcoa indicated that the substrate and operation mode both contributed to the shifts in the bacterial community fig 2 as confirmed by pcoa of weighted and unweighted unifrac distances fig s8 in depth analysis of the predominant taxa that illustrates the main differences between mfcs and microbial controls at different acclimation time points was carried out by the lefse algorithm fig 3 judging by statistically significant differences 32 biomarkers were found at an lda threshold of 4 0 fig 3b at the phylum level an obvious distinction between mfcs and microbial controls at two acclimation time points was observed and confirmed the conclusion about the effect of the carbon source and operation mode on microbial communities compared to other samples firmicutes as the dominant phylum was found to be greatly enriched to 94 70 in oxytetracycline fed mfcs fig s9 some studies on the microbial communities in mfcs fed different fermentation end products have shown that firmicutes play a vital role in the processing of complex substances kiely et al 2011 in addition our data are in agreement with other studies showing that firmicutes become the dominant phylum under long term antibiotic selection pressure li et al 2011 qiu et al 2013 the structure of the microbial communities at the class level manifested variation during the 330 day operation although lefse analysis did not yield this result the relative abundance of clostridia in oxytetracycline fed mfcs one of the most strictly anaerobic classes increased obviously from 71 0 to 93 6 fig s9 it has been reported that the peak voltage and charge in mfcs were tightly associated with the abundances of clostridiaceae lachnospiraceae and peptostreptococcaceae all belonging to clostridia implying that the clostridia class played a significant role in power generation in mfcs jiang et al 2016 in addition many bacteria belonging to clostridia can degrade a large array of complex carbohydrates to produce a wide range of simple metabolites like ethanol elsden et al 1976 gu et al 2014 it was noticeable here that α β and γ proteobacteria in oxytetracycline fed mfcs accounting for 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 and 0 8 1 6 respectively were still not eliminated after a long period of operation recent studies on removal of the chloramphenicol antibiotic by a biocathode revealed that α β and γ proteobacteria perform a significant function in the degradation of chloramphenicol liang et al 2013 in addition research has revealed that bacteria belonging to β and γ proteobacteria dominated in anoxic or aerobic membrane bioreactors processing oxytetracycline tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole xia et al 2012 next a comparison of the microbial communities at the genus level was conducted lefse analysis revealed that eubacterium spp in oxytetracycline fed mfcs manifested a remarkable difference from other samples its relative abundance underwent a noteworthy increase from merely 0 0 in raw pig manure to 91 8 fig s10 an exoelectrogenic bacterium belonging to eubacterium spp was isolated from soil and the maximum power density of an mfc generated by this isolate was about 19 mw m2 jiang et al 2016 these results indicated that this member of eubacterium spp played a role in electron transfer and power generation in mfcs additionally qiu et al have reported that a eubacterium sp was identified as a functional species during biodegradation of the berberine antibiotic whose molecular structure is similar to that of oxytetracycline qiu et al 2013 some species of eubacterium have also been reported to be responsible for anaerobically transforming various oxygen containing heterocyclic and methoxylated aromatic compounds mountfort et al 1988 zeng et al 2017 eubacterium sp strain sdg 2 possess abilities of heterocyclic ring cleavage and p dihydroxylation split in the aromatic rings of catechins wang et al 2000 2001 eubacterium ramulus is capable of cleaving oxygen containing heterocyclic ring system of various flavonoids under anaerobic condition schneider and blaut 2000 furthermore some members of eubacterium sp could secrete enzymes to catalyze metabolic processes including demethylation dehydroxylation ring cleavage and oxidation of complex compounds for example by the action of a four component o demethylase eubacterium limosum zl ii could convert secoisolariciresinol to its demethylating products which were easily oxidized due to their low redox potentials chen et al 2016 and methyltransferase secreted form eubacterium sp arc 2 facilitating the metabolic reaction of demethylating arctigenin was also found jin et al 2007 besides phenolic hydroxyl and methyl groups as well as heterocyclic aromatic rings are present in the chemical structure of oxytetracycline therefore taken together the data on quick and efficient antibiotic removal after long term acclimation and results of the above mentioned studies suggest that eubacterium is the main functional bacterial genus biodegrading oxytetracycline and its metabolites 3 3 variation in args in biofilms during long term operation long term antibiotic treatment means that microbes are subjected to stressful selective pressure to increase the dissemination of args which is a common challenge in all biological systems designed for removal of antibiotics mckinney et al 2010 miller et al 2016 hence it is important to evaluate the fate of args in mfcs and in microbial controls during 330 day oxytetracycline processing the overall pcoa pattern based on args in all 13 samples is illustrated in fig 4 a the samples from the same experimental group could be easily assigned to the same group in the pcoa pattern indicating good reproducibility of the experiments pco1 separated the samples of mfcs from the samples of microbial controls this finding indicated that the operational mode may be the most influential factor for the arg profile the samples from mfcs fed with acetate and oxytetracycline were clustered into two close knit groups by pco2 in arg profiles whereas the samples of oc naac and oc otc were separated substantially these results revealed that the substrate replacement had a big impact on the arg profile in the traditional anaerobic reactor but barely in mfcs that is to say the type of args i e the pattern of args present in mfcs is more stable a total of 56 unique args mainly conferring resistance to tetracyclines and sulfonamides were analyzed in all samples in sample rpm 32 args were detected which were assumed to come from inoculation sources and from the total original args fig 4b these 32 args included six transposase genes and one integron gene regarded as horizontal transfer genes implying that raw pig manure is a possible reservoir of args and may cause horizontal transfer of args if handled inappropriately zhu et al 2013 nevertheless arg abundance levels in all the reactors sharply decreased as compared to raw pig manure in particular the integron gene was not detected no matter what substrates were fed to biofilms the total arg types in oxytetracycline fed mfcs declined to one third of that in rpm and was also the lowest among all the samples this result may be mainly related to the noteworthy reduction in the bacterial communities diversity in these mfcs in other words eubacterium spp as the sole dominant genus in mfcs may not acquire or upregulate various types of args under oxytetracycline pressure fig s10 to evaluate relative abundance of args in all the samples all arg abundance levels were normalized to the single cell level fig 4c klappenbach et al 2001 stalder et al 2013 in sample rpm the normalized copy number of mobile genetic elements exceeded 1 00 and this value for args surpassed 2 50 suggesting that each bacterial cell harbored at least 1 00 mobile genetic element and possessed a certain potential for horizontal gene transfer the normalized copy numbers of all args from the bacterial communities fed with acetate in both mfcs and in microbial controls were much lower than those of biofilms fed with oxytetracycline this finding confirmed that the substrate can influence the fate of args and biological reactors containing antibiotics may facilitate the proliferation of args to some extent nonetheless except for sulfonamide related args the normalized copy numbers of the other classes of args in mfcs were much lower than those in rpm even though anodic biofilms of mfcs were under long term oxytetracycline pressure moreover the normalized copy numbers of mobile genetic elements and sulfonamide related and tetracycline related args in mfcs were 0 0064 1 16 and 0 57 respectively which were much lower than those of microbial controls 0 16 2 13 and 2 16 respectively this result implies that mfcs may be a more favorable approach to decreasing the dissemination of args in biofilms in comparison with microbial controls representing the traditional anaerobic systems that is mfcs may decrease oxytetracycline pressure more effectively by selecting a stand alone functional microbial taxon more rapidly thereby reducing the variety of args and their abundance in addition it has been reported that anaerobic systems are favorable for the removal of args diehl and lapara 2010 pei et al 2007 and in this regard mfcs constructed on the basis of anaerobic conditions may be superior to traditional biological processes 3 4 the changes of args in effluents the diversity and abundance of args in effluents of mfcs as a technology for wastewater treatment has remained obscure to date to study the effect of different initial oxytetracycline concentrations on the fate of args in effluents arg enrichment as compared to sample rpm was next analyzed and presented as a heatmap fig 5 among the 56 target args most args showed extensive depletion but 16 args including twelve tetracycline related args one sulfonamide related arg and three mobile genetic elements were enriched in all the samples on the other hand no clear cut correlation was found between environmental factors such as the treatment method or antibiotic concentration and the enrichment of args pcoa analysis based on arg distribution in effluents confirmed this result fig s11 where all samples were distributed randomly aside from grouping in specific clusters by treatment method and by antibiotic concentration of note not all tetracycline related args were enriched in effluents under long term oxytetracycline pressure furthermore args in the same reactor at different concentrations or in different reactors at the same concentration of oxytetracycline did not yield a positive correlation for example in the mfc tnpa 04 was depleted almost 1000 fold during 5 and 10 mg l oxytetracycline treatment but sul2 was the most depleted gene in the samples corresponding to 0 5 and 3 mg l oxytetracycline almost 100 fold and 1000 fold respectively notably inti 1 as an integron gene has been reported to be enriched by biological treatments according to conventional qpcr yuan et al 2016 but appears to be depleted in mfcs and microbial controls in this study by contrast tp614 as a transposase gene was enriched from 13 and 103 fold to 77 and 802 fold in different reactors with different oxytetracycline concentrations this result is mainly associated with the functional microbes eubacterium spp belonging to gram positive bacteria in this system it has been reported that transposons are important determinants of antibiotic resistance especially in gram positive bacteria on the contrary integrons appear more frequently in gram negative bacteria jr scott and churchward 1995 in addition transposons commonly carry a tetracycline resistance gene encoding an efflux pump for tetracycline and transposons abundance levels are positively associated with oxytetracycline concentration zhu et al 2013 as for integrons they most commonly contain resistance cassettes carrying the sul2 gene singh et al 2005 which appeared to be depleted in this study the above result also confirms that the emergence of args is associated with transposases and integrons binh et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 given that tp614 was enriched in both mfcs and microbial controls it represents a common challenge for different biological processes for wastewater treatment 4 conclusion this study showed the feasibility of using mfcs to enhance degradation of oxytetracycline and eliminate its antibacterial activity continuous electrical stimulation and higher atp concentration mainly contributed to bioelectrochemical reactions more rapidly to enhance oxytetracycline removal in mfcs the number of args and the normalized copy number of args in biofilms of mfcs were both lower than those in microbial reactors representing conventional anaerobic treatment hence such a process may have its advantage over traditional wastewater treatment process on the minimization of args horizontal transfer and the evolution of novel args through enriching more quickly eubacterium spp as sole functional bacteria nevertheless tp614 as a transposase gene was enriched in both mfcs and microbial reactors reveling that it may be a common challenge for biological treatment acknowledgments this study was supported by grants from the national natural science

19466,an integrated investigation to document high anammox abundance activity and diversity in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating low strength ammonium loading sewage was performed and showed that the optimal anammox granular sludge sizes could mitigate undesirable n2o emission the enhanced anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate were achieved with optimal granules sludge sizes of 0 5 0 9 mm with multiple jettenia brocadia and anammoxoglobus species the tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps was the main eps layer found in anammox granular sludge in which polysaccharides play an important structural role over this granular sludge sizes the anammox bacterial abundance and activity did not significantly decrease but n2o emission significantly increased high throughput sequencing and ecological networks demonstrated the patterns of anammox and their co occurring bacteria with availability n2o producer and n2o reducer functional genes incomplete denitrification and insufficient carbon source mainly contributed to n2o production in granular sludge as supported by results of stratification analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granular sludge size low ammonium sewage treatment abundance microbial mechanism n2o emission 1 introduction studies have recognized the important role of anammox for fixed n loss in natural and artificial ecosystems thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 dalsgaard et al 2003 kuypers et al 2003 schubert et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 2015a b the anammox process over the past decade was found to be advantageous in removing n and saving carbon source and energy in biological wastewater treatment systems zhu et al 2008 du et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 ma et al 2015 2017 generally available data indicate that many technical methods have already been developed to maximize the use of anammox in treating wastewaters with high strength ammonium loadings which may be responsible for a significant proportion of n2 production susanne et al 2014 ma et al 2016 however anammox only contributed to 2 7 of total n loss in municipal sewage treatment with low ammonium concentration 50 mg l 1 which also represent the most typical man made aquatic ecological system in the world wang et al 2015 low bacterial abundance and growth rate are two of the main indices affected by several factors such as dissolved oxygen cod tkn ratio and high temperature limiting the efficiency of anammox in sewage treatment systems ma et al 2016 because anammox bacteria tend to grow in aggregates activated sludge granulation is one of the best approaches to increase bacterial quantity and retention trigo et al 2006 fernandez et al 2008 abma et al 2007 tang et al 2011a b for anammox granules the diameter is an important parameter influencing the settlement ability and the subsequent performance of the bioreactor when the particle size is too large a dead zone forms in granules which could result in sludge floatation and losses chen et al 2010 this will also reduce the efficiency of mass transfer between the anammox granular sludge and pollutants even though granular sludge has a large particle size it is not only composed of anammox bacteria recent studies showed that wastewater treatment plants using anammox granular sludge with high abundance and a wide range of granular diameter from 0 5 to 25 mm exhibited consistent treatment efficiency for 11 years the anammox bacteria were mainly distributed in the outer layer of granular sludge and only a small portion of the total bacteria consisted of anammox in the inner layer with most of not being anammox specific microorganisms azari et al 2017 ke et al 2015 in contrast it is difficult to increase the biomass of anammox sludge when the particle size is too small the diameter of the anammox granular sludge is affected by the shape of the reactors hydrodynamic shear force nitrogen loading rate nlr and other factors tang et al 2011a ma et al 2013 ni et al 2009 consequently the optimal diameter of the granules in the different influent wastewater is often inconsistent ranging from micro to millimeter lu et al 2013 ni et al 2009 while the optimal anammox granules diameter in treating low strength ammonium sewage remains little known the anammox process is mediated by the anammox bacteria previous studies on activated sludge floc from a sewage treatment plant revealed that anammox diversity was very low and the genus candidatus brocadia was the absolute dominant species wang et al 2015 similarly in treating low ammonia synthetic domestic wastewater 55 mgl 1 metagenomic analysis showed that candidatus jettenia caeni and candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis were the top two dominant species in anoxic biofilm ma et al 2017 when treating high ammonia wastewater such as landfill leachate microbial diversity analysis on floccular sludge and granular biofilm samples in lab scale up flow reactor and full scale landfill leachate treatment plant showed that brocadia dominated the anammox community with other genus like candidatus scalindua being rarely detected azari et al 2017 ke et al 2015 furthermore the effects of anammox granular size on microbial distribution in anammox sludge granules their abundance activity and community structuring as well as their symbiosis with other microorganisms are also not well understood beside saving carbon and energy another great advantage of anammox is that it does not produce nitrous oxide n2o which was revealed after elucidating its underlying molecular mechanisms kartal et al 2011 we also previously showed that the n2o released in areas with high anammox activity was significantly lower than the areas with low or no anammox activity zhu et al 2013 2015 however previous studies on lab pilot and even full scale granular sludge reactors also reported the accumulation and subsequent release of n2o zhu et al 2008 ma et al 2013 castro barros et al 2015 a recent breakthrough was achieved by ali et al 2016 when they reported that approximately 70 of n2o was produced by oxic nitrifiers in the surface of the granular biomass from the nitritation anammox reactor by successfully using isotopic fish and microsensor analyses the rest of the n2o meanwhile was produced in the anammox bacteria dominated anoxic zone ali et al 2016 however the mechanism of n2o production in anaerobic granular sludge processes could be completely different because its surface might not be oxic currently the interactions between the nitrifiers and denitrifiers and the anammox bacteria and how they contribute to anaerobic n2o remain little understood this study then aims to investigate anammox bacterial abundance activity and community structure in various anammox granule sizes to determine the most optimal granule size in treating low strength ammonium sewage with special attention to n2o production to do this the anammox granules were first enriched and cultured and then microbial activities related to n2o production were investigated using qpcr high throughput sequencing network analysis and fluorescence imaging techniques 2 experimental procedures 2 1 reactor setup and operation a 3 l lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with an internal diameter of 80 mm was used as the incubation device for anammox

granules layers the anammox granules were artificially divided into four layers from the inside to outside namely the pellet tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps and outer slime layer changes in total polysaccharides ps and proteins pn content in different layers represented the transformation of organic substances along the sludge granulation total dna accounted for less than 10 5 of the total eps content indicating that during the eps extraction process microbial cells were basically intact and no intracellular substances overflowed which could affect the results extraction of tb eps and lb eps were carried out as previously reported yu et al 2008 50 0 ml of anammox granules in different particle sizes were collected on the 200th day at the end of the steady stage the sludge was directly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected here referred to as the slime

again at 5000 g for 15 min with the supernatant and the solid phase was collected separately the organic substances in the supernatant were used as the lb eps collected sediments were re suspended again with buffer solution to the original volumes and then treated using ultrasonicator fs 600 shanghai sonxi co ltd china at 20 khz and 480 w for 10 min at 4 c the extracted solutions were subsequently centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min the organic substances in the supernatant were used for the tb eps while the residues solid phase were used as the pellet 3 result 3 1 start up stability and granulation process of anammox sludge in the first 20 days of the start up phase the anammox activity increased gradually and was detected at an hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 50 h and an influent nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 64 kg n m3 d fig 1 supplementary table s3 the nh4 and no2 removal rate increased from 5 36 to 23 6 42 6 and 42 4 respectively between 21 and 60 days the influent nlr increased to 1 06 kg n m3 d and the removal rates of nh4 and no2 further increased to 68 9 and 74 0 respectively on day 61 80 nh4 and no2 removal rate rapidly increased to more than 90 with nlr increasing to 1 50 kg n m3 d during the start up phase 0 80 d the total sludge mass increased from 3213 0 to 6742 0 mg vss l with an average sludge yield of about 44 1 mg vss l d at the same time about 46 1 of the seeding floc sludge gradually granulated with a diameter of 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 0 9 mm accounting for 39 4 and 6 7 of the total sludge mass respectively after the start up phase the reactor stabilized in operation for the remaining 120 days 81 200 d with an average nlr of 1 1 0 1 kg n m3 d the average effluent concentrations of nh4 and no2 were 0 97 0 79 mg l 1 and 0 64 0 36 mg l 1 with removal rates of 96 4 2 9 and 97 9 1 2 respectively at the end of the stable operation phase 200 d the proportion of the granular sludge of different particle size to the total sludge mass was as follows 0 2 mm 6 3 here referred to as flocs 0 2 0 5 mm 9 0 0 5 0 9 mm 31 0 0 9 1 5 mm 25 8 1 5 2 0 mm 18 6 and 2 0 2 5 mm 9 3 fig 2 a the total sludge mass reached 16 255 mg vss l 1 and the average sludge yield was 79 mg vssl 1 d 1 about twice higher than the start up phase with the growth of granular sludge anammox bacteria aggregated together like iron red cauliflowers in line with the previous studies ke et al 2015 azari et al 2017 fig 2b and c 3 2 nitrogen removal performance of anammox granular sludge with various particle sizes the nitrogen removal performance was further investigated with different particle sizes 0 2 mm 0 2 0 5 mm 0 5 0 9 mm 0 9 1 5 mm 1 5 2 0 mm and 2 0 2 5 mm of anammox granule sludge at a sludge concentration of 1800 2000 mg vss l in 1 0 l lab scale sbr reactors fig 3 when the anammox granule particle sizes were 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm the n removal rates were maintained at a relatively low level only 10 9 1 1 and 19 1 0 7 mg n g vss h for nh4 and no2 respectively the tn removal rate was 23 8 3 1 mg n g vss h with a removal efficiency of 77 2 10 4 when the anammox granular grew to larger sizes 0 5 0 9 mm the n removal rates were significantly increased to 60 6 31 5 and 33 2 mg n g vss h for tn nh4 and no2 respectively with a removal efficiency of 89 5 however the n removal rates then gradually decreased with the increase of particle sizes finally reducing to 42 1 15 0 and 29 9 mg n g vss h for tn nh4 and no2 respectively with a removal efficiency of 73 0 at the particle size of 2 0 2 5 mm the analysis of metabolic ratios of different n pollutants at different particle sizes of anammox sludge showed that the values of δno3 δnh4 and δno2 δnh4 at the particle size of 0 5 0 9 mm were the ones very close to the theoretical values of anammox reaction stoichiometry of 0 26 and 1 32 respectively in a word the n removal rates of anammox granular sludge would increase with the particle sizes but it would not increase continuously when a certain anammox granular size 0 5 0 9 mm in this study is reached the n removal rates begin to decrease gradually we also observed a short term accumulation of n2o during nitrogen removal at different anammox granular sizes the n2o accumulation rate was less than 0 20 mg n g vss h at the particle size below 0 5 mm but decreased to 0 03 mg n g vss h when the particle size increased to 0 5 0 9 mm accounting for only 0 1 of tn conversion rate for the particle size above 0 9 mm the n2o accumulation rate rapidly increased to 5 6 mg n g vss h at the size of 2 0 2 5 mm the n2o accumulation rate increased with the anammox granular size these results indicate that the n removal rates increased when the anammox activated sludge floc shifted to anammox granular sludge and also increased with n2o accumulation taking into consideration of n removal rates and n2o emission together the optimal anammox granular sludge particle size 0 5 0 9 mm in this study should be maintained in the low strength ammonium sewage treatments 3 3 abundance of anammox bacteria in granular sludge with varying particle sizes the abundance of anammox bacteria significantly increased during the anammox sludge granulation the functional genes hzsb of anammox bacteria increased from 107 to 1011 copies g vss and the proportion in total bacteria increased from 1 to 8 10 fig 4 however the anammox abundance did not always increase with the particle size in consistence with the trend of the anammox activity the maximum anammox abundance 2 02 0 05 1011 copies g vss was observed at the granular size of 0 5 0 9 mm and the abundance slightly declined with the increase of particle size at the granular sizes of 0 9 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 2 5 mm the abundance was maintained at a high level of 1 65 0 16 1011 1 63 0 00 1011 and 1 65 0 00 1011 copies g vss respectively the proportion of the anammox bacteria in the total bacteria also showed a similar result we also found that the specific anammox activity peaked at the particle size of 0 5 0 9 mm during the cultivation specific anammox activity increased rapidly in the initial stage of granulation consistently at the particle size of 0 5 0 9 mm the specific anammox cellular rate reached the highest and then declined and became stable with the increase of particle size these results suggest that a larger particle size of anammox granular sludge was not corresponding to a higher abundance and activity of anammox bacterial functional genes in contrast the larger particle size not the optimal one 0 5 0 9 mm in this study would promote the n2o emission 3 4 anammox community in granular sludge with varying particle sizes diversity analysis of the anammox granular sludge with varying particle sizes showed that anammox bacterial diversity increased with granulation process and peaked at particle sizes of 0 5 0 9 mm with three detected genera fig 5 a supplementary figure s3 and table s4 phylogenetic analysis showed that the obtained 14 otus 98 similarity from 38 hzsb gene sequences after enzyme digestion belonged to brocadia otu 1 10 81 7 of the total reads kuenenia otu 11 10 5 of total reads and jettenia otu 12 14 7 8 of the total reads in the case of the anammox sludge with granular sizes below 0 5 mm only one genus brocadia was detected while two genera brocadia and kuenenia were detected in anammox granular sludge with sizes over 0 9 mm further the symbiosis between anammox bacteria and other microorganisms was investigated in the sludge samples of floc 0 2 mm optimum particle 0 5 0 9 mm and the largest particle 2 0 2 5 mm using high throughput sequencing approach fig 5b although anammox bacteria had the highest diversity within the size of 0 5 0 9 mm bacterial co occurrence with anammox had the lowest diversity at both phylum and species levels floc sludge 0 2 mm showed the highest diversity at the phylum level a total of 13 phyla were identified including anaerolineaceae 31 1 31 8 proteobacteria 20 0 25 8 rhodocyclaceae 10 8 14 8 planctomycetes 6 5 13 0 and bacteroidetes 4 2 7 9 the relative abundance of planctomycetes all of the known anammox bacteria belong to the phylum planctomycetes were 6 5 16 6 and 13 0 in the floc optimum particle and the largest particle samples respectively these were consistent with previous observations based on the anammox functional genes we explored the bacterial co occurrence patterns of anammox bacteria using network analysis based on strong and significant correlations fig 5c in the module with candidatus brocadia there are four bacterial classes acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and double anaerolineae and four families comamonadaceae caldilineaceae patulibacteraceae and rhodospirillaceae directly correlated to candidatus brocadia moreover each correlation is positive interaction this is a further explanation of the high throughput results anaerolineaceae is widely distributed in the anaerobic reactor to degrade carbohydrates and other cell tissues miao et al 2016 proteobacteria is a common flora in the denitrification reaction system it can utilize substrate nh4 or no2 for metabolism and proliferation activities and simultaneously consume dissolved oxygen creating an anaerobic environment for the anammox bacteria cao et al 2016 2017 rhodocyclaceae is a facultative aerobic bacterial flora with diverse biological functions it may be involved in the metabolism of p and fe in the anammox process chua et al 2006 therefore through the cooperative competition for substrate dissolved oxygen and metabolic products anaerolineaceae proteobacteria rhodocyclaceae bacteroidete and anammox bacteria formed a stable microbial community of anammox granular sludge heatmap cluster analysis basing on top 100 otus of relative abundance at the species level showed that the microbial community structure and diversity of anammox in floc sludge were significantly different from those found in the anammox granular sludge fig 5d interestingly the species composition of anammox granular sludge in the size range of 0 5 0 9 mm and 2 2 5 mm showed higher similarity the functional genes for n2o producers nirs and nirk and n2o reducer nosz were further examined for each strain the nosz gene was only detected in three strains burkholderiaceae rhodospirillaceae rhodobacteraceae the nirs or nirk gene were detected in more strains anaerolineaceae comamonadaceae planctomycetaceae nitrosomonadaceae actinobacteria comamonas denitratisoma anaerolineaceae but these strains did not contained nosz gene moreover two nitrifier genera nitrospira and nitrosomonas with nirk gene were mainly detected in the sludge floc indicating n2o produced via the nitrifier denitrification pathway which is in agreement with results of ali et al 2016 the aob were seldomly detected in the granular sludge in sizes of 0 5 0 9 mm or 2 0 2 5 mm incomplete denitrification should be the main contributor of n2o in the granular sludge while insufficiency in carbon source caused n2o accumulation 3 5 stratification and fluorescence characteristics of granular sludge eps the different granular size produced different anammox abundance diversity and activity meanwhile we investigated the anammox sludge granulation process by classifying the eps of the anammox granular sludge into slime layer slime eps loose layer lb eps and dense layer tb eps fig 6 the total eps content of all granular sizes was very high which ranged from 247 8 to 693 1 mg eps g vss these values were significantly higher than that of the conventional nitrification and denitrification sludge indicating that the eps mainly caused the granulation which corroborates results of previous studies of sheng et al 2010 and hou et al 2015 the three layers of eps also varied with particle size for the slime layer the slime eps content was 121 0 302 3 mg eps g vss accounting for over 48 0 of the total eps when the particle size was less than 0 5 mm and also decreased when the particle size increased 0 5 2 5 mm with a final stable ratio of around 35 0 of the total eps fig 6a for the loose layer the lb eps contents 121 0 302 3 mg eps g vss did not change significantly with particle size with all the contents maintained to be less than 24 0 for the dense layer the tb eps in the deepest layer of sludge eps increased from 95 6 to 334 1 mg eps g vss and the ratio increased rapidly from 18 3 in 0 2 mm to 50 0 in 2 0 2 5 mm further analyses of eps composition showed that proteins and polysaccharides were enriched in tb eps with the proportions of 33 5 48 6 and 23 6 47 4 respectively fig 6b in slime and lb eps layer proteins accounted for more than 90 1 and 81 5 respectively the polysaccharides in the two layers were only less than 20 but significantly increased with particle size this result indicates that tb eps layer was the main eps layer of anammox granular sludge in which the polysaccharides may play an important role in maintaining the eps structure the three dimensional fluorescence spectra of the three eps layers in anammox granular sludge showed that there were two main distinct characteristic fluorescence peaks specifically pertaining to the peaks of cr amino acid peak i and tryptophan peak ii fig 6c both are protein like and related to the aromatic ring amino acid structure in the eps the content of the cr amino acid in tb eps was the highest which increased to 78 au mg c l with the granulation process while it was low and not correlated with particle size in the other two layers the tryptophan only made up half of the cr amino acid but had the same trend and the highest signal value in the tb eps was 22 3 au mg c l the highly dense and concentrated tb eps could provide a stable anaerobic condition for anammox bacteria which might be good for the high activity and granulation of anammox sludge 4 discussion anammox has been widely applied in high strength ammonium wastewater treatment due to its low oxygen demand and lack of demand for organic carbons zhu et al 2008 recently application of anammox to sewage with low strength ammonium loading ma et al 2016 2017 lotti et al 2014 cao et al 2017 regmi et al 2016 laureni et al 2016 has also bene started in this study we found that an increase in the diameter of the anammox granular sludge did not result in significant changes in anammox abundance activity and diversity when treated with low strength sewage the other interesting observation was the gradual increase in greenhouse gas n2o accumulation with increasing sludge granular diameter even with these results however some uncertainties remain to maintain a stable anammox process in a biological wastewater treatment system it is important to consider improving at the least microbial stability diversity and activity to date the diversity of anammox bacterial hzsb functional gene in an anammox reactor with different particle size has not been reported in this study we found that the anammox bacteria had the highest diversity when the particle size ranged from 0 5 to 0 9 mm and the diversity decreased with increased particle size similar trends were obtained when dealing with high strength ammonia wastewaters with the granular size over 20 mm low diversity was also confirmed by having all of the 35 anammox clones belonging to the genus candidatus brocadia and can only be grouped into 2 otus azari et al 2017 ke et al 2015 for operation performance sludge wash out often occurs in high loaded anammox uasb reactors when the particle size of sludge increased from 1 9 mm to 2 5 mm tang et al 2011a b similar patterns were also observed by chen et al 2010 in terms of the anammox activity in a lab scale anaerobic up flow granular bed anammox reactor fed with high strength synthetic nutrient medium and granular size 2 mm the in situ anammox activity was detected by microsensors mainly from near the surface to the upper 0 8 mm of the granules cho et al 2010 under phenol stress the granular sludge size even reached 15 6 mm but rod shaped non anammox like bacteria were observed on the surface of granular sludge and the anammox activity also didn t increase yang et al 2013 combining previous results with ours these illustrate that the anammox granular sludge with bigger size did not definitely drive better performance in low ammonium sewage treatment previous and current studies also showed that the n2o is indeed generated during the anammox granulation process ma et al 2011 2012 castro barros et al 2015 in this study we found that n2o production rate increased with sludge particle size which could be related to the structure of anammox bacterial granular sludge in this system the carbon source for denitrification was mainly from the hydrolysis and acidification of the granular sludge due to the absence of external carbon source both proteins and polysaccharides are long chain molecules which differently require duration for hydrolysis and acidification huang et al 2016 both anammox and no3 n production rates in the system exceeded the hydrolysis and acidification rate of proteins and polysaccharides therefore the available carbon source became limited leading to n2o accumulation when the substrates for anammox gradually decreased the anammox rate and no3 n formation rates also decreased however when the no3 n formation rate became lower than the hydrolysis acidification rate the reduction of n2o to n2 still proceeded therefore the accumulated n2o could gradually be denitrified in the subsequent reactions the high throughput sequencing analysis results supported our hypothesis n2o emission in microbial n cycle mainly comes from nitrification related pathways and heterotrophic denitrification hu et al 2015 in the sludge floc we detected two nitrifying genera namely nitrospira and nitrosamonas with proportions of 4 1 of the total bacteria n2o production via nitrifier denitrification is a universal trait of nitrifying bacteria wrage et al 2004 this process has been suggested to be an important n2o source under low organic carbon and o2 levels wrage et al 2001 in this study the do in the uasb system remained at a very low level 0 5 mg l 1 therefore the generation of n2o in the sludge floc 0 2 mm should mainly come from nitrifier denitrification in contrast the nitrifiers at the general level in the granular sludge only accounted for less than 0 6 of the total bacteria among the denitrifying genes the nirs nirk and nosz genes are more commonly used and their abundance and community can be referred to as n2o emission potential indicators morales et al 2010 the nosz gene the only known biotic sink for n2o hu et al 2015 was detected in only three strains with the average proportion only at 1 which was much lower than the n2o producers 39 8 of nirs and 3 4 of nirk therefore heterotrophic denitrification may be the main n2o contributor in the granular sludge further we also found the diversity of bacterial co occurrence with anammox bacteria gradually increased as the particle size increased this result agrees with recent results showing that larger granules harbor more diverse microbial community symbiosis with anammox bacteria luo et al 2017 this should be attributed to the maximum mass transfer distance in the granular sludge i e the maximum particle radius some studies suggested that the active area of the granular sludge was 0 2 0 3 mm from the surface to the inside of high rate upflow anaerobic treatment systems batstone and keller 2001 while ni et al 2009 indicated that the optimal particle size was 1 0 1 3 mm under the hrt of 24 30 h and the nlr of 0 8 kg n m 3 d 1 based on the results of a kinetic modeling in anammox reactor another study showed that the depth of activity could reach up to 0 8 mm during the granulation of anammox microorganisms in up flow reactors imajo et al 2004 this may then suggest that the different species and hydraulic conditions could also lead to different depths of activity when the particle radius was greater than the maximum mass transfer distance the activity of anammox bacteria in the particles was inhibited and changes on the internal microenvironment also caused changes in microbial community structure for example some facultative anaerobic fermentative or denitrifying bacteria continued their metabolic activities when presented with suitable conditions as a result the diversity of large particle communities was also high in addition to profiling of the microbial community stratification in the granular sludge and fluorescence method was also used to investigate the anammox bacterial eps under different particle sizes we found that the proteins and polysaccharides were the main components of eps a large number of proteins secreted to the extracellular environment that became involved in the transfer process were probably due to the eps not only being adhesive causing the cells to aggregate but also serving as an ion transport channel between bacteria and the external aquatic environment this transfer of proteins was necessary for ion transfer in this study the optimal particle size was related to the eps content of 385 1 mg g vss under the volume loading rate of 1 5 kg m3 d hrt 0 76 h this is comparable to the total eps of the anammox granular sludge of 236 410 mg g vss as reported by tang et al 2011a which was obtained under high hydraulic loading rate of 152 4 221 0 103 kg m3 d hrt 0 16 0 11 h in comparison lower carbohydrate at 83 2 mg and 42 7 mg proteins per gram vss were suggested by ni et al 2010 under the loading rate of 0 8 kg m3 d the higher eps and volume loading rate indicate that the anammox granular sludge formed in this study had stronger adhesion and higher stability on the other hand the composition of eps obtained by stratification indicates that the polysaccharides were the main factors causing anammox sludge granulation although the proteins were 1 6 times higher than the polysaccharides this was consistent with the high polysaccharides in tb eps layer reported by ni et al 2010 moreover the polysaccharides also gradually increased during the sludge granulation process indicating that it promoted the granulation of anammox sludge finally this study provided some suggestions to optimize anammox process in the bioreactor the 0 5 0 9 mm particle size range produced the highest mass transfer efficiency in treating low strength wastewater this particle size range was significantly smaller than those obtained from the reactor treating high ammonia wastewater 1 0 6 4 mm tang et al 2011a 0 3 15 6 mm yang et al 2013 but similar with the results of tang 2014 0 5 1 5 mm and ma 2012 0 5 0 9 mm who also treated low strength wastewater therefore the particle size of granular sludge may be determined by the substrate concentration in the influent rather than the operational conditions such as the process mode operation and hydraulic retention time among others in the reactor treating high ammonia wastewater the sludge particles reached as high as 6 4 mm but could also have some negative effects on process performance such as particle floatation and run off chen et al 2010 tang et al 2011a b the present study demonstrated that the amount of the released n2o significantly increased with sludge particle size to optimize operations and mitigate greenhouse gas production the particle size of sludge should be controlled 5 conclusions this study aims to investigate anammox bacterial abundance activity and community structure structuring in various anammox granule sizes to determine the most optimal granule size in treating low strength ammonium sewage with special attention to n2o production the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the n removal rates of the anammox granule particle sizes were in the ranges of 0 18 0 53 0 23 0 98 and 0 36 1 13 mg n g vss h for nh4 no2 and tn respectively the functional genes hzsb of anammox bacteria increased from 107 to 1011 copies g vss with three detected anammox genera jettenia brocadia and anammoxoglobus species there are four bacterial classes acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and double anaerolineae and four families comamonadaceae caldilineaceae patulibacteraceae and rhodospirillaceae directly negative interaction with candidatus brocadia the short term accumulation of n2o was observed during n removal in various anammox granular sizes with 18 0 156 mg n gvss h the n2o reducer gene nosz was only detected in three strains namely burkholderiaceae rhodospirillaceae rhodobacteraceae the n2o producer functional genes nirs or nirk were detected in more strains anaerolineaceae comamonadaceae planctomycetaceae nitrosomonadaceae actinobacteria denitratisoma etc but these strains did not contain the nosz gene considering the integrated n removal and n2o emission the optimal anammox granular sludge particle size should be 0 5 0 9 mm in low strength ammonium sewage treatment which have the highest n removal rate 1 13 mg n g vss h for tn and anammox bacterial abundance 1011 copies g vss but lower n2o emission rate 44 0 mg n gvss h thus the optimum particle size of anammox granular sludge should be controlled to obtain high nitrogen removal efficiency and low n2o emission rate conflicts of interest

19466,an integrated investigation to document high anammox abundance activity and diversity in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating low strength ammonium loading sewage was performed and showed that the optimal anammox granular sludge sizes could mitigate undesirable n2o emission the enhanced anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate were achieved with optimal granules sludge sizes of 0 5 0 9 mm with multiple jettenia brocadia and anammoxoglobus species the tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance tb eps was the main eps layer found in anammox granular sludge in which polysaccharides play an important structural role over this granular sludge sizes the anammox bacterial abundance and activity did not significantly decrease but n2o emission significantly increased high throughput sequencing and ecological networks demonstrated the patterns of anammox and their co occurring bacteria with availability n2o producer and n2o reducer functional genes incomplete denitrification and insufficient carbon source mainly contributed to n2o production in granular sludge as supported by results of stratification analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granular sludge size low ammonium sewage treatment abundance microbial mechanism n2o emission 1 introduction studies have recognized the important role of anammox for fixed n loss in natural and artificial ecosystems thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 dalsgaard et al 2003 kuypers et al 2003 schubert et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 2015a b the anammox process over the past decade was found to be advantageous in removing n and saving carbon source and energy in biological wastewater treatment systems zhu et al 2008 du et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 ma et al 2015 2017 generally available data indicate that many technical methods have already been developed to maximize the use of anammox in treating wastewaters with high strength ammonium loadings which may be responsible for a significant proportion of n2 production susanne et al 2014 ma et al 2016 however anammox only contributed to 2 7 of total n loss in municipal sewage treatment with low ammonium concentration 50 mg l 1 which also represent the most typical man made aquatic ecological system in the world wang et al 2015 low bacterial abundance and growth rate are two of the main indices affected by several factors such as dissolved oxygen cod tkn ratio and high temperature limiting the efficiency of anammox in sewage treatment systems ma et al 2016 because anammox bacteria tend to grow in aggregates activated sludge granulation is one of the best approaches to increase bacterial quantity and retention trigo et al 2006 fernandez et al 2008 abma et al 2007 tang et al 2011a b for anammox granules the diameter is an important parameter influencing the settlement ability and the subsequent performance of the bioreactor when the particle size is too large a dead zone forms in granules which could result in sludge floatation and losses chen et al 2010 this will also reduce the efficiency of mass transfer between the anammox granular sludge and pollutants even though granular sludge has a large particle size it is not only composed of anammox bacteria recent studies showed that wastewater treatment plants using anammox granular sludge with high abundance and a wide range of granular diameter from 0 5 to 25 mm exhibited consistent treatment efficiency for 11 years the anammox bacteria were mainly distributed in the outer layer of granular sludge and only a small portion of the total bacteria consisted of anammox in the inner layer with most of not being anammox specific microorganisms azari et al 2017 ke et al 2015 in contrast it is difficult to increase the biomass of anammox sludge when the particle size is too small the diameter of the anammox granular sludge is affected by the shape of the reactors hydrodynamic shear force nitrogen loading rate nlr and other factors tang et al 2011a ma et al 2013 ni et al 2009 consequently the optimal diameter of the granules in the different influent wastewater is often inconsistent ranging from micro to millimeter lu et al 2013 ni et al 2009 while the optimal anammox granules diameter in treating low strength ammonium sewage remains little known the anammox process is mediated by the anammox bacteria previous studies on activated sludge floc from a sewage treatment plant revealed that anammox diversity was very low and the genus candidatus brocadia was the absolute dominant species wang et al 2015 similarly in treating low ammonia synthetic domestic wastewater 55 mgl 1 metagenomic analysis showed that candidatus jettenia caeni and candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis were the top two dominant species in anoxic biofilm ma et al 2017 when treating high ammonia wastewater such as landfill leachate microbial diversity analysis on floccular sludge and granular biofilm samples in lab scale up flow reactor and full scale landfill leachate treatment plant showed that brocadia dominated the anammox community with other genus like candidatus scalindua being rarely detected azari et al 2017 ke et al 2015 furthermore the effects of anammox granular size on microbial distribution in anammox sludge granules their abundance activity and community structuring as well as their symbiosis with other microorganisms are also not well understood beside saving carbon and energy another great advantage of anammox is that it does not produce nitrous oxide n2o which was revealed after elucidating its underlying molecular mechanisms kartal et al 2011 we also previously showed that the n2o released in areas with high anammox activity was significantly lower than the areas with low or no anammox activity zhu et al 2013 2015 however previous studies on lab pilot and even full scale granular sludge reactors also reported the accumulation and subsequent release of n2o zhu et al 2008 ma et al 2013 castro barros et al 2015 a recent breakthrough was achieved by ali et al 2016 when they reported that approximately 70 of n2o was produced by oxic nitrifiers in the surface of the granular biomass from the nitritation anammox reactor by successfully using isotopic fish and microsensor analyses the rest of the n2o meanwhile was produced in the anammox bacteria dominated anoxic zone ali et al 2016 however the mechanism of n2o production in anaerobic granular sludge processes could be completely different because its surface might not be oxic currently the interactions between the nitrifiers and denitrifiers and the anammox bacteria and how they contribute to anaerobic n2o remain little understood this study then aims to investigate anammox bacterial abundance activity and community structure in various anammox granule sizes to determine the most optimal granule size in treating low strength ammonium sewage with special attention to n2o production to do this the anammox granules were first enriched and cultured and then microbial activities related to n2o production were investigated using qpcr high throughput sequencing network analysis and fluorescence imaging techniques 2 experimental procedures 2 1 reactor setup and operation a 3 l lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with an internal diameter of 80 mm was used as the incubation device for anammox

ecologically represent specialists whereas module hubs and connectors refer to the generalists while the network hubs as super generalists olesen et al 2007 deng et al 2012 2 8 extracting anammox granules layers the anammox granules were artificially divided into four layers from the inside to outside namely the pellet tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps and outer slime layer changes in total polysaccharides ps and proteins pn content in different layers represented the transformation of organic substances along the sludge granulation total dna accounted for less than 10 5 of the total eps content indicating that during the eps extraction process microbial cells were basically intact and no intracellular substances overflowed which could affect the results extraction of tb eps and lb eps were carried out as previously reported yu et al 2008 50 0 ml of anammox granules in different particle sizes were collected on the 200th day at the end of the steady stage the sludge was directly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected here referred to as the slime the collected bottom sludge was re suspended to their original volume using a ph 7 buffer solution consisting of 1 3 mm na3po4 2 7 mm nah2po4 6 mm nacl and 0 7 mm kcl the suspensions were centrifuged again at 5000 g for 15 min with the supernatant and the solid phase was collected separately the organic substances in the supernatant were used as the lb eps collected sediments were re suspended again with buffer solution to the original volumes and then treated using ultrasonicator fs 600 shanghai sonxi co ltd china at 20 khz and 480 w for 10 min at 4 c the extracted solutions were subsequently centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min the organic substances in the supernatant were used for the tb eps while the residues solid phase were used as the pellet 3 result 3 1 start up stability and granulation process of anammox sludge in the first 20 days of the start up phase the anammox activity increased gradually and was detected at an hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 50 h and an influent nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 64 kg n m3 d fig 1 supplementary table s3 the nh4 and no2 removal rate increased from 5 36 to 23 6 42 6 and 42 4 respectively between 21 and 60 days the influent nlr increased to 1 06 kg n m3 d and the removal rates of nh4 and no2 further increased to 68 9 and 74 0 respectively on day 61 80 nh4 and no2 removal rate rapidly increased to more than 90 with nlr increasing to 1 50 kg n m3 d during the start up phase 0 80 d the total sludge mass increased from 3213 0 to 6742 0 mg vss l with an average sludge yield of about 44 1 mg vss l d at the same time about 46 1 of the seeding floc sludge gradually granulated with a diameter of 0 2 0 5 mm and 0 5 0 9 mm accounting for 39 4 and 6 7 of the total sludge mass respectively after the start up phase the reactor stabilized in operation for the remaining 120 days 81 200 d with an average nlr of 1 1 0 1 kg n m3 d the average effluent concentrations of nh4 and no2 were 0 97 0 79 mg l 1 and 0 64 0 36 mg l 1 with removal rates of 96 4 2 9 and 97 9 1 2 respectively at the end of the stable operation phase 200 d the proportion of the granular sludge of different particle size to the total sludge mass was as follows 0 2 mm 6 3 here referred to as flocs 0 2 0 5 mm 9 0 0 5 0 9 mm 31 0 0 9 1 5 mm 25 8 1 5 2 0 mm 18 6 and 2 0 2 5 mm 9 3 fig 2 a the total sludge mass reached 16 255 mg vss l 1 and the average sludge yield was 79 mg vssl 1 d 1 about twice higher than the start up phase with the growth of granular sludge anammox bacteria aggregated together like iron red cauliflowers in line with the previous studies ke et al 2015 azari et al 2017 fig 2b and c 3 2 nitrogen removal performance of anammox granular sludge with various particle sizes the nitrogen removal performance was further investigated with different particle sizes 0 2 mm 0 2 0 5 mm 0 5 0 9 mm 0 9 1 5 mm 1 5 2 0 mm and 2 0 2 5 mm of anammox granule sludge at a sludge concentration of 1800 2000 mg vss l in 1 0 l lab scale sbr reactors fig 3 when the anammox granule particle sizes were 0 2 mm and 0 2 0 5 mm the n removal rates were maintained at a relatively low level only 10 9 1 1 and 19 1 0 7 mg n g vss h for nh4 and no2 respectively the tn removal rate was 23 8 3 1 mg n g vss h with a removal efficiency of 77 2 10 4 when the anammox granular grew to larger sizes 0 5 0 9 mm the n removal rates were significantly increased to 60 6 31 5 and 33 2 mg n g vss h for tn nh4 and no2 respectively with a removal efficiency of 89 5 however the n removal rates then gradually decreased with the increase of particle sizes finally reducing to 42 1 15 0 and 29 9 mg n g vss h for tn nh4 and no2 respectively with a removal efficiency of 73 0 at the particle size of 2 0 2 5 mm the analysis of metabolic ratios of different n pollutants at different particle sizes of anammox sludge showed that the values of δno3 δnh4 and δno2 δnh4 at the particle size of 0 5 0 9 mm were the ones very close to the theoretical values of anammox reaction stoichiometry of 0 26 and 1 32 respectively in a word the n removal rates of anammox granular sludge would increase with the particle sizes but it would not increase continuously when a certain anammox granular size 0 5 0 9 mm in this study is reached the n removal rates begin to decrease gradually we also observed a short term accumulation of n2o during nitrogen removal at different anammox granular sizes the n2o accumulation rate was less than 0 20 mg n g vss h at the particle size below 0 5 mm but decreased to 0 03 mg n g vss h when the particle size increased to 0 5 0 9 mm accounting for only 0 1 of tn conversion rate for the particle size above 0 9 mm the n2o accumulation rate rapidly increased to 5 6 mg n g vss h at the size of 2 0 2 5 mm the n2o accumulation rate increased with the anammox granular size these results indicate that the n removal rates increased when the anammox activated sludge floc shifted to anammox granular sludge and also increased with n2o accumulation taking into consideration of n removal rates and n2o emission together the optimal anammox granular sludge particle size 0 5 0 9 mm in this study should be maintained in the low strength ammonium sewage treatments 3 3 abundance of anammox bacteria in granular sludge with varying particle sizes the abundance of anammox bacteria significantly increased during the anammox sludge granulation the functional genes hzsb of anammox bacteria increased from 107 to 1011 copies g vss and the proportion in total bacteria increased from 1 to 8 10 fig 4 however the anammox abundance did not always increase with the particle size in consistence with the trend of the anammox activity the maximum anammox abundance 2 02 0 05 1011 copies g vss was observed at the granular size of 0 5 0 9 mm and the abundance slightly declined with the increase of particle size at the granular sizes of 0 9 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 2 5 mm the abundance was maintained at a high level of 1 65 0 16 1011 1 63 0 00 1011 and 1 65 0 00 1011 copies g vss respectively the proportion of the anammox bacteria in the total bacteria also showed a similar result we also found that the specific anammox activity peaked at the particle size of 0 5 0 9 mm during the cultivation specific anammox activity increased rapidly in the initial stage of granulation consistently at the particle size of 0 5 0 9 mm the specific anammox cellular rate reached the highest and then declined and became stable with the increase of particle size these results suggest that a larger particle size of anammox granular sludge was not corresponding to a higher abundance and activity of anammox bacterial functional genes in contrast the larger particle size not the optimal one 0 5 0 9 mm in this study would promote the n2o emission 3 4 anammox community in granular sludge with varying particle sizes diversity analysis of the anammox granular sludge with varying particle sizes showed that anammox bacterial diversity increased with granulation process and peaked at particle sizes of 0 5 0 9 mm with three detected genera fig 5 a supplementary figure s3 and table s4 phylogenetic analysis showed that the obtained 14 otus 98 similarity from 38 hzsb gene sequences after enzyme digestion belonged to brocadia otu 1 10 81 7 of the total reads kuenenia otu 11 10 5 of total reads and jettenia otu 12 14 7 8 of the total reads in the case of the anammox sludge with granular sizes below 0 5 mm only one genus brocadia was detected while two genera brocadia and kuenenia were detected in anammox granular sludge with sizes over 0 9 mm further the symbiosis between anammox bacteria and other microorganisms was investigated in the sludge samples of floc 0 2 mm optimum particle 0 5 0 9 mm and the largest particle 2 0 2 5 mm using high throughput sequencing approach fig 5b although anammox bacteria had the highest diversity within the size of 0 5 0 9 mm bacterial co occurrence with anammox had the lowest diversity at both phylum and species levels floc sludge 0 2 mm showed the highest diversity at the phylum level a total of 13 phyla were identified including anaerolineaceae 31 1 31 8 proteobacteria 20 0 25 8 rhodocyclaceae 10 8 14 8 planctomycetes 6 5 13 0 and bacteroidetes 4 2 7 9 the relative abundance of planctomycetes all of the known anammox bacteria belong to the phylum planctomycetes were 6 5 16 6 and 13 0 in the floc optimum particle and the largest particle samples respectively these were consistent with previous observations based on the anammox functional genes we explored the bacterial co occurrence patterns of anammox bacteria using network analysis based on strong and significant correlations fig 5c in the module with candidatus brocadia there are four bacterial classes acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and double anaerolineae and four families comamonadaceae caldilineaceae patulibacteraceae and rhodospirillaceae directly correlated to candidatus brocadia moreover each correlation is positive interaction this is a further explanation of the high throughput results anaerolineaceae is widely distributed in the anaerobic reactor to degrade carbohydrates and other cell tissues miao et al 2016 proteobacteria is a common flora in the denitrification reaction system it can utilize substrate nh4 or no2 for metabolism and proliferation activities and simultaneously consume dissolved oxygen creating an anaerobic environment for the anammox bacteria cao et al 2016 2017 rhodocyclaceae is a facultative aerobic bacterial flora with diverse biological functions it may be involved in the metabolism of p and fe in the anammox process chua et al 2006 therefore through the cooperative competition for substrate dissolved oxygen and metabolic products anaerolineaceae proteobacteria rhodocyclaceae bacteroidete and anammox bacteria formed a stable microbial community of anammox granular sludge heatmap cluster analysis basing on top 100 otus of relative abundance at the species level showed that the microbial community structure and diversity of anammox in floc sludge were significantly different from those found in the anammox granular sludge fig 5d interestingly the species composition of anammox granular sludge in the size range of 0 5 0 9 mm and 2 2 5 mm showed higher similarity the functional genes for n2o producers nirs and nirk and n2o reducer nosz were further examined for each strain the nosz gene was only detected in three strains burkholderiaceae rhodospirillaceae rhodobacteraceae the nirs or nirk gene were detected in more strains anaerolineaceae comamonadaceae planctomycetaceae nitrosomonadaceae actinobacteria comamonas denitratisoma anaerolineaceae but these strains did not contained nosz gene moreover two nitrifier genera nitrospira and nitrosomonas with nirk gene were mainly detected in the sludge floc indicating n2o produced via the nitrifier denitrification pathway which is in agreement with results of ali et al 2016 the aob were seldomly detected in the granular sludge in sizes of 0 5 0 9 mm or 2 0 2 5 mm incomplete denitrification should be the main contributor of n2o in the granular sludge while insufficiency in carbon source caused n2o accumulation 3 5 stratification and fluorescence characteristics of granular sludge eps the different granular size produced different anammox abundance diversity and activity meanwhile we investigated the anammox sludge granulation process by classifying the eps of the anammox granular sludge into slime layer slime eps loose layer lb eps and dense layer tb eps fig 6 the total eps content of all granular sizes was very high which ranged from 247 8 to 693 1 mg eps g vss these values were significantly higher than that of the conventional nitrification and denitrification sludge indicating that the eps mainly caused the granulation which corroborates results of previous studies of sheng et al 2010 and hou et al 2015 the three layers of eps also varied with particle size for the slime layer the slime eps content was 121 0 302 3 mg eps g vss accounting for over 48 0 of the total eps when the particle size was less than 0 5 mm and also decreased when the particle size increased 0 5 2 5 mm with a final stable ratio of around 35 0 of the total eps fig 6a for the loose layer the lb eps contents 121 0 302 3 mg eps g vss did not change significantly with particle size with all the contents maintained to be less than 24 0 for the dense layer the tb eps in the deepest layer of sludge eps increased from 95 6 to 334 1 mg eps g vss and the ratio increased rapidly from 18 3 in 0 2 mm to 50 0 in 2 0 2 5 mm further analyses of eps composition showed that proteins and polysaccharides were enriched in tb eps with the proportions of 33 5 48 6 and 23 6 47 4 respectively fig 6b in slime and lb eps layer proteins accounted for more than 90 1 and 81 5 respectively the polysaccharides in the two layers were only less than 20 but significantly increased with particle size this result indicates that tb eps layer was the main eps layer of anammox granular sludge in which the polysaccharides may play an important role in maintaining the eps structure the three dimensional fluorescence spectra of the three eps layers in anammox granular sludge showed that there were two main distinct characteristic fluorescence peaks specifically pertaining to the peaks of cr amino acid peak i and tryptophan peak ii fig 6c both are protein like and related to the aromatic ring amino acid structure in the eps the content of the cr amino acid in tb eps was the highest which increased to 78 au mg c l with the granulation process while it was low and not correlated with particle size in the other two layers the tryptophan only made up half of the cr amino acid but had the same trend and the highest signal value in the tb eps was 22 3 au mg c l the highly dense and concentrated tb eps could provide a stable anaerobic condition for anammox bacteria which might be good for the high activity and granulation of anammox sludge 4 discussion anammox has been widely applied in high strength ammonium wastewater treatment due to its low oxygen demand and lack of demand for organic carbons zhu et al 2008 recently application of anammox to sewage with low strength ammonium loading ma et al 2016 2017 lotti et al 2014 cao et al 2017 regmi et al 2016 laureni et al 2016 has also bene started in this study we found that an increase in the diameter of the anammox granular sludge did not result in significant changes in anammox abundance activity and diversity when treated with low strength sewage the other interesting observation was the gradual increase in greenhouse gas n2o accumulation with increasing sludge granular diameter even with these results however some uncertainties remain to maintain a stable anammox process in a biological wastewater treatment system it is important to consider improving at the least microbial stability diversity and activity to date the diversity of anammox bacterial hzsb functional gene in an anammox reactor with different particle size has not been reported in this study we found that the anammox bacteria had the highest diversity when the particle size ranged from 0 5 to 0 9 mm and the diversity decreased with increased particle size similar trends were obtained when dealing with high strength ammonia wastewaters with the granular size over 20 mm low diversity was also confirmed by having all of the 35 anammox clones belonging to the genus candidatus brocadia and can only be grouped into 2 otus azari et al 2017 ke et al 2015 for operation performance sludge wash out often occurs in high loaded anammox uasb reactors when the particle size of sludge increased from 1 9 mm to 2 5 mm tang et al 2011a b similar patterns were also observed by chen et al 2010 in terms of the anammox activity in a lab scale anaerobic up flow granular bed anammox reactor fed with high strength synthetic nutrient medium and granular size 2 mm the in situ anammox activity was detected by microsensors mainly from near the surface to the upper 0 8 mm of the granules cho et al 2010 under phenol stress the granular sludge size even reached 15 6 mm but rod shaped non anammox like bacteria were observed on the surface of granular sludge and the anammox activity also didn t increase yang et al 2013 combining previous results with ours these illustrate that the anammox granular sludge with bigger size did not definitely drive better performance in low ammonium sewage treatment previous and current studies also showed that the n2o is indeed generated during the anammox granulation process ma et al 2011 2012 castro barros et al 2015 in this study we found that n2o production rate increased with sludge particle size which could be related to the structure of anammox bacterial granular sludge in this system the carbon source for denitrification was mainly from the hydrolysis and acidification of the granular sludge due to the absence of external carbon source both proteins and polysaccharides are long chain molecules which differently require duration for hydrolysis and acidification huang et al 2016 both anammox and no3 n production rates in the system exceeded the hydrolysis and acidification rate of proteins and polysaccharides therefore the available carbon source became limited leading to n2o accumulation when the substrates for anammox gradually decreased the anammox rate and no3 n formation rates also decreased however when the no3 n formation rate became lower than the hydrolysis acidification rate the reduction of n2o to n2 still proceeded therefore the accumulated n2o could gradually be denitrified in the subsequent reactions the high throughput sequencing analysis results supported our hypothesis n2o emission in microbial n cycle mainly comes from nitrification related pathways and heterotrophic denitrification hu et al 2015 in the sludge floc we detected two nitrifying genera namely nitrospira and nitrosamonas with proportions of 4 1 of the total bacteria n2o production via nitrifier denitrification is a universal trait of nitrifying bacteria wrage et al 2004 this process has been suggested to be an important n2o source under low organic carbon and o2 levels wrage et al 2001 in this study the do in the uasb system remained at a very low level 0 5 mg l 1 therefore the generation of n2o in the sludge floc 0 2 mm should mainly come from nitrifier denitrification in contrast the nitrifiers at the general level in the granular sludge only accounted for less than 0 6 of the total bacteria among the denitrifying genes the nirs nirk and nosz genes are more commonly used and their abundance and community can be referred to as n2o emission potential indicators morales et al 2010 the nosz gene the only known biotic sink for n2o hu et al 2015 was detected in only three strains with the average proportion only at 1 which was much lower than the n2o producers 39 8 of nirs and 3 4 of nirk therefore heterotrophic denitrification may be the main n2o contributor in the granular sludge further we also found the diversity of bacterial co occurrence with anammox bacteria gradually increased as the particle size increased this result agrees with recent results showing that larger granules harbor more diverse microbial community symbiosis with anammox bacteria luo et al 2017 this should be attributed to the maximum mass transfer distance in the granular sludge i e the maximum particle radius some studies suggested that the active area of the granular sludge was 0 2 0 3 mm from the surface to the inside of high rate upflow anaerobic treatment systems batstone and keller 2001 while ni et al 2009 indicated that the optimal particle size was 1 0 1 3 mm under the hrt of 24 30 h and the nlr of 0 8 kg n m 3 d 1 based on the results of a kinetic modeling in anammox reactor another study showed that the depth of activity could reach up to 0 8 mm during the granulation of anammox microorganisms in up flow reactors imajo et al 2004 this may then suggest that the different species and hydraulic conditions could also lead to different depths of activity when the particle radius was greater than the maximum mass transfer distance the activity of anammox bacteria in the particles was inhibited and changes on the internal microenvironment also caused changes in microbial community structure for example some facultative anaerobic fermentative or denitrifying bacteria continued their metabolic activities when presented with suitable conditions as a result the diversity of large particle communities was also high in addition to profiling of the microbial community stratification in the granular sludge and fluorescence method was also used to investigate the anammox bacterial eps under different particle sizes we found that the proteins and polysaccharides were the main components of eps a large number of proteins secreted to the extracellular environment that became involved in the transfer process were probably due to the eps not only being adhesive causing the cells to aggregate but also serving as an ion transport channel between bacteria and the external aquatic environment this transfer of proteins was necessary for ion transfer in this study the optimal particle size was related to the eps content of 385 1 mg g vss under the volume loading rate of 1 5 kg m3 d hrt 0 76 h this is comparable to the total eps of the anammox granular sludge of 236 410 mg g vss as reported by tang et al 2011a which was obtained under high hydraulic loading rate of 152 4 221 0 103 kg m3 d hrt 0 16 0 11 h in comparison lower carbohydrate at 83 2 mg and 42 7 mg proteins per gram vss were suggested by ni et al 2010 under the loading rate of 0 8 kg m3 d the higher eps and volume loading rate indicate that the anammox granular sludge formed in this study had stronger adhesion and higher stability on the other hand the composition of eps obtained by stratification indicates that the polysaccharides were the main factors causing anammox sludge granulation although the proteins were 1 6 times higher than the polysaccharides this was consistent with the high polysaccharides in tb eps layer reported by ni et al 2010 moreover the polysaccharides also gradually increased during the sludge granulation process indicating that it promoted the granulation of anammox sludge finally this study provided some suggestions to optimize anammox process in the bioreactor the 0 5 0 9 mm particle size range produced the highest mass transfer efficiency in treating low strength wastewater this particle size range was significantly smaller than those obtained from the reactor treating high ammonia wastewater 1 0 6 4 mm tang et al 2011a 0 3 15 6 mm yang et al 2013 but similar with the results of tang 2014 0 5 1 5 mm and ma 2012 0 5 0 9 mm who also treated low strength wastewater therefore the particle size of granular sludge may be determined by the substrate concentration in the influent rather than the operational conditions such as the process mode operation and hydraulic retention time among others in the reactor treating high ammonia wastewater the sludge particles reached as high as 6 4 mm but could also have some negative effects on process performance such as particle floatation and run off chen et al 2010 tang et al 2011a b the present study demonstrated that the amount of the released n2o significantly increased with sludge particle size to optimize operations and mitigate greenhouse gas production the particle size of sludge should be controlled 5 conclusions this study aims to investigate anammox bacterial abundance activity and community structure structuring in various anammox granule sizes to determine the most optimal granule size in treating low strength ammonium sewage with special attention to n2o production the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the n removal rates of the anammox granule particle sizes were in the ranges of 0 18 0 53 0 23 0 98 and 0 36 1 13 mg n g vss h for nh4 no2 and tn respectively the functional genes hzsb of anammox bacteria increased from 107 to 1011 copies g vss with three detected anammox genera jettenia brocadia and anammoxoglobus species there are four bacterial classes acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and double anaerolineae and four families comamonadaceae caldilineaceae patulibacteraceae and rhodospirillaceae directly negative interaction with candidatus brocadia the short term accumulation of n2o was observed during n removal in various anammox granular sizes with 18 0 156 mg n gvss h the n2o reducer gene nosz was only detected in three strains namely burkholderiaceae rhodospirillaceae rhodobacteraceae the n2o producer functional genes nirs or nirk were detected in more strains anaerolineaceae comamonadaceae planctomycetaceae nitrosomonadaceae actinobacteria denitratisoma etc but these strains did not contain the nosz gene considering the integrated n removal and n2o emission the optimal anammox granular sludge particle size should be 0 5 0 9 mm in low strength ammonium sewage treatment which have the highest n removal rate 1 13 mg n g vss h for tn and anammox bacterial abundance 1011 copies g vss but lower n2o emission rate 44 0 mg n gvss h thus the optimum particle size of anammox granular sludge should be controlled to obtain high nitrogen removal efficiency and low n2o emission rate conflicts of interest

19467,this study demonstrated the removal and recovery of uranium vi in a fed batch stirred tank reactor str using waste digested activated sludge wdas the batch adsorption experiments showed that wdas can adsorb 200 9 0 mg of uranium vi per g of wdas the maximum adsorption of uranium vi was achieved even at an acidic initial ph of 2 7 which increased to a ph of 4 0 in the equilibrium state desorption of uranium vi from wdas was successfully demonstrated from the release of more than 95 of uranium vi using both acidic 0 5 m hcl and alkaline 1 0 m na2co3 eluents due to the fast kinetics of uranium vi adsorption onto wdas the fed batch str was successfully operated at a mixing time of 15 min twelve consecutive uranium vi adsorption steps with an average adsorption efficiency of 91 5 required only two desorption steps to elute more than 95 of uranium vi from wdas uranium vi was shown to interact predominantly with the phosphoryl and carboxyl groups of the wdas as revealed by in situ infrared spectroscopy and time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy studies this study provides a proof of concept of the use of fed batch str process based on wdas for the removal and recovery of uranium vi graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption desorption str infrared spectroscopy uranium sludge 1 introduction the consumption of fossil fuels is the main contributor to the worldwide co2 emission ipcc 2007 for instance the production of electricity out of fossil fuel emits 600 1200 g co2 per kwh generated lenzen 2008 sims et al 2003 a significant decrease of such emissions can be achieved by the use of nuclear energy which has been shown to emit only 10 130 g co2 per kwh of electricity generated lenzen 2008 sims et al 2003 uranium is the major chemical element used for the production of energy in nuclear power plants and thus exploited by intense mining activities the processing of uranium ores typically consists of acidic or alkaline leaching followed by solvent extraction ion exchange and precipitation of uranium as yellow cake international atomic energy agency 1993 resulting in generation of waste streams loaded with uranium carvalho et al 2007 križman et al 1995 tripathi et al 2008 in addition there are further anthropogenic activities such as nuclear research and weapon manufacturing mining and processing of uranium bearing polymetallic ores combustion of coal and the use of phosphate fertilizers containing uranium as impurity which potentially lead to elevated concentrations of uranium in water streams kamunda et al 2016 takeda et al 2006 due to the chemical and radiological toxicity of uranium towards humans and the environment brugge et al 2005 domingo 2001 pyle et al 2001 the discharge limits of uranium in drinking water and milling water are 0 03 and 2 5 mg l 1 respectively iaea 2004 who 2012 however as a source of energy it is also beneficial to recover this uranium in a form that can be fed to the different steps of uranium ore processing however the addition of the recovered uranium to the feed of the different ore processing steps should not affect the process efficiency and should not require any major changes to the mineral processing infrastructure adsorption combined with desorption is a promising technology for the recovery of valuable metals including uranium from wastewaters generally bearing low concentrations of the contaminants for a review see gao et al 2014 adsorption has several advantages such as ease of operation scalability and low cost thus there is a constant search for adsorbents that i can remove the metal from aqueous phases efficiently and ii allow the adsorbed metals to be easily desorbed furthermore the acquisition or production costs of the adsorbent should be low and it should be available in adequate quantities as well as it can be easily disposed of without further problems the waste digested activated sludge wdas potentially fits the above criteria for such an adsorbent the wdas is a waste product of anaerobic digestion of the excess sludge generated at wastewater treatment plants to produce biogas the wdas is produced in large quantity and mainly contains water 85 and rest of the solid constituents are microbial cells metcalf 1991 these solid constituents have a large variety of functional sites such as carboxyl phosphoryl hydroxyl and amine moieties on their surfaces as observed for activated sludge prior to its anaerobic digestion jain et al 2015 these microbial cells also contain nutrients and thus can be suitable as an agricultural fertilizer or soil amendment for a review see fytili and zabaniotou 2008 however municipal wastewater sludge and wdas can contain trace levels of metals and organic pollutants pharmaceutical residues and micro plastics mahon et al 2017 consequently land use of wdas is restricted in some countries and not often favored by farmers mininni et al 2015 suominen et al 2014 tampio et al 2016 thus the disposal of large quantities of wdas entails extra costs to the treatment plants guo et al 2013 considering above wdas might represent an efficient and economic adsorbent for uranium recovery from wastewaters for the successful application of wdas the exploration of the uranium recovery capabilities of the wdas in its native state is mandatory in particular the use of stirred tank reactor str for the adsorption desorption of uranium vi onto from native wdas needs to be tested before treating more complex real wastewater also it is important to understand the uranium vi adsorption mechanism i e what are the uranium species occurring during the adsorption processes onto wdas for further developing the technology further the developed technology should be able to recover uranium vi from its low concentrated wastewater 50 mg l 1 which is economically or technically not feasible with solvent extraction and ion exchange resins wang and chen 2009 finally the developed technology should be easily integrated to the existing uranium ore processing infrastructure including ion exchangers and solvent extraction process or rather act as a feeder to each of these processes this study attempted to fill the above mentioned knowledge gaps batch adsorption experiments were carried out to optimize the operational parameters of the fed batch str operations in situ attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ft ir and time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs measurements were performed to understand the uranium vi adsorption mechanism 2 materials methods 2 1 wdas and synthetic uranium wastewaters the wdas was obtained from viinikanlahti wastewater treatment plant tampere finland and characterized for total solids metal concentration and brunauer emmett teller analysis more details in si the uranium solutions were prepared from accutrace icp uranium standard solution containing 1000 mg l 1 of uranium more details in si 2 2 spectroscopic measurements the interaction between uranium vi and the sludge at the solid liquid interface was investigated by in situ atr ft ir and trlfs spectroscopies see foerstendorf et al 2014 jordan et al 2013 and si for more details 2 3 batch adsorption experiments all batch adsorption experiments were carried out in a total volume of 10 ml in shake flasks at 27 1 c and 150 rpm mixing the ph of wdas suspensions for all batch adsorption experiments was 8 0 0 2 from a time dependent adsorption study with initial uranium and wdas concentrations of 22 0 mg l 1 and 0 2 g l 1 respectively at initial phinit of 3 2 and pheq varying between 4 6 and 5 4 it was found that equilibrium was achieved after 960 min fig s1 in si consequently all subsequent batch adsorption experiments were carried out for 960 min adsorption studies were performed with varied initial uranium concentration u init 3 3 89 1 mg l 1 phinit 3 2 at constant wdas concentration of 0 2 g l 1 the pheq varied from 4 4 to 5 6 the effect of different initial uranium solution ph phinit 2 2 4 5 u init 22 0 mg l 1 was also investigated at constant wdas concentration of 0 2 g l 1 the effect of wdas dosage on the uranium adsorption was studied at varying wdas concentration from 0 2 to 1 5 g l 1 u init 20 6 mg l 1 phinit 3 2 the pheq for the dosage experiments varied from 4 2 to 7 2 the predominant aqueous uranium species at ph 3 2 is the fully hydrated uo2 2 species guillaumont et al 2003 after each batch experiment solid liquid separation was carried out by filtering the samples with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter the uranium concentration in the filtrate was measured by total reflection x ray fluorescence spectrometer txrf bruker s2 picofox using gallium ga as internal standard control experiments were carried out to rule out the possibility of adsorption onto the filter material all experiments were carried out in duplicates and if the duplicate varied by more than 10 the experiments were repeated 2 4 batch desorption experiments the batch desorption experiments were carried out on two different initial wdas quantities 2 0 mg and 6 0 mg the wdas were loaded with 85 89 mg of uranium per g of wdas thus containing 0 171 0 002 and 0 534 0 028 mg of uranium onto 2 0 and 6 0 mg wdas respectively the higher wdas quantity entailed higher total mass of uranium which allowed us to compare our desorption capacities after the adsorption the samples were centrifuged at 5200 g for 15 min to carry out solid liquid separation the supernatant was collected and uranium concentration was measured using txrf desorption was induced by resuspension of the uranium loaded wdas in 2 ml of hcl or na2co3 at different concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 2 m for 24 h by shaking at 150 rpm and 27 1 c subsequently the samples were centrifuged at 5200 g for 15 min and the concentration of desorbed uranium in the supernatant was determined by txrf 2 5 fed batch str operations the working volume used for the fed batch str was 900 ml fig 1 a synthetic uranium solution 560 ml 5 0 mg l 1 uranium vi phinit 3 2 was used as an influent at every adsorption step the rest of the reactor volume was filled with the wdas and milli q water the final wdas concentration in the fed batch str was 3 1 g l 1 the mixing was carried out by the use of magnetic stirrer rotating at 150 rpm the mixing time for the adsorption was optimized by evaluating the performance of the fed batch str at mixing time of 15 30 and 60 min for each mixing time three adsorption steps were carried out after each adsorption step wdas was allowed to settle by gravity for 1 h and the 560 ml of supernatant was removed by an effluent port in the reactor after the removal of the 560 ml effluent another 560 ml of 5 0 mg l 1 uranium solution at phinit 3 2 was added for next adsorption step in order to keep a total volume of str at 900 ml to provide further proof of the wdas applicability in its native state the fed batch str was operated for twelve adsorption steps at the optimized mixing time all the adsorption steps were carried in similar fashion as operated for optimizing the mixing times the ph and uranium concentration of the effluent after each step and final step were measured desorption in the fed batch str was performed subsequently to the 12 step adsorption experiment the final adsorption step was completed by removing 560 ml of the supernatant after 1 h of gravity settling as carried out in all the previous adsorption steps now the reactor has 340 ml of wdas and supernatant the wdas was settled overnight about 70 of the supernatant 250 ml was removed by decanting and replaced with equal volume of milli q water a solution of na2co3 560 ml was added and the total volume in the fed batch str was again 900 ml and the final na2co3 concentration was 1 87 m the mixing time for desorption was 60 min the mixing was carried out by the use of magnetic stirrer rotating at 150 rpm after the first desorption step the wdas was allowed to settle for 60 min and 560 ml of the supernatant was removed from the effluent port for the next desorption step a solution of na2co3 560 ml was added followed by mixing settling and removing the effluent the ph and uranium concentration of the effluent after each desorption step were measured after desorption wdas was digested with concentrated hno3 the remaining content of uranium and other heavy metals in the sludge was determined by icp ms 3 results 3 1 wdas characterization the total solids ts of the wdas obtained from viinikanlahti wastewater treatment plant tampere finland varied between 28 0 and 30 0 g l 1 the total elemental analysis of the wdas suggested the presence of na k ca p cu and zn among other metals at varying concentrations but confirmed the very low concentration of uranium in the wdas table s1 in si the bet n2 surface area of wdas was 6 25 m2 g 1 which is similar to the value observed in a previous study lu et al 1995 3 2 spectroscopic measurements of the u vi wdas system spectroscopic measurements ir and trlfs were carried out to shed light on the underlying mechanism occurring during the interaction of uranium vi with the wdas the mid ir spectrum of the aqueous uranium vi ion is characterized by the asymmetric stretching ν 3 uo2 vibration observed at 961 cm 1 for the fully hydrated uo2 2 ion fig 2 a at ph 5 5 this frequency is decreased to 923 cm 1 due to the occurrence of numerous uranium vi hydrolysis species such as monomeric hydroxo complexes in the lower micromolar concentration range as suggested in an earlier study müller et al 2008 lower frequencies of this vibrational mode indicate the presence of ligands with a high affinity to the uranyl ions such as carboxyl or phosphoryl groups barkleit et al 2008 li et al 2010 during the ongoing loading process onto wdas the maximum of the band representing the ν 3 uo2 mode was shifted from 902 to 917 cm 1 reflecting a change of the functional groups predominantly binding the uranyl ions with time fig 2a from the low frequency observed at an early stage it can be assumed that the uranyl ions were preferably coordinated to functional groups showing a high affinity to the heavy metal ions such as phosphoryl groups bader et al 2017 at longer reaction times i e 30 min the band of the ν 3 uo2 mode was centered at 917 cm 1 suggesting that the interaction with carboxylic groups became predominant bader et al 2017 this was supported by the simultaneous occurrence of bands at 1531 and 1448 cm 1 which are assigned to the antisymmetric ν 3 as and symmetric ν 3 s stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups respectively barkleit et al 2008 li et al 2010 upon unloading with 0 1 m nacl the spectra were characterized by significantly reduced amplitudes fig 2b the ν 3 uo2 mode was now observed at 924 cm 1 reflecting the predominant release of u vi species from the wdas it is however difficult to distinguish between species located in the pores of the wdas or weakly interacting with the solid phase via electrostatic attraction the asymmetric shape of the band in the unloading spectra suggested a release of small amounts of u vi species bound to specific functional groups however the significantly different shapes and amplitudes of the spectra of the loading and unloading processes indicated a predominant formation of inner sphere complexes under the prevailing conditions and therefore a strong association of the uranium vi to the wdas bader et al 2017 the trlfs measurements confirmed the interaction of carboxyl and phosphoryl groups of wdas with uranium leading to a mixture of uranium vi phosphoryl and carboxyl complexes these complexes were present albeit at different ratios in the spectra measured at three different equilibrium ph bader et al 2017 vogel et al 2010 for more details refer to si and fig s2 and table s2 in the si 3 3 batch adsorption of uranium vi the mg of uranium adsorbed per g of wdas qe in mg g 1 increased from 16 4 0 1 to 200 0 9 0 with increasing initial uranium concentration u init from 3 3 mg l 1 to 89 1 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 a simultaneously the equilibrium ph pheq decreased from 5 8 to 4 6 precipitation of uranium vi in the aqueous phase after adsorption was not expected as the equilibrium uranium concentration u eq and pheq were within the thermodynamically stable region guillaumont et al 2003 the qe did not reach a maximum under the conditions applied as the focus of this technology is wastewaters with relatively low concentrations of uranium further increase in the initial uranium concentration was not carried out the adsorption of uranium onto wdas increased with the increasing ph of the initial uranium solution as well as with the increasing pheq fig 3b the qe was 55 0 6 2 mg g 1 at initial uranium solution ph phinit of 2 5 and pheq of 3 2 the qe increased to 97 7 0 5 mg g 1 when phinit was 4 5 and pheq was 7 4 as seen in fig 3b the increase in the pheq from 4 0 to 7 4 phinit varied from 2 7 to 4 5 did not increase the qe of wdas the adsorption of 22 5 mg l 1 of uranium solution at phinit 3 2 was investigated to ascertain the appropriate starting wdas concentration in the fed batch str as the wdas dosage increased from 0 2 g l 1 to 1 5 g l 1 the uranium removal percentage increased from 76 6 0 1 to higher than 93 fig 3c as twelve steps were envisioned in the str reactor a starting wdas concentration of 3 1 g l 1 was chosen for the fed batch str operations based on more than 93 removal at 1 5 g l 1 wdas concentration in batch study 3 4 batch desorption of uranium desorption studies of uranium by hcl and na2co3 solutions of different concentrations were carried out on two different starting mass of wdas 2 mg and 6 mg with qe in the range from 85 to 89 mg g 1 thus containing 0 171 0 002 and 0 534 0 028 mg of uranium respectively in general more than 88 of the adsorbed uranium was recovered under all the tested conditions for the two different masses of wdas suggesting good desorption fig 4 the control was accomplished by using milli q water as desorbing eluent desorption was 1 and 10 in control for 2 mg and 6 mg wdas samples respectively fig 4 for an efficient feeding to the uranium ore processing steps of either solvent extraction ion exchange or precipitation edwards and oliver 2000 iaea 2000 an increased uranium concentration after the desorption process is desirable thus the uranium concentration after desorption should be preferably much higher than the uranium concentration present in the influent wastewater to achieve this objective the volume of the eluent was significantly reduced by a factor of 4 5 compared to the volume of the initial uranium solution thus the concentration of uranium in the batch experiments from influent was increased from 18 8 mg l 1 to higher than 75 0 mg l 1 and from 86 2 mg l 1 to higher than 245 0 mg l 1 fig s3 in si this represents 4 2 and 3 1 fold increase in the uranium concentration when using 2 0 and 6 0 mg of wdas with a qe of 85 89 mg g 1 3 5 fed batch str operations three different mixing times 15 30 and 60 min were studied for three adsorption cycles for the adsorption of uranium as well as optimization of the mixing time in the fed batch str fig 5 a the fed uranium solution had a uranium concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 and phinit 3 2 while the concentration of uranium in the str after dilution due to the presence of wdas was 3 1 mg l 1 cycle 1 showed 61 62 removal for 15 and 30 min mixing time while 71 removal for 60 min mixing time cycle 2 and 3 demonstrated that the removal increased to 92 95 and 99 for 15 30 and 60 min mixing time respectively fig 5a the twelve cycle adsorption of uranium at 15 min mixing time fig 5b also demonstrated similar trends as observed in three cycle experiments fig 5a for the first three cycles adsorption of uranium increased from 45 to 95 and from fifth to twelfth cycle the adsorption of uranium remained above 99 fig 5b the pheq decreased from 7 8 to 6 8 for the first three cycles from the fifth to twelfth cycle the pheq dropped from 6 5 to 5 0 for the complete desorption of the adsorbed uranium in the fed batch str only two cycles with 1 87 m na2co3 of final concentration in the fed batch str was required fig 5c the pheq of the desorbed solution in the first and second desorption cycles were 11 4 and 11 6 respectively the desorption process from wdas not only led to the release of uranium but other elements such as p ca and al table s3 in si were also detected as seen in table s3 in si the concentration of other heavy metals such as ni cr zn cu ni mo were orders of magnitude lower than uranium further concentration of ni cr zn cu mo as and se in wdas after final desorption was even lower than the one observed in the wdas prior to adsorption however na concentration of wdas increased significantly due to use of na2co3 in the desorption table s3 in si further there was significant presence of p ca and al along with uranium after desorption 4 discussion 4 1 semi continuous recovery of uranium by wdas in fed batch str this study provided a proof of concept for the removal and successful recovery of uranium vi from synthetic wastewaters using wdas the 6 72 l feed of 5 0 mg l 1 uranium at phinit 3 2 in the twelve steps of the fed batch str operation led to 1 12 l desorbed uranium at 30 3 mg l 1 this resulted in 6 05 times concentration of uranium vi when compared to the feed fig 5b and c the uranium concentration obtained in this study is sufficient 30 9 and 280 mg l 1 of uranium in fed batch str and batch respectively fig 5c and fig s3 in si for conventional ion exchange or solvent extraction procedures where uranium concentrations are generally required in mg l 1 for further concentration and the subsequent uranium precipitation as a yellow cake composed of sodium diuranate edwards and oliver 2000 iaea 2000 seidel 1990 zhu et al 2013 the recovery of uranium from carbonate as well as acid leach solutions is well established iaea 2000 zhu et al 2013 thus the proposed technology in principle can be integrated into the existing uranium ore processing infrastructure this study also validated the principle of using wdas in the semi continuous fed batch str for the recovery of uranium from synthetic wastewaters though the adsorption of uranium onto wdas in its native form has never been investigated the application of the waste activated sludge for metal adsorption before as well as after the anaerobic digestion has been carried out by drying and then immobilizing the sludge in columns for continuous or semi continuous operation aksu et al 2002 aksu and gönen 2004 gulnaz et al 2005 li et al 2011 the column operations of dried wdas have challenges with the back flush due to the small size of wdas particles that generally vary between 0 063 mm and 2 5 mm gulnaz et al 2005 furthermore the immobilization of wdas would require dewatering and drying as the use of wdas for column operations without drying is not possible due to its liquid nature water content in wdas is higher than 85 the significant challenge however in the columns adsorption process is the limited mixing or contact of adsorbate and adsorbent due to the diffusion controlled longitudinal mass transfer presence of dead regions and flow channeling pamukoglu and kargi 2007 simoni et al 2001 this leads to the reduced real adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in columns for instance the adsorption capacity towards cu ions of a powdered activated sludge was 100 times lower in a column compared to a fed batch str pamukoglu and kargi 2007 the use of the fed batch str operations in this study overcame the need of drying and immobilization of wdas as well as the limitation of mass transfer due to diffusion by continuous mixing the main challenge of the fed batch str operations is the power requirement for the mixing which could be offset by the pump and piping requirement for the column operations however this would require more detailed assessment which is beyond the scope of this study the adsorption capacity of wdas is among the highest when compared to other bio sorbents used in previous studies table 1 when the adsorption capacity qe of wdas is compared with chemical sorbents and ion exchange resins the adsorption capacity is lower than the polysulfide layered double hydroxide composites and sulphonic acid functionalized amberlite irn 77 resin but comparable or better to the other chemical sorbents and 2 n dimethyl pyridinium groups functionalized varion ap ion exchange resin table 1 however the advantage with wdas is it is a waste by product of the energy generation process anaerobic digestion of a waste generated by municipal wastewater treatment plants and the disposal of which entails cost to the treatment plants in contrast most of the bio sorbents listed in table 1 are produced purely for the purpose of sorption 4 2 molecular aspects of uranium adsorption and desorption processes the change in the ph affects the interaction of uranyl ions with the wdas fig 3b suggesting the role of the protonation deprotonation state of the functional groups of the wdas the qe doubled to 100 2 2 3 mg g 1 when the equilibrium ph changed from 3 2 to 4 0 this doubling is most likely due to the increase in the concentration of the deprotonated functional sites jain et al 2015 the ir and trlfs spectra confirmed the interaction of phosphoryl and carboxyl groups with uranyl ions for its adsorption onto wdas fig 2 and fig s2 in si the interaction of uranyl ions with phosphoryl and carboxyl groups is also reported for s layer proteins and vegetative cells of bacillus sphaericus jg a12 merroun et al 2005 for bacterial lipopolysaccharide barkleit et al 2011 as well as for wholes cells of bacillus subtilis fowle et al 2000 the pka of the carboxyl group and phosphoryl group are reported in the range of 3 9 5 5 and 6 9 7 2 respectively for bacterial lipopolysaccharide barkleit et al 2011 bacillus subtilis fowle et al 2000 and activated sludge jain et al 2015 this suggests that the jump of equilibrium ph from 3 2 to 4 0 would certainly increase the deprotonated sites of the carboxyl groups and thus result in increase in the adsorption of uranium onto wdas the ir measurements suggested that the interaction of uranyl ions initially takes place with phosphoryl and then with carboxyl groups fig 2a and fig s2 in si one of the possible reasons is the probably higher concentration of phosphoryl groups as observed in the activated sludge jain et al 2015 another reason could be the higher affinity of uranium towards forming uranium phosphate aqueous complexes log k 11 8 compared to the formation of uranium carbonate aqueous complexes log k 5 4 fowle et al 2000 li et al 2010 the adsorption of uranium in the fed batch str was increasing with the first three cycles at the different mixing times fig 5a and b this is contrary to the more typical of high adsorption in initial cycles followed by decrease in adsorption capacity due to saturation phillips et al 2008 the observed phenomenon can be due to the decrease in the equilibrium ph in the first three cycles from 7 8 to 6 8 similar phenomenon where the uranium adsorption decreased at ph values greater than 6 0 was also observed for the adsorption of uranium onto macroporous fibrous polymeric adsorbent containing amidoxime chelating functional group zhang et al 2005 this was explained by the formation of uranium vi colloids which are expected to be mobile and hence present in the effluent another possibility is the presence of soluble uranium carbonate complex present at such ph values therefore either recirculation of the effluent of the fed batch str for the first three cycles is warranted or pheq should be kept below 6 0 in the fed batch str desorption of uranium was successfully carried out by two eluents hcl and na2co3 as previously reported to be efficient for uranium desorption akhtar et al 2007 fig 4 both eluents were able to desorb the uranium from the wdas the addition of hcl generates neutral carboxyl and phosphoryl groups releasing the adsorbed uranyl ions into the aqueous phase in contrast na2co3 increased the ph above 11 0 under this condition still more than 95 of uranium was released from wdas due to the formation of the thermodynamically very stable uranyl carbonate complex under the prevailing high carbonate concentrations fowle et al 2000 krestou and panias 2004 4 3 perspectives in this study the qe for the fed batch str for all the combined twelve steps was 11 5 mg g 1 which is 18 times lower than the one observed in the batch experiments as the saturation was not achieved in the fed batch str operation fig 5b for an estimation of number of possible feed steps in the fed batch str a sufficient high qe and low enough residual uranium concentration point was chosen from isotherm fig 3a the qe of 80 7 mg g 1 with residual uranium concentration of 0 7 mg l 1 in the solution u init 16 9 mg l 1 u eq 0 7 mg l 1 volume 10 ml wdas conc 0 2 g l 1 was selected at 3 1 g l 1 wdas concentration in 900 ml fed batch str and assuming qe of 80 7 mg g 1 the total uranium that can be adsorbed is 225 2 mg with addition of 560 ml of u init 5 mg l 1 2 80 mg of uranium would be added in each step assuming 100 adsorption of all the added uranium in each step it would suggests that the efficient uranium removal could be continued for 80 steps of 560 ml u init 5 mg l 1 before u eq 0 7 mg l 1 even when qe is only 80 7 mg g 1 the uranium concentration is 8 1 w w which is considered as a high grade ore iaea 2000 since both the acid as well as alkaline desorption was successful for the wdas the uranium loaded wdas can be added to the leaching step of the primary ore processing infrastructure irrespective whether acid or alkaline is used in the leaching process iaea 2000 furthermore the adsorption of uranium at low ph as well as the increase in the equilibrium ph of the wastewater upon adsorption onto wdas fig 3b would minimize the use of lime to neutralize the wastewaters iaea 2004 combined with the low mixing time of 15 min and adsorption at low ph wdas based uranium recovery process is promising note that the calculation of the number of steps is a rough estimation as the real wastewater may vary in composition e g ph and the presence of other contaminant ions however this study is the first step in the development of wdas based uranium recovery technology the biggest challenge in developing the wdas based uranium recovery system is the selectivity of wdas towards target metals which to our knowledge has never been investigated the wastewaters originating from uranium mines mostly contain fe cd cu zn pb ni th and uranium chen et al 2017 iaea 2004 the ion exchange resins show higher selectivity towards uranium in presence of anions chloride nitrate carbonate chlorate and sulfate gu et al 2005 however when only cationic contaminants calcium magnesium are present then the sorption capacity of ion exchange membrane decreases barton et al 2004 in the presence of both cationic and anionic contaminants the formation of anionic uranium species such as uo2 so4 3 4 might preferentially occur which in turn can be selectively taken up by the anionic ion exchange resin danko et al 2017 gu et al 2005 for the sorbents such as talc and microorganisms uranium is preferentially adsorbed compared to cu cd zn ni and pb choi and park 2005 sprynskyy et al 2011 whereas fe and th are preferentially adsorbed compared to uranium sprynskyy et al 2011 syed 1999 the selectivity of adsorbent towards metals ions can be enhanced by tightly controlling adsorbent adsorbate ratio as well as equilibrium ph as was shown by the preferential adsorption of cu from equi molar mixture of cu zn and cd onto biogenic selenium nanoparticles jain et al 2016 thus the selective adsorption capacity of the wdas should be benchmarked not only against various bio sorbents but also against ion exchange resins the desorption step in the fed batch str by 1 87 m na2co3 led to a release of other heavy metals table s3 present in the wdas on the one hand this would make the disposal of wdas easier as only the adjustment of ph would be required prior to wdas disposal on the other hand a release of other metals in uranium desorption solution albeit at low concentration for heavy metals and comparable concentration for p ca and al will result in a uranium solution undesirably contaminated with other heavy metals in this study the wdas could concentrate the uranium vi by a factor of 6 05 whereas the ion exchange or solvent extractions process can increase the uranium concentration by a factor of 30 however in general adsorption process can deal with low concentrated uranium solutions 5 mg l 1 or even lower that the solvent extraction process cannot handle ion exchange resins can handle lower concentrations but their production entails cost while wdas is almost free of cost or rather cost negative the potential better cost and performance of the wdas based technology may make it possible for it to act as a feeder for the ion exchange or solvent extraction thus complimenting these technologies and making it easily integrate in the existing uranium mining infrastructure thus evaluating the wdas selectivity towards uranium as well as optimizing of the operational parameters for desorption is required for developing uranium recovery process based on wdas 5 conclusions wdas could recover and concentrate the uranium from the synthetic wastewaters by means of adsorption desorption in a fed batch str presence of phosphoryl and carboxyl functional groups on wdas facilitated the high adsorption capacity of wdas towards uranium both acidic and alkaline desorption of uranium from wdas was demonstrated wdas is a promising technology and future work on its selectivity and adsorption capacity of uranium from in real wastewaters should be evaluated acknowledgements this work was supported by the

19467,this study demonstrated the removal and recovery of uranium vi in a fed batch stirred tank reactor str using waste digested activated sludge wdas the batch adsorption experiments showed that wdas can adsorb 200 9 0 mg of uranium vi per g of wdas the maximum adsorption of uranium vi was achieved even at an acidic initial ph of 2 7 which increased to a ph of 4 0 in the equilibrium state desorption of uranium vi from wdas was successfully demonstrated from the release of more than 95 of uranium vi using both acidic 0 5 m hcl and alkaline 1 0 m na2co3 eluents due to the fast kinetics of uranium vi adsorption onto wdas the fed batch str was successfully operated at a mixing time of 15 min twelve consecutive uranium vi adsorption steps with an average adsorption efficiency of 91 5 required only two desorption steps to elute more than 95 of uranium vi from wdas uranium vi was shown to interact predominantly with the phosphoryl and carboxyl groups of the wdas as revealed by in situ infrared spectroscopy and time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy studies this study provides a proof of concept of the use of fed batch str process based on wdas for the removal and recovery of uranium vi graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption desorption str infrared spectroscopy uranium sludge 1 introduction the consumption of fossil fuels is the main contributor to the worldwide co2 emission ipcc 2007 for instance the production of electricity out of fossil fuel emits 600 1200 g co2 per kwh generated lenzen 2008 sims et al 2003 a significant decrease of such emissions can be achieved by the use of nuclear energy which has been shown to emit only 10 130 g co2 per kwh of electricity generated lenzen 2008 sims et al 2003 uranium is the major chemical element used for the production of energy in nuclear power plants and thus exploited by intense mining activities the processing of uranium ores typically consists of acidic or alkaline leaching followed by solvent extraction ion exchange and precipitation of uranium as yellow cake international atomic energy agency 1993 resulting in generation of waste streams loaded with uranium carvalho et al 2007 križman et al 1995 tripathi et al 2008 in addition there are further anthropogenic activities such as nuclear research and weapon manufacturing mining and processing of uranium bearing polymetallic ores combustion of coal and the use of phosphate fertilizers containing uranium as impurity which potentially lead to elevated concentrations of uranium in water streams kamunda et al 2016 takeda et al 2006 due to the chemical and radiological toxicity of uranium towards humans and the environment brugge et al 2005 domingo 2001 pyle et al 2001 the discharge limits of uranium in drinking water and milling water are 0 03 and 2 5 mg l 1 respectively iaea 2004 who 2012 however as a source of energy it is also beneficial to recover this uranium in a form that can be fed to the different steps of uranium ore processing however the addition of the recovered uranium to the feed of the different ore processing steps should not affect the process efficiency and should not require any major changes to the mineral processing infrastructure adsorption combined with desorption is a promising technology for the recovery of valuable metals including uranium from wastewaters generally bearing low concentrations of the contaminants for a review see gao et al 2014 adsorption has several advantages such as ease of operation scalability and low cost thus there is a constant search for adsorbents that i can remove the metal from aqueous phases efficiently and ii allow the adsorbed metals to be easily desorbed furthermore the acquisition or production costs of the adsorbent should be low and it should be available in adequate quantities as well as it can be easily disposed of without further problems the waste digested activated sludge wdas potentially fits the above criteria for such an adsorbent the wdas is a waste product of anaerobic digestion of the excess sludge generated at wastewater treatment plants to produce biogas the wdas is produced in large quantity and mainly contains water 85 and rest of the solid constituents are microbial cells metcalf 1991 these solid constituents have a large variety of functional sites such as carboxyl phosphoryl hydroxyl and amine moieties on their surfaces as observed for activated sludge prior to its anaerobic digestion jain et al 2015 these microbial cells also contain nutrients and thus can be suitable as an agricultural fertilizer or soil amendment for a review see fytili and zabaniotou 2008 however municipal wastewater sludge and wdas can contain trace levels of metals and organic pollutants pharmaceutical residues and micro plastics mahon et al 2017 consequently land use of wdas is restricted in some countries and not often favored by farmers mininni et al 2015 suominen et al 2014 tampio et al 2016 thus the disposal of large quantities of wdas entails extra costs to the treatment plants guo et al 2013 considering above wdas might represent an efficient and economic adsorbent for uranium recovery from wastewaters for the successful application of wdas the exploration of the uranium recovery capabilities of the wdas in its native state is mandatory in particular the use of stirred tank reactor str for the adsorption desorption of uranium vi onto from native wdas needs to be tested before treating more complex real wastewater also it is important to understand the uranium vi adsorption mechanism i e what are the uranium species occurring during the adsorption processes onto wdas for further developing the technology further the developed technology should be able to recover uranium vi from its low concentrated wastewater 50 mg l 1 which is economically or technically not feasible with solvent extraction and ion exchange resins wang and chen 2009 finally the developed technology should be easily integrated to the existing uranium ore processing infrastructure including ion exchangers and solvent extraction process or rather act as a feeder to each of these processes this study attempted to fill the above mentioned knowledge gaps batch adsorption experiments were carried out to optimize the operational parameters of the fed batch str operations in situ attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ft ir and time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs measurements were performed to understand the uranium vi adsorption mechanism 2 materials methods 2 1 wdas and synthetic uranium wastewaters the wdas was obtained from viinikanlahti wastewater treatment plant tampere finland and characterized for total solids metal concentration and brunauer emmett teller analysis more details in si the uranium solutions were prepared from accutrace icp uranium standard solution containing 1000 mg l 1 of uranium more details in si 2 2 spectroscopic measurements the interaction between uranium vi and the sludge at the solid liquid interface was investigated by in situ atr ft ir and trlfs spectroscopies see foerstendorf et al 2014 jordan et al 2013 and si for more details 2 3 batch adsorption experiments all batch adsorption experiments were carried out in a total volume of 10 ml in shake flasks at 27 1 c and 150 rpm mixing the ph of wdas suspensions for all batch adsorption experiments was 8 0 0 2 from a time dependent adsorption study with initial uranium and wdas concentrations of 22 0 mg l 1 and 0 2 g l 1 respectively at initial phinit of 3 2 and pheq varying between 4 6 and 5 4 it was found that equilibrium was achieved after 960 min fig s1 in si consequently all subsequent batch adsorption experiments were carried out for 960 min adsorption studies were performed with varied initial uranium concentration u init 3 3 89 1 mg l 1 phinit 3 2 at constant wdas concentration of 0 2 g l 1 the pheq varied from 4 4 to 5 6 the effect of different initial uranium solution ph phinit 2 2 4 5 u init 22 0 mg l 1 was also investigated at constant wdas concentration of 0 2 g l 1 the effect of wdas dosage on the uranium adsorption was studied at varying wdas concentration from 0 2 to 1 5 g l 1 u init 20 6 mg l 1 phinit 3 2 the pheq for the dosage experiments varied from 4 2 to 7 2 the predominant aqueous uranium species at ph 3 2 is the fully hydrated uo2 2 species guillaumont et al 2003 after each batch experiment solid liquid separation was carried out by filtering the samples with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter the uranium concentration in the filtrate was measured by total reflection x ray fluorescence spectrometer txrf bruker s2 picofox using gallium ga as internal standard control experiments were carried out to rule out the possibility of adsorption onto the filter material all experiments were carried out in duplicates and if the duplicate varied by more than 10 the experiments were repeated 2 4 batch desorption experiments the batch desorption experiments were carried out on two different initial wdas quantities 2 0 mg and 6 0 mg the wdas were loaded with 85 89 mg of uranium per g of wdas thus containing 0 171 0 002 and 0 534 0 028 mg of uranium onto 2 0 and 6 0 mg wdas respectively the higher wdas quantity entailed higher total mass of uranium which allowed us to compare our desorption capacities after the adsorption the samples were centrifuged at 5200 g for 15 min to carry out solid liquid separation the supernatant was collected and uranium concentration was measured using txrf desorption was induced by resuspension of the uranium loaded wdas in 2 ml of hcl or na2co3 at different concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 2 m for 24 h by shaking at 150 rpm and 27 1 c subsequently the samples were centrifuged at 5200 g for 15 min and the concentration of desorbed uranium in the supernatant was determined by txrf 2 5 fed batch str operations the working volume used for the fed batch str was 900 ml fig 1 a synthetic uranium solution 560 ml 5 0 mg l 1 uranium vi phinit 3 2 was used as an influent at every adsorption step the rest of the reactor volume was filled with the wdas and milli q water the final wdas concentration in the fed batch str was 3 1 g l 1 the mixing was carried out by the use of magnetic stirrer rotating at 150 rpm the mixing time for the adsorption was optimized by evaluating the performance of the fed batch str at mixing time of 15 30 and 60 min for each mixing time three adsorption steps were carried out after each adsorption step wdas was allowed to settle by gravity for 1 h and the 560 ml of supernatant was removed by an effluent port in the reactor after the removal of the 560 ml effluent another 560 ml of 5 0 mg l 1 uranium solution at phinit 3 2 was added for next adsorption step in order to keep a total volume of str at 900 ml to provide further proof of the wdas applicability in its native state the fed batch str was operated for twelve adsorption steps at the optimized mixing time all the adsorption steps were carried in similar fashion as operated for optimizing the mixing times the ph and uranium concentration of the effluent after each step and final step were measured desorption in the fed batch str was performed subsequently to the 12 step adsorption experiment the final adsorption step was completed by removing 560 ml of the supernatant after 1 h of gravity settling as carried out in all the previous adsorption steps now the reactor has 340 ml of wdas and supernatant the wdas was settled overnight about 70 of the supernatant 250 ml was removed by decanting and replaced with equal volume of milli q water a solution of na2co3 560 ml was added and the total volume in the fed batch str was again 900 ml and the final na2co3 concentration was 1 87 m the mixing time for desorption was 60 min the mixing was carried out by the use of magnetic stirrer rotating at 150 rpm after the first desorption step the wdas was allowed to settle for 60 min and 560 ml of the supernatant was removed from the effluent port for the next desorption step a solution of na2co3 560 ml was added followed by mixing settling and removing the effluent the ph and uranium concentration of the effluent after each desorption step were measured after desorption wdas was digested with concentrated hno3 the remaining content of uranium and other heavy metals in the sludge was determined by icp ms 3 results 3 1 wdas characterization the total solids ts of the wdas obtained from viinikanlahti wastewater treatment plant tampere finland varied between 28 0 and 30 0 g l 1 the total elemental analysis of the wdas suggested the presence of na k ca p cu and zn among other metals at varying concentrations but confirmed the very low concentration of uranium in the wdas table s1 in si the bet n2 surface area of wdas was 6 25 m2 g 1 which is similar to the value observed in a previous study lu et al 1995 3 2 spectroscopic measurements of the u vi wdas system spectroscopic measurements ir and trlfs were carried out to shed light on the underlying mechanism occurring during the interaction of uranium vi with the wdas the mid ir spectrum of the aqueous uranium vi ion is characterized by the asymmetric stretching ν 3 uo2 vibration observed at 961 cm 1 for the fully hydrated uo2 2 ion fig 2 a at ph 5 5 this frequency is decreased to 923 cm 1 due to the occurrence of numerous uranium vi hydrolysis species such as monomeric hydroxo complexes in the lower micromolar concentration range as suggested in an earlier study müller et al 2008 lower frequencies of this vibrational mode indicate the presence of ligands with a high affinity to the uranyl ions such as carboxyl or phosphoryl groups barkleit et al 2008 li et al 2010 during the ongoing loading process onto wdas the maximum of the band representing the ν 3 uo2 mode was shifted from 902 to 917 cm 1 reflecting a change of the functional groups predominantly binding the uranyl ions with time fig 2a from the low frequency observed at an early stage it can be assumed that the uranyl ions were preferably coordinated to functional groups showing a high affinity to the heavy metal ions such as phosphoryl groups bader et al 2017 at longer reaction times i e 30 min the band of the ν 3 uo2 mode was centered at 917 cm 1 suggesting that the interaction with carboxylic groups became predominant bader et al 2017 this was supported by the simultaneous occurrence of bands at 1531 and 1448 cm 1 which are assigned to the antisymmetric ν 3 as and symmetric ν 3 s stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups respectively barkleit et al 2008 li et al 2010 upon unloading with 0 1 m nacl the spectra were characterized by significantly reduced amplitudes fig 2b the ν 3 uo2 mode was now observed at 924 cm 1 reflecting the predominant release of u vi species from the wdas it is however difficult to distinguish between species located in the pores of the wdas or weakly interacting with the solid phase via electrostatic attraction the asymmetric shape of the band in the unloading spectra suggested a release of small amounts of u vi species bound to specific functional groups however the significantly different shapes and amplitudes of the spectra of the loading and unloading processes indicated a predominant formation of inner sphere complexes under the prevailing conditions and therefore a strong association of the uranium vi to the wdas bader et al 2017 the trlfs measurements confirmed the interaction of carboxyl and phosphoryl groups of wdas with uranium leading to a mixture of uranium vi phosphoryl and carboxyl complexes these complexes were present albeit at different ratios in the spectra measured at three different equilibrium ph bader et al 2017 vogel et al 2010 for more details refer to si and fig s2 and table s2 in the si 3 3 batch adsorption of uranium vi the mg of uranium adsorbed per g of wdas qe in mg g 1 increased from 16 4 0 1 to 200 0 9 0 with increasing initial uranium concentration u init from 3 3 mg l 1 to 89 1 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 a simultaneously the equilibrium ph pheq decreased from 5 8 to 4 6 precipitation of uranium vi in the aqueous phase after adsorption was not expected as the equilibrium uranium concentration u eq and pheq were within the thermodynamically stable region guillaumont et al 2003 the qe did not reach a maximum under the conditions applied as the focus of this technology is wastewaters with relatively low concentrations of uranium further increase in the initial uranium concentration was not carried out the adsorption of uranium onto wdas increased with the increasing ph of the initial uranium solution as well as with the increasing pheq fig 3b the qe was 55 0 6 2 mg g 1 at initial uranium solution ph phinit of 2 5 and pheq of 3 2 the qe increased to 97 7 0 5 mg g 1 when phinit was 4 5 and pheq was 7 4 as seen in fig 3b the increase in the pheq from 4 0 to 7 4 phinit varied from 2 7 to 4 5 did not increase the qe of wdas the adsorption of 22 5 mg l 1 of uranium solution at phinit 3 2 was investigated to ascertain the appropriate starting wdas concentration in the fed batch str as the wdas dosage increased from 0 2 g l 1 to 1 5 g l 1 the uranium removal percentage increased from 76 6 0 1 to higher than 93 fig 3c as twelve steps were envisioned in the str reactor a starting wdas concentration of 3 1 g l 1 was chosen for the fed batch str operations based on more than 93 removal at 1 5 g l 1 wdas concentration in batch study 3 4 batch desorption of uranium desorption studies of uranium by hcl and na2co3 solutions of different concentrations were carried out on two different starting mass of wdas 2 mg and 6 mg with qe in the range from 85 to 89 mg g 1 thus containing 0 171 0 002 and 0 534 0 028 mg of uranium respectively in general more than 88 of the adsorbed uranium was recovered under all the tested conditions for the two different masses of wdas suggesting good desorption fig 4 the control was accomplished by using milli q water as desorbing eluent desorption was 1 and 10 in control for 2 mg and 6 mg wdas samples respectively fig 4 for an efficient feeding to the uranium ore processing steps of either solvent extraction ion exchange or precipitation edwards and oliver 2000 iaea 2000 an increased uranium concentration after the desorption process is desirable thus the uranium concentration after desorption should be preferably much higher than the uranium concentration present in the influent wastewater to achieve this objective the volume of the eluent was significantly reduced by a factor of 4 5 compared to the volume of the initial uranium solution thus the concentration of uranium in the batch experiments from influent was increased from 18 8 mg l 1 to higher than 75 0 mg l 1 and from 86 2 mg l 1 to higher than 245 0 mg l 1 fig s3 in si this represents 4 2 and 3 1 fold increase in the uranium concentration when using 2 0 and 6 0 mg of wdas with a qe of 85 89 mg g 1 3 5 fed batch str operations three different mixing times 15 30 and 60 min were studied for three adsorption cycles for the adsorption of uranium as well as optimization of the mixing time in the fed batch str fig 5 a the fed uranium solution had a uranium concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 and phinit 3 2 while the concentration of uranium in the str after dilution due to the presence of wdas was 3 1 mg l 1 cycle 1 showed 61 62 removal for 15 and 30 min mixing time while 71 removal for 60 min mixing time cycle 2 and 3 demonstrated that the removal increased to 92 95 and 99 for 15 30 and 60 min mixing time respectively fig 5a the twelve cycle adsorption of uranium at 15 min mixing time fig 5b also demonstrated similar trends as observed in three cycle experiments fig 5a for the first three cycles adsorption of uranium increased from 45 to 95 and from fifth to twelfth cycle the adsorption of uranium remained above 99 fig 5b the pheq decreased from 7 8 to 6 8 for the first three cycles from the fifth to twelfth cycle the pheq dropped from 6 5 to 5 0 for the complete desorption of the adsorbed uranium in the fed batch str only two cycles with 1 87 m na2co3 of final concentration in the fed batch str was required fig 5c the pheq of the desorbed solution in the first and second desorption cycles were 11 4 and 11 6 respectively the desorption process from wdas not only led to the release of uranium but other elements such as p ca and al table s3 in si were also detected as seen in table s3 in si the concentration of other heavy metals such as ni cr zn cu ni mo were orders of magnitude lower than uranium further concentration of ni cr zn cu mo as and se in wdas after final desorption was even lower than the one observed in the wdas prior to adsorption however na concentration of wdas increased significantly due to use of na2co3 in the desorption table s3 in si further there was significant presence of p ca and al along with uranium after desorption 4 discussion 4 1 semi continuous recovery of uranium by wdas in fed batch str this study provided a proof of concept for the removal and successful recovery of uranium vi from synthetic wastewaters using wdas the 6 72 l feed of 5 0 mg l 1 uranium at phinit 3 2 in the twelve steps of the fed batch str operation led to 1 12 l desorbed uranium at 30 3 mg l 1 this resulted in 6 05 times concentration of uranium vi when compared to the feed fig 5b and c the uranium concentration obtained in this study is sufficient 30 9 and 280 mg l 1 of uranium in fed batch str and batch respectively fig 5c and fig s3 in si for conventional ion exchange or solvent extraction procedures where uranium concentrations are generally required in mg l 1 for further concentration and the subsequent uranium precipitation as a yellow cake composed of sodium diuranate edwards and oliver 2000 iaea 2000 seidel 1990 zhu et al 2013 the recovery of uranium from carbonate as well as acid leach solutions is well established iaea 2000 zhu et al 2013 thus the proposed technology in principle can be integrated into the existing uranium ore processing infrastructure this study also validated the principle of using wdas in the semi continuous fed batch str for the recovery of uranium from synthetic wastewaters though the adsorption of uranium onto wdas in its native form has never been investigated the application of the waste activated sludge for metal adsorption before as well as after the anaerobic digestion has been carried out by drying and then immobilizing the sludge in columns for continuous or semi continuous operation aksu et al 2002 aksu and gönen 2004 gulnaz et al 2005 li et al 2011 the column operations of dried wdas have challenges with the back flush due to the small size of wdas particles that generally vary between 0 063 mm and 2 5 mm gulnaz et al 2005 furthermore the immobilization of wdas would require dewatering and drying as the use of wdas for column operations without drying is not possible due to its liquid nature water content in wdas is higher than 85 the significant challenge however in the columns adsorption process is the limited mixing or contact of adsorbate and adsorbent due to the diffusion controlled longitudinal mass transfer presence of dead regions and flow channeling pamukoglu and kargi 2007 simoni et al 2001 this leads to the reduced real adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in columns for instance the adsorption capacity towards cu ions of a powdered activated sludge was 100 times lower in a column compared to a fed batch str pamukoglu and kargi 2007 the use of the fed batch str operations in this study overcame the need of drying and immobilization of wdas as well as the limitation of mass transfer due to diffusion by continuous mixing the main challenge of the fed batch str operations is the power requirement for the mixing which could be offset by the pump and piping requirement for the column operations however this would require more detailed assessment which is beyond the scope of this study the adsorption capacity of wdas is among the highest when compared to other bio sorbents used in previous studies table 1 when the adsorption capacity qe of wdas is compared with chemical sorbents and ion exchange resins the adsorption capacity is lower than the polysulfide layered double hydroxide composites and sulphonic acid functionalized amberlite irn 77 resin but comparable or better to the other chemical sorbents and 2 n dimethyl pyridinium groups functionalized varion ap ion exchange resin table 1 however the advantage with wdas is it is a waste by product of the energy generation process anaerobic digestion of a waste generated by municipal wastewater treatment plants and the disposal of which entails cost to the treatment plants in contrast most of the bio sorbents listed in table 1 are produced purely for the purpose of sorption 4 2 molecular aspects of uranium adsorption and desorption processes the change in the ph affects the interaction of uranyl ions with the wdas fig 3b suggesting the role of the protonation deprotonation state of the functional groups of the wdas the qe doubled to 100 2 2 3 mg g 1 when the equilibrium ph changed from 3 2 to 4 0 this doubling is most likely due to the increase in the concentration of the deprotonated functional sites jain et al 2015 the ir and trlfs spectra confirmed the interaction of phosphoryl and carboxyl groups with uranyl ions for its adsorption onto wdas fig 2 and fig s2 in si the interaction of uranyl ions with phosphoryl and carboxyl groups is also reported for s layer proteins and vegetative cells of bacillus sphaericus jg a12 merroun et al 2005 for bacterial lipopolysaccharide barkleit et al 2011 as well as for wholes cells of bacillus subtilis fowle et al 2000 the pka of the carboxyl group and phosphoryl group are reported in the range of 3 9 5 5 and 6 9 7 2 respectively for bacterial lipopolysaccharide barkleit et al 2011 bacillus subtilis fowle et al 2000 and activated sludge jain et al 2015 this suggests that the jump of equilibrium ph from 3 2 to 4 0 would certainly increase the deprotonated sites of the carboxyl groups and thus result in increase in the adsorption of uranium onto wdas the ir measurements suggested that the interaction of uranyl ions initially takes place with phosphoryl and then with carboxyl groups fig 2a and fig s2 in si one of the possible reasons is the probably higher concentration of phosphoryl groups as observed in the activated sludge jain et al 2015 another reason could be the higher affinity of uranium towards forming uranium phosphate aqueous complexes log k 11 8 compared to the formation of uranium carbonate aqueous complexes log k 5 4 fowle et al 2000 li et al 2010 the adsorption of uranium in the fed batch str was increasing with the first three cycles at the different mixing times fig 5a and b this is contrary to the more typical of high adsorption in initial cycles followed by decrease in adsorption capacity due to saturation phillips et al 2008 the observed phenomenon can be due to the decrease in the equilibrium ph in the first three cycles from 7 8 to 6 8 similar phenomenon where the uranium adsorption decreased at ph values greater than 6 0 was also observed for the adsorption of uranium onto macroporous fibrous polymeric adsorbent containing amidoxime chelating functional group zhang et al 2005 this was explained by the formation of uranium vi colloids which are expected to be mobile and hence present in the effluent another possibility is the presence of soluble uranium carbonate complex present at such ph values therefore either recirculation of the effluent of the fed batch str for the first three cycles is warranted or pheq should be kept below 6 0 in the fed batch str desorption of uranium was successfully carried out by two eluents hcl and na2co3 as previously reported to be efficient for uranium desorption akhtar et al 2007 fig 4 both eluents were able to desorb the uranium from the wdas the addition of hcl generates neutral carboxyl and phosphoryl groups releasing the adsorbed uranyl ions into the aqueous phase in contrast na2co3 increased the ph above 11 0 under this condition still more than 95 of uranium was released from wdas due to the formation of the thermodynamically very stable uranyl carbonate complex under the prevailing high carbonate concentrations fowle et al 2000 krestou and panias 2004 4 3 perspectives in this study the qe for the fed batch str for all the combined twelve steps was 11 5 mg g 1 which is 18 times lower than the one observed in the batch experiments as the saturation was not achieved in the fed batch str operation fig 5b for an estimation of number of possible feed steps in the fed batch str a sufficient high qe and low enough residual uranium concentration point was chosen from isotherm fig 3a the qe of 80 7 mg g 1 with residual uranium concentration of 0 7 mg l 1 in the solution u init 16 9 mg l 1 u eq 0 7 mg l 1 volume 10 ml wdas conc 0 2 g l 1 was selected at 3 1 g l 1 wdas concentration in 900 ml fed batch str and assuming qe of 80 7 mg g 1 the total uranium that can be adsorbed is 225 2 mg with addition of 560 ml of u init 5 mg l 1 2 80 mg of uranium would be added in each step assuming 100 adsorption of all the added uranium in each step it would suggests that the efficient uranium removal could be continued for 80 steps of 560 ml u init 5 mg l 1 before u eq 0 7 mg l 1 even when qe is only 80 7 mg g 1 the uranium concentration is 8 1 w w which is considered as a high grade ore iaea 2000 since both the acid as well as alkaline desorption was successful for the wdas the uranium loaded wdas can be added to the leaching step of the primary ore processing infrastructure irrespective whether acid or alkaline is used in the leaching process iaea 2000 furthermore the adsorption of uranium at low ph as well as the increase in the equilibrium ph of the wastewater upon adsorption onto wdas fig 3b would minimize the use of lime to neutralize the wastewaters iaea 2004 combined with the low mixing time of 15 min and adsorption at low ph wdas based uranium recovery process is promising note that the calculation of the number of steps is a rough estimation as the real wastewater may vary in composition e g ph and the presence of other contaminant ions however this study is the first step in the development of wdas based uranium recovery technology the biggest challenge in developing the wdas based uranium recovery system is the selectivity of wdas towards target metals which to our knowledge has never been investigated the wastewaters originating from uranium mines mostly contain fe cd cu zn pb ni th and uranium chen et al 2017 iaea 2004 the ion exchange resins show higher selectivity towards uranium in presence of anions chloride nitrate carbonate chlorate and sulfate gu et al 2005 however when only cationic contaminants calcium magnesium are present then the sorption capacity of ion exchange membrane decreases barton et al 2004 in the presence of both cationic and anionic contaminants the formation of anionic uranium species such as uo2 so4 3 4 might preferentially occur which in turn can be selectively taken up by the anionic ion exchange resin danko et al 2017 gu et al 2005 for the sorbents such as talc and microorganisms uranium is preferentially adsorbed compared to cu cd zn ni and pb choi and park 2005 sprynskyy et al 2011 whereas fe and th are preferentially adsorbed compared to uranium sprynskyy et al 2011 syed 1999 the selectivity of adsorbent towards metals ions can be enhanced by tightly controlling adsorbent adsorbate ratio as well as equilibrium ph as was shown by the preferential adsorption of cu from equi molar mixture of cu zn and cd onto biogenic selenium nanoparticles jain et al 2016 thus the selective adsorption capacity of the wdas should be benchmarked not only against various bio sorbents but also against ion exchange resins the desorption step in the fed batch str by 1 87 m na2co3 led to a release of other heavy metals table s3 present in the wdas on the one hand this would make the disposal of wdas easier as only the adjustment of ph would be required prior to wdas disposal on the other hand a release of other metals in uranium desorption solution albeit at low concentration for heavy metals and comparable concentration for p ca and al will result in a uranium solution undesirably contaminated with other heavy metals in this study the wdas could concentrate the uranium vi by a factor of 6 05 whereas the ion exchange or solvent extractions process can increase the uranium concentration by a factor of 30 however in general adsorption process can deal with low concentrated uranium solutions 5 mg l 1 or even lower that the solvent extraction process cannot handle ion exchange resins can handle lower concentrations but their production entails cost while wdas is almost free of cost or rather cost negative the potential better cost and performance of the wdas based technology may make it possible for it to act as a feeder for the ion exchange or solvent extraction thus complimenting these technologies and making it easily integrate in the existing uranium mining infrastructure thus evaluating the wdas selectivity towards uranium as well as optimizing of the operational parameters for desorption is required for developing uranium recovery process based on wdas 5 conclusions wdas could recover and concentrate the uranium from the synthetic wastewaters by means of adsorption desorption in a fed batch str presence of phosphoryl and carboxyl functional groups on wdas facilitated the high adsorption capacity of wdas towards uranium both acidic and alkaline desorption of uranium from wdas was demonstrated wdas is a promising technology and future work on its selectivity and adsorption capacity of uranium from in real wastewaters should be evaluated acknowledgements this work was supported by the

19468,stability of colloidal particles contributes to the turbidity in the water column which significantly influences water quality and ecological functions in aquatic environments especially shallow lakes here we report characterization origin and aggregation behavior of aquatic colloids including natural colloidal particles ncps and total inorganic colloidal particles ticps in a highly turbid shallow lake via field observations simulation experiments ultrafiltration spectral and microscopic and light scattering techniques the colloidal particles were characterized with various shapes spherical polygonal and elliptical and aluminum silicon and ferric containing mineralogical structures with a size range of 20 200 nm the process of sediment re suspension under environmentally relevant conditions contributed 78 80 of ticps and 54 55 of ncps in lake taihu representing an important source of colloids in the water column both mono and divalent electrolytes enhanced colloidal aggregation while a reverse trend was observed in the presence of natural organic matter nom the influence of nom on colloidal stability was highly related to molecular weight mw properties with the high mw fraction exhibiting higher stability efficiency than the low mw counterparts however the mw dependent aggregation behavior for ncps was less significant than that for ticps implying that previous results on colloidal behavior using model inorganic colloids alone should be reevaluated further studies are needed to better understand the mobility stability and transformation of aquatic colloids and their role in governing the fate and transport of pollutants in natural waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords eutrophic shallow lakes aquatic colloids aggregation behavior natural organic matter molecular size fractionation 1 introduction natural colloids defined as particles with sizes ranging between 1 nm and 1 μm are ubiquitous in aquatic environments buffle and leppard 1995 gibson et al 2007 due to the small sizes these colloidal particles usually have a long residence time and substantially impact transparency and recreational value of waters the properties of high specific surface area and reactivity endow them strong adsorption potential to many trace elements including nutrients and pollutants and as a result influence their chemical speciation behavior and environmental fate gibson et al 2007 moreover the persistence of aquatic colloids can also cause potential toxicity to microorganism shang et al 2017 and impacts on aquatic ecosystems colman et al 2014 owing to the significant influence on the fate and transport of pollutants and on ecosystem balance characterization of aquatic colloids have received increasing attention over the past years environmental colloidal particles in lake waters originate from either allochthonous or autochthonous sources depending on human activity and local meteorological hydrological conditions compared with deep lakes shallow lakes are usually characterized by higher turbidity and colloidal abundance due to high primary production and sediment re suspension xing and kong 2007 zheng et al 2015 the size composition and spatio temporal distribution of lake water colloids had previously been reported but mainly focused on inorganic colloidal particles icps chanudet and filella 2007 2009 filella et al 2009 however icps in natural waters are usually coated with dissolved organic ligands to form organic inorganic colloidal particles schäfer et al 2007 in addition dissolved organic matter in natural waters had been shown to occur mostly in the form of colloids guéguen et al 2006 guo et al 2009 shirokova et al 2013 stolpe et al 2013 therefore the organic inorganic and organic inorganic colloids collectively constitute the abundance of natural colloidal particles ncps in lake waters nevertheless knowledge on the properties and sources of colloidal particles including ncps and icps in lake waters especially the high turbidity shallow lakes is lacking but vital for understanding the roles of colloidal particles in regulating water quality ecosystem function and pollutant transport the environmental behaviors of colloids in natural waters are controlled by their stability aggregation propensities which are highly dependent on environmental conditions many parameters including electrolytes ionic strength ph and natural organic matter nom have been reported to influence the stability of inorganic colloids like kaolinite kretzschmar et al 1998 aurell and wistrom 2000 sequaris 2010 montmorillonite garcia garcia et al 2007 sequaris 2010 borgnino 2013 illite and quartz jiang et al 2012 among them electrolytes and nom including quantity and composition play critical roles in affecting the stability of colloids philippe and schaumann 2014 it was generally found that electrolytes including mono and divalent enhanced colloidal aggregation but presence of nom can significantly inhibit the aggregation potential of colloids nanoparticles chen et al 2006 dong and lo 2013 however the nom induced aggregation inhibition can be highly related to its inherent chemical structure and molecular size for instance bovine serum albumins were found to be more effective than humic and fulvic acids in stabilizing the manganese dioxide colloids due to the difference in molecular sizes of the nom huangfu et al 2013 in fact nom in aquatic environments is a highly heterogeneous mixture with various organic components and a continuous size spectra philippe and schaumann 2014 xu and guo 2017 and different functional groups and molecular weight mw fractions may interact differently with colloidal particles within the bulk nom pool the high mw hmw nom fraction has been shown to play a central role in regulating the concentration and speciation and hence the fate transport and bioavailability of many trace elements in aquatic ecosystems guo et al 2002 alasonati et al 2010 in addition recent studies also highlighted the influence of nom on colloidal stability and found the mws and functionalities of nom an important parameter in controlling aggregation kinetics and stability for nanoparticles including silver yin et al 2015 gold louie et al 2015 fullerene shen et al 2015 and zno kteeba et al 2017 however these studies usually selected one or two synthesized or engineered nanoparticles as the model materials while the ncps are polyfunctional and contain compounds with various compositions and structures in addition it is not clear in the aggregation heterogeneities between the ncps and icps in natural waters leaving a knowledge gap regarding the aggregation behaviors of colloids including ncps and icps in environmentally relevant conditions the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the physicochemical properties of aquatic colloids including ncps and icps in shallow lakes 2 define the origins of these colloidal particles 3 explore the nom and electrolyte related aggregation profiles in ambient conditions and reveal the specific mw fractions in nom matrix that regulate colloidal stability both spectral and microscopic techniques were used to characterize the chemical properties of colloidal particles and a simulation experiment was carried out to quantify the contribution of sediment re suspension processes to the colloid abundance in lake waters in addition ultrafiltration was used to fractionate the bulk nom into lmw and hmw nom fractions whose specific effects on colloidal aggregation under mono and divalent electrolyte conditions were determined via the dynamic light scattering dls technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of aquatic colloids and sediment core samples lake taihu located between 30 55 40 31 32 58 n and 119 52 32 120 36 10 e is one of the largest shallow lakes in china mean water depth 1 9 m with high turbidity and low transparency in the water column qin et al 2007 another feature of lake taihu is that it has two distinctive ecological regions macrophyte and algae dominant regions surface water samples were collected from the two regions fig s1 in the supporting information si with an average wind speed based on 30 min of continuous measurement of 2 4 6 and 8 m s respectively after collection the samples were transported to the lab within 4 h and settled statically the particles with size less than 1 μm sedimentation velocity 0 3 cm h were collected by siphon based on stokes law the supernatants were then ultrafiltered using a stirred cell ultrafiltration unit amicon 8500 and a 1 kda membrane disc millipore plac07610 the retentate with colloidal sizes between 1 nm and 1 μm was carefully collected to represent the ncps an aliquot of the retentate was further treated with 30 hydrogen peroxide to obtain total icps ticps until no residual organic matters can be detected in the retentates dumat et al 1997 it was noted that the ticps herein included pristine inorganic colloids and the inorganic particles that coated with organic matters in natural waters both the ncps and ticps collected finally were freeze dried and stored in the desiccator before analysis in addition to the colloidal samples from the water column sediment core samples were also collected at the same sampling location using a ø110 mm l500 mm gravity corer rigo co ltd japan at least 25 cm of intact sediment cores 2 4 l were sampled fig s2a in the si kept upright and transported to laboratory within 4 h of sampling 2 2 sediment re suspension experiments a y shape sediment generation equipment patent number cn200410014329 x was used to simulate the re suspension process of lake sediment at 2 4 6 and 8 m s respectively fig s2b in the si the system consisted of a series of individual polyethylene tubes with a length of 180 cm and a diameter of 11 cm two electric motor driven propellers were equipped to simulate wind induced waves one was placed 120 cm above the sediment surface to mix the water vertically and the other was placed 15 cm above the sediment surface in the incline tube with an angle of 55 to offer sediment re suspension force the rotation of the two propellers was controlled by different motors with a frequency ranging from 0 to 20 hz to simulate various wind speeds liu et al 2015 before the re suspension experiment the sediment cores were carefully transplanted into lower plexiglass tube of y shape apparatus simulated lake waters containing 0 15 mm k 2 mm na 0 5 mm ca2 0 4 mm mg2 and 1 5 mm hco3 yan et al 2014 were added to each tube to obtain a depth of about 1 9 m the same as the mean depth of lake taihu for each experiment surface water samples were collected after 5 h of re suspension process and the colloidal particles were isolated using the above mentioned ultrafiltration method each re suspension experiment was conducted in duplicate the difference in colloidal abundance between lake waters and simulation experiments can be used to quantify the contribution of sediment re suspension to colloids in the water column 2 3 molecular size fractionation of nom samples fulvic acid fa 99 as a representative of nom was purchased from jonln biological technology co china the ultrafiltration unit was used to fractionate the bulk fa 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filtration into fractions with various molecular sizes the 1 kda membrane discs were firstly cleaned with 0 05 n naoh and 0 02 n hcl followed by thorough flushing with ultrapure water the membranes were also cleaned with ultrapure water between chemicals for ultrafiltration the bulk water samples 300 ml each were transferred to the stirred cell loaded with a pre cleaned 1 kda membrane xu and guo 2017 during ultrafiltration samples were under continuous stirring and a n2 pressure maintaining at 345 kpa 50 psi the initial bulk and permeate solutions were saved for the measurement of dissolved organic carbon doc and other chemical properties to calculate the size or mw distributions between the 1 kda and 1 kda fractions stock solutions of 0 05 m cacl2 and 5 m nacl were prepared by dissolving analytical grade cacl2 and nacl in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter in addition the ncps and ticps collected from algae and macrophyte dominant lake waters were re suspended in the ultrapure water to obtain colloidal suspensions at a mass concentration of 10 mg l 2 4 hydrodynamic diameters and electrophoretic mobility measurements of hydrodynamic diameters and electrophoretic mobility were conducted at room temperature and neutral ph using a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern uk a monochromatic coherent he ne laser with a fixed wavelength of 633 nm was used as a light source and the intensity of scattered light was measured by a detector at 173 each auto correlation function was accumulated for 6 s and a total of 10 auto correlations were obtained for each measurement for colloidal aggregation in the absence of nom the mono and divalent electrolytes with different concentrations na 0 1 m ca2 0 4 mm were added into the colloidal solutions 10 mg l the suspensions ph 7 0 0 1 were briefly mixed vortex genie 2 fisher scientific for no more than 3 s then one ml of the suspension was introduced into a disposable polystyrene cuvette sarstedt germany to track the time dependent changes in hydrodynamic diameters for aggregation dynamics in the presence of nom a specific concentration e g 2 mg c l of bulk and size fractionated fa sample was added to the colloidal suspension along with the addition of the electrolytes with a measurement procedure similar to that in the absence of fa samples as for the electrophoretic mobility analysis each sample was measured at least 3 times and data were presented as mean standard deviation 2 5 aggregation kinetics time resolved dls was used to obtain the aggregation profiles of colloidal particles in the absence or presence of bulk and size fractionated nom by measuring the variations in hydrodynamic diameters over time t the aggregation rate constant k is determined from the relative rate of z average hydrodynamic diameter changes with time chen et al 2006 chen and elimelech 2006 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n 0 is the initial particle concentration and d h t is the hydrodynamic diameter of colloidal particles at time t the initial rate of increase in d h t is obtained by determining the slope in the linear regime during the initial 20 min since colloidal aggregation was highly dependent on the interaction energy two aggregation regimes that is reaction and diffusion limited aggregation can be identified diffusion limited aggregation usually occurs when there is a low or negative energy barrier under which the repulsive force is negligible and thus the aggregation rate is dependent solely on the time for clusters to encounter each other by diffusion the reaction limited aggregation on the other hand occurs when there is a substantial but not insurmountable energy barrier under which repulsive and attraction force were highly dependent upon the solution chemistry e g ionic strength electrolyte valence based on different aggregation regimes the particle attachment efficiency a can be obtained to quantitatively compare the aggregation potential of colloidal particles under various conditions it is defined as normalizing the measured k by those under diffusion limited condition where the aggregation behavior is independent of the electrolyte concentration as the concentrations of colloids in all aggregation experiments are the same the value of a in the absence of nom is calculated by the initial slope of the aggregation profile at a given electrolyte concentration normalized by k fast under the diffusion limited condition whereas the a value in the presence of nom was calculated by normalizing the early stage aggregation rate constants by k fast determined for the respective samples in the absence of nom chen and elimelech 2007 baalousha et al 2013 2 a k k f a s t d d h t d t t 0 d d h t d t t 0 f a s t where the k fast is the aggregation rate constant of colloidal particles under the diffusion limited condition 2 6 sorption of bulk and mw fractionated nom onto aquatic colloidal particles batch sorption experiments were performed in duplicate to estimate the sorption capacity of bulk and mw fractionated fa by ncps and ticps detailed procedures of the sorption experiment have been described elsewhere xu and jiang 2015 and given in the si 2 7 other chemical analyses doc concentrations in the bulk and mw fractionated fa samples were measured by a toc vcph analyzer toc 400 shimadzu uv absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu over a wavelength range of 200 800 nm with 1 nm increments fluorescence eem spectra were measured using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer varian usa the spectra were gathered with subsequent scanning emission spectra from 250 to 550 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 200 to 450 nm at 10 nm increments the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 1200 nm min using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm observations on hr tem were conducted using a jem 2100 field emission gun tem joel japan the hr tem selected area electron diffraction and energy dispersive x ray edx analyses were conducted using a 200 kev electron beam to characterize the sample appearance and structure powder xrd patterns were collected on a x ray diffractometer siemens d5000 with cu ka radiation 40 kv and 30 ma with a step size of 0 02 in addition the independent sample t test model was performed to examine the significance of differences between different sample sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aquatic colloids fig 1 shows typical tem micrographs and edx spectra for the colloids collected from different ecological regions of the lake no significant difference in shapes was observed for ncps between the two regions they both contained a mixture of spherical polygonal and elliptical shaped colloids with an uneven size distribution ranging from 20 nm to 200 nm in addition some organic coated boundary can be found on the surface of ncps which would be attributed to the chemical and or physical sorption of macromolecules buffle and leppard 1995 schäfer et al 2007 the conformation of ticps however showed an origin dependent feature specifically ticps from the macrophyte dominant region were mostly polygonal while those from algae dominant lake waters were mainly spherical compared with the wider size range of ncps the individual ticps from the two sampling regions contained mainly colloids with sizes between 20 and 40 nm fig 1 showing a more uniform size distribution for the ticps the electron diffraction patterns demonstrated obvious crystalline properties and chemical composition obtained from edx analysis indicated that these ticps contained similar major elements such as si fe al k and mg table s1 in the si detailed analysis however showed that the ticps from algae dominant region exhibited higher mineral al and si contents than that from macrophyte dominant region which may be responsible for their different conformations results from xrd analysis further identified that the main mineral structure for the ticps included quartz sio2 montmorillonite na0 3 al mg 2si4o10 oh 2 8h2o nontronite na0 3fe2si4o10 oh 2 4h2o and volkonskoite ca0 3 cr mg 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 4h2o fig s3 in the si these results indicated that al si and fe containing nanoparticles are the main mineralogical composition for the ticps in lake waters 3 2 sources of colloidal particles in lake waters fig 2 compares the wind induced concentrations of colloidal particles between natural waters and simulated experiments the concentrations of ticps in lake waters ranged from 6 3 0 3 to 20 7 2 2 mg l and from 2 8 0 2 to 11 4 0 5 mg l for the algae and macrophyte dominant regions respectively which were significantly higher than those detected in some deep lake waters filella et al 2009 the concentrations of ncps were about two times higher than those of ticps in our samples indicating the presence and importance of colloidal organic matter in the water column which is consistent with previous observations for other freshwater systems zou et al 2006 stolpe et al 2013 cai et al 2015 in addition adsorption of macromolecules on inorganic colloid surfaces as well as the excretion of colloid like organic substances from algae and macrophytes could also contribute to the high abundance of ncps in natural waters xu et al 2013 xu and jiang 2015 further analysis showed that concentrations of colloidal particles in both lake waters and simulated resuspension experiments increased with increasing wind speeds fig 2a demonstrating the important role of sediment re suspension in the formation of colloids in shallow lake waters in the algae dominant region as the wind speed increased from 2 to 8 m s the concentrations of ncps and ticps in simulated experiments increased from 12 5 0 9 and 4 9 0 3 mg l to 30 2 2 1 and 16 0 1 1 mg l respectively however under the same wind speed conditions the ncps and ticps collected from lake waters varied from 23 1 1 9 and 6 3 0 3 mg l to 58 4 4 2 and 20 7 2 2 mg l respectively the differences in colloidal abundance between lake waters and simulated experiments demonstrated that 53 9 1 8 of ncps and 78 3 1 1 of ticps in lake waters could be derived from the sediment re suspension during windy conditions the effect of sediment re suspension to the aquatic colloid abundance in macrophyte dominant region fig 2b showed similar results that the contribution of sediment re suspension to natural colloid abundance was 55 0 3 5 for ncps and 80 1 2 6 for ticps the lower percentage contribution of sediment re suspension for ncps can be attributed to the presence of colloid like organic substances in the water column and or the adsorption of macromolecules on inorganic colloid surfaces 3 3 aggregation of aquatic colloids in electrolyte solutions without nom time resolved aggregation profiles of aquatic colloids including ncps and ticps isolated from lake waters as a function of electrolyte concentrations are presented in fig s4 in the si based on aggregation kinetics the electrolyte dependent attachment efficiencies can be obtained as shown in fig 3 the aggregation behavior of ncps and ticps in both na and ca2 solutions exhibited clearly a dlvo type aggregation profile suggesting that electrostatic interactions played an important role in stabilizing the aquatic colloids yin et al 2015 this cation induced aggregation behavior has also been reported for other bare and surface modified inorganic colloidal particles liu et al 2011 dong and lo 2013 in this study the attachment efficiency exhibited an initial electrolyte dependent enhancement followed by a non sensitive stage with increasing electrolyte concentrations the minimum electrolyte concentration required for the occurrence of this non sensitivity was defined as critical coagulation concentration ccc chen et al 2006 it was shown that the ccc values were highly dependent on the valence of electrolytes taken the ticps as an example the cccs in na treatment were 18 2 and 28 2 mm for ticps from the macrophyte and algae dominant regions respectively while those in ca2 treatment decreased to 0 55 0 05 and 0 50 0 05 mm respectively the much lower ccc value of ca2 was ascribed to the high charge density and strong neutralization abilities of divalent electrolytes stankus et al 2011 since the ccc values of nacl observed in this study were in the range of 18 28 mm for ticps those of cacl2 calculated based on the schulze hardy rule verwey et al 1999 were thus within 0 28 and 0 44 mm which were in the same range as the experimental data fig 3 in addition to electrolyte valences types of colloidal particles also played an important role in determining the ccc values for example the ncps exhibited higher ccc values than ticps both for the macrophyte and algae dominant lake waters specifically the ccc values of na and ca2 were 18 28 and 0 50 0 55 mm for ticps respectively which were obviously lower than those for the ncps 33 150 mm in na and 0 75 1 60 mm in ca2 based on these cccs it is clear that ncps were more stable or less sensitive to the effect of cations than ticps in both mono and divalent electrolyte solutions the zeta potentials of ticps in algae and macrophyte dominant lake waters were 42 0 0 3 and 38 5 1 6 mv respectively while those of ncps were in the range from 60 3 1 8 to 60 9 2 3 mv lower zeta potentials and steric repulsion originated from the surface coating suggest that more electrolyte cations are needed to screen the negative charge for colloidal aggregation which accounts for the higher ccc values of na and ca2 for ncps 3 4 aggregation kinetics of colloids in electrolyte solution with bulk and mw fractionated nom 3 4 1 characterization of bulk and mw fractionated nom information on mw distribution of fa was obtained via the application of ultrafiltration comparisons in doc concentrations between the bulk and ultrafiltered samples showed that the fa tested was composed of 40 in mass of the 1 kda lmw and 60 of the hmw fa 1 kda 0 45 μm the percentage of the lmw fraction was similar to those observed in natural river nom samples using the same membrane disc and mwco xu and guo 2017 but much lower than that of the western siberia lakes shirokova et al 2013 spectroscopic data for comparing the inherent chemical properties between the bulk and mw fractionated fa samples are shown in fig 4 the absorbance intensities of the 1 kda hmw fa were generally higher than those of bulk and lmw fa at all wavelengths fig 4a this demonstrated that the aromatic components and hydrophobic structures were partitioned mainly in the hmw fraction similar with other previous studies shen et al 2015 yin et al 2015 the fluorescent eem spectra in the bulk fa sample detected four major peaks with ex em maxima at 275 320 340 230 320 340 275 380 400 and 230 380 400 nm representing peaks a b c d respectively fig 4b manifesting the abundance of carboxylic like functional groups yan et al 2013 xu et al 2016a among these peaks peaks a and b with low aromaticity were substaintially located in the lmw fraction fig 4c while the hmw fraction with high aromaticity and hydrophobicity contained mainly peaks c and d fig 4d showing a mw dependent feature in abundance and chemical composition in the bulk fa similar distribution patterns were also found in other natural waters xu and guo 2017 3 4 2 nom molecular size dependent aggregation behavior of ticps based on the time resolved aggregation profiles fig s5 s8 in the si the variations in attachment efficiencies of ticps as a function of different electrolyte concentrations in the presence of bulk and mw fractioned fas can be obtained fig 5 overall the addition of fa matrix resulted in the increase in ccc values in both mono and divalent electrolytes showing a fa induced enhancement in colloidal stability dong and lo 2013 specifically due to the addition of fa matrix the cccs of na shifted from 18 2 28 2 mm to 150 5 170 10 mm and those of ca2 increased from 0 50 0 05 0 55 0 05 mm to 3 30 0 05 4 20 0 05 mm the ccc values in the presence of bulk fa observed herein were comparable with previous studies showing a ccc of 170 mm for na and 2 5 mm for ca2 for the aggregation of al2o3 colloids in the presence of microbially derived extracellular polymeric substance eps xu et al 2016b the increase in ccc values indicated that colloidal particles were prone to be more stable even with a low doc concentration e g 2 mg c l however in some shallow lakes especially the eutrophic shallow lakes doc concentrations can reach up to about 20 mg c l xu and jiang 2013 which were significantly higher than those applied in the simulation study due to the negative charge imparted by organic matters colloids in such high doc environments are expected to be relatively stable this mechanism could result in the persistence of high water turbidity in some eutrophic shallow lakes such as lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi in china xing and kong 2007 zhang et al 2014 in addition to bulk fa variations in attachment efficiencies of ticps were also related to the inherent mw properties for example cccs values with the addition of lmw fa were 2 7 3 4 times higher for na and 2 2 3 0 times higher for ca2 respectively compared to those without fa in contrast the cccs in the presence of hmw fa were 7 9 15 6 times higher for na and 12 2 12 4 times higher for ca2 respectively these results clearly demonstrated that the hmw fa enhanced colloidal stability much more efficiently than the lmw fa similar with the aggregation profiles of ticps the nom induced stability enhancement has been reported for some model inorganic colloids or nanoparticles such as nano zero valent iron titanium dioxide nickel oxide zinc oxide silica colloidal particles zhang et al 2009 dong and lo 2013 kteeba et al 2017 however the relationship between specific nom mw ranges and colloidal stability enhancement has not been well quantified our findings here on mw dependent aggregation heterogeneity in different electrolytes implied that previous observations of nom enhanced colloidal stability should mainly resulted from the hmw fraction of nom matrix to probe into mechanisms responsible for the stability enhancement zeta potentials of ticps in the presence of different electrolytes altered by the bulk and mw fractionated fa were compared fig s9 in the si as depicted the zeta potential of ticps was generally more negative in the presence of fa even with the presence of divalent electrolytes in addition the zeta potential of ticps in the presence of hmw fa became even more negative compared to those in the presence of bulk or lmw fa except for the condition of high na concentrations fig s9 in the si the more negative surface charge indicated strong electrostatic repulsion which accounts for the higher colloidal stability in the presence of hmw fa in addition owing to the plenty of aromatic substances and hydrophobicity the hmw fa would be expected to have preferable adsorption on ticps through hydrophobic and π π interactions yin et al 2015 our adsorption experiments also showed that hmw fa exhibited higher adsorption intensities than the bulk and lmw fa table s2 in the si high adsorptive ability of hmw fa indicated the efficient formation of organic layers on the surface of ticps thus enhancing the zeta potential and colloidal stability via steric repulsion shen et al 2015 therefore both the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance can account for the mw dependent enhancement of colloidal stability for ticps in lake waters 3 4 3 aggregation kinetics of ncps affected by bulk and mw fractionated nom fig 6 shows the mw dependent aggregation behavior of ncps in the presence of different electrolytes with the detailed time resolved aggregation profiles shown in figs s5 s8 in the si compared with the electrolyte induced aggregation profiles in the absence of fa addition of bulk fa resulted in higher ccc values 1 2 1 3 times higher for na and 1 3 1 4 times higher for ca2 as for the mw fractionated fa the lmw fa increased the ccc values at 1 2 1 4 times higher for na and 1 1 1 5 times higher for ca2 respectively and the addition of hmw fa also caused a slight increase in ccc values at 1 4 1 5 times higher for na and 1 3 1 5 times higher for ca2 respectively these results demonstrated that the increase extents of cccs for ncps were much less significant compared to those for ticps both in mono and divalent electrolytes due to the difference in colloidal composition yin et al 2015 also showed that nom enhanced the stability of bare silver nanoparticles but exhibited minor influence for the citrate coated nanoparticles 20 nm however another study reported that addition of nom elevated the stability of both citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles 60 nm in solutions containing na or low concentrations of ca2 but inhibited the stability at high ca2 concentrations huynh and chen 2011 this indicated that the influences of nom on the aggregation profiles of surface coated colloidal particles also depended on other factors such as colloid properties coating agents and specific electrolytes our results were consistent with those of yin et al 2015 to reveal the mechanism for the insensitivity of aggregation kinetics in response to fa addition the surface charges and fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of ncps under various conditions were measured the zeta potential and ftir spectra of ncps in both mono and divalent electrolytes was not significantly influenced by the bulk and mw fractionated fa figs s10 and s11 in the si demonstrating weak interactions between fa and the coated organic layers on ncp surfaces the adsorption experiments also showed that the adsorption capacities of bulk and mw fractionated fa on ncps surfaces were generally lower p 0 05 than those on ticps table s2 in the si therefore the presence of organic layers inhibited the further adsorption or coating of the bulk and mw fractionated fa on the surfaces of ncps which were responsible for the slight mw dependent enhancement of ccc values 3 5 significance and implications due to the high surface activity and potential influence on the toxicity and bio availability of many contaminants aquatic colloids have received increasing attention in recent years lead and wilkinson 2006 chanudet and filella 2009 filella et al 2009 louie et al 2016 however many previous studies focused mainly on the spatio temporal distribution and abundance analysis lacking the information on sources of the colloidal particles pokrovsky et al 2016 in this study a sediment generation apparatus was applied to quantify the contribution of sediment re suspension to the colloid abundance in natural waters it was found that under environmentally relevant conditions the process of sediment re suspension contributed up to 78 80 of ticps and 54 55 of ncps in the water column of eutrophic shallow lakes to our knowledge this is the first study elucidating the sources and production of natural colloids as a ubiquitous entity nom can regulate the stability of colloids via electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance furman et al 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 although previous studies on the nom effects on colloidal stability were mainly based on model inorganic colloids a consistent nom induced stability enhancement has been observed in both mono and divalent electrolytes similar to those observed for ticps here however we found that the nom induced aggregation heterogeneities of the ncps were less significant than those of the ticps as known engineered nanoparticles are likely to be coated with organic macromolecules either intentionally added by manufacturers for desired properties or incidentally obtained during their life cycle louie et al 2013 moreover the large specific surface area endowed inorganic colloids a high capacity for nom adsorption or coating table s2 in the si forming the predominant ncps species in aquatic environments thus due to the noticeable heterogeneities in aggregation profiles between the ncps and ticps previous results on colloidal behavior analysis using model inorganic colloids are likely to deviate from those of aquatic colloids and may need a critical reevaluation furthermore since the bulk nom is highly heterogeneous in molecular size and composition different molecular size fractions of nom are expected to play distinct roles in determining the aggregation behavior compared with previous studies aiming at the effects of bulk nom zhang et al 2009 dong and lo 2013 we found evident mw dependent aggregation heterogeneity in both mono and divalent electrolytes with the 1 kda hmw fa having higher stability efficiency followed by bulk fa and then the 1 kda lmw fa this is consistent with the distribution of aromatic and hydrophobic organic components among the lmw hmw and bulk nom pools cai et al 2015 the results highlighted the heterogeneity of nom in regulating colloidal stability among different mw fractions within nom matrix overall our results revealed that even a low concentration of organic ligands 2 mg c l can significantly enhance the colloidal stability and divalent cations enhanced colloidal stability more efficiently than monovalent cations as reported fresh waters usually contain a ca2 concentration less than 1 0 mm and na less than 2 5 mm xu et al 2016b this indicated that the colloidal particles including ncps and ticps in most freshwater systems were usually characterized as obvious reaction limited aggregation regime this also accounted for the persistence of high water turbidity in many aquatic ecosystems the mechanisms for colloidal aggregation in natural waters included electrostatic neutralization and or interparticle bridging huangfu et al 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 our previous studies reported that in the presence of cyanobacterial eps electrostatic neutralization contributed to the aggregation of model inorganic colloids at low ca2 concentration while cation bridging became the main mechanism for the enhanced aggregation in ca2 concentrations higher than the ccc xu et al 2016b yin et al 2015 also found that although hmw nom was the key component in stabilizing the citrate coated silver colloids at low ca2 concentrations it could play a reversed role in promoting the colloidal aggregation at high concentrations of divalent cations however the phenomenon of the interparticle bridging was not observed in this study both for the ncps and ticps the reason for the absence of bridging mechanism was still unclear but may be related to factors such as ph nom composition molecular size and colloidal structure which needs further studies 4 conclusion aquatic colloids including ncps and ticps in eutrophic shallow lake waters were characterized with high abundance broad size distribution and fe al si containing mineralogical properties sediment re suspension can have a significant contribution to colloidal particles at 54 55 of the ncps and 78 80 of the ticps in lake waters the colloidal particles exhibited obvious dlvo like aggregation profiles in mono and divalent electrolytes but presence of fa significantly inhibited the aggregation and enhanced the colloidal stability in the water column different mw fractions within fa matrix showed different effects on colloidal stability against aggregation with hmw fraction exhibiting higher stability efficiency than the lmw counterpart however the mw dependent aggregation heterogeneities for ncps were less significant than those for ticps therefore in addition to bulk nom influence of dom with different size fractions within nom matrix should also be considered when interpreting effects of nom on colloidal behavior in addition differences in the nom mw dependent aggregation behavior between ncps and ticps indicated that previous results on colloidal behavior analysis using model inorganic colloids should be reevaluated

19468,stability of colloidal particles contributes to the turbidity in the water column which significantly influences water quality and ecological functions in aquatic environments especially shallow lakes here we report characterization origin and aggregation behavior of aquatic colloids including natural colloidal particles ncps and total inorganic colloidal particles ticps in a highly turbid shallow lake via field observations simulation experiments ultrafiltration spectral and microscopic and light scattering techniques the colloidal particles were characterized with various shapes spherical polygonal and elliptical and aluminum silicon and ferric containing mineralogical structures with a size range of 20 200 nm the process of sediment re suspension under environmentally relevant conditions contributed 78 80 of ticps and 54 55 of ncps in lake taihu representing an important source of colloids in the water column both mono and divalent electrolytes enhanced colloidal aggregation while a reverse trend was observed in the presence of natural organic matter nom the influence of nom on colloidal stability was highly related to molecular weight mw properties with the high mw fraction exhibiting higher stability efficiency than the low mw counterparts however the mw dependent aggregation behavior for ncps was less significant than that for ticps implying that previous results on colloidal behavior using model inorganic colloids alone should be reevaluated further studies are needed to better understand the mobility stability and transformation of aquatic colloids and their role in governing the fate and transport of pollutants in natural waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords eutrophic shallow lakes aquatic colloids aggregation behavior natural organic matter molecular size fractionation 1 introduction natural colloids defined as particles with sizes ranging between 1 nm and 1 μm are ubiquitous in aquatic environments buffle and leppard 1995 gibson et al 2007 due to the small sizes these colloidal particles usually have a long residence time and substantially impact transparency and recreational value of waters the properties of high specific surface area and reactivity endow them strong adsorption potential to many trace elements including nutrients and pollutants and as a result influence their chemical speciation behavior and environmental fate gibson et al 2007 moreover the persistence of aquatic colloids can also cause potential toxicity to microorganism shang et al 2017 and impacts on aquatic ecosystems colman et al 2014 owing to the significant influence on the fate and transport of pollutants and on ecosystem balance characterization of aquatic colloids have received increasing attention over the past years environmental colloidal particles in lake waters originate from either allochthonous or autochthonous sources depending on human activity and local meteorological hydrological conditions compared with deep lakes shallow lakes are usually characterized by higher turbidity and colloidal abundance due to high primary production and sediment re suspension xing and kong 2007 zheng et al 2015 the size composition and spatio temporal distribution of lake water colloids had previously been reported but mainly focused on inorganic colloidal particles icps chanudet and filella 2007 2009 filella et al 2009 however icps in natural waters are usually coated with dissolved organic ligands to form organic inorganic colloidal particles schäfer et al 2007 in addition dissolved organic matter in natural waters had been shown to occur mostly in the form of colloids guéguen et al 2006 guo et al 2009 shirokova et al 2013 stolpe et al 2013 therefore the organic inorganic and organic inorganic colloids collectively constitute the abundance of natural colloidal particles ncps in lake waters nevertheless knowledge on the properties and sources of colloidal particles including ncps and icps in lake waters especially the high turbidity shallow lakes is lacking but vital for understanding the roles of colloidal particles in regulating water quality ecosystem function and pollutant transport the environmental behaviors of colloids in natural waters are controlled by their stability aggregation propensities which are highly dependent on environmental conditions many parameters including electrolytes ionic strength ph and natural organic matter nom have been reported to influence the stability of inorganic colloids like kaolinite kretzschmar et al 1998 aurell and wistrom 2000 sequaris 2010 montmorillonite garcia garcia et al 2007 sequaris 2010 borgnino 2013 illite and quartz jiang et al 2012 among them electrolytes and nom including quantity and composition play critical roles in affecting the stability of colloids philippe and schaumann 2014 it was generally found that electrolytes including mono and divalent enhanced colloidal aggregation but presence of nom can significantly inhibit the aggregation potential of colloids nanoparticles chen et al 2006 dong and lo 2013 however the nom induced aggregation inhibition can be highly related to its inherent chemical structure and molecular size for instance bovine serum albumins were found to be more effective than humic and fulvic acids in stabilizing the manganese dioxide colloids due to the difference in molecular sizes of the nom huangfu et al 2013 in fact nom in aquatic environments is a highly heterogeneous mixture with various organic components and a continuous size spectra philippe and schaumann 2014 xu and guo 2017 and different functional groups and molecular weight mw fractions may interact differently with colloidal particles within the bulk nom pool the high mw hmw nom fraction has been shown to play a central role in regulating the concentration and speciation and hence the fate transport and bioavailability of many trace elements in aquatic ecosystems guo et al 2002 alasonati et al 2010 in addition recent studies also highlighted the influence of nom on colloidal stability and found the mws and functionalities of nom an important parameter in controlling aggregation kinetics and stability for nanoparticles including silver yin et al 2015 gold louie et al 2015 fullerene shen et al 2015 and zno kteeba et al 2017 however these studies usually selected one or two synthesized or engineered nanoparticles as the model materials while the ncps are polyfunctional and contain compounds with various compositions and structures in addition it is not clear in the aggregation heterogeneities between the ncps and icps in natural waters leaving a knowledge gap regarding the aggregation behaviors of colloids including ncps and icps in environmentally relevant conditions the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the physicochemical properties of aquatic colloids including ncps and icps in shallow lakes 2 define the origins of these colloidal particles 3 explore the nom and electrolyte related aggregation profiles in ambient conditions and reveal the specific mw fractions in nom matrix that regulate colloidal stability both spectral and microscopic techniques were used to characterize the chemical properties of colloidal particles and a simulation experiment was carried out to quantify the contribution of sediment re suspension processes to the colloid abundance in lake waters in addition ultrafiltration was used to fractionate the bulk nom into lmw and hmw nom fractions whose specific effects on colloidal aggregation under mono and divalent electrolyte conditions were determined via the dynamic light scattering dls technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of aquatic colloids and sediment core samples lake taihu located between 30 55 40 31 32 58 n and 119 52 32 120 36 10 e is one of the largest shallow lakes in china mean water depth 1 9 m with high turbidity and low transparency in the water column qin et al 2007 another feature of lake taihu is that it has two distinctive ecological regions macrophyte and algae dominant regions surface water samples were collected from the two regions fig s1 in the supporting information si with an average wind speed based on 30 min of continuous measurement of 2 4 6 and 8 m s respectively after collection the samples were transported to the lab within 4 h and settled statically the particles with size less than 1 μm sedimentation velocity 0 3 cm h were collected by siphon based on stokes law the supernatants were then ultrafiltered using a stirred cell ultrafiltration unit amicon 8500 and a 1 kda membrane disc millipore plac07610 the retentate with colloidal sizes between 1 nm and 1 μm was carefully collected to represent the ncps an aliquot of the retentate was further treated with 30 hydrogen peroxide to obtain total icps ticps until no residual organic matters can be detected in the retentates dumat et al 1997 it was noted that the ticps herein included pristine inorganic colloids and the inorganic particles that coated with organic matters in natural waters both the ncps and ticps collected finally were freeze dried and stored in the desiccator before analysis in addition to the colloidal samples from the water column sediment core samples were also collected at the same sampling location using a ø110 mm l500 mm gravity corer rigo co ltd japan at least 25 cm of intact sediment cores 2 4 l were sampled fig s2a in the si kept upright and transported to laboratory within 4 h of sampling 2 2 sediment re suspension experiments a y shape sediment generation equipment patent number cn200410014329 x was used to simulate the re suspension process of lake sediment at 2 4 6 and 8 m s respectively fig s2b in the si the system consisted of a series of individual polyethylene tubes with a length of 180 cm and a diameter of 11 cm two electric motor driven propellers were equipped to simulate wind induced waves one was placed 120 cm above the sediment surface to mix the water vertically and the other was placed 15 cm above the sediment surface in the incline tube with an angle of 55 to offer sediment re suspension force the rotation of the two propellers was controlled by different motors with a frequency ranging from 0 to 20 hz to simulate various wind speeds liu et al 2015 before the re suspension experiment the sediment cores were carefully transplanted into lower plexiglass tube of y shape apparatus simulated lake waters containing 0 15 mm k 2 mm na 0 5 mm ca2 0 4 mm mg2 and 1 5 mm hco3 yan et al 2014 were added to each tube to obtain a depth of about 1 9 m the same as the mean depth of lake taihu for each experiment surface water samples were collected after 5 h of re suspension process and the colloidal particles were isolated using the above mentioned ultrafiltration method each re suspension experiment was conducted in duplicate the difference in colloidal abundance between lake waters and simulation experiments can be used to quantify the contribution of sediment re suspension to colloids in the water column 2 3 molecular size fractionation of nom samples fulvic acid fa 99 as a representative of nom was purchased from jonln biological technology co china the ultrafiltration unit was used to fractionate the bulk fa 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filtration into fractions with various molecular sizes the 1 kda membrane discs were firstly cleaned with 0 05 n naoh and 0 02 n hcl followed by thorough flushing with ultrapure water the membranes were also cleaned with ultrapure water between chemicals for ultrafiltration the bulk water samples 300 ml each were transferred to the stirred cell loaded with a pre cleaned 1 kda membrane xu and guo 2017 during ultrafiltration samples were under continuous stirring and a n2 pressure maintaining at 345 kpa 50 psi the initial bulk and permeate solutions were saved for the measurement of dissolved organic carbon doc and other chemical properties to calculate the size or mw distributions between the 1 kda and 1 kda fractions stock solutions of 0 05 m cacl2 and 5 m nacl were prepared by dissolving analytical grade cacl2 and nacl in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter in addition the ncps and ticps collected from algae and macrophyte dominant lake waters were re suspended in the ultrapure water to obtain colloidal suspensions at a mass concentration of 10 mg l 2 4 hydrodynamic diameters and electrophoretic mobility measurements of hydrodynamic diameters and electrophoretic mobility were conducted at room temperature and neutral ph using a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern uk a monochromatic coherent he ne laser with a fixed wavelength of 633 nm was used as a light source and the intensity of scattered light was measured by a detector at 173 each auto correlation function was accumulated for 6 s and a total of 10 auto correlations were obtained for each measurement for colloidal aggregation in the absence of nom the mono and divalent electrolytes with different concentrations na 0 1 m ca2 0 4 mm were added into the colloidal solutions 10 mg l the suspensions ph 7 0 0 1 were briefly mixed vortex genie 2 fisher scientific for no more than 3 s then one ml of the suspension was introduced into a disposable polystyrene cuvette sarstedt germany to track the time dependent changes in hydrodynamic diameters for aggregation dynamics in the presence of nom a specific concentration e g 2 mg c l of bulk and size fractionated fa sample was added to the colloidal suspension along with the addition of the electrolytes with a measurement procedure similar to that in the absence of fa samples as for the electrophoretic mobility analysis each sample was measured at least 3 times and data were presented as mean standard deviation 2 5 aggregation kinetics time resolved dls was used to obtain the aggregation profiles of colloidal particles in the absence or presence of bulk and size fractionated nom by measuring the variations in hydrodynamic diameters over time t the aggregation rate constant k is determined from the relative rate of z average hydrodynamic diameter changes with time chen et al 2006 chen and elimelech 2006 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n 0 is the initial particle concentration and d h t is the hydrodynamic diameter of colloidal particles at time t the initial rate of increase in d h t is obtained by determining the slope in the linear regime during the initial 20 min since colloidal aggregation was highly dependent on the interaction energy two aggregation regimes that is reaction and diffusion limited aggregation can be identified diffusion limited aggregation usually occurs when there is a low or negative energy barrier under which the repulsive force is negligible and thus the aggregation rate is dependent solely on the time for clusters to encounter each other by diffusion the reaction limited aggregation on the other hand occurs when there is a substantial but not insurmountable energy barrier under which repulsive and attraction force were highly dependent upon the solution chemistry e g ionic strength electrolyte valence based on different aggregation regimes the particle attachment efficiency a can be obtained to quantitatively compare the aggregation potential of colloidal particles under various conditions it is defined as normalizing the measured k by those under diffusion limited condition where the aggregation behavior is independent of the electrolyte concentration as the concentrations of colloids in all aggregation experiments are the same the value of a in the absence of nom is calculated by the initial slope of the aggregation profile at a given electrolyte concentration normalized by k fast under the diffusion limited condition whereas the a value in the presence of nom was calculated by normalizing the early stage aggregation rate constants by k fast determined for the respective samples in the absence of nom chen and elimelech 2007 baalousha et al 2013 2 a k k f a s t d d h t d t t 0 d d h t d t t 0 f a s t where the k fast is the aggregation rate constant of colloidal particles under the diffusion limited condition 2 6 sorption of bulk and mw fractionated nom onto aquatic colloidal particles batch sorption experiments were performed in duplicate to estimate the sorption capacity of bulk and mw fractionated fa by ncps and ticps detailed procedures of the sorption experiment have been described elsewhere xu and jiang 2015 and given in the si 2 7 other chemical analyses doc concentrations in the bulk and mw fractionated fa samples were measured by a toc vcph analyzer toc 400 shimadzu uv absorption spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu over a wavelength range of 200 800 nm with 1 nm increments fluorescence eem spectra were measured using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer varian usa the spectra were gathered with subsequent scanning emission spectra from 250 to 550 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 200 to 450 nm at 10 nm increments the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 1200 nm min using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm observations on hr tem were conducted using a jem 2100 field emission gun tem joel japan the hr tem selected area electron diffraction and energy dispersive x ray edx analyses were conducted using a 200 kev electron beam to characterize the sample appearance and structure powder xrd patterns were collected on a x ray diffractometer siemens d5000 with cu ka radiation 40 kv and 30 ma with a step size of 0 02 in addition the independent sample t test model was performed to examine the significance of differences between different sample sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aquatic colloids fig 1 shows typical tem micrographs and edx spectra for the colloids collected from different ecological regions of the lake no significant difference in shapes was observed for ncps between the two regions they both contained a mixture of spherical polygonal and elliptical shaped colloids with an uneven size distribution ranging from 20 nm to 200 nm in addition some organic coated boundary can be found on the surface of ncps which would be attributed to the chemical and or physical sorption of macromolecules buffle and leppard 1995 schäfer et al 2007 the conformation of ticps however showed an origin dependent feature specifically ticps from the macrophyte dominant region were mostly polygonal while those from algae dominant lake waters were mainly spherical compared with the wider size range of ncps the individual ticps from the two sampling regions contained mainly colloids with sizes between 20 and 40 nm fig 1 showing a more uniform size distribution for the ticps the electron diffraction patterns demonstrated obvious crystalline properties and chemical composition obtained from edx analysis indicated that these ticps contained similar major elements such as si fe al k and mg table s1 in the si detailed analysis however showed that the ticps from algae dominant region exhibited higher mineral al and si contents than that from macrophyte dominant region which may be responsible for their different conformations results from xrd analysis further identified that the main mineral structure for the ticps included quartz sio2 montmorillonite na0 3 al mg 2si4o10 oh 2 8h2o nontronite na0 3fe2si4o10 oh 2 4h2o and volkonskoite ca0 3 cr mg 2 si al 4o10 oh 2 4h2o fig s3 in the si these results indicated that al si and fe containing nanoparticles are the main mineralogical composition for the ticps in lake waters 3 2 sources of colloidal particles in lake waters fig 2 compares the wind induced concentrations of colloidal particles between natural waters and simulated experiments the concentrations of ticps in lake waters ranged from 6 3 0 3 to 20 7 2 2 mg l and from 2 8 0 2 to 11 4 0 5 mg l for the algae and macrophyte dominant regions respectively which were significantly higher than those detected in some deep lake waters filella et al 2009 the concentrations of ncps were about two times higher than those of ticps in our samples indicating the presence and importance of colloidal organic matter in the water column which is consistent with previous observations for other freshwater systems zou et al 2006 stolpe et al 2013 cai et al 2015 in addition adsorption of macromolecules on inorganic colloid surfaces as well as the excretion of colloid like organic substances from algae and macrophytes could also contribute to the high abundance of ncps in natural waters xu et al 2013 xu and jiang 2015 further analysis showed that concentrations of colloidal particles in both lake waters and simulated resuspension experiments increased with increasing wind speeds fig 2a demonstrating the important role of sediment re suspension in the formation of colloids in shallow lake waters in the algae dominant region as the wind speed increased from 2 to 8 m s the concentrations of ncps and ticps in simulated experiments increased from 12 5 0 9 and 4 9 0 3 mg l to 30 2 2 1 and 16 0 1 1 mg l respectively however under the same wind speed conditions the ncps and ticps collected from lake waters varied from 23 1 1 9 and 6 3 0 3 mg l to 58 4 4 2 and 20 7 2 2 mg l respectively the differences in colloidal abundance between lake waters and simulated experiments demonstrated that 53 9 1 8 of ncps and 78 3 1 1 of ticps in lake waters could be derived from the sediment re suspension during windy conditions the effect of sediment re suspension to the aquatic colloid abundance in macrophyte dominant region fig 2b showed similar results that the contribution of sediment re suspension to natural colloid abundance was 55 0 3 5 for ncps and 80 1 2 6 for ticps the lower percentage contribution of sediment re suspension for ncps can be attributed to the presence of colloid like organic substances in the water column and or the adsorption of macromolecules on inorganic colloid surfaces 3 3 aggregation of aquatic colloids in electrolyte solutions without nom time resolved aggregation profiles of aquatic colloids including ncps and ticps isolated from lake waters as a function of electrolyte concentrations are presented in fig s4 in the si based on aggregation kinetics the electrolyte dependent attachment efficiencies can be obtained as shown in fig 3 the aggregation behavior of ncps and ticps in both na and ca2 solutions exhibited clearly a dlvo type aggregation profile suggesting that electrostatic interactions played an important role in stabilizing the aquatic colloids yin et al 2015 this cation induced aggregation behavior has also been reported for other bare and surface modified inorganic colloidal particles liu et al 2011 dong and lo 2013 in this study the attachment efficiency exhibited an initial electrolyte dependent enhancement followed by a non sensitive stage with increasing electrolyte concentrations the minimum electrolyte concentration required for the occurrence of this non sensitivity was defined as critical coagulation concentration ccc chen et al 2006 it was shown that the ccc values were highly dependent on the valence of electrolytes taken the ticps as an example the cccs in na treatment were 18 2 and 28 2 mm for ticps from the macrophyte and algae dominant regions respectively while those in ca2 treatment decreased to 0 55 0 05 and 0 50 0 05 mm respectively the much lower ccc value of ca2 was ascribed to the high charge density and strong neutralization abilities of divalent electrolytes stankus et al 2011 since the ccc values of nacl observed in this study were in the range of 18 28 mm for ticps those of cacl2 calculated based on the schulze hardy rule verwey et al 1999 were thus within 0 28 and 0 44 mm which were in the same range as the experimental data fig 3 in addition to electrolyte valences types of colloidal particles also played an important role in determining the ccc values for example the ncps exhibited higher ccc values than ticps both for the macrophyte and algae dominant lake waters specifically the ccc values of na and ca2 were 18 28 and 0 50 0 55 mm for ticps respectively which were obviously lower than those for the ncps 33 150 mm in na and 0 75 1 60 mm in ca2 based on these cccs it is clear that ncps were more stable or less sensitive to the effect of cations than ticps in both mono and divalent electrolyte solutions the zeta potentials of ticps in algae and macrophyte dominant lake waters were 42 0 0 3 and 38 5 1 6 mv respectively while those of ncps were in the range from 60 3 1 8 to 60 9 2 3 mv lower zeta potentials and steric repulsion originated from the surface coating suggest that more electrolyte cations are needed to screen the negative charge for colloidal aggregation which accounts for the higher ccc values of na and ca2 for ncps 3 4 aggregation kinetics of colloids in electrolyte solution with bulk and mw fractionated nom 3 4 1 characterization of bulk and mw fractionated nom information on mw distribution of fa was obtained via the application of ultrafiltration comparisons in doc concentrations between the bulk and ultrafiltered samples showed that the fa tested was composed of 40 in mass of the 1 kda lmw and 60 of the hmw fa 1 kda 0 45 μm the percentage of the lmw fraction was similar to those observed in natural river nom samples using the same membrane disc and mwco xu and guo 2017 but much lower than that of the western siberia lakes shirokova et al 2013 spectroscopic data for comparing the inherent chemical properties between the bulk and mw fractionated fa samples are shown in fig 4 the absorbance intensities of the 1 kda hmw fa were generally higher than those of bulk and lmw fa at all wavelengths fig 4a this demonstrated that the aromatic components and hydrophobic structures were partitioned mainly in the hmw fraction similar with other previous studies shen et al 2015 yin et al 2015 the fluorescent eem spectra in the bulk fa sample detected four major peaks with ex em maxima at 275 320 340 230 320 340 275 380 400 and 230 380 400 nm representing peaks a b c d respectively fig 4b manifesting the abundance of carboxylic like functional groups yan et al 2013 xu et al 2016a among these peaks peaks a and b with low aromaticity were substaintially located in the lmw fraction fig 4c while the hmw fraction with high aromaticity and hydrophobicity contained mainly peaks c and d fig 4d showing a mw dependent feature in abundance and chemical composition in the bulk fa similar distribution patterns were also found in other natural waters xu and guo 2017 3 4 2 nom molecular size dependent aggregation behavior of ticps based on the time resolved aggregation profiles fig s5 s8 in the si the variations in attachment efficiencies of ticps as a function of different electrolyte concentrations in the presence of bulk and mw fractioned fas can be obtained fig 5 overall the addition of fa matrix resulted in the increase in ccc values in both mono and divalent electrolytes showing a fa induced enhancement in colloidal stability dong and lo 2013 specifically due to the addition of fa matrix the cccs of na shifted from 18 2 28 2 mm to 150 5 170 10 mm and those of ca2 increased from 0 50 0 05 0 55 0 05 mm to 3 30 0 05 4 20 0 05 mm the ccc values in the presence of bulk fa observed herein were comparable with previous studies showing a ccc of 170 mm for na and 2 5 mm for ca2 for the aggregation of al2o3 colloids in the presence of microbially derived extracellular polymeric substance eps xu et al 2016b the increase in ccc values indicated that colloidal particles were prone to be more stable even with a low doc concentration e g 2 mg c l however in some shallow lakes especially the eutrophic shallow lakes doc concentrations can reach up to about 20 mg c l xu and jiang 2013 which were significantly higher than those applied in the simulation study due to the negative charge imparted by organic matters colloids in such high doc environments are expected to be relatively stable this mechanism could result in the persistence of high water turbidity in some eutrophic shallow lakes such as lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi in china xing and kong 2007 zhang et al 2014 in addition to bulk fa variations in attachment efficiencies of ticps were also related to the inherent mw properties for example cccs values with the addition of lmw fa were 2 7 3 4 times higher for na and 2 2 3 0 times higher for ca2 respectively compared to those without fa in contrast the cccs in the presence of hmw fa were 7 9 15 6 times higher for na and 12 2 12 4 times higher for ca2 respectively these results clearly demonstrated that the hmw fa enhanced colloidal stability much more efficiently than the lmw fa similar with the aggregation profiles of ticps the nom induced stability enhancement has been reported for some model inorganic colloids or nanoparticles such as nano zero valent iron titanium dioxide nickel oxide zinc oxide silica colloidal particles zhang et al 2009 dong and lo 2013 kteeba et al 2017 however the relationship between specific nom mw ranges and colloidal stability enhancement has not been well quantified our findings here on mw dependent aggregation heterogeneity in different electrolytes implied that previous observations of nom enhanced colloidal stability should mainly resulted from the hmw fraction of nom matrix to probe into mechanisms responsible for the stability enhancement zeta potentials of ticps in the presence of different electrolytes altered by the bulk and mw fractionated fa were compared fig s9 in the si as depicted the zeta potential of ticps was generally more negative in the presence of fa even with the presence of divalent electrolytes in addition the zeta potential of ticps in the presence of hmw fa became even more negative compared to those in the presence of bulk or lmw fa except for the condition of high na concentrations fig s9 in the si the more negative surface charge indicated strong electrostatic repulsion which accounts for the higher colloidal stability in the presence of hmw fa in addition owing to the plenty of aromatic substances and hydrophobicity the hmw fa would be expected to have preferable adsorption on ticps through hydrophobic and π π interactions yin et al 2015 our adsorption experiments also showed that hmw fa exhibited higher adsorption intensities than the bulk and lmw fa table s2 in the si high adsorptive ability of hmw fa indicated the efficient formation of organic layers on the surface of ticps thus enhancing the zeta potential and colloidal stability via steric repulsion shen et al 2015 therefore both the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance can account for the mw dependent enhancement of colloidal stability for ticps in lake waters 3 4 3 aggregation kinetics of ncps affected by bulk and mw fractionated nom fig 6 shows the mw dependent aggregation behavior of ncps in the presence of different electrolytes with the detailed time resolved aggregation profiles shown in figs s5 s8 in the si compared with the electrolyte induced aggregation profiles in the absence of fa addition of bulk fa resulted in higher ccc values 1 2 1 3 times higher for na and 1 3 1 4 times higher for ca2 as for the mw fractionated fa the lmw fa increased the ccc values at 1 2 1 4 times higher for na and 1 1 1 5 times higher for ca2 respectively and the addition of hmw fa also caused a slight increase in ccc values at 1 4 1 5 times higher for na and 1 3 1 5 times higher for ca2 respectively these results demonstrated that the increase extents of cccs for ncps were much less significant compared to those for ticps both in mono and divalent electrolytes due to the difference in colloidal composition yin et al 2015 also showed that nom enhanced the stability of bare silver nanoparticles but exhibited minor influence for the citrate coated nanoparticles 20 nm however another study reported that addition of nom elevated the stability of both citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles 60 nm in solutions containing na or low concentrations of ca2 but inhibited the stability at high ca2 concentrations huynh and chen 2011 this indicated that the influences of nom on the aggregation profiles of surface coated colloidal particles also depended on other factors such as colloid properties coating agents and specific electrolytes our results were consistent with those of yin et al 2015 to reveal the mechanism for the insensitivity of aggregation kinetics in response to fa addition the surface charges and fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of ncps under various conditions were measured the zeta potential and ftir spectra of ncps in both mono and divalent electrolytes was not significantly influenced by the bulk and mw fractionated fa figs s10 and s11 in the si demonstrating weak interactions between fa and the coated organic layers on ncp surfaces the adsorption experiments also showed that the adsorption capacities of bulk and mw fractionated fa on ncps surfaces were generally lower p 0 05 than those on ticps table s2 in the si therefore the presence of organic layers inhibited the further adsorption or coating of the bulk and mw fractionated fa on the surfaces of ncps which were responsible for the slight mw dependent enhancement of ccc values 3 5 significance and implications due to the high surface activity and potential influence on the toxicity and bio availability of many contaminants aquatic colloids have received increasing attention in recent years lead and wilkinson 2006 chanudet and filella 2009 filella et al 2009 louie et al 2016 however many previous studies focused mainly on the spatio temporal distribution and abundance analysis lacking the information on sources of the colloidal particles pokrovsky et al 2016 in this study a sediment generation apparatus was applied to quantify the contribution of sediment re suspension to the colloid abundance in natural waters it was found that under environmentally relevant conditions the process of sediment re suspension contributed up to 78 80 of ticps and 54 55 of ncps in the water column of eutrophic shallow lakes to our knowledge this is the first study elucidating the sources and production of natural colloids as a ubiquitous entity nom can regulate the stability of colloids via electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance furman et al 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 although previous studies on the nom effects on colloidal stability were mainly based on model inorganic colloids a consistent nom induced stability enhancement has been observed in both mono and divalent electrolytes similar to those observed for ticps here however we found that the nom induced aggregation heterogeneities of the ncps were less significant than those of the ticps as known engineered nanoparticles are likely to be coated with organic macromolecules either intentionally added by manufacturers for desired properties or incidentally obtained during their life cycle louie et al 2013 moreover the large specific surface area endowed inorganic colloids a high capacity for nom adsorption or coating table s2 in the si forming the predominant ncps species in aquatic environments thus due to the noticeable heterogeneities in aggregation profiles between the ncps and ticps previous results on colloidal behavior analysis using model inorganic colloids are likely to deviate from those of aquatic colloids and may need a critical reevaluation furthermore since the bulk nom is highly heterogeneous in molecular size and composition different molecular size fractions of nom are expected to play distinct roles in determining the aggregation behavior compared with previous studies aiming at the effects of bulk nom zhang et al 2009 dong and lo 2013 we found evident mw dependent aggregation heterogeneity in both mono and divalent electrolytes with the 1 kda hmw fa having higher stability efficiency followed by bulk fa and then the 1 kda lmw fa this is consistent with the distribution of aromatic and hydrophobic organic components among the lmw hmw and bulk nom pools cai et al 2015 the results highlighted the heterogeneity of nom in regulating colloidal stability among different mw fractions within nom matrix overall our results revealed that even a low concentration of organic ligands 2 mg c l can significantly enhance the colloidal stability and divalent cations enhanced colloidal stability more efficiently than monovalent cations as reported fresh waters usually contain a ca2 concentration less than 1 0 mm and na less than 2 5 mm xu et al 2016b this indicated that the colloidal particles including ncps and ticps in most freshwater systems were usually characterized as obvious reaction limited aggregation regime this also accounted for the persistence of high water turbidity in many aquatic ecosystems the mechanisms for colloidal aggregation in natural waters included electrostatic neutralization and or interparticle bridging huangfu et al 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 our previous studies reported that in the presence of cyanobacterial eps electrostatic neutralization contributed to the aggregation of model inorganic colloids at low ca2 concentration while cation bridging became the main mechanism for the enhanced aggregation in ca2 concentrations higher than the ccc xu et al 2016b yin et al 2015 also found that although hmw nom was the key component in stabilizing the citrate coated silver colloids at low ca2 concentrations it could play a reversed role in promoting the colloidal aggregation at high concentrations of divalent cations however the phenomenon of the interparticle bridging was not observed in this study both for the ncps and ticps the reason for the absence of bridging mechanism was still unclear but may be related to factors such as ph nom composition molecular size and colloidal structure which needs further studies 4 conclusion aquatic colloids including ncps and ticps in eutrophic shallow lake waters were characterized with high abundance broad size distribution and fe al si containing mineralogical properties sediment re suspension can have a significant contribution to colloidal particles at 54 55 of the ncps and 78 80 of the ticps in lake waters the colloidal particles exhibited obvious dlvo like aggregation profiles in mono and divalent electrolytes but presence of fa significantly inhibited the aggregation and enhanced the colloidal stability in the water column different mw fractions within fa matrix showed different effects on colloidal stability against aggregation with hmw fraction exhibiting higher stability efficiency than the lmw counterpart however the mw dependent aggregation heterogeneities for ncps were less significant than those for ticps therefore in addition to bulk nom influence of dom with different size fractions within nom matrix should also be considered when interpreting effects of nom on colloidal behavior in addition differences in the nom mw dependent aggregation behavior between ncps and ticps indicated that previous results on colloidal behavior analysis using model inorganic colloids should be reevaluated

19469,beta n methylamino l alanine bmaa a new cyanobacterial neurotoxin produced by more than 20 genera of cyanobacteria has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex als pdc or alzheimer s disease although bmaa has been shown to be removed in drinking water treatment plants dwtps studies regarding the reactions between bmaa and the commonly used oxidants in dwtps are limited to chlorine under specific conditions in this study the reaction kinetics between bmaa and five oxidants commonly used in dwtps including chlorine potassium permanganate ozone hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical were investigated the oxidation of bmaa by chlorine ozone or oh radical followed the second order reaction rate law and the reaction rate was in the order of oh radicals ozone chlorine the rate constants increased by 20 times from 2 103 m 1s 1 at ph 5 8 to 4 93 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 and kept in a relatively stable level at ph 7 9 5 rate constants of oh radicals were 1 11 108 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 and 5 51 109 1 35 1010 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 for both permanganate and h2o2 only the removal of bmaa was negligible the ph dependency of chlorine and the oh radical may be attributed to the neutral form of bmaa with free lone pair electrons readily to be attacked by oxidants however for ozonation of bmaa the rate constants were 1 88 106 3 72 1010 m 1s 1 with a linear dependency on ph implying that the hydroxide concentration governs the reaction in addition the rate of bmaa degradation was found to be slower in natural water if compared with that in deionized water graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanotoxin beta n methylamino l alanine bmaa reaction kinetics oxidation ph effect natural water 1 introduction the blooming of cyanobacteria has become a global phenomenon in recent years because of eutrophication of many lakes and reservoirs since many cyanobacteria are producers of cyanotoxins and taste and odor t o compounds excess growth of cyanobacteria may deteriorate the water quality of water resources posing risk to public health and endangering public perceptions of drinking water therefore removal of cyanotoxins such as microcystins cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxins and t o compounds such as geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol in drinking water treatment processes has been well documented lin et al 2009 rodríguez et al 2007b zamyadi et al 2013 recently a novel neurotoxin β n methylamino l alanine bmaa cox et al 2005 produced by many genera of cyanobacteria has received high attention because of its association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex als pdc or alzheimer s disease bradley et al 2013 murch et al 2004 pablo et al 2009 in addition the cyanotoxin has been proved to be neurotoxic to chicks rats and monkeys bell 2009 and may be incorporated into the brain where it recycles causing slow neurodegeneration murch et al 2004 rao et al 2006 bmaa has been detected in many water resources including lake winnipeg manitoba canada bishop et al 2018 6 of the 12 studied reservoirs in nebraska usa al sammak et al 2014 and 1 of the 3 studied water sources in south africa esterhuizen londt and downing 2011 considering the occurrence in water resources and toxicity to human health understanding the removal of bmaa in water treatment processes is thus needed for better management of cyanotoxin relevant drinking water quality although conventional water treatment processes including sedimentation flotation and filtration can remove cyanobacterial cells and intra cellular cyanotoxins from water the processes cannot effectively remove dissolved contaminants newcombe and nicholson 2004 pietsch et al 2002 chemical oxidation processes however have been applied in water treatment for the removal of extracellular cyanotoxins westrick et al reviewed and summarized the effectiveness and application of six oxidants including chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide permanganate ozone and hydroxyl radial oh for the destruction of four conventional cyanotoxins including microcystin anatoxin a cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin westrick et al 2010 among these oxidants chlorine is the most commonly used oxidant in drinking water systems for which the reactions between chlorine and conventional cyanotoxins have been extensively documented acero et al 2005 rodríguez et al 2007b 2008 chlorine may react with organic compounds on the moieties of activated aromatic and neutral amine groups rodríguez et al 2007b potassium permanganate kmno4 ozone and hydroxyl radicals are three other oxidants commonly used in drinking water treatment the reactions between permanganate and organic compounds are known to include electron exchange hydrogen abstraction and oxygen donation rodríguez et al 2007a while the reactions with ozone may involve attacks on alkene groups as well as activated aromatic and neutral amine groups von gunten 2003 westrick et al 2010 in the case of hydroxyl radicals the reactions with organic compounds involve random attacks on carbon hydrogen bonds westrick et al 2010 since bmaa is considered to be a new cyanotoxin unlike conventional cyanotoxins reactions between bmaa and the oxidants used in water treatment processes have been rarely studied with only one study focusing on reactions with chlorine chen et al 2017 chen et al 2017 studied the reaction mechanisms kinetics and formation of intermediates between bmaa and chlorine in their report four chlorinated intermediates each with one or two chlorines were identified where the intermediates were possibly converted back to bmaa under a reducing condition chen et al 2017 the reaction pathway of bmaa and chlorine has been shown to occur in three steps where it was studied for the reaction kinetics at ph 5 5 and 7 0 in deionized water chen et al 2017 with the scheme being shown in si scheme s1 the three reaction steps include reaction of bmaa and free chlorine to form chlorinated bmaa autodecomposition of chlorinated bmaa and the reaction of chlorinated bmaa with free chlorine in chen et al 2017 the reactions between chlorine and bmaa were only studied in deionized water under acidic and neutral conditions however in natural waters particularly in those with high algae cyanobacteria concentrations the ph value is usually higher than 8 0 xie et al 2003 since the dominant species of chlorine at ph 8 0 is hocl whereas ocl dominates at ph 8 0 10 0 aieta et al 1984 it is necessary to study the reaction between bmaa and chlorine at ph values higher than 8 0 in addition natural water contains natural organic matter nom and ions boyle et al 1977 sholkovitz 1976 so it is also necessary to understand the impact of the water matrix on the bmaa and chlorine reaction in natural water in light of the shortage of current literature on bmaa removal the aims of this study are 1 to examine the reaction kinetics during bmaa chlorination processes in natural water and under alkaline conditions 2 to understand the removal of bmaa by different oxidants including kmno4 ozone h2o2 and hydroxyl radical and 3 to elucidate the effect of ph and water matrix on the reactions between these oxidants and bmaa 2 materials and methods 2 1 bmaa analyses the quantification of bmaa was performed using a liquid chromatograph ultimate 3000 hplc thermo scientific usa coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer ms ms tsq quantum ultra thermo scientific usa a hilic column 2 7 μm 4 6 mm 150 mm i d capcell core pc shisido japan was used in this analysis for which the flow rate was set at 0 25 ml min 1 the gradient came with mobile phase a 0 1 formic acid 15 and mobile phase b acn 0 1 formic acid 85 for 1 5 mins then the mobile phase b was decreased to 30 in 2 mins held at 30 for 7 min and finally returned to 85 until the process was terminated at 20 min to identify bmaa the ms ms system was operated under the positive ion mode and three srm transitions of m z were monitored 119 1 44 0 amu collision energies ce 14 ev 119 1 88 0 amu ce 11 ev and 119 1 102 1 amu ce 9 ev the ion source parameters were optimized with the parameters

gas pressure 1 5 mtorr 2 2 chlorination experiments a batch reaction was used for the chlorination experiments in this study with 500 ml glass vessels used as the reactors a stock solution of bmaa 97 purity sigma aldrich usa was prepared at 250 mg l before use two types of natural water were collected from lan tan reservoir chiayi taiwan lt water total organic carbon toc 1 4 mg l and cheng kung lake toc 12 7 mg l tainan taiwan the two natural waters and deionized water milli q usa were used as the studied water matrix for the chlorination experiments the ph of the deionized water was adjusted to 6 5 9 0 and 9 5 using sodium hydroxide gr grade showa chemical japan while that of the two natural waters was not adjusted both chlorine and bmaa dosages were set at 0 5 5 mg l in the chlorination experiments ascorbic acid 99 purity acros organics usa was used as the reductant for the kinetic experiments of chlorine and chlorinated bmaa the difference of ph values before and after the experiments were all less than 0 2 suggesting that the ph values were stable during the oxidation process 2 3 competition experiments based on the preliminary experiments the oxidation of bmaa by ozone and chlorine were completed very fast bmaa was either disappeared or remained constant after 1 min the reaction kinetics could not be obtained through direct measurement of the bmaa concentration therefore competition experiments were conducted for the reaction kinetics of bmaa with chlorine and with ozone following a similar approach to that reported in shah et al 2006 and chen et al 2017 chen et al 2017 shah et al 2006 the reactions between bmaa and chlorine or ozone can be described by a second order reaction as 1 ln c reactant c reactant 0 k app c oxidant dt where creacant creactanto is the ratio of the bmaa or competitor concentration at time t relative to the initial concentration c oxidant dt ct is the oxidant exposure and k app m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant both free chlorine and ozone follow a second order reaction while the competitor and bmaa are at equal molar concentrations then equation 1 can be rewritten as 2 ln c bmaa c bmaa 0 k a p p b m a a k a p p c o m p e t i t o r ln c c o m p e t i t o r c c o m p e t i t o r 0 for chlorination of bmaa the competing chemical used for the competition experiments was 4 6 dichlororesorcinol dcr for which details of the experiments can be found in chen et al 2017 chen et al 2017 in the experiment both dcr and bmaa were set at 5 μm and different chlorine concentrations were added in six batches 3 3 5 9 7 7 9 3 13 5 and 15 μm similar to that for the chlorination experiments a chemical competitor 4 chloroguaiacol 4 cg was used in the ozonation of bmaa and the concentrations of bmaa and 4 cg were both set at 5 μm the ozone solution was prepared from purging gaseous ozone produced by a laboratory ozone generator ozonizer o3 6g y roda usa into deionized water with pure oxygen 99 99 yunshan taiwan used as the gas source the ph of the ozone solution was adjusted to 5 8 6 5 7 0 8 5 and 9 5 the initial concentrations of ozone were 5 6 11 3 16 9 22 5 28 1 and 33 1 μm in six batches under each ph condition a scavenger 2 propanol was added into the reactors to eliminate hydroxyl radicals hislop and bolton 1999 xu et al 2011 due to the instability of ozone in water von gunten 2003 the two competitors dcr and 4 cg were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a photodiode array detector module spd m10a shimadzu inc japan using a c18 ods column 150 mm 4 6 mm tosoh japan for the separation of the chemicals the detection wavelengths were 295 and 280 nm the flow rate was 0 8 ml min and the mobile phase solution was a mix of methanol water and acetic acid at volume ratios of 45 54 and 1 respectively 2 4 oxidation with permanganate in the permanganation experiments bmaa concentrations were set at between 0 5 and 5 mgl 1 kmno4 gr grade merck germany was added into a 250 ml amber glass reactor at a dosage of 4 mg l 1 to investigate the reaction kinetics and the ph was adjusted to 5 8 7 0 and 8 5 samples were collected every 30 mins 10 ml for the analysis of residual kmno4 concentrations and 0 5 ml for the quantification of bmaa 2 5 oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical the reaction of bmaa with hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical was conducted in a hydrogen peroxide uv system using 250 ml glass reactors with a telfon coated magnetic stirrer at 280 rpm in the reaction h2o2 30w sigma aldrich united states was controlled at 10 and 60 mgl 1 and bmaa dosages was controlled at 0 2 and 0 5 mgl 1 a uv light source execure 4000 d hoya japan was set to illuminate the reactor and the total uv irradiance was determined to be 57 4 w m 2 including uva uvb and uvc at a depth of 5 cm from the surface of the solution in the reactor using a spectrometer greenwave uvnb stellarnet corp united states equipped with a receptor cr2 stellarnet corp united states and an optical fiber f600 uv vis 2m stellarnet corp japan the spectrum for the uv irradiance was shown in fig s2 the ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 8 6 5 7 0 8 5 and 9 5 samples were taken at 10 30 50 70 90 120 150 and 180 mins for the analysis of bmaa and oh radical concentrations in the reactor rhodamine b rhb was chosen as the chemical probe to estimate the oh radical concentration in this study based on the kwon et al 2014 rhb can be regarded as the probe compound of oh radical and the reaction between rhb and oh radical can be expressed as the following equation kwon et al 2014 3 d c d t k o h r h b c o h ln c r h b c r h b 0 k o h r h b c o h t where c r h b and c r h b 0 are the concentrations of rhb at times t and t 0 respectively c o h is the oh radical concentration k o h r h b is the apparent rate constant of rhb decolorization reported as 3 75 0 15 109 m 1 s 1 kwon et al 2014 and t is the time of exposure to uv h2o2 rhb concentrations were determined using a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa at a wavelength of 554 nm experimental results indicated that h2o2 concentration remained unchanged through the experimental time under the conditions of this study fig s3 indicating that oh radical can be generated stably if the oh radical concentration is constant during the experimental period the rate constant between oh radical and bmaa can be obtained using eq 4 4 ln c b m a a c b m a a 0 k o h b m a a c o h t 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics of bmaa with chlorine under alkaline conditions and in natural water the ph effect was evaluated for ph values ranging from 5 8 to 9 5 for bmaa chlorination fig 1 shows the results of the bmaa and free chlorine competition experiments using 4 6 dichlororesorcinol dcr as the competitor for the chlorination of bmaa a second order kinetic rate was observed with the first order in chlorine and first order in bmaa where the rate constant denoted as k 1 was determined to be 8 78 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 5 1 29 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 0 1 85 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 5 with the coefficient of determination r2 being 0 95 for all experiments table 1 table s1 as shown in fig 1 and table 1 the rate constants of bmaa reacting with free chlorine conducted in di water were influenced by ph in both neutral and acidic conditions ph 5 7 larger rate constants were observed when the ph 7 but the variation was less significant a natural water sample from lt reservoir was tested and a smaller rate constant was obtained k 1 3 78 104 m 1 s 1 ph 8 5 indicating that the water matrix may influence the reaction rate because the organic matter in natural water may compete with the free chlorine in the reactor system gallard and von gunten 2002 rook 1977 the slower reaction rate in natural water may be linked to the presence of natural organic matter since chlorinated bmaa can be considered to be a group of chloramines it may autodecompose in water for which the reaction can be described by a pseudo first order reaction chen et al 2017 5 d c c h l o r i n a t e d b m a a d t k 2 c c h l o r i n a t e d b m a a according to the k 1 values listed in table 1 it was clear that bmaa rapidly reacts with chlorine to generate combined bmaa also recognized as chlorinated bmaa the chlorinated bmaa autodecomposition experiments were conducted under excess bmaa conditions as compared to those for chlorine all chlorine was consumed and formed chlorinated bmaa within a 5 min reaction time the concentration of combined bmaa was determined by adding a high dose reductant to convert it back to its original compound chen et al 2017 which could be quantified by lc ms ms the differences among the bmaa concentrations at different sampling times can be viewed as the degradation of chlorinated bmaa the concentration changes in the chlorinated bmaa were used to determine the chlorinated bmaa autodecomposition rate denoted as k 2 based on eq 5 the k 2 values did not vary obviously when the ph was higher than 7 fig 2 and table 2 k 2 0 0029 min 1 at ph 7 and 0 0023 min 1 at ph 9 however a 5 times higher rate constant 0 012 min 1 was obtained at ph 5 5 5 8 vikesland et al 2001 observed that the rates of monochloramine decay are dependent on ph the rate at ph 6 5 was ten times higher than that at ph 8 34 and was three times higher than that at ph 7 56 vikesland et al 2001 as in the current study mono chlorinated bmaa a form of organic monochloramines was the prevalent chlorinated bmaa in the current experimental system chen et al 2017 the ph dependency of k 2 varied similarly to that reported by vikesland et al 2001 in addition to autodecomposition chlorinated bmaa may further react with chlorine to generate oxidative products chen et al 2017 the reaction between bmaa and chlorine shown in eq 1 may also be adapted to describe the reaction between chlorinated bmaa and chlorine in the equation bmaa was replaced with chlorinated bmaa and k 1 was replaced with k 3 the excess free chlorine condition was conducted and bmaa was expected to be exhausted in a few minutes the rapidly formed chlorinated bmaa has been shown to continue to react with free chlorine chen et al 2017 therefore the data obtained after 5 min of spiking with excess amounts of chlorine were used for model fitting to yield k 3 it can be seen in fig 3 that the rates for further chlorination of chlorinated bmaa did not change significantly for all the tested conditions including in di water under different phs and in natural water all the experimental data could be fitted with one rate constant table 2 k 3 17 75 m 1s 1 and r2 0 96 based on the obtained k 1 and k 3 if the ct value was set at 150 mgl 1 min 90 of bmaa and its chlorinated intermediates were expected to be degraded the estimated ct values from usepa lechevallier and au 2004 for inactivation of giardia cysts with free chlorine are around 37 65 mgl 1 min to achieve a 3 log 99 9 reduction at ph 7 and 8 this indicated that if bmaa is present in the source water larger ct value for chlorination compared to that for giardia cysts is required to achieve 90 degradation 3 2 bmaa oxidation by kmno4 the degradation of bmaa by kmno4 was examined at various reactant concentrations kmno4 0 3 5 mg l bmaa 0 0 5 and 5 mg l and ph 5 5 7 and 8 5 cyanotoxins such as microcystin cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin a have been reported to be oxidized by permanganate as a second order reaction chen et al 2005 rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b however for bmaa the results showed that changes in the bmaa and permanganate concentrations had no obvious impacts on bmaa degradation less than 10 of bmaa and less than 5 of permanganate disappeared within 3 h fig 4 permanganate has been suggested to attack the conjugated double bond of the adda residue of microcystins pietsch et al 2002 the rate constants of microcystin oxidized by permanganate were 400 6 4 105 m 1 s 1 and that of cylindrospermopsin was 0 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 chen et al 2005 rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b however the rate constant of bmaa with permanganate was found to be 5 7 10 5 m 1s 1 in this study much smaller than the reaction of permanganate with microcystins and anatoxin a the high rate constants between permanganate and microcystins anatoxin a can be attributed to hydroxylation on their carbon carbon double bonds freeman and kappos 1985 wiberg and saegebarth 1957 because bmaa does not have carbon carbon double bonds fig s1 no hydroxylation can occur perez benito 2011 studied the oxidation kinetics of α amino acids under permanganation and observed slow reaction rates with the second order reaction rate constants of seven amino acids ranging from 1 10 8 m 1s 1 to 3 10 8 m 1s 1 perez benito 2011 bmaa also is a member of the amino acid family and therefore a slow reaction rate between bmaa and permanganate can be expected 3 3 ozonation of bmaa bmaa oxidation by ozone was fast and competition experiments using 4 chloroguaiacol as the competing agent were conducted to study the reaction kinetics at different phs 1 14 benitez et al 2000 ozone may decompose and generate oh radical in aqueous solutions typically at higher ph values although the decomposition ratio of ozone is less than 10 in 1 min at ph 8 5 von gunten 2003 to confirm the contribution of oh radicals to the degradation of bmaa during ozonation parallel experimental sets with and without addition of the oh radical scavenger 2 propanol were conducted shown as solid symbols in fig 5 the results showed that the reaction kinetics of bmaa during ozonation were identical for the cases with and without addition of 2 propanol for all the studied conditions including under different phs and in natural water this observation suggests that the amount of oh radicals generated in the current systems were not enough to significantly degrade bmaa and therefore the disappearance of bmaa in this system can be attributed completely to direct ozonation also as shown in fig 5 the second order models fit very well with all the experimental data r2 0 93 table s1 where the rate constants were found to increase with increasing ph summarized in table 1 the slowest rate constant was 1 88 106 m 1s 1 at ph 5 8 and the highest was 3 72 1010 m 1s 1 at ph 9 5 in di water onstad et al 2007 studied the apparent rate constant of cylindrospermopsin by ozonation and similar ph dependency where a higher ph led to a faster reaction in di water was reported onstad et al 2007 however the rate differences were not obvious for microcystin and anatoxin a in the common ph range for drinking water treatment ph 6 8 their rate constants for microcystin lr cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin a were between 6 4 104 and 4 1 105 m 1s 1 which were much smaller than bmaa suggesting that the structure of bmaa may be very receptive to ozone attack 3 4 reaction with hydrogen peroxide and oh radicals fig 6 illustrates the degradation of bmaa in the uv h2o2 system different h2o2 concentrations and phs were tested at a uv light intensity 57 4 w m 2 in all the scenarios two sets of control experiments one applied with only h2o2 and the other with only uv irradiation were conducted to evaluate the direct oxidation of bmaa by h2o2 and direct photolysis as shown in fig 6 the bmaa concentrations remained unchanged for all tested h2o2 dosages within 3 h of reaction time suggesting that the degradation of bmaa by h2o2 alone is slow similar results were also observed in the uv irradiation suggesting that direct photolysis of bmaa under the studied uv condition was not significant in the experiments the oh radical concentration was quantified using the chemical probe chemical rhb as indicted in the material and methods section the oh radicals produced were estimated to be at concentrations ranging from 5 3 10 14 to 1 1 10 13 m and 1 6 10 13 to 3 7 10 13 m for the cases of h2o2 dosages 10 mg l and 60 mg l respectively table s2 the data shown in fig 6 for the degradation of bmaa were modeled with first order reaction rate constants using eq 3 the oxidation of bmaa by oh radicals was very fast and all bmaa was exhausted within 120 min except for the reaction at ph 5 5 in di water the rate constants of bmaa oxidized by oh radical as summarized in table 2 were shown to be ph dependent with the highest rate constants 1 35 0 35 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 5 among all tested conditions onstad et al 2007 determined the rate constants for oh radicals and typical cyanotoxins to be microcystin lr cylindrospermopsin anatoxin roughly corresponding to the sizes of the molecules and the number of hydrogen molecules that can be abstracted by oh radicals onstad et al 2007 since the molecule size of bmaa is much smaller than those of the four cyanotoxins mentioned above the smaller rate constant with the oh radical observed for bmaa at ph 7 6 7 109 m 1 s 1 as compared to that for microcystin lr 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 was therefore expectable 3 5 ph dependency of bmaa oxidation the effects of ph on bmaa oxidation by chlorine ozone and oh radicals are summarized in fig 7 it can be seen that the rate constants of bmaa oxidation are highly relevant to the ph with different degrees among different oxidants suggesting that different mechanisms were involved in the oxidation processes the ph dependency of oh radicals and chlorine is similar where both exhibit lower rate constants at lower phs that increase dramatically at ph 6 7 bmaa includes a carboxylic group and a primary α and a secondary β amino groups to dissociate protons for which the corresponding pk values are 2 1 pk1 6 63 pkα and 9 76 pkβ diaz parga et al 2017 sundh et al 2007 as also depicted in fig 7 the major species of bmaa at ph 5 8 is the protonated form denoted as bmaa where the neutral form bmaa0 becomes dominant at ph 5 8 to 9 therefore it can be inferred that speciation of bmaa plays an important role in its oxidation by oh radicals and chlorine oxidation mechanisms of bmaa may be linked to amine oxidation as proposed previously according to weil and morris 1949 the observed rate for the nh3 hocl reaction is ph dependent due to changes in nh3 speciation at different phs they suggested the nucleophilic displacement and the formation of a cyclic transition state with a hydroxide involved will facilitate the electron shift from one hydrogen on the amine group to chlorine weil and morris 1949 at a lower ph the reactants i e the ammonium or the substituted ammonium ions had no free electron pairs for interacting with the chlorine which led to a lower reaction rate weil and morris 1949 however at higher ph values the reaction rate of the neutral form of ammonia has been shown to be much larger than its protonated form pryor et al 1984 weil and morris 1949 the slow reaction of protonated amines with ozone and the hydroxyl radical have also reported in a few other studies indicating that the nucleophilic attack is the critical reaction for oxidation of amine compounds in this study the rate constants increased significantly with the increasing trend of neutral bmaa indicating that the speciation of bmaa is a major factor for the ph dependency of bmaa chlorination although the speciation of chlorine i e hocl and ocl may possibly influence the reaction rate since the pka of chlorine is 7 6 suidan et al 1977 the slight increases in the rate constant from ph 7 to 9 implies that the electronic force between bmaa and hocl has a less significant impact on the reaction kinetics similar ph dependency with a slow reaction in low ph ranges was observed for bmaa oxidation with oh radicals the smallest rate constant was at ph 5 8 when bmaa was the dominant bmaa species the rate increased dramatically from ph 5 8 to 7 1 and went up slightly as the ph increased to 9 5 as indicated in table s2 the oh radical concentration did not change significantly for the studied phs so the oh radical concentration was not the major factor causing the changes in reaction rate at different phs similar to that for chlorine the oh radical exhibited less reactivity with bmaa as also reported in huang et al 2008 in which nh3 was more vulnerable to oxidation by the oh radical than nh4 in the aqueous phase taken together these results demonstrated that the ph dependency of bmaa oxidation by chlorine and the oh radical can be attributed to the availability of the free electron i e the lone pair on its structure the protonated form of bmaa greatly decreased its nucleophilicity leading to a lower reaction rate at ph 6 on the other hand the neutral form of bmaa exhibited a strong nucleophilic nature yielding a transition state to facilitate electron donation to the chlorine oh radical as also shown in fig 7 the effects of ph on the rate of ozonation of bmaa were quite different from those for bmaa with the chlorine and hydroxyl radical which were related to the speciation of bmaa the rate constant linearly increased with increasing ph values for the reaction of ozone and bmaa which was similar to that reported in pryor et al 1984 for free amine and ozone unlike the transition state mechanism for chlorine hydroxyl radical with bmaa no explicit electron was transferred between ozone and bmaa where an oxygen transfer from the ozone molecule to another compound should be expected beltrán 2003 it has been widely accepted that ozone reacts with oh and then yields a number of reactive secondary oxidants such as h o 2 and h o 2 hoigné 1998 therefore higher oh or higher ph may accelerate the reaction of ozone and form more reactive oxidants for bmaa according to the observations in this study the rate constant between ozone and bmaa was found to be linearly proportional to ph fig 7 r2 0 989 suggesting that the oh concentration plays a critical role in the reaction although the possibility that ozone may directly attack the lone pair of electrons on the bmaa amine group cannot be entirely ruled out based on the observations in this study the contribution of a direct attack by ozone to bmaa degradation is minor 3 6 the effects of natural water matrix to understand the effect of water matrix on bmaa oxidation natural water lt water the water quality data was shown in table s3 was used as in the bmaa oxidation experiments as the background water for which the results are also shown in tables 1 and 2 in the case of chlorination of bmaa the rate constant k 1 for bmaa disappearance increased with increasing ph values however the k 1 k 1 3 78 104 m 1 s 1 ph 8 5 for the lt water was found to be smaller compared to that at the ph 7 condition for di water 5 0 104 m 1 s 1 indicating that the water matrix may influence the reaction rate since the organic matter in natural water may compete with the free chlorine in the system gallard and von gunten 2002 rook 1977 a slower reaction rate is thus expected the autodecomposition rate constant k 2 for chlorinated bmaa in lt water 0 0027 min 1 was similar to that in di water in a similar ph range 0 0027 min 1 for ph 7 and 0 023 min 1 for ph 9 it was obvious that the autodecomposition rate of chlorinated bmaa was not significantly affected by the tested water matrix at the ph near neutral condition unlike k 1 no significant difference was observed for k 3 in natural water or in di water fig 3 the presence of organic matter thus had a limited impact on the chlorination of chlorinated bmaa the rate constant between ozone and bmaa was 2 82 109 m 1 s 1 in the lt natural water which was 22 smaller than that at the same ph in di water rositano et al 2001 studied the effect of nom on ozonation of algal toxins in water their results showed that more ozone doses were needed if a higher concentration of dissolved organic carbon was present in the water rositano et al 2001 our observation also suggested that higher nom concentrations in the lt water may slow down the reaction of ozone with cyanotoxins in the case of the reaction between bmaa and the oh radical the water matrix clearly had an influence the rate constant between the oh radical and bmaa observed for the lt water 6 88 1 25 109 m 1 s 1 was only about half of that for di water under similar ph conditions our observations were similar to the findings reported in lindsey and tarr 2000 lindsey and tarr 2000 in which nom in water was demonstrated to inhibit the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons by the oh radical because nom is commonly present in natural water the effectiveness of oxidants in natural water is typically reduced as compared to those in di water ho et al 2011 therefore the slower reaction rates between bmaa and the studied oxidants in lt natural water may be attributed to the presence of nom in the lt water 4 conclusions the reaction rates of bmaa with four oxidants commonly used in drinking water treatment were studied a second order reaction model was successfully employed to describe the reaction between bmaa and all the studied oxidants with rates of bmaa with oh radicals 1 1 108 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 for different phs and in natural water ozone 5 8 106 3 1 1010 m 1s 1 chlorine 2 1 103 1 2 105 m 1s 1 permanganate 5 7 10 5 m 1s 1 h2o2 slow direct photolysis slow the rate constants between bmaa and chlorine ozone and oh radicals were all found to be ph dependent the oxidation rates of bmaa with chlorine and h2o2 uv were the highest at neutral ph range and therefore no ph adjustment is needed if bmaa is to be treated however if ozonation is used for treating bmaa an alkaline ph is preferred as the rate is proportional to that of the oh concentration the water matrix is also important for the oxidation of bmaa compared with the experiments in di water a 22 50 rate reduction was observed for bmaa with chlorine ozone and the hydroxyl radical in the studied natural water for chlorination the most widely used practice in drinking water treatment plants bmaa and its chlorinated intermediates can be degraded by 90 if the ct value 150 mg l min in both di and natural water the rate constants obtained between bmaa and the four studied oxidants in this study may serve as a useful reference for water utilities to estimate removal efficiency once bmaa is present in their source water acknowledgements this research is supported by the taiwan ministry of science and technology

19469,beta n methylamino l alanine bmaa a new cyanobacterial neurotoxin produced by more than 20 genera of cyanobacteria has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex als pdc or alzheimer s disease although bmaa has been shown to be removed in drinking water treatment plants dwtps studies regarding the reactions between bmaa and the commonly used oxidants in dwtps are limited to chlorine under specific conditions in this study the reaction kinetics between bmaa and five oxidants commonly used in dwtps including chlorine potassium permanganate ozone hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical were investigated the oxidation of bmaa by chlorine ozone or oh radical followed the second order reaction rate law and the reaction rate was in the order of oh radicals ozone chlorine the rate constants increased by 20 times from 2 103 m 1s 1 at ph 5 8 to 4 93 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 and kept in a relatively stable level at ph 7 9 5 rate constants of oh radicals

attributed to the neutral form of bmaa with free lone pair electrons readily to be attacked by oxidants however for ozonation of bmaa the rate constants were 1 88 106 3 72 1010 m 1s 1 with a linear dependency on ph implying that the hydroxide concentration governs the reaction in addition the rate of bmaa degradation was found to be slower in natural water if compared with that in deionized water graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanotoxin beta n methylamino l alanine bmaa reaction kinetics oxidation ph effect natural water 1 introduction the blooming of cyanobacteria has become a global phenomenon in recent years because of eutrophication of many lakes and reservoirs since many cyanobacteria are producers of cyanotoxins and taste and odor t o compounds excess growth of cyanobacteria may deteriorate the water quality of water resources posing risk to public health and endangering public perceptions of drinking water therefore removal of cyanotoxins such as microcystins cylindrospermopsin saxitoxin and anatoxins and t o compounds such as geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol in drinking water treatment processes has been well documented lin et al 2009 rodríguez et al 2007b zamyadi et al 2013 recently a novel neurotoxin β n methylamino l alanine bmaa cox et al 2005 produced by many genera of cyanobacteria has received high attention because of its association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex als pdc or alzheimer s disease bradley et al 2013 murch et al 2004 pablo et al 2009 in addition the cyanotoxin has been proved to be neurotoxic to chicks rats and monkeys bell 2009 and may be incorporated into the brain where it recycles causing slow neurodegeneration murch et al 2004 rao et al 2006 bmaa has been detected in many water resources including lake winnipeg manitoba canada bishop et al 2018 6 of the 12 studied reservoirs in nebraska usa al sammak et al 2014 and 1 of the 3 studied water sources in south africa esterhuizen londt and downing 2011 considering the occurrence in water resources and toxicity to human health understanding the removal of bmaa in water treatment processes is thus needed for better management of cyanotoxin relevant drinking water quality although conventional water treatment processes including sedimentation flotation and filtration can remove cyanobacterial cells and intra cellular cyanotoxins from water the processes cannot effectively remove dissolved contaminants newcombe and nicholson 2004 pietsch et al 2002 chemical oxidation processes however have been applied in water treatment for the removal of extracellular cyanotoxins westrick et al reviewed and summarized the effectiveness and application of six oxidants including chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide permanganate ozone and hydroxyl radial oh for the destruction of four conventional cyanotoxins including microcystin anatoxin a cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin westrick et al 2010 among these oxidants chlorine is the most commonly used oxidant in drinking water systems for which the reactions between chlorine and conventional cyanotoxins have been extensively documented acero et al 2005 rodríguez et al 2007b 2008 chlorine may react with organic compounds on the moieties of activated aromatic and neutral amine groups rodríguez et al 2007b potassium permanganate kmno4 ozone and hydroxyl radicals are three other oxidants commonly used in drinking water treatment the reactions between permanganate and organic compounds are known to include electron exchange hydrogen abstraction and oxygen donation rodríguez et al 2007a while the reactions with ozone may involve attacks on alkene groups as well as activated aromatic and neutral amine groups von gunten 2003 westrick et al 2010 in the case of hydroxyl radicals the reactions with organic compounds involve random attacks on carbon hydrogen bonds westrick et al 2010 since bmaa is considered to be a new cyanotoxin unlike conventional cyanotoxins reactions between bmaa and the oxidants used in water treatment processes have been rarely studied with only one study focusing on reactions with chlorine chen et al 2017 chen et al 2017 studied the reaction mechanisms kinetics and formation of intermediates between bmaa and chlorine in their report four chlorinated intermediates each with one or two chlorines were identified where the intermediates were possibly converted back to bmaa under a reducing condition chen et al 2017 the reaction pathway of bmaa and chlorine has been shown to occur in three steps where it was studied for the reaction kinetics at ph 5 5 and 7 0 in deionized water chen et al 2017 with the scheme being shown in si scheme s1 the three reaction steps include reaction of bmaa and free chlorine to form chlorinated bmaa autodecomposition of chlorinated bmaa and the reaction of chlorinated bmaa with free chlorine in chen et al 2017 the reactions between chlorine and bmaa were only studied in deionized water under acidic and neutral conditions however in natural waters particularly in those with high algae cyanobacteria concentrations the ph value is usually higher than 8 0 xie et al 2003 since the dominant species of chlorine at ph 8 0 is hocl whereas ocl dominates at ph 8 0 10 0 aieta et al 1984 it is necessary to study the reaction between bmaa and chlorine at ph values higher than 8 0 in addition natural water contains natural organic matter nom and ions boyle et al 1977 sholkovitz 1976 so it is also necessary to understand the impact of the water matrix on the bmaa and chlorine reaction in natural water in light of the shortage of current literature on bmaa removal the aims of this study are 1 to examine the reaction kinetics during bmaa chlorination processes in natural water and under alkaline conditions 2 to understand the removal of bmaa by different oxidants including kmno4 ozone h2o2 and hydroxyl radical and 3 to elucidate the effect of ph and water matrix on the reactions between these oxidants and bmaa 2 materials and methods 2 1 bmaa analyses the quantification of bmaa was performed using a liquid chromatograph ultimate

this analysis for which the flow rate was set at 0 25 ml min 1 the gradient came with mobile phase a 0 1 formic acid 15 and mobile phase b acn 0 1 formic acid 85 for 1 5 mins then the mobile phase b was decreased to 30 in 2 mins held at 30 for 7 min and finally returned to 85 until the process was terminated at 20 min to identify bmaa the ms ms system was operated under the positive ion mode and

gas pressure 1 5 mtorr 2 2 chlorination experiments a batch reaction was used for the chlorination experiments in this study with 500 ml glass vessels used as the reactors a stock solution of bmaa 97 purity sigma aldrich usa was prepared at 250 mg l before use two types of natural water were collected from lan tan reservoir chiayi taiwan lt water total organic carbon toc 1 4 mg l and cheng kung lake toc 12 7 mg l tainan taiwan the two natural waters and deionized water milli q usa were used as the studied water matrix for the chlorination experiments the ph of the deionized water was adjusted to 6 5 9 0 and 9 5 using sodium hydroxide gr grade showa chemical japan while that of the two natural waters was not adjusted both chlorine and bmaa dosages were set at 0 5 5 mg l in the chlorination experiments ascorbic acid 99 purity acros organics usa was used as the reductant for the kinetic experiments of chlorine and chlorinated bmaa the difference of ph values before and after the experiments were all less than 0 2 suggesting that the ph values were stable during the oxidation process 2 3 competition experiments based on the preliminary experiments the oxidation of bmaa by ozone and chlorine were completed very fast bmaa was either disappeared or remained constant after 1 min the reaction kinetics could not be obtained through direct measurement of the bmaa concentration therefore competition experiments were conducted for the reaction kinetics of bmaa with chlorine and with ozone following a similar approach to that reported in shah et al 2006 and chen et al 2017 chen et al 2017 shah et al 2006 the reactions between bmaa and chlorine or ozone can be described by a second order reaction as 1 ln c reactant c reactant 0 k app c oxidant dt where creacant creactanto is the ratio of the bmaa or competitor concentration at time t relative to the initial concentration c oxidant dt ct is the oxidant exposure and k app m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant both free chlorine and ozone follow a second order reaction while the competitor and bmaa are at equal molar concentrations then equation 1 can be rewritten as 2 ln c bmaa c bmaa 0 k a p p b m a a k a p p c o m p e t i t o r ln c c o m p e t i t o r c c o m p e t i t o r 0 for chlorination of bmaa the competing chemical used for the competition experiments was 4 6 dichlororesorcinol dcr for which details of the experiments can be found in chen et al 2017 chen et al 2017 in the experiment both dcr and bmaa were set at 5 μm and different chlorine concentrations were added in six batches 3 3 5 9 7 7 9 3 13 5 and 15 μm similar to that for the chlorination experiments a chemical competitor 4 chloroguaiacol 4 cg was used in the ozonation of bmaa and the concentrations of bmaa and 4 cg were both set at 5 μm the ozone solution was prepared from purging gaseous ozone produced by a laboratory ozone generator ozonizer o3 6g y roda usa into deionized water with pure oxygen 99 99 yunshan taiwan used as the gas source the ph of the ozone solution was adjusted to 5 8 6 5 7 0 8 5 and 9 5 the initial concentrations of ozone were 5 6 11 3 16 9 22 5 28 1 and 33 1 μm in six batches under each ph condition a scavenger 2 propanol was added into the reactors to eliminate hydroxyl radicals hislop and bolton 1999 xu et al 2011 due to the instability of ozone in water von gunten 2003 the two competitors dcr and 4 cg were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a photodiode array detector module spd m10a shimadzu inc japan using a c18 ods column 150 mm 4 6 mm tosoh japan for the separation of the chemicals the detection wavelengths were 295 and 280 nm the flow rate was 0 8 ml min and the mobile phase solution was a mix of methanol water and acetic acid at volume ratios of 45 54 and 1 respectively 2 4 oxidation with permanganate in the permanganation experiments bmaa concentrations were set at between 0 5 and 5 mgl 1 kmno4 gr grade merck germany was added into a 250 ml amber glass reactor at a dosage of 4 mg l 1 to investigate the reaction kinetics and the ph was adjusted to 5 8 7 0 and 8 5 samples were collected every 30 mins 10 ml for the analysis of residual kmno4 concentrations and 0 5 ml for the quantification of bmaa 2 5 oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical the reaction of bmaa with hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical was conducted in a hydrogen peroxide uv system using 250 ml glass reactors with a telfon coated magnetic stirrer at 280 rpm in the reaction h2o2 30w sigma aldrich united states was controlled at 10 and 60 mgl 1 and bmaa dosages was controlled at 0 2 and 0 5 mgl 1 a uv light source execure 4000 d hoya japan was set to illuminate the reactor and the total uv irradiance was determined to be 57 4 w m 2 including uva uvb and uvc at a depth of 5 cm from the surface of the solution in the reactor using a spectrometer greenwave uvnb stellarnet corp united states equipped with a receptor cr2 stellarnet corp united states and an optical fiber f600 uv vis 2m stellarnet corp japan the spectrum for the uv irradiance was shown in fig s2 the ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 8 6 5 7 0 8 5 and 9 5 samples were taken at 10 30 50 70 90 120 150 and 180 mins for the analysis of bmaa and oh radical concentrations in the reactor rhodamine b rhb was chosen as the chemical probe to estimate the oh radical concentration in this study based on the kwon et al 2014 rhb can be regarded as the probe compound of oh radical and the reaction between rhb and oh radical can be expressed as the following equation kwon et al 2014 3 d c d t k o h r h b c o h ln c r h b c r h b 0 k o h r h b c o h t where c r h b and c r h b 0 are the concentrations of rhb at times t and t 0 respectively c o h is the oh radical concentration k o h r h b is the apparent rate constant of rhb decolorization reported as 3 75 0 15 109 m 1 s 1 kwon et al 2014 and t is the time of exposure to uv h2o2 rhb concentrations were determined using a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa at a wavelength of 554 nm experimental results indicated that h2o2 concentration remained unchanged through the experimental time under the conditions of this study fig s3 indicating that oh radical can be generated stably if the oh radical concentration is constant during the experimental period the rate constant between oh radical and bmaa can be obtained using eq 4 4 ln c b m a a c b m a a 0 k o h b m a a c o h t 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics of bmaa with chlorine under alkaline conditions and in natural water the ph effect was evaluated for ph values ranging from 5 8 to 9 5 for bmaa chlorination fig 1 shows the results of the bmaa and free chlorine competition experiments using 4 6 dichlororesorcinol dcr as the competitor for the chlorination of bmaa a second order kinetic rate was observed with the first order in chlorine and first order in bmaa where the rate constant denoted as k 1 was determined to be 8 78 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 5 1 29 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 0 1 85 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 5 with the coefficient of determination r2 being 0 95 for all experiments table 1 table s1 as shown in fig 1 and table 1 the rate constants of bmaa reacting with free chlorine conducted in di water were influenced by ph in both neutral and acidic conditions ph 5 7 larger rate constants were observed when the ph 7 but the variation was less significant a natural water sample from lt reservoir was tested and a smaller rate constant was obtained k 1 3 78 104 m 1 s 1 ph 8 5 indicating that the water matrix may influence the reaction rate because the organic matter in natural water may compete with the free chlorine in the reactor system gallard and von gunten 2002 rook 1977 the slower reaction rate in natural water may be linked to the presence of natural organic matter since chlorinated bmaa can be considered to be a group of chloramines it may autodecompose in water for which the reaction can be described by a pseudo first order reaction chen et al 2017 5 d c c h l o r i n a t e d b m a a d t k 2 c c h l o r i n a t e d b m a a according to the k 1 values listed in table 1 it was clear that bmaa rapidly reacts with chlorine to generate combined bmaa also recognized as chlorinated bmaa the chlorinated bmaa autodecomposition experiments were conducted under excess bmaa conditions as compared to those for chlorine all chlorine was consumed and formed chlorinated bmaa within a 5 min reaction time the concentration of combined bmaa was determined by adding a high dose reductant to convert it back to its original compound chen et al 2017 which could be quantified by lc ms ms the differences among the bmaa concentrations at different sampling times can be viewed as the degradation of chlorinated bmaa the concentration changes in the chlorinated bmaa were used to determine the chlorinated bmaa autodecomposition rate denoted as k 2 based on eq 5 the k 2 values did not vary obviously when the ph was higher than 7 fig 2 and table 2 k 2 0 0029 min 1 at ph 7 and 0 0023 min 1 at ph 9 however a 5 times higher rate constant 0 012 min 1 was obtained at ph 5 5 5 8 vikesland et al 2001 observed that the rates of monochloramine decay are dependent on ph the rate at ph 6 5 was ten times higher than that at ph 8 34 and was three times higher than that at ph 7 56 vikesland et al 2001 as in the current study mono chlorinated bmaa a form of organic monochloramines was the prevalent chlorinated bmaa in the current experimental system chen et al 2017 the ph dependency of k 2 varied similarly to that reported by vikesland et al 2001 in addition to autodecomposition chlorinated bmaa may further react with chlorine to generate oxidative products chen et al 2017 the reaction between bmaa and chlorine shown in eq 1 may also be adapted to describe the reaction between chlorinated bmaa and chlorine in the equation bmaa was replaced with chlorinated bmaa and k 1 was replaced with k 3 the excess free chlorine condition was conducted and bmaa was expected to be exhausted in a few minutes the rapidly formed chlorinated bmaa has been shown to continue to react with free chlorine chen et al 2017 therefore the data obtained after 5 min of spiking with excess amounts of chlorine were used for model fitting to yield k 3 it can be seen in fig 3 that the rates for further chlorination of chlorinated bmaa did not change significantly for all the tested conditions including in di water under different phs and in natural water all the experimental data could be fitted with one rate constant table 2 k 3 17 75 m 1s 1 and r2 0 96 based on the obtained k 1 and k 3 if the ct value was set at 150 mgl 1 min 90 of bmaa and its chlorinated intermediates were expected to be degraded the estimated ct values from usepa lechevallier and au 2004 for inactivation of giardia cysts with free chlorine are around 37 65 mgl 1 min to achieve a 3 log 99 9 reduction at ph 7 and 8 this indicated that if bmaa is present in the source water larger ct value for chlorination compared to that for giardia cysts is required to achieve 90 degradation 3 2 bmaa oxidation by kmno4 the degradation of bmaa by kmno4 was examined at various reactant concentrations kmno4 0 3 5 mg l bmaa 0 0 5 and 5 mg l and ph 5 5 7 and 8 5 cyanotoxins such as microcystin cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin a have been reported to be oxidized by permanganate as a second order reaction chen et al 2005 rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b however for bmaa the results showed that changes in the bmaa and permanganate concentrations had no obvious impacts on bmaa degradation less than 10 of bmaa and less than 5 of permanganate disappeared within 3 h fig 4 permanganate has been suggested to attack the conjugated double bond of the adda residue of microcystins pietsch et al 2002 the rate constants of microcystin oxidized by permanganate were 400 6 4 105 m 1 s 1 and that of cylindrospermopsin was 0 3 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 chen et al 2005 rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b however the rate constant of bmaa with permanganate was found to be 5 7 10 5 m 1s 1 in this study much smaller than the reaction of permanganate with microcystins and anatoxin a the high rate constants between permanganate and microcystins anatoxin a can be attributed to hydroxylation on their carbon carbon double bonds freeman and kappos 1985 wiberg and saegebarth 1957 because bmaa does not have carbon carbon double bonds fig s1 no hydroxylation can occur perez benito 2011 studied the oxidation kinetics of α amino acids under permanganation and observed slow reaction rates with the second order reaction rate constants of seven amino acids ranging from 1 10 8 m 1s 1 to 3 10 8 m 1s 1 perez benito 2011 bmaa also is a member of the amino acid family and therefore a slow reaction rate between bmaa and permanganate can be expected 3 3 ozonation of bmaa bmaa oxidation by ozone was fast and competition experiments using 4 chloroguaiacol as the competing agent were conducted to study the reaction kinetics at different phs 1 14 benitez et al 2000 ozone may decompose and generate oh radical in aqueous solutions typically at higher ph values although the decomposition ratio of ozone is less than 10 in 1 min at ph 8 5 von gunten 2003 to confirm the contribution of oh radicals to the degradation of bmaa during ozonation parallel experimental sets with and without addition of the oh radical scavenger 2 propanol were conducted shown as solid symbols in fig 5 the results showed that the reaction kinetics of bmaa during ozonation were identical for the cases with and without addition of 2 propanol for all the studied conditions including under different phs and in natural water this observation suggests that the amount of oh radicals generated in the current systems were not enough to significantly degrade bmaa and therefore the disappearance of bmaa in this system can be attributed completely to direct ozonation also as shown in fig 5 the second order models fit very well with all the experimental data r2 0 93 table s1 where the rate constants were found to increase with increasing ph summarized in table 1 the slowest rate constant was 1 88 106 m 1s 1 at ph 5 8 and the highest was 3 72 1010 m 1s 1 at ph 9 5 in di water onstad et al 2007 studied the apparent rate constant of cylindrospermopsin by ozonation and similar ph dependency where a higher ph led to a faster reaction in di water was reported onstad et al 2007 however the rate differences were not obvious for microcystin and anatoxin a in the common ph range for drinking water treatment ph 6 8 their rate constants for microcystin lr cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin a were between 6 4 104 and 4 1 105 m 1s 1 which were much smaller than bmaa suggesting that the structure of bmaa may be very receptive to ozone attack 3 4 reaction with hydrogen peroxide and oh radicals fig 6 illustrates the degradation of bmaa in the uv h2o2 system different h2o2 concentrations and phs were tested at a uv light intensity 57 4 w m 2 in all the scenarios two sets of control experiments one applied with only h2o2 and the other with only uv irradiation were conducted to evaluate the direct oxidation of bmaa by h2o2 and direct photolysis as shown in fig 6 the bmaa concentrations remained unchanged for all tested h2o2 dosages within 3 h of reaction time suggesting that the degradation of bmaa by h2o2 alone is slow similar results were also observed in the uv irradiation suggesting that direct photolysis of bmaa under the studied uv condition was not significant in the experiments the oh radical concentration was quantified using the chemical probe chemical rhb as indicted in the material and methods section the oh radicals produced were estimated to be at concentrations ranging from 5 3 10 14 to 1 1 10 13 m and 1 6 10 13 to 3 7 10 13 m for the cases of h2o2 dosages 10 mg l and 60 mg l respectively table s2 the data shown in fig 6 for the degradation of bmaa were modeled with first order reaction rate constants using eq 3 the oxidation of bmaa by oh radicals was very fast and all bmaa was exhausted within 120 min except for the reaction at ph 5 5 in di water the rate constants of bmaa oxidized by oh radical as summarized in table 2 were shown to be ph dependent with the highest rate constants 1 35 0 35 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 5 among all tested conditions onstad et al 2007 determined the rate constants for oh radicals and typical cyanotoxins to be microcystin lr cylindrospermopsin anatoxin roughly corresponding to the sizes of the molecules and the number of hydrogen molecules that can be abstracted by oh radicals onstad et al 2007 since the molecule size of bmaa is much smaller than those of the four cyanotoxins mentioned above the smaller rate constant with the oh radical observed for bmaa at ph 7 6 7 109 m 1 s 1 as compared to that for microcystin lr 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 was therefore expectable 3 5 ph dependency of bmaa oxidation the effects of ph on bmaa oxidation by chlorine ozone and oh radicals are summarized in fig 7 it can be seen that the rate constants of bmaa oxidation are highly relevant to the ph with different degrees among different oxidants suggesting that different mechanisms were involved in the oxidation processes the ph dependency of oh radicals and chlorine is similar where both exhibit lower rate constants at lower phs that increase dramatically at ph 6 7 bmaa includes a carboxylic group and a primary α and a secondary β amino groups to dissociate protons for which the corresponding pk values are 2 1 pk1 6 63 pkα and 9 76 pkβ diaz parga et al 2017 sundh et al 2007 as also depicted in fig 7 the major species of bmaa at ph 5 8 is the protonated form denoted as bmaa where the neutral form bmaa0 becomes dominant at ph 5 8 to 9 therefore it can be inferred that speciation of bmaa plays an important role in its oxidation by oh radicals and chlorine oxidation mechanisms of bmaa may be linked to amine oxidation as proposed previously according to weil and morris 1949 the observed rate for the nh3 hocl reaction is ph dependent due to changes in nh3 speciation at different phs they suggested the nucleophilic displacement and the formation of a cyclic transition state with a hydroxide involved will facilitate the electron shift from one hydrogen on the amine group to chlorine weil and morris 1949 at a lower ph the reactants i e the ammonium or the substituted ammonium ions had no free electron pairs for interacting with the chlorine which led to a lower reaction rate weil and morris 1949 however at higher ph values the reaction rate of the neutral form of ammonia has been shown to be much larger than its protonated form pryor et al 1984 weil and morris 1949 the slow reaction of protonated amines with ozone and the hydroxyl radical have also reported in a few other studies indicating that the nucleophilic attack is the critical reaction for oxidation of amine compounds in this study the rate constants increased significantly with the increasing trend of neutral bmaa indicating that the speciation of bmaa is a major factor for the ph dependency of bmaa chlorination although the speciation of chlorine i e hocl and ocl may possibly influence the reaction rate since the pka of chlorine is 7 6 suidan et al 1977 the slight increases in the rate constant from ph 7 to 9 implies that the electronic force between bmaa and hocl has a less significant impact on the reaction kinetics similar ph dependency with a slow reaction in low ph ranges was observed for bmaa oxidation with oh radicals the smallest rate constant was at ph 5 8 when bmaa was the dominant bmaa species the rate increased dramatically from ph 5 8 to 7 1 and went up slightly as the ph increased to 9 5 as indicated in table s2 the oh radical concentration did not change significantly for the studied phs so the oh radical concentration was not the major factor causing the changes in reaction rate at different phs similar to that for chlorine the oh radical exhibited less reactivity with bmaa as also reported in huang et al 2008 in which nh3 was more vulnerable to oxidation by the oh radical than nh4 in the aqueous phase taken together these results demonstrated that the ph dependency of bmaa oxidation by chlorine and the oh radical can be attributed to the availability of the free electron i e the lone pair on its structure the protonated form of bmaa greatly decreased its nucleophilicity leading to a lower reaction rate at ph 6 on the other hand the neutral form of bmaa exhibited a strong nucleophilic nature yielding a transition state to facilitate electron donation to the chlorine oh radical as also shown in fig 7 the effects of ph on the rate of ozonation of bmaa were quite different from those for bmaa with the chlorine and hydroxyl radical which were related to the speciation of bmaa the rate constant linearly increased with increasing ph values for the reaction of ozone and bmaa which was similar to that reported in pryor et al 1984 for free amine and ozone unlike the transition state mechanism for chlorine hydroxyl radical with bmaa no explicit electron was transferred between ozone and bmaa where an oxygen transfer from the ozone molecule to another compound should be expected beltrán 2003 it has been widely accepted that ozone reacts with oh and then yields a number of reactive secondary oxidants such as h o 2 and h o 2 hoigné 1998 therefore higher oh or higher ph may accelerate the reaction of ozone and form more reactive oxidants for bmaa according to the observations in this study the rate constant between ozone and bmaa was found to be linearly proportional to ph fig 7 r2 0 989 suggesting that the oh concentration plays a critical role in the reaction although the possibility that ozone may directly attack the lone pair of electrons on the bmaa amine group cannot be entirely ruled out based on the observations in this study the contribution of a direct attack by ozone to bmaa degradation is minor 3 6 the effects of natural water matrix to understand the effect of water matrix on bmaa oxidation natural water lt water the water quality data was shown in table s3 was used as in the bmaa oxidation experiments as the background water for which the results are also shown in tables 1 and 2 in the case of chlorination of bmaa the rate constant k 1 for bmaa disappearance increased with increasing ph values however the k 1 k 1 3 78 104 m 1 s 1 ph 8 5 for the lt water was found to be smaller compared to that at the ph 7 condition for di water 5 0 104 m 1 s 1 indicating that the water matrix may influence the reaction rate since the organic matter in natural water may compete with the free chlorine in the system gallard and von gunten 2002 rook 1977 a slower reaction rate is thus expected the autodecomposition rate constant k 2 for chlorinated bmaa in lt water 0 0027 min 1 was similar to that in di water in a similar ph range 0 0027 min 1 for ph 7 and 0 023 min 1 for ph 9 it was obvious that the autodecomposition rate of chlorinated bmaa was not significantly affected by the tested water matrix at the ph near neutral condition unlike k 1 no significant difference was observed for k 3 in natural water or in di water fig 3 the presence of organic matter thus had a limited impact on the chlorination of chlorinated bmaa the rate constant between ozone and bmaa was 2 82 109 m 1 s 1 in the lt natural water which was 22 smaller than that at the same ph in di water rositano et al 2001 studied the effect of nom on ozonation of algal toxins in water their results showed that more ozone doses were needed if a higher concentration of dissolved organic carbon was present in the water rositano et al 2001 our observation also suggested that higher nom concentrations in the lt water may slow down the reaction of ozone with cyanotoxins in the case of the reaction between bmaa and the oh radical the water matrix clearly had an influence the rate constant between the oh radical and bmaa observed for the lt water 6 88 1 25 109 m 1 s 1 was only about half of that for di water under similar ph conditions our observations were similar to the findings reported in lindsey and tarr 2000 lindsey and tarr 2000 in which nom in water was demonstrated to inhibit the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons by the oh radical because nom is commonly present in natural water the effectiveness of oxidants in natural water is typically reduced as compared to those in di water ho et al 2011 therefore the slower reaction rates between bmaa and the studied oxidants in lt natural water may be attributed to the presence of nom in the lt water 4 conclusions the reaction rates of bmaa with four oxidants commonly used in drinking water treatment were studied a second order reaction model was successfully employed to describe the reaction between bmaa and all the studied oxidants with rates of bmaa with oh radicals 1 1 108 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 for different phs and in natural water ozone 5 8 106 3 1 1010 m 1s 1 chlorine 2 1 103 1 2 105 m 1s 1 permanganate 5 7 10 5 m 1s 1 h2o2 slow direct photolysis slow the rate constants between bmaa and chlorine ozone and oh radicals were all found to be ph dependent the oxidation rates of bmaa with chlorine and h2o2 uv were the highest at neutral ph range and therefore no ph adjustment is needed if bmaa is to be treated however if ozonation is used for treating bmaa an alkaline ph is preferred as the rate is proportional to that of the oh concentration the water matrix is also important for the oxidation of bmaa compared with the experiments in di water a 22 50 rate reduction was observed for bmaa with chlorine ozone and the hydroxyl radical in the studied natural water for chlorination the most widely used practice in drinking water treatment plants bmaa and its chlorinated intermediates can be degraded by 90 if the ct value 150 mg l min in both di and natural water the rate constants obtained between bmaa and the four studied oxidants in this study may serve as a useful reference for water utilities to estimate removal efficiency once bmaa is present in their source water acknowledgements this research is supported by the taiwan ministry of science and technology
