16315,warming sea surface temperature has led to an increase in the prevalence of vibrio species in marine environments this can be observed particularly in temperate regions where conditions for their growth has become more favourable the increased prevalence of pathogenic vibrio species has resulted in a worldwide surge of vibriosis infections in human and aquatic animals this study uses sea surface temperature data around the english and welsh coastlines to identify locations where conditions for the presence and growth of vibrio species is favourable shellfish samples collected from three locations that were experiencing an increase in sea surface temperature were found to be positive for the presence of vibrio species we identified important aquaculture pathogens vibrio rotiferianus and vibrio jasicida from these sites that have not been reported in uk waters we also isolated human pathogenic vibrio species including v parahaemolyticus from these sites this paper reports the first isolation of v rotiferianus and v jasicida from uk shellfish and highlights a growing diversity of vibrio species inhabiting british waters keywords vibrio species vibrio jasicida vibrio rotiferianus vibrio parahaemolyticus shellfish sea surface temperature 1 introduction the aquaculture industry provides an increasing contribution to global food supplies however it is faced with challenges from a changing climate globalisation ecological constraints and human population changes both growth and food preference the uk shellfish industry is worth over 350 million annually uk sea fisheries statistics 2019 providing an important contribution to the uk aquaculture sector and economy the farming of molluscan shellfish in nearshore ecosystems accounts for a large portion of the shellfish industry molluscan shellfish are filter feeders i e they pass water across their gills filtering and selecting particles for consumption including algae and bacteria consequently pathogenic bacteria including vibrio species can accumulate to levels where the shellfish become unsafe to eat in the united states 76 of seafood associated infections between 1973 and 2006 were due to bacteria iwamoto et al 2010 in previous studies vibrio parahaemolyticus levels have been shown to be up to five times higher within crab tissues than in the surrounding water wagley et al 2009 indicating that in some ecological habitats vibrio species are extremely abundant within shellfish parveen et al 2008 wagley et al 2009 there is evidence that the increased global incidence of vibriosis any disease caused by a vibrio species is linked to climate change with altered patterns of bacterial survival in shellfish baker austin et al 2013 costello et al 2009 froelich and daines 2020 leddin and macrae 2020 lindgren et al 2012 martinez urtaza et al 2010 takemura et al 2014 consequently global increases in sea surface temperatures in nearshore ecosystems can drive the emergence of a range of vibrio species including pathogens of humans marine finfish shellfish and crustaceans in regions where this has not been previously seen baker austin et al 2013 froelich and daines 2020 lindgren et al 2012 takemura et al 2014 vibrio species can cause disease in shellfish in both aquaculture settings and the natural environment these vibrio species include v aestuarianus v crassostreae and v coralliilyticus which are responsible for the sharp decline of pacific oyster numbers crassostrea gigas resulting in serious socioeconomic losses in europe new zealand and australia european commission 2015 de lorgeril et al 2018 elston et al 2008 goudenege et al 2015 members of the v harveyi clade such as v campbelli and v rotiferianus can also cause disease in marine fish and shrimp european commission 2015 austin and zhang 2006 bruto et al 2017 de lorgeril et al 2018 elston et al 2008 goudenege et al 2015 travers et al 2015 the poleward spread of human pathogenic vibrio species such as v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus is concurrent with increasing global temperature and reduced sea surface salinity contributing to an increase in human disease burden globally baker austin et al 2010 2013 martinez urtaza et al 2010 outbreaks of vibriosis in humans have recently been reported in regions of the world previously considered to have temperate or cold climates including peru during its austral winter fuenzalida et al 2007 chile gonzalez escalona et al 2005 alaska mclaughlin et al 2005 denmark dalsgaard et al 1996 spain martinez urtaza et al 2005 2018 and pacific northwest usa martinez urtaza et al 2013 collectively these findings support the hypothesis that vibrio associated diseases are increasing and are influenced by the rise in global sea temperature there is a strong seasonal pattern related to temperature and abundance of vibrio species kokashvili et al 2015 vezzulli et al 2016 nearly all vibrio species can grow at temperatures between 13 and 22 c and where salinity ranges from 5 to 25 parts per thousand ppt kaspar and tamplin 1993 under these conditions most vibrio species will proliferate in shellfish and this coincides with elevated disease burden ansede bermejo et al 2010 joseph et al 1982 mclaughlin et al 2005 mead et al 1999 in the uk vibrio species are detected in domestically grown shellfish from may october with peak levels occurring at the end of august and the start of september ford et al 2020a powell et al 2013 wagley et al 2009 2008 in this study sea surface temperature data were analysed to identify the locations where vibrio species were most likely to be found around the english and welsh coastlines shellfish samples were then sourced from these areas and from a nearby region of cooler waters the prevalence of vibrio species in shellfish from chichester harbour osea island whitstable bay and lyme bay in the summer of 2018 was determined using culture based methods several strains isolated from these sites were genome sequenced in order to ascertain their taxonomy and investigate their genomics 2 results 2 1 sea surface temperature at different sites in england and wales sea surface temperature data from the global operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis ostia system donlon et al 2012 was used to study the sea surface temperature around england and wales indicated in figs 1 and 2 using data from 2015 to 2017 a map of the average number of days per year when the sea surface temperature is warmer than 18 c was produced fig 1a several regions in england and wales where commercial shellfisheries exist were analysed further figs 1 and 2 the time series sea surface temperature for these locations are in fig 2 and a map of location of these sites is shown in supplementary data 1 we identified chichester harbour whitstable bay and osea island as areas were sea surface temperatures were favourable for vibrio species presence lyme bay was identified as areas where sea surface temperature were lower and unfavourable for growth of vibrio species fig 2 shows the time series of daily sea surface temperature at these four locations between 2015 and 2018 as well as several other sites in britain and wales where commercial shellfisheries are based the sea surface temperature at whitstable bay osea island and chichester harbour during summer 2015 june august was around 18 c but peaked around 22 c in these areas in 2018 fig 2 in lyme bay the sea surface temperature remained stable peaking at around 18 c during the summer months during this four year period fig 2 the time series data plotted for whitstable bay osea island chichester harbour selsey thames estuary and cliff pools show that in 2015 the temperature occasionally exceeded 18 c fig 2 between 2016 and 2018 the sea surface temperature at these sites had exceeded 18 c and remained above this temperature for eight weeks or more consecutively although the observed the sea surface temperature has increased in the areas mentioned above over the four year period the sea surface temperature is variable around the coast of england and wales and there is natural variability from year to year 2 2 vibrio abundance peaks in july and august shellfish samples from osea island whitstable bay chichester harbour and lyme bay were examined from june october in 2018 and total vibrio species were recorded from plate counts of sucrose positive and negative colonies on thiosulphate citrate bile sucrose agar tcbs plates before a further enrichment step for depurated pacific oysters from whitstable bay the total numbers of vibrio species peaked in july to 603 cfu g fig 3 b table 1 for depurated pacific oysters from the osea island area the total numbers of vibrio species peaked in august at 2384 cfu g fig 3c non depurated blue mussels mytilus edulis from lyme bay where the sea surface temperature only briefly rose above 18 c fig 2 table 1 were also tested and found to be negative for vibrio species between june and september 2018 unless an enrichment step was first performed human pathogenic vibrio species such as v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were not identified from samples from osea island whitstable bay or lyme bay for non depurated european flat oysters ostrea edulis samples from chichester harbour the total number of vibrio species isolated in june when the temperature taken at site was an average of 16 17 c was 140 cfu g fig 3 and table 1 this increased to 3480 cfu g in shellfish taken in august 2018 when the average temperature at the site was 20 c fig 3 a seasonal relationship was seen between increasing temperature and the total number of vibrio species present in samples tested from chichester harbour for the five months of testing r value of 0 90 using spearman s rho correlation fig 3a v parahaemolyticus was present at low levels in shellfish sample taken in june sample exe 04 2018 20 cfu g and representative isolates were confirmed as v parahaemolyticus by pcr using the species marker toxr kim et al 1999 the representative isolates tested were all negative for the tdh and trh haemolysins known to be associated with virulence as determined by pcr for tdh and trh genes tada et al 1992 2 3 biochemical characteristics of sucrose negative strains one aim of this project was to measure the levels of the human pathogenic vibrio species v parahaemolyticus or v vulnificus in shellfish from whitstable bay osea island and chichester harbour sucrose negative colonies on tcbs were further identified as presumptive v parahaemolyticus or v vulnificus sucrose negative colonies were found in 10 of the 16 shellfish samples from whitstable bay n 2 osea island n 3 lyme bay n 0 and chichester harbour n 5 however only one sample exe 04 2018 from chichester harbour was positively identified further as v parahaemolyticus strain vp 04 2018 all other sucrose negative isolates were negative by pcr for v parahaemolyticus species marker toxr kim et al 1999 and tlh taniguchi et al 1985 and v vulnificus species marker vvha hill et al 1991 these sucrose negative isolates were gram negative oxidase positive positive for fermentation of glucose were not able to grow in 0 sodium chloride solution and grew well in solution containing 2 sodium chloride the results show that these isolates belong to the vibrionaceae family the sucrose negative colonies on tcbs agar fell broadly into three groups depending on the biochemical tests applied one group of isolates from the chichester harbour and whitstable bay samples exe 05 2018 exe 09 2018 exe 10 2018 and exe 13 2018 were positive for the production of indole from tryptophan and positive for the fermentation amygdalin glycoside table 2 these isolates were designated as group a another group of sucrose negative colonies were designated group b and were negative for indole production and negative for the fermentation of amygdalin group b isolates came from samples collected from chichester harbour and osea island finally group c included two isolates exe 05 2018 and exe 10 2018 that were positively identified as photobacterium species with a 99 8 api identification 2 4 whole genome sequencing analysis identifies v rotiferianus and v jasicida present in shellfish samples whole genome sequencing was carried out on 14 of the isolates collected exe 04 2018 thought to be v parahaemolyticus five representative vibrio isolates from group a six representative vibrio isolates from group b table 2 and one representative photobacterium isolate from group c initial mlsa results confirmed exe 04 2018 as v parahaemolyticus witherall et al 2019 and indicated that group a and group b isolates fell into the v harveyi clade grouping with v rotiferianus group a and v jasicida group b to confirm the identify of group a and group b to species level average nucleotide identity ani was calculated between these strains and publicly available vibrio strains supplementary data 2 fig 4 a the highest ani was observed between the isolates of group a and v rotiferianus b64d1 97 and secondly with group b and v jasicida 090810c 97 both of which are above the hypothesised species delineation threshold value of 95 richter and rossello mora 2009 the mlsa and ani analyses confirm that isolates sequenced in group a were v rotiferianus while isolates sequenced in group b were v jasicida fig 5 a shows circular genome maps comparing the assemblies of each sequenced v rotiferianus stains in group a aligned against that of v rotiferianus b64d1 genbank accession number cp018311 1 while fig 5b shows a circular genome map comparing assemblies of each sequenced v jasicida stain in group b aligned against that of v jasicida 090810c genbank accession number gca 002887615 1 these alignments both agree with the mlsa and ani results they show there is a high level of similarity between the strains from this study and the relevant reference strains used however these data do show that there is genomic variation within the v rotiferianus clade and similarly within the v jasicida clade overall v rotiferianus was found in four of the 16 samples tested and was isolated from two locations tested in the uk in 2018 chichester harbour and osea island vibrio jasicida was found in eight out of the 16 samples tested in this study and were also isolated from two locations in the uk in 2018 chichester harbour and whitstable bay table 1 biochemically the only way to distinguish between v rotiferianus and v jasicida isolates was on the production of indole from tryptophan and the fermentation amygdalin glycoside v rotiferianus positive and v jasicida negative the growth of v rotiferianus and v jasicida was tested at 30 c in marine broth and compared to growth of v parahaemolyticus strains to determine and characteristic growth phenotypes the v parahaemolyticus strain 05 2018 grew at similar rates to reference rimd2210633 fig 6 compared to the vibrio strains tested the growth of photobacterium damsela in marine broth was slower fig 6 2 5 pathogenic potential of v parahaemolyticus previous work has shown that the insect infection model galleria mellonella can be used to assess the virulence of v parahaemolyticus strains wagley et al 2017 and could distinguish clinical toxigenic strains from non toxigenic strains from the environment the v parahaemolyticus strain rimd 22 106 333 a typical and well referenced clinical tdh positive reference strain was compared with the v parahaemolyticus strain vp 05 2018 isolated from sample exe 04 2018 strain vp 04 2018 was negative for both tdh and trh haemolysin genes both rimd 2 210 633 and vp 04 2018 caused lethal infections at a dose of 106 cfu per larvae fig 7 the ld50 for rimd2210633 was 10 000 cfu per larvae while the ld50 dose for exe 04 2018 was 1000 cfu per larvae when the experiment was carried out at 37 c indicating that vp 04 2018 was more virulent than the reference strain even without the presence of known virulence genes tdh and trh needed for human infection 2 6 pathogenic potential of v rotiferianus v jasicida and ph damsela environmental strains ph damsela pb 05 2018 v jasicida vj 05 2018 and v rotiferianus vr 05 2018 were injected into g mellonella at a dose of 106 cfu per larvae the results are shown in fig 7 strain ph damsela pb 05 2018 showed 50 survival while v jasicida vj 05 2018 and v rotiferianus vr 05 2018 showed 70 and 60 survival respectively at 106 cfu per larvae at a higher dose of 107 cfu per larvae vj 05 2018 and vr 05 2018 showed 40 survival after 48 h data not shown 3 discussion one of the potential consequences of climate change will be changed patterns of parasite and microbial disease in aquaculture settings one concern is the potential for an increased incidence of vibriosis diseases caused by vibrio species vibriosis caused by some species such as v parahaemolyticus can occur in humans causing gastroenteritis originating from raw or undercooked seafood vibriosis is also one of the main bacterial diseases of larvae and juvenile bivalves affecting the early development stages of shellfish growth the presence of vibrio species and their growth is dependant on the water temperature of the environment thus an increase in sea surface temperatures could lead to increased bacterial growth leading to more disease in this study sea surface temperature data were assessed in several nearshore ecosystems in english and welsh waters that accommodate uk shellfisheries fig 2 and supplementary data 1 in several areas an increase in peak summer sea surface temperature from 18 c to 22 was recorded over this four year period furthermore for some of these shellfish harvesting areas the sea surface temperature remained above 18 c for up to eight consecutive weeks fluctuations at shellfish sites cannot be ruled out when comparing to sea surface temperatures of wider regions however temperature increases for prolonged periods could alter habitats and change the distribution of bacterial species within them vibrio species are predominantly found in locations where the temperatures are above 18 c a temperature that is suitable for their growth and proliferation increased sea surface temperatures in nearshore ecosystems in the uk could allow for favourable growth conditions that support the growth of vibrio species research carried out in the uk has mainly focussed on the presence of human pathogenic vibrio species such as v parahaemolyticus in the uk marine environment these have been readily detected in some nearshore ecosystems since 2001 baker austin et al 2010 ford et al 2020b martinez urtaza et al 2013 powell et al 2013 wagley et al 2009 2008 thus it is unsurprising that v parahaemolyticus was detected in samples from chichester harbour when the temperature was suitable for bacterial growth however why v parahaemolyticus was not detected in later months when sea surface temperature continued to be suitable for growth suggests that other factors such as competition from other vibrio species and environmental abiotic factors in the community play a vital role in v parahaemolyticus establishment efforts to use temperature and salinity data alone to predict the occurrence of pathogenic vibrio species in an ecosystem have not always been reliable indicators of vibrio emergence mclaughlin et al 2005 in some disease outbreaks vibrio species have appeared in shellfish where waters were less than 18 c indicating that simplistic environmental conditions alone are not reliable indicators of disease prediction mclaughlin et al 2005 conversely in this study increasing temperatures in nearshore ecosystems did not necessarily drive the occurrence of v parahaemolyticus in the shellfish thus further research is required to combine key environmental biological and molecular factors to ascertain the drivers behind the seasonal occurrence of v parahaemolyticus in the natural environment during this study our focus was on detecting the main human pathogens such as v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus however during shellfish testing v alginolyticus was also detected in nearly all shellfish samples and can be considered part of normal marine flora xie et al 2005 it should be noted that v alginolyticus can increase health risk for consumers baker austin et al 2018 reilly et al 2011 and further studies need to be conducted to ascertain whether v alginolyticus strains from the uk are a risk to consumers and recreational users of waterways where v alginolyitcus are widely present this study shows that members of the v harveyi clade are also present in nearshore ecosystems in the uk and that vibrio species may play a role in both human and shellfish associated diseases the core of the v harveyi clade is made up of v harveyi itself and closely related species including v alginolyticus v azureus v mytili v natriegens v campbellii v parahaemolyticus v owensii v jascinda v sagamiensis and v rotiferianus the members of v harveyi clade share a high degree of genetic and phenotypic similarity which can often lead to the misidentification of species within this clade gomez gil et al 2004 lin et al 2010 sawabe et al 2007 the analysis of shellfish samples from the uk in the summer of 2018 identified the presence of v parahaemolyticus v jasicida and v rotiferianus in three shellfish sites around the uk to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to identify and report v rotiferianus and v jasicida presence in shellfish harvesting areas in england previous testing of shellfish prior to 2008 for the presence of vibrio species in uk sites did not detect the presence of v rotiferianus and v jasicida in uk shellfisheries wagley et al 2008 v rotiferianus was first described by gomez gil and co workers in 2003 isolated from the rotifer brachionus plicatilis gomez gil et al 2003 this species was described as growing yellow sucrose positive colonies on tcbs agar and was positive for the production of indole in this study v rotiferianus strains isolated were positive for indole production but grew as sucrose negative green colonies on tcbs agar indicating that these strains are biochemically different from those first described in the literature v jasicida first described in 2012 has been recovered from marine invertebrates and vertebrates including atlantic salmon and flounder yoshizawa et al 2012 in this study we examined the pathogenic potential of the v jasicida and v rotiferianus in an insect infection model using g mellonella larvae this model has been shown to be a useful for studying human pathogenic vibrio species as well as aquaculture vibrio and non vibrio species djainal et al 2020 mcmillan et al 2015 the data here indicate that the strains of v jasicida and v rotiferianus tested are able to cause infection and mortality in g mellonella and this model could be used in the future to further investigate the virulence of these aquaculture pathogens members of the v harveyii clade are a major concern for sustainability of the aquaculture industry king et al 2019 vezzulli et al 2010 wendling et al 2014 thus it is vital to understand the epidemiological significance of these new emerging vibrio species before any associated disease burden becomes a problem in aquaculture settings using a one health aquaculture approach is needed to understand the decline in native oysters at chichester harbour chichester harbour is home to the native oysters ostrea edulis and once supported a substantial fishery but stocks of native oysters have declined significantly over the last 20 years helmer et al 2019 globally 85 of all oyster beds and reefs have been lost and across europe and england up to 95 of native oyster reefs have been extirpated airoldi and beck 2007 beck et al 2011 this trend has been reflected in the solent once home to one of europe s largest native oyster fisheries with seabed densities of 32m2 supporting 450 commercial vessels in the 1980 s key and davidson 1981 native oyster stocks have since declined suffering a population crash in 2007 from which they have not recovered and remain severely depleted in many harbours including chichester harbour a long term study found numbers of o edulis within chichester harbour had decreased by 96 between 1998 and 2017 helmer et al 2019 sussex inshore fisheries and conservation authority ifca has been conducting annual stock assessments catch per unit effort cpue estimates for the oysters in chichester harbour since 2013 in the main fishery area emsworth channel the cpue decreased from 50 kg h 1 min dredge width in 2013 to 22 kg h 1 min in 2017 in 2018 the cpue dropped to 3 9 kg h 1 min and the fishery was closed cpue remained low in 2019 1 4 kg h 1 min and the fishery has remained closed the continued low cpue levels indicates a lack of continued oyster recruitment in chichester harbour and efforts to restore the populations of native oysters have been unsuccessful in recent years several reports of the implications of vibrio species acting as a potential disease causing agent involved in oyster mortality have been published king et al 2019 waechter et al 2002 wendling et al 2014 but in the majority of records no clear aetiological agent can be identified garnier et al 2007 in this study the presence of vibrio species such as v jasicida and v rotiferianus belonging to the v harveyi clade is reported and this may play a role in oyster disease in this area further contributions to disease in oysters may be attributed to abiotic factors such as temperature nutrient concentrations and salinity as well as host oyster genetic backgrounds that make them sensitive to disease de lorgeril et al 2018 lang et al 2010 malham et al 2009 samain et al 2007 the low levels of oyster recruitment in chichester harbour may also be due to the level of harvesting exceeding the reproductive capacity of the species as well as the presence of the invasive slipper limpet crepidula fornicate that can outcompete o edulis larvae leading to a dominance of c fornicata in the solent preston et al 2020 leakage of partially treated sewage into chichester harbour between 2010 and 2015 may also have contributed to the low levels of oyster recruitment in the harbour which needs to be further investigated environment agency v southern water services ltd 2021 all er d 62 aug furthermore oysters are typically populated with multiple bacterial and viral species in vivo infection studies to find the causative agents of oyster mortality do not consider the complexity in the natural environment or how microorganisms interact with each other to cause host disease bivalve larvae can naturally exhibit a high mortality during their transition to a juvenile state whether the vibrio strains isolated in this study are responsible for bivalve larvae death in chichester harbour requires more investigation metagenomic time series studies targeting the microbiome of oysters and the surrounding environments coupled with a survey of environmental abiotic factors and host susceptibility such as those conducted by king and co workers to study the mortality events in the pacific oyster in australia king et al 2019 are needed in this area to identify causes of oyster mortality events to understand why native oysters populations have declined in chichester harbour it is thus important to use a one health approach stentiford et al 2020 this approach examines all hazards that may contribute to water quality and the health of the oysters if aquaculture is going to thrive again in chichester harbour these hazards may include chemicals such as naturally occurring biotoxins and partially treated sewage leaks entering the harbour as well as the presence of increasing numbers and species of animal and human pathogens 4 conclusion this study assessed the presence of culturable bacterial species in shellfish from multiple sites around england and found them to be populated with multiple vibrio and non vibrio species a number of factors could explain the increasing amount of vibrio species now present in temperate regions including the uk marine and estuarine environments firstly favourable growth conditions for vibrio species such as increasing sea surface temperatures and heavy rainfall events during the summer which can bring the water salinity down to optimum are currently present in some areas around the uk baker austin et al 2018 2013 secondly globalisation and the importing of more seafood from regions that have a higher incidence of vibrio species in the environment may favour the introduction of a variety of species into our waters connected to this is the increase in shipping and the release of ship ballast water that has been shown to be a transport vector for vibrio species drake et al 2007 mimura et al 2005 rivera et al 2012 ruiz et al 2000 if ballast water is contaminated with vibrio species and is discharged into harbours and coastal waterways then this could lead to the introduction and establishment of new pathogenic and non pathogenic vibrio species into the environment finally the improvement of detection methods of vibrio species from water and shellfish in the uk has improved vastly over the past 15 years and in the advent of cheaper and faster genome sequencing scientists are able to sequence strains that we previously may have overlooked consequentially the conditions that favour the growth and establishment of vibrio species as a seasonal human and aquaculture pathogen in temperate regions is a public health concern and should be monitored in the environment 5 methods and materials 5 1 shellfish collection and bacterial isolation bacterial strains used in this study are shown in table 1 v parahaemolyticus strains were initially cultured aerobically onto selective media thiosulphate citrate bile sucrose tcbs agar oxoid at 37 c for 24 h for enumeration of colony counts routine sub culturing and growth marine agar conda labs spain was used and incubated at 30 c for 24 h for shellfish testing non depurated samples were sought initially from all sites but could only be obtained from chichester harbour and lyme bay while commercially depurated shellfish were obtained from osea island and whitstable bay in the five months of june to october 2018 a total of five shellfish samples were tested for the presence of vibrio species from chichester harbour shellfish were supplied as part of ongoing research programmes and were received confidentially directly from harvesting areas samples comprised of non depurated o edulis and were held between 4 and 8 c during transit and on arrival in the laboratory were placed in the fridge until analysis further commercially available shellfish samples that had been harvested from osea island and whitstable bay and non depurated m edulis from lyme bay were also obtained and tested for the presence of vibrio species samples were tested in duplicate and the average of both experiments was used to calculate the total vibrio species count all raw shellfish samples were analysed within 24 h of collection and according to iso 21 872 1 with minor modifications a total of 25 g of shellfish meat taken from a minimum of eight animals was disrupted using a stomacher before the addition of 225 ml of alkaline salt peptone water aspw oxoid ltd basingstoke hampshire uk sequential log dilutions of stomached shellfish meat were carried out in apsw to a maximum of 10 1 and 100 µl was spread onto the surface of tcbs plates to determine direct enumeration of vibrio species total vibrio species were recorded from plate counts of sucrose positive and negative colonies on thiosulphate citrate bile sucrose agar tcbs plates before a further enrichment step all samples were then incubated at 41 c for 6 h for an enrichment step after which a 5 µl loopful was taken from directly below the surface of the broth and streaked onto tcbs plates all tcbs plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h typical sucrose negative green colonies were subcultured onto marine agar conda labs spain and incubated at 30 c for 24 h presumptive colonies were identified as v parahaemolyticus if they met the following criteria positive for oxidase negative for voges proskauer and ortho nitrophenyl β d galactopyranoside no growth in 0 nacl and no acid from sucrose further identification by api 20e strips biomerieux was also carried out on sucrose negative colonies all biochemically identified v parahaemolyticus strains were further analysed by pcr amplification using the species target toxr kim et al 1999 all sucrose negative colonies that were also negative for v parahaemolyticus pcr tests were checked for v vulnificus identification using pcr amplification using the species target vvh hill et al 1991 5 2 genome sequencing assembly and annotation thirteen unidentified strains and one v parahaemolyticus strain table 1 were genome sequenced bacterial cells were harvested and genomic dna was extracted using wizard genomic dna purification kit promega library preparation was carried out by exeter dna sequencing service in brief dna was concentrated using generead kit lot no 145 025 210 and end repair and adenylation of fragments was carried using nextflex rapid dnaseq kit 5144 02 according to manufactures instructions purification and concentration of pcr amplified library was carried out according to generead kit instructions genome wide sequence data 150 bp paired end was generated using an illumina novaseq raw sequencing reads were screened for contamination and quality filtered using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 sequencing metrics were generated using fastqc wingett and andrews 2018 this filtered dataset was then assembled de novo using spades v3 15 1 bankevich et al 2012 de novo assemblies were assessed for completeness using busco seppey et al 2019 supplementary data 3 and annotated using prokka seemann 2014 assembly metrics were generated using the quast gurevich et al 2013 5 3 multi locus sequence analysis mlsa multi locus sequence analysis mlsa was conducted on all sequenced strains and a panel of reference strains downloaded from the ncbi genomes database feb 2021 the mlsa was conducted using six conserved housekeeping genes efp glna gyrb metg purm pnta the sequences of these genes were extracted from the genome annotations for each strain and concatenated the concatenated mlsa sequences were aligned using muscle edgar 2004 and phylogenetic analysis was conducted using mega 10 kumar et al 2016 maximum likelihood trees were generated using the general time reversible model and 100 bootstrap replicates were performed photobacterium species were initially used as the outgroup to root the tree 5 4 evolutionary analysis by maximum likelihood method the evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method and general time reversible model nei and kumar 2000 the tree with the highest log likelihood 291 299 34 is shown in fig 4a

depth several meters down where there are no variations on the sub daily timescale and hence can be treated as a daily mean value the data is from the operational sea surface temperatures and sea ice analysis ostia which is used to provide the sea surface temperature in met office global weather forecasts the sea temperature dataset is produced by combining observations from satellite and buoys and filling gaps between these observations in a physically consistent manner the time series plotted in fig 2 were extracted for the locations nearest to the sample collections sites supplementary data 1 however since the sea surface temperature data are available on a 0 05 0 05 latitude longitude grid corresponding to roughly a 5 km x 5 km spatial average the nearest location may be a couple of kilometres away from the sampling site additionally they are more likely to be representative of the offshore sea surface temperature than the temperature within a sheltered harbour despite these caveats the ostia data can be used as a guide of where sea surface temperatures are likely to be suitable for the presence of vibrio species during 2018 the sea surface temperature plots were updated

16315,warming sea surface temperature has led to an increase in the prevalence of vibrio species in marine environments this can be observed particularly in temperate regions where conditions for their growth has become more favourable the increased prevalence of pathogenic vibrio species has resulted in a worldwide surge of vibriosis infections in human and aquatic animals this study uses sea surface temperature data around the english and welsh coastlines to identify locations where conditions for the presence and growth of vibrio species is favourable shellfish samples collected from three locations that were experiencing an increase in sea surface temperature were found to be positive for the presence of vibrio species we identified important aquaculture pathogens vibrio rotiferianus and vibrio jasicida from these sites that have not been reported in uk waters we also isolated human pathogenic vibrio species including v parahaemolyticus from these sites this paper reports the first isolation of v rotiferianus and v jasicida from uk shellfish and highlights a growing diversity of vibrio species inhabiting british waters keywords vibrio species vibrio jasicida vibrio rotiferianus vibrio parahaemolyticus shellfish sea surface temperature 1 introduction the aquaculture industry provides an increasing contribution to global food supplies however it is faced with challenges from a changing climate globalisation ecological constraints and human population changes both growth and food preference the uk shellfish industry is worth over 350 million annually uk sea fisheries statistics 2019 providing an important contribution to the uk aquaculture sector and economy the farming of molluscan shellfish in nearshore ecosystems accounts for a large portion of the shellfish industry molluscan shellfish are filter feeders i e they pass water across their gills filtering and selecting particles for consumption including algae and bacteria consequently pathogenic bacteria including vibrio species can accumulate to levels where the shellfish become unsafe to eat in the united states 76 of seafood associated infections between 1973 and 2006 were due to bacteria iwamoto et al 2010 in previous studies vibrio parahaemolyticus levels have been shown to be up to five times higher within crab tissues than in the surrounding water wagley et al 2009 indicating that in some ecological habitats vibrio species are extremely abundant within shellfish parveen et al 2008 wagley et al 2009 there is evidence that the increased global incidence of vibriosis any disease caused by a vibrio species is linked to climate change with altered patterns of bacterial survival in shellfish baker austin et al 2013 costello et al 2009 froelich and daines 2020 leddin and macrae 2020 lindgren et al 2012 martinez urtaza et al 2010 takemura et al 2014 consequently global increases in sea surface temperatures in nearshore ecosystems can drive the emergence of a range of vibrio species including pathogens of humans marine finfish shellfish and crustaceans in regions where this has not been previously seen baker austin et al 2013 froelich and daines 2020 lindgren et al 2012 takemura et al 2014 vibrio species can cause disease in shellfish in both aquaculture settings and the natural environment these vibrio species include v aestuarianus v

species such as v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus is concurrent with increasing global temperature and reduced sea surface salinity contributing to an increase in human disease burden globally baker

pacific northwest usa martinez urtaza et al 2013 collectively these findings support the hypothesis that vibrio associated diseases are increasing and are influenced by the rise in global sea temperature there is a strong seasonal pattern related to temperature and abundance of vibrio species kokashvili et al 2015 vezzulli et al 2016 nearly all vibrio species can grow at temperatures between 13 and 22 c and where salinity ranges from 5 to 25 parts per thousand ppt kaspar and tamplin 1993 under these conditions most vibrio species will proliferate in shellfish and this coincides with elevated disease burden ansede bermejo et al 2010 joseph et al 1982 mclaughlin et al 2005 mead et al 1999 in the uk vibrio species are detected in domestically grown shellfish from may october with peak levels occurring at the end of august and the start of september ford et al 2020a powell et al 2013 wagley et al 2009 2008 in this study sea surface temperature data were analysed to identify the locations where vibrio species were most likely to be found around the english and welsh coastlines shellfish samples were then sourced from these areas and from a nearby region of cooler waters the prevalence of vibrio species in shellfish from chichester harbour osea island whitstable bay and lyme bay in the summer of 2018 was determined using culture based methods several strains isolated from these sites were genome sequenced in order to ascertain their taxonomy and investigate their genomics 2 results 2 1 sea surface temperature at different sites in england and wales sea surface temperature data from the global operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis ostia system donlon et al 2012 was used to study the sea surface temperature around england and wales indicated in figs 1 and 2 using data from 2015 to 2017 a map of the average number of days per year when the sea surface temperature is warmer than 18 c was produced fig 1a several regions in england and wales where commercial shellfisheries exist were analysed further figs 1 and 2 the time series sea surface temperature for these locations are in fig 2 and a map of location of these sites is shown in supplementary data 1 we identified chichester harbour whitstable bay and osea island as areas were sea surface temperatures were favourable for vibrio species presence lyme bay was identified as areas where sea surface temperature were lower and unfavourable for growth of vibrio species fig 2 shows the time series of daily sea surface temperature at these four locations between 2015 and 2018 as well as several other sites in britain and wales where commercial shellfisheries are based the sea surface temperature at whitstable bay osea island and chichester harbour during summer 2015 june august was around 18 c but peaked around 22 c in these areas in 2018 fig 2 in lyme bay the sea surface temperature remained stable peaking at around 18 c during the summer months during this four year period fig 2 the time series data plotted for whitstable bay osea island chichester harbour selsey thames estuary and cliff pools show that in 2015 the temperature occasionally exceeded 18 c fig 2 between 2016 and 2018 the sea surface temperature at these sites had exceeded 18 c and remained above this temperature for eight weeks or more consecutively although the observed the sea surface temperature has increased in the areas mentioned above over the four year period the sea surface temperature is variable around the coast of england and wales and there is natural variability from year to year 2 2 vibrio abundance peaks in july and august shellfish samples from osea island whitstable bay chichester harbour and lyme bay were examined from june october in 2018 and total vibrio species were recorded from plate counts of sucrose positive and negative colonies on thiosulphate citrate bile sucrose agar tcbs plates before a further enrichment step for depurated pacific oysters from whitstable bay the total numbers of vibrio species peaked in july to 603 cfu g fig 3 b table 1 for depurated pacific oysters from the osea island area the total numbers of vibrio species peaked in august at 2384 cfu g fig 3c non depurated blue mussels mytilus edulis from lyme bay where the sea surface temperature only briefly rose above 18 c fig 2 table 1 were also tested and found to be negative for vibrio species between june and september 2018 unless an enrichment step was first performed human pathogenic vibrio species such as v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus were not identified from samples from osea island whitstable bay or lyme bay for non depurated european flat oysters ostrea edulis samples from chichester harbour the total number of vibrio species isolated in june when the temperature taken at site was an average of 16 17 c was 140 cfu g fig 3 and table 1 this increased to 3480 cfu g in shellfish taken in august 2018 when the average temperature at the site was 20 c fig 3 a seasonal relationship was seen between increasing temperature and the total number of vibrio species present in samples tested from chichester harbour for the five months of testing r value of 0 90 using spearman s rho correlation fig 3a v parahaemolyticus was present at low levels in shellfish sample taken in june sample exe 04 2018 20 cfu g and representative isolates were confirmed as v parahaemolyticus by pcr using the species marker toxr kim et al 1999 the representative isolates tested were all negative for the tdh and trh haemolysins known to be associated with virulence as determined by pcr for tdh and trh genes tada et al 1992 2 3 biochemical characteristics of sucrose negative strains one aim of this project was to measure the levels of the human pathogenic vibrio species v parahaemolyticus or v vulnificus in shellfish from whitstable bay osea island and chichester harbour sucrose negative colonies on tcbs were further identified as presumptive v parahaemolyticus or v vulnificus sucrose negative colonies were found in 10 of the 16 shellfish samples from whitstable bay n 2 osea island n 3 lyme bay n 0 and chichester harbour n 5 however only one sample exe 04 2018 from chichester harbour was positively identified further as v parahaemolyticus strain vp 04 2018 all other sucrose negative isolates were negative by pcr for v parahaemolyticus species marker toxr kim et al 1999 and tlh taniguchi et al 1985 and v vulnificus species marker vvha hill et al 1991 these sucrose negative isolates were gram negative oxidase positive positive for fermentation of glucose were not able to grow in 0 sodium chloride solution and grew well in solution containing 2 sodium chloride the results show that these isolates belong to the vibrionaceae family the sucrose negative colonies on tcbs agar fell broadly into three groups depending on the biochemical tests applied one group of isolates from the chichester harbour and whitstable bay samples exe 05 2018 exe 09 2018 exe 10 2018 and exe 13 2018 were positive for the production of indole from tryptophan and positive for the fermentation amygdalin glycoside table 2 these isolates were designated as group a another group of sucrose negative colonies were designated group b and were negative for indole production and negative for the fermentation of amygdalin group b isolates came from samples collected from chichester harbour and osea island finally group c included two isolates exe 05 2018 and exe 10 2018 that were positively identified as photobacterium species with a 99 8 api identification 2 4 whole genome sequencing analysis identifies v rotiferianus and v jasicida present in shellfish samples whole genome sequencing was carried out on 14 of the isolates collected exe 04 2018 thought to be v parahaemolyticus five representative vibrio isolates from group a six representative vibrio isolates from group b table 2 and one representative photobacterium isolate from group c initial mlsa results confirmed exe 04 2018 as v parahaemolyticus witherall et al 2019 and indicated that group a and group b isolates fell into the v harveyi clade grouping with v rotiferianus group a and v jasicida group b to confirm the identify of group a and group b to species level average nucleotide identity ani was calculated between these strains and publicly available vibrio strains supplementary data 2 fig 4 a the highest ani was observed between the isolates of group a and v rotiferianus b64d1 97 and secondly with group b and v jasicida 090810c 97 both of which are above the hypothesised species delineation threshold value of 95 richter and rossello mora 2009 the mlsa and ani analyses confirm that isolates sequenced in group a were v rotiferianus while isolates sequenced in group b were v jasicida fig 5 a shows circular genome maps comparing the assemblies of each sequenced v rotiferianus stains in group a aligned against that of v rotiferianus b64d1 genbank accession number cp018311 1 while fig 5b shows a circular genome map comparing assemblies of each sequenced v jasicida stain in group b aligned against that of v jasicida 090810c genbank accession number gca 002887615 1 these alignments both agree with the mlsa and ani results they show there is a high level of similarity between the strains from this study and the relevant reference strains used however these data do show that there is genomic variation within the v rotiferianus clade and similarly within the v jasicida clade overall v rotiferianus was found in four of the 16 samples tested and was isolated from two locations tested in the uk in 2018 chichester harbour and osea island vibrio jasicida was found in eight out of the 16 samples tested in this study and were also isolated from two locations in the uk in 2018 chichester harbour and whitstable bay table 1 biochemically the only way to distinguish between v rotiferianus and v jasicida isolates was on the production of indole from tryptophan and the fermentation amygdalin glycoside v rotiferianus positive and v jasicida negative the growth of v rotiferianus and v jasicida was tested at 30 c in marine broth and compared to growth of v parahaemolyticus strains to determine and characteristic growth phenotypes the v parahaemolyticus strain 05 2018 grew at similar rates to reference rimd2210633 fig 6 compared to the vibrio strains tested the growth of photobacterium damsela in marine broth was slower fig 6 2 5 pathogenic potential of v parahaemolyticus previous work has shown that the insect infection model galleria mellonella can be used to assess the virulence of v parahaemolyticus strains wagley et al 2017 and could distinguish clinical toxigenic strains from non toxigenic strains from the environment the v parahaemolyticus strain rimd 22 106 333 a typical and well referenced clinical tdh positive reference strain was compared with the v parahaemolyticus strain vp 05 2018 isolated from sample exe 04 2018 strain vp 04 2018 was negative for both tdh and trh haemolysin genes both rimd 2 210 633 and vp 04 2018 caused lethal infections at a dose of 106 cfu per larvae fig 7 the ld50 for rimd2210633 was 10 000 cfu per larvae while the ld50 dose for exe 04 2018 was 1000 cfu per larvae when the experiment was carried out at 37 c indicating that vp 04 2018 was more virulent than the reference strain even without the presence of known virulence genes tdh and trh needed for human infection 2 6 pathogenic potential of v rotiferianus v jasicida and ph damsela environmental strains ph damsela pb 05 2018 v jasicida vj 05 2018 and v rotiferianus vr 05 2018 were injected into g mellonella at a dose of 106 cfu per larvae the results are shown in fig 7 strain ph damsela pb 05 2018 showed 50 survival while v jasicida vj 05 2018 and v rotiferianus vr 05 2018 showed 70 and 60 survival respectively at 106 cfu per larvae at a higher dose of 107 cfu per larvae vj 05 2018 and vr 05 2018 showed 40 survival after 48 h data not shown 3 discussion one of the potential consequences of climate change will be changed patterns of parasite and microbial disease in aquaculture settings one concern is the potential for an increased incidence of vibriosis diseases caused by vibrio species vibriosis caused by some species such as v parahaemolyticus can occur in humans causing gastroenteritis originating from raw or undercooked seafood vibriosis is also one of the main bacterial diseases of larvae and juvenile bivalves affecting the early development stages of shellfish growth the presence of vibrio species and their growth is dependant on the water temperature of the environment thus an increase in sea surface temperatures could lead to increased bacterial growth leading to more disease in this study sea surface temperature data were assessed in several nearshore ecosystems in english and welsh waters that accommodate uk shellfisheries fig 2 and supplementary data 1 in several areas an increase in peak summer sea surface temperature from 18 c to 22 was recorded over this four year period furthermore for some of these shellfish harvesting areas the sea surface temperature remained above 18 c for up to eight consecutive weeks fluctuations at shellfish sites cannot be ruled out when comparing to sea surface temperatures of wider regions however temperature increases for prolonged periods could alter habitats and change the distribution of bacterial species within them vibrio species are predominantly found in locations where the temperatures are above 18 c a temperature that is suitable for their growth and proliferation increased sea surface temperatures in nearshore ecosystems in the uk could allow for favourable growth conditions that support the growth of vibrio species research carried out in the uk has mainly focussed on the presence of human pathogenic vibrio species such as v parahaemolyticus in the uk marine environment these have been readily detected in some nearshore ecosystems since 2001 baker austin et al 2010 ford et al 2020b martinez urtaza et al 2013 powell et al 2013 wagley et al 2009 2008 thus it is unsurprising that v parahaemolyticus was detected in samples from chichester harbour when the temperature was suitable for bacterial growth however why v parahaemolyticus was not detected in later months when sea surface temperature continued to be suitable for growth suggests that other factors such as competition from other vibrio species and environmental abiotic factors in the community play a vital role in v parahaemolyticus establishment efforts to use temperature and salinity data alone to predict the occurrence of pathogenic vibrio species in an ecosystem have not always been reliable indicators of vibrio emergence mclaughlin et al 2005 in some disease outbreaks vibrio species have appeared in shellfish where waters were less than 18 c indicating that simplistic environmental conditions alone are not reliable indicators of disease prediction mclaughlin et al 2005 conversely in this study increasing temperatures in nearshore ecosystems did not necessarily drive the occurrence of v parahaemolyticus in the shellfish thus further research is required to combine key environmental biological and molecular factors to ascertain the drivers behind the seasonal occurrence of v parahaemolyticus in the natural environment during this study our focus was on detecting the main human pathogens such as v parahaemolyticus and v vulnificus however during shellfish testing v alginolyticus was also detected in nearly all shellfish samples and can be considered part of normal marine flora xie et al 2005 it should be noted that v alginolyticus can increase health risk for consumers baker austin et al 2018 reilly et al 2011 and further studies need to be conducted to ascertain whether v alginolyticus strains from the uk are a risk to consumers and recreational users of waterways where v alginolyitcus are widely present this study shows that members of the v harveyi clade are also present in nearshore ecosystems in the uk and that vibrio species may play a role in both human and shellfish associated diseases the core of the v harveyi clade is made up of v harveyi itself and closely related species including v alginolyticus v azureus v mytili v natriegens v campbellii v parahaemolyticus v owensii v jascinda v sagamiensis and v rotiferianus the members of v harveyi clade share a high degree of genetic and phenotypic similarity which can often lead to the misidentification of species within this clade gomez gil et al 2004 lin et al 2010 sawabe et al 2007 the analysis of shellfish samples from the uk in the summer of 2018 identified the presence of v parahaemolyticus v jasicida and v rotiferianus in three shellfish sites around the uk to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to identify and report v rotiferianus and v jasicida presence in shellfish harvesting areas in england previous testing of shellfish prior to 2008 for the presence of vibrio species in uk sites did not detect the presence of v rotiferianus and v jasicida in uk shellfisheries wagley et al 2008 v rotiferianus was first described by gomez gil and co workers in 2003 isolated from the rotifer brachionus plicatilis gomez gil et al 2003 this species was described as growing yellow sucrose positive colonies on tcbs agar and was positive for the production of indole in this study v rotiferianus strains isolated were positive for indole production but grew as sucrose negative green colonies on tcbs agar indicating that these strains are biochemically different from those first described in the literature v jasicida first described in 2012 has been recovered from marine invertebrates and vertebrates including atlantic salmon and flounder yoshizawa et al 2012 in this study we examined the pathogenic potential of the v jasicida and v rotiferianus in an insect infection model using g mellonella larvae this model has been shown to be a useful for studying human pathogenic vibrio species as well as aquaculture vibrio and non vibrio species djainal et al 2020 mcmillan et al 2015 the data here indicate that the strains of v jasicida and v rotiferianus tested are able to cause infection and mortality in g mellonella and this model could be used in the future to further investigate the virulence of these aquaculture pathogens members of the v harveyii clade are a major concern for sustainability of the aquaculture industry king et al 2019 vezzulli et al 2010 wendling et al 2014 thus it is vital to understand the epidemiological significance of these new emerging vibrio species before any associated disease burden becomes a problem in aquaculture settings using a one health aquaculture approach is needed to understand the decline in native oysters at chichester harbour chichester harbour is home to the native oysters ostrea edulis and once supported a substantial fishery but stocks of native oysters have declined significantly over the last 20 years helmer et al 2019 globally 85 of all oyster beds and reefs have been lost and across europe and england up to 95 of native oyster reefs have been extirpated airoldi and beck 2007 beck et al 2011 this trend has been reflected in the solent once home to one of europe s largest native oyster fisheries with seabed densities of 32m2 supporting 450 commercial vessels in the 1980 s key and davidson 1981 native oyster stocks have since declined suffering a population crash in 2007 from which they have not recovered and remain severely depleted in many harbours including chichester harbour a long term study found numbers of o edulis within chichester harbour had decreased by 96 between 1998 and 2017 helmer et al 2019 sussex inshore fisheries and conservation authority ifca has been conducting annual stock assessments catch per unit effort cpue estimates for the oysters in chichester harbour since 2013 in the main fishery area emsworth channel the cpue decreased from 50 kg h 1 min dredge width in 2013 to 22 kg h 1 min in 2017 in 2018 the cpue dropped to 3 9 kg h 1 min and the fishery was closed cpue remained low in 2019 1 4 kg h 1 min and the fishery has remained closed the continued low cpue levels indicates a lack of continued oyster recruitment in chichester harbour and efforts to restore the populations of native oysters have been unsuccessful in recent years several reports of the implications of vibrio species acting as a potential disease causing agent involved in oyster mortality have been published king et al 2019 waechter et al 2002 wendling et al 2014 but in the majority of records no clear aetiological agent can be identified garnier et al 2007 in this study the presence of vibrio species such as v jasicida and v rotiferianus belonging to the v harveyi clade is reported and this may play a role in oyster disease in this area further contributions to disease in oysters may be attributed to abiotic factors such as temperature nutrient concentrations and salinity as well as host oyster genetic backgrounds that make them sensitive to disease de lorgeril et al 2018 lang et al 2010 malham et al 2009 samain et al 2007 the low levels of oyster recruitment in chichester harbour may also be due to the level of harvesting exceeding the reproductive capacity of the species as well as the presence of the invasive slipper limpet crepidula fornicate that can outcompete o edulis larvae leading to a dominance of c fornicata in the solent preston et al 2020 leakage of partially treated sewage into chichester harbour between 2010 and 2015 may also have contributed to the low levels of oyster recruitment in the harbour which needs to be further investigated environment agency v southern water services ltd 2021 all er d 62 aug furthermore oysters are typically populated with multiple bacterial and viral species in vivo infection studies to find the causative agents of oyster mortality do not consider the complexity in the natural environment or how microorganisms interact with each other to cause host disease bivalve larvae can naturally exhibit a high mortality during their transition to a juvenile state whether the vibrio strains isolated in this study are responsible for bivalve larvae death in chichester harbour requires more investigation metagenomic time series studies targeting the microbiome of oysters and the surrounding environments coupled with a survey of environmental abiotic factors and host susceptibility such as those conducted by king and co workers to study the mortality events in the pacific oyster in australia king et al 2019 are needed in this area to identify causes of oyster mortality events to understand why native oysters populations have declined in chichester harbour it is thus important to use a one health approach stentiford et al 2020 this approach examines all hazards that may contribute to water quality and the health of the oysters if aquaculture is going to thrive again in chichester harbour these hazards may include chemicals such as naturally occurring biotoxins and partially treated sewage leaks entering the harbour as well as the presence of increasing numbers and species of animal and human pathogens 4 conclusion this study assessed the presence of culturable bacterial species in shellfish from multiple sites around england and found them to be populated with multiple vibrio and non vibrio species a number of factors could explain the increasing amount of vibrio species now present in temperate regions including the uk marine and estuarine environments firstly favourable growth conditions for vibrio species such as increasing sea surface temperatures and heavy rainfall events during the summer which can bring the water salinity down to optimum are currently present in some areas around the uk baker austin et al 2018 2013 secondly globalisation and the importing of more seafood from regions that have a higher incidence of vibrio species in the environment may favour the introduction of a variety of species into our waters connected to this is the increase in shipping and the release of ship ballast water that has been shown to be a transport vector for vibrio species drake et al 2007 mimura et al 2005 rivera et al 2012 ruiz et al 2000 if ballast water is contaminated with vibrio species and is discharged into harbours and coastal waterways then this could lead to the introduction and establishment of new pathogenic and non pathogenic vibrio species into the environment finally the improvement of detection methods of vibrio species from water and shellfish in the uk has improved vastly over the past 15 years and in the advent of cheaper and faster genome sequencing scientists are able to sequence strains that we previously may have overlooked consequentially the conditions that favour the growth and establishment of vibrio species as a seasonal human and aquaculture pathogen in temperate regions is a public health concern and should be monitored in the environment 5 methods and materials 5 1 shellfish collection and bacterial isolation bacterial strains used in this study are shown in table 1 v parahaemolyticus strains were initially cultured aerobically onto selective media thiosulphate citrate bile sucrose tcbs agar oxoid at 37 c for 24 h for enumeration of colony counts routine sub culturing and growth marine agar conda labs spain was used and incubated at 30 c for 24 h for shellfish testing non depurated samples were sought initially from all sites but could only be obtained from chichester harbour and lyme bay while commercially depurated shellfish were obtained from osea island and whitstable bay in the five months of june to october 2018 a total of five shellfish samples were tested for the presence of vibrio species from chichester harbour shellfish were supplied as part of ongoing research programmes and were received confidentially directly from harvesting areas samples comprised of non depurated o edulis and were held between 4 and 8 c during transit and on arrival in the laboratory were placed in the fridge until analysis further commercially available shellfish samples that had been harvested from osea

16316,with the speedy evolution of global climate change and water shortage there is a growing need for the energy and carbon neutral wastewater reclamation technology to tackle this challenge an innovative anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr biochar adsorption ro process was developed for reclaiming municipal wastewater to high grade product water with the aims for achieving the energy and carbon neutrality it was found that about 95 6 of influent cod was removed by anmbr with direct generation of biomethane while ammonium n in anmbr permeate was fully recovered through biochar adsorption the effluent from biochar adsorber with significantly lowered divalent ions concentrations was further reclaimed by ro at reduced cost and energy consumption the energy demand and the total carbon emissions in the proposed process were estimated to be 0 50 kwh m3 and 633 g co2e m3 against 0 86 kwh m3 and 1101 g co2e m3 in the current conventional activated sludge cas microfiltration ro process it was further shown that the ammonium recovery via biochar adsorption could offset about 0 503 kwh m3 that was originally utilized for chemically producing recovered ammonia by the haber bosch method equivalent to a carbon offsetting of 498 g co2e m3 leading to a net carbon emission of 135 co2e m3 in the proposed process which was only about 12 of that in the current cas mf ro process these suggested that a carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation might be achievable through concurrent carbon reduction and offsetting while carbon offsetting via ammonia recovery appeared to be a game changer towards the carbon neutral operation consequently it is expected that this study can shed lights on how energy and carbon neutrality would be achieved by innovating municipal wastewater reclamation technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic mbr biochar adsorption reverse osmosis municipal wastewater reclamation energy and resource recovery carbon neutrality 1 introduction the world s population has been projected to hit 9 7 billion by 2050 and more than 25 of population will live in regions exposed to extreme water shortages vakilifard et al 2018 this implies that there is an urgent need to exploit emerging untraditional water sources for sustaining future water supply it has been widely accepted that municipal wastewater instead of a simple waste should be regarded as an emerging while regenerative water resource for producing high grade product water however the current municipal wastewater reclamation technologies suffer from high energy demand generation of excessive waste sludge carbon emissions large footprint and no resource recovery zhang and liu 2022 2020 zhang et al 2019 in singapore the combined activated sludge microfiltration ultrafiltration reverse osmosis ro and uv disinfection process has been applied for reclamation of municipal wastewater to the high grade product water knowns as newater it had been reported that the energy consumption for newater production was in the range of 0 7 1 2 kwh m3 vincent et al 2014 equivalent to an energy associated indirect carbon emission of 693 1188 g co2e m3 wastewater with a factor of 0 99 kg co2e kwh of electricity produced from the combustion of coal https www eia gov tools faqs faq php id 74 t 11 moreover most of ammonium in municipal wastewater was biologically converted to the nitrogen gas together with high energy and chemicals consumptions for example in the conventional nitrification denitrification process about 2 6 6 2 kwh of energy should be needed for removing one kilogram of ammonium n cruz et al 2019 on the other hand it should also be realized that a portion of ammonium could be oxidized to n2o during biological nitrogen removal bnr which has been known as a potent greenhouse gas he et al 2020 these seem to imply that the current municipal wastewater reclamation process is not favourable for the energy and carbon neutrality obviously innovative technology is strongly needed for realizing the synergetic water reclamation energy and resource recovery with minimized carbon emissions ammonium fertilizer has been playing a vital role in sustaining the global agricultural productivity ye et al 2018 so far bnr via different biochemical pathways e g nitrification denitrification partial nitritation denitritation autotrophic anaerobic ammonia oxidation etc has been commonly practiced in municipal wastewater treatment however these bnr processes have been developed on the basis of biological oxidation reduction by which most of wastewater ammonium is ultimately transformed to nitrogen gas making ammonium recovery impossible zhang and liu 2021 zhang et al 2019 these in turn challenge the environmental sustainability and economic viability of the current bnr processes on the other hand almost all ammonium products originate from ammonia chemically synthesized through a highly energy intensive haber bosch reaction bonmatı and flotats 2003 erisman et al 2008 indicating a hidden environmental and economic cost in wastewater ammonium it has been believed that ammonium recovery is to game change the landscape of future municipal wastewater treatment which indeed is aligned with the concept and practice of circular economy adsorption with a simple process configuration has showed the potential and feasibility for ammonium removal and recovery han et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 so far many different types of adsorbents e g zeolite ion exchange resin modified materials etc have been reported for ammonium removal from wastewater han et al 2020 however the post regeneration and processing with intensive usages of chemicals and energy e g sodium chloride acids alkaline etc are needed for ammonium recovery resulting in a substantial production of waste chemical solutions making the recovery of ammonium through adsorption technically unfeasible environmentally unfriendly and economically inviable zhang and liu 2021 therefore there is an urgent need to explore an innovative engineering solution for concurrent wastewater reclamation and ammonium recovery without chemical regeneration biochar derived from pyrolysis of a wide spectrum of biomasses has been shown to be an excellent soil amendment that can improve the soil fertility and agricultural productivity while providing protection against soil borne diseases alhashimi and aktas 2017 e g 139 268 of growth enhancements for lettuce and 111 241 for cabbage were achieved with the applications of biochar carter et al 2013 on the other hand biochar had also been explored for adsorption of ammonium zhang and liu 2021 thus it is reasonable to consider that biochar after adsorption of ammonium should be directly deployed as an ammonium loaded soil ameliorant for agricultural applications without the needs for further regeneration and processing making the whole process nearly chemical free and more environmentally sustainable in addition it should also be noted that such direct application of ammonium loaded biochar is helpful for promoting carbon sequestration by the mean of carbon capture and storage in biochar shen et al 2020 facing to the situation described above this study aimed to developing an innovative integrated anaerobic fixed film mbr biochar adsorption ro process for concurrent wastewater reclamation and enhanced energy and resource recovery carbon neutral in this process might be achievable through carbon reduction and offsetting this process for the first time innovatively integrated anmbr for enhancing energy recovery biochar adsorption for environmentally friendly recovery of ammonium and ultimate water reclamation by ro in holistic manner meanwhile the energy and carbon emission analysis were also performed which showed a great possibility of realizing the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation it is expected that this study could open a new horizon about the way towards energy and carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation 2 materials and methods 2 1 process design and operation an integrated anmbr biochar adsorber ro process was developed in this study fig 1 the anmbr with a working volume of 5 l was operated at a hydraulic retention time of 6 4 h and the temperature of 30 1 c and the anaerobic biofilms were cultivated on bio ropes in the anmbr a side stream polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane with a pore size of 0 02 μm creflux china was adopted running in a 9 min on and 1 min off mode with biogas scouring for membrane fouling control and the membrane permeate flux was controlled at 10 l m2 h the composition of municipal wastewater used consisted of 400 mg cod l 45 mg l nh4 n 5 mg l po4 3 p 500 mg l nahco3 45 mg l cacl2 2h2o 20 mg l mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l feso4 7h2o and trace elements more details of anmbr operation could be found in gu et al 2019 a biochar column with the dimensions of 1 6 cm in diameter and 21 cm in length was packed with modified biochar and operated at different empty bed contact times ebct of 10 to 20 min the influent was introduced from the top of biochar column and flowed downward a ro unit with an effective membrane surface area of 33 34 cm2 bw espa2 nitto denko usa was run at a pressure of 10 bar and the crossflow velocity of the ro unit was maintained at 0 10 m s 2 2 modification and characterization of biochar the biochar derived from natural wood waste green back singapore was sieved to 1 0 1 4 mm in size then washed with distilled water and ethanol the prepared biochar was first activated with 4 m of nitric acid hno3 60 sigma aldrich at an impregnation ratio weight volume of 1 5 for 12 h at 40 rpm afterwards the biochar was rinsed with deionized water followed by soaking in 0 3 m of sodium hydroxide naoh sigma aldrich at an impregnation ratio of 1 20 weight volume for 12 h lastly the collected biochar was washed with deionized water till a solution ph of 8 9 and then dried at 105 c for 24 h the physicochemical properties and adsorption performance of modified biochar were summarized in the supplementary materials s1 and table s1 in this study the

analytical methods total organic carbon toc reflecting organic concentration was measured by a toc tn analyzer shimadzu japan and nh4 n and po4 3 p were quantified according to standard methods apha

an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer optima 8300 usa the concentrations of chloride and sulfate were determined by an ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 sunnyvale ca usa the morphology and energy dispersive spectrum eds of ro membranes were characterized for determination of the elemental compositions of foulants on ro membrane surfaces using a scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7600 f microscope japan with ro membrane sputter coated by a thin layer of gold 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anmbr biochar adsorber in the integrated process illustrated in fig 1 the anmbr was primarily designed for direct cod capture with the aims to maximize biogas generation while minimizing waste sludge production the anmbr was steadily operated for about two years it was observed that about 95 6 of influent cod was removed in the steady state anmbr with 76 8 of the cod converted to methane in anmbr nearly no removal of ammonium was achieved while the dynamic changes of the cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in the anmbr could be found in gu et al 2019 the observed biomass yield in the anmbr was found to be as low as 0 03 g vss g cod which was much lower than that observed in activated sludge i e 0 3 0 5 g vss g cod liu et al 2020b leading to a significant reduction in the waste sludge production in the proposed integrated process a total of 105 6 l of methane was produced from one cubic meter of wastewater treated with 34 2 of produced methane was in the dissolved form anaerobic biofilms were cultivated on bio ropes in the anmbr thus the suspended solids concentration in the reactor was determined to be 10 39 1 19 mg l with the on and off operation mode and biogas sparging the membrane fouling rate was found to be very low in the first 5 days i e dtmp dt 0 037 kpa h afterwards the tmp was gradually increased to 0 30 bar after 10 4 day operation gu et al 2019 a simulated effluent prepared according to a blended effluent from the steady state anmbr with averaged concentrations of major substances was used for subsequent biochar adsorption with the aim to investigate the effect of major cations on the performance of ro unit in fact simulated anaerobic effluent has been commonly used in various investigations chen et al 2021 iddya et al 2020 fig 2 showed the performances of the biochar adsorber at different ebcts as can be seen almost all influent nh4 n could be removed by biochar in 50 to 300 min from the perspective of recovery more ammonium retained via biochar adsorption is preferable the actual adsorption capacities of biochar determined from fig 2 were found to be 3 63 4 99 and 5 89 mg nh4 n g at the ebcts of 10 to 20 min which were lower than the adsorption capacity calculated from the langmuir isotherm fig s1 likely due to the co adsorption of divalent cations in the anmbr permeate e g ca2 mg2 etc table 1 it can be seen in table 1 that the divalent cations e g calcium magnesium iron etc in the anmbr permeate were significantly removed by biochar through adsorption for example the calcium magnesium and iron concentrations were reduced from 8 92 mg l to 0 16 mg l 1 53 mg l to 0 0039 mg l and 0 3 mg l to 0 0084 mg l respectively these suggested that the biochar adsorber in the proposed integrated process could serve two fold purposes i e ammonium recovery and removal of divalent cations as such the chance for the divalent cations to form inorganic colloidal particles or precipitates on ro membrane surface should be substantially reduced while greatly helping to mitigate membrane fouling in the subsequent ro operation fig 1 in fact it had been shown that divalent ions had a higher inorganic fouling potential to ro membranes mo et al 2008 yin et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 3 2 performance of ro unit table 1 showed that the toc concentration in the ro permeate decreased to 0 28 0 01 mg l while the ammonium and phosphate in the ro permeate were not detectable such permeate quality could meet the singapore s typical newater standards in terms of toc and major ions table 1 obviously this high grade product water is suitable for direct industrial and indirect portable uses https www pub gov sg watersupply waterquality newater fig 3 a further illustrated the respective flux profiles of the ro unit fed with the anmbr permeate and the effluent from the biochar adsorber for the ro unit receiving the effluent from the biochar adsorber no fouling was observed in the first 30 min as compared to that fed with the anmbr permeate followed by a slower fouling development according to fig 3a the linear fouling rate of ro fed with the anmbr permeate was determined to be 2 82 lmh h that was 3 3 fold higher than that in the case with the biochar adsorber effluent i e 0 86 lmh h as both anmbr permeate and effluent from the biochar adsorber had a similar toc concentration the fouling propensities observed in fig 3a could be reasonably attributed to different divalent cations concentrations in the two feed waters as shown in table 1 for example the total divalent cation concentration in the anmbr permeate was 0 59 meq l against 0 0086 meq l in the effluent from the biochar adsorber suggesting that inorganic scaling was a main cause of the ro fouling observed with the anmbr permeate sem and eds were used to determine the elemental compositions of the foulants on the ro membrane surfaces as can be seen in figs 3b 3d more inorganic crystal like substances were found on the ro membrane fed with the anmbr permeate and such observations were consistent with the fouling profile in fig 3a in addition it appears from table 2 and fig s2 that the fraction of ca2 in the foulants on the ro membrane surfaces fed with the anmbr permeate was 13 times higher than that in the ro fed with the effluent from the biochar adsorber while a similar trend was also observed for phosphate moreover the iron content in the foulants on the surfaces of ro membrane fed with the anmbr permeate was as high as 2 9 but the iron on the ro membrane fed with the effluent of the biochar adsorber was not detectable in fact the elemental compositions of the foulants table 2 clearly suggested that inorganic fouling was dominant over organic fouling in the ro unit according to the fe ca and p contents in the foulants table 2 the crystal like yellowish brown substances observed on the ro membrane surfaces might be attributed to ferrous phosphate and hydroxyapatite hap which had been known as the major inorganic foulants on ro membranes zheng et al 2018 in this study the ph in the biochar effluent was found to be around 7 6 in fact it had been reported that highly insoluble hap was the predominant foulant at a neutral or alkaline ph chesters 2009 in addition the cost associated with fouling control accounted for about 24 of the total operation cost in ro systems jafari et al 2021 while the energy consumption could be reduced by around 16 6 in ro with pre removal of major ions in feed water through reverse electrodialysis tufa et al 2019 consequently the biochar adsorber in the proposed integrated process fig 1 was not only meant for ammonium recovery but was also helpful for the control of ro fouling leading to lowered overall ro operation cost i e one stone killing two birds 4 engineering implications 4 1 energy demand and recovery in the current newater production process denoted as cas mf ro fig 4 a the energy consumption in the activated sludge unit with anaerobic digestion ad had been reported to be 0 45 kwh m3 on average cao 2011 on the other hand the respective energy consumptions of microfiltration mf and ro determined to be 0 13 kwh m3 and 0 396 kwh m3 of wastewater treated with 75 recovery rate liu et al 2020a for municipal wastewater with an influent cod concentration of 400 mg l and a cod removal efficiency of 90 the waste activated sludge generated in the cas mf ro process fig 4a could be roughly calculated to be 400 mg cod l 90 0 40 g vss g cod 144 g vss m3 of wastewater treated with an average sludge growth yield of 0 40 g vss g cod the biochemical methane potential of activated sludge had been reported to be 0 19 to 0 24 nm3 kg vss i e 0 21 to 0 27 m3 kg vss at 30 c which were averaged at 0 24 m3 kg vss bachmann et al 2015 thus the methane produced through ad of waste activated sludge could be calculated to be 144 g vss m3 0 24 m3 ch4 kg vss 0 0346 m3 ch4 m3 wastewater treated however the fugitive loss of methane given by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc generally varies in between 0 and 10 of the produced methane from facility to facility and an average value of about 3 was adopted in previous study by møller et al 2009 as such the potentially recoverable electrical energy from ad of waste sludge was estimated to be 0 0346 m3 ch4 m3 1 0 03 37 8 mj m3 ch4 35 3 6 mj kwh 0 12 kwh m3 assuming that methane has an energy content of 37 8 mj m3 based on the averaged heating value with a heat to electricity conversion efficiency of 35 mccarty et al 2011 smyth et al 2010 thus the total energy consumption in the cas mf ro process for newater production fig 4a could be determined to be 0 45 kwh m3 cas 0 13 kwh m3 mf 0 396 kwh m3 ro 0 12 kwh m3 energy recovered from ad 0 86 kwh m3 wastewater treated the energy utilization in the anmbr equipped with biogas sparging for membrane fouling control was reported to be about 0 41 kwh m3 on average shin and bae 2018 as the observed sludge yield in the anmbr was less than 10 of that in the activated sludge process the energy consumption associated with sludge handling as well as the energy potentially recovered from ad of waste sludge in the anmbr biochar ro process would be negligible in the anmbr wastewater cod was directly captured for methane production while the dissolved methane in its effluent was detected to be averaged at 29 mg l approximately 90 of the dissolved methane i e 32 5 l m3 could be recoverable with the assistance of a methane recovery degasser at an energy cost of 0 12 kwh m3 gu et al 2017 as the result a total of 102 l ch4 m3 could be collected with a residual dissolved methane of about 2 9 mg l being eventually emitted into the atmosphere therefore the recoverable energy from the anmbr could reach 0 102 m3 ch4 m3 1 0 03 37 8 mj m3 methane 35 3 6 mj kwh 0 36 kwh m3 wastewater treated indicating that the energy recovery efficiency in the anmbr was 3 times of that obtained through ad of waste sludge in the cas mf ro process i e 0 12 kwh m3 these clearly showed that direct cod capture from municipal wastewater was more energy efficient than the energy harvesting through ad of waste sludge in the current cas mf ro process for the biochar adsorber the energy was mainly consumed by the influent pump in this study the influent was introduced into the biochar adsorber from the top and flowed downwards in this case it is reasonable to consider that the associated energy usage could be negligible on the other hand it should be noted that the energy consumption of the ro unit in the proposed process could be reduced by approximately 16 6 with pre removal of major ions tufa et al 2019 thus the net energy demand in the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b was determined to be 0 41 kwh m3 anmbr 0 396 1 0 166 kwh m3 ro 0 12 kwh m3 dissolved methane recovery 0 36 kwh m3 energy recovered from methane 0 50 kwh m3 of wastewater treated which was about 42 lower than that in the current cas mf ro process fig 4a making the reclamation of municipal wastewater more energy efficient 4 2 greenhouse gas emissions in the current cas mf ro process fig 4a the direct ghg emissions primarily resulted from carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane as reported by cao et al 2013 about 52 9 of wastewater cod was oxidized to co2 with the rest being converted to biomass in the cas process it should be noted that municipal wastewater may contain fossil organic carbon and biogenic organic carbon according to the ipcc guidelines degradation of biogenic organic carbon in a municipal wastewater plant would not result in significant lasting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ipcc 2006 as such the biogenic co2 from wastewater treatment is not required to be included in the ghg inventory towards global climate change on the other hand it had been reported that approximately 10 of organic carbon in municipal wastewater was of non biogenic origin de haas et al 2009 2014 møller et al 2009 therefore the direct non biogenic co2 emission due to aerobic oxidation of influent cod was determined to be 400 g cod m3 10 52 9 44 32 29 1 g co2 m3 wastewater treated according to the recommendation by ipcc 2019 a default emission factor of 0 016 mg n2on released mg tn removed was adopted in this study to determine the n2o emission in the cas process with 60 of tn removal cao et al 2013 i e 0 016 mg n2on mg tn 45 mg tn l 60 44 28 0 68 mg n2o l equivalent to 0 68 298 203 g co2e m3 wastewater treated given the global warming potential of n2o being 298 fold of co2 referring to a time framework of 100 years climate carbon feedbacks https www epa gov ghgemissions understanding global warming potentials learn 20why it should be noted that the generation of n2o in a wwtp in fact is strongly related to the removal efficiency of tn as for the ch4 emission from the ad unit in wwtp it has been agreed that ch4 emissions are likely to be close to zero if technical standards for biogas plants could ensure that unintentional ch4 emissions are flared møller et al 2009 in the cas mf ro process fig 4a produced methane was used for energy recovery with unused biogas being flared hsien et al 2019 these imply that only 3 of fugitive loss of methane should be counted towards the carbon emission i e 0 0346 m3 ch4 m3 3 637 g m3 density of methane at 30 c 28 18 5 g co2e m3 given the global warming potential of ch4 being 28 fold of co2 referring to a time framework of 100 years climate carbon feedbacks therefore the direct ghg emissions from the current cas mf ro process fig 4a was determined to be 29 1 g co2 m3 non biogenic co2 from cas 203 g co2e m3 n2o 18 5 g co2e m3 fugitive loss methane during ad 250 g co2e m3 wastewater treated it should also be realized that the electricity supply in most wwtps still relies on fossil fuels leading to the indirect co2 emission with a factor of 0 99 kg co2e kwh produced from the combustion of fossil coal useia 2020 with these the indirect co2 emission in the current cas mbr ro process fig 4a was calculated to be 0 86 kwh m3 0 99 kg co2e kwh 851 g co2e m3 therefore the total ghg emissions from the current cas mbr ro process could reach 1101 g co2e m3 wastewater treated also it is worth noting that the indirect carbon emission was the major carbon source which was more than three times of the direct carbon emission implying that the energy neutrality is essential towards the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation in this study biogenic carbon emission was not counted in as recommended by ipcc however it has been generally agreeable that any carbon currently sequestered is helpful for reducing the peak carbon dioxide concentration in atmosphere and it is a matter of time scale biotechnology industry organization 2010 biogenic carbon in municipal wastewater treatment plant can be degraded within hours much faster than its natural decomposition over a time scale of years this in turn suggests that decomposition of wastewater biogenic carbon could inevitably lead to an increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide if biogenic carbon is not rapidly renewable through a natural cycle it is apparent that municipal wastewater treatment plants could transfer biogenic carbon in municipal wastewater from the slow domain with a longer turnover time to the fast domain with a shorter turnover time in the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b the ratio of gaseous co2 to ch4 was found to be 0 2 implying that the direct non biogenic co2 emission from the anmbr could be determined to be 102 32 5 l ch4 m3 0 2 1 75 kg m3 density of co2 at 30 c 10 2 4 g co2e m3 on the other hand it should be realized that the n2o emission was negligible in the proposed anmbr biochar ro process just because biological nitrogen removal was not engaged at all the carbon emissions associated to fugitive loss of methane was further estimated to be 102 l ch4 m3 3 637 g m3 density of methane at 30 c 28 54 6 g co2e m3 in addition as discussed above after harvesting of dissolved methane the residual dissolved methane concentration of 2 9 g m3 led to a potential carbon emission of 81 2 g co2e m3 thus the direct ghg emissions from the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b was determined to be 138 g co2e m3 wastewater treated while the indirect co2 emission associated to the energy consumption in the proposed process could be determined to be 0 50 kwh m3 990 g co2e kwh 495 g co2e m3 wastewater treated thus the total ghg emissions from the proposed anmbr biochar ro process was estimated to be 633 g co2e m3 wastewater treated which was only about 57 5 of that emitted from the current cas mbr ro process fig 4a suggesting a step further close to carbon neutral reclamation of municipal wastewater to high grade product water similar to the situation in the current cas mbr ro process it was observed again that the indirect carbon emission was about 3 6 times higher than the direct carbon emissions in the anmbr biochar ro process it should also be noted that the carbon emissions and energy consumption discussed above were primarily derived from this study and the related information available in the literature and obviously they deserve a further study in a more holistic manner as shown above the indirect carbon emission primarily resulted from the electrical energy consumed during municipal wastewater reclamation obviously the energy neutrality is the prerequisite for the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation almost all ammonium in municipal wastewater could be recovered via biochar adsorption fig 2 the biochar loaded with ammonium in fact can be directly deployed as an ammonium rich solid fertilizer as well as a soil ameliorant for increasing agricultural productivity because the porous structure of biochar is helpful for effectively retaining water and nutrients in soil with reduced leaching of fertilizer into surrounding surface water and groundwater yao et al 2012 on the other hand it should be realized that recovered ammonium used as fertilizer could substitute that primarily produced via the haber bosch reaction a highly energy intensive process in which about 10 kwh is required for producing one kg of ammonia zhang and liu 2021 these clearly suggest that ammonium recovered through biochar adsorption in the proposed integrated process in fact could offset the energy consumption by 41 4 g m3 ammonium n 17 14 10 kwh kg ammonia 0 503 kwh m3 while offsetting 498 g co2e m3 wastewater as such the net carbon emissions from the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b was determined to be 633 g co2e m3 498 g co2e m3 135 co2e m3 which was only about 12 of that in the current cas mf ro process i e 1101 co2e m3 it should be noted that the carbon emissions described above were only meant for the purpose of discussion which were estimated based on the information gathered from this and the related literature the comparisons of the energy consumption and ghgs emissions in the proposed process against the current newater production process were summarized in table s2 consequently it appears that the combined carbon reduction and carbon offsetting as demonstrated in this study are essential for achieving the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation biochar added to agricultural soils could help to mitigate global climate change through carbon sequestration e g the maximum sustainable technical potential of biochar to store greenhouse gasses e g co2 ch4 and n2o had been reported to be 1 8 gt co2 c eq year at the global scale woolf et al 2010 moreover biochar at a dosage rate of 22 4 ton ha was able to improve the shoot and root biomass of wheat bista et al 2019 while vaccari et al 2011 also reported 30 increase in biomass production after 30 tons of biochar ha were returned to a durum wheat field the other benefit of returning biochar to soils is its carbon sequestrating potential e g about 0 61 to 0 80 ton of carbon i e 2 2 to 2 93 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent averaged at 2 66 tons of carbon dioxide could be sequestered by one ton of biochar blasing et al 2004 for the purpose of illustration provided 20 tons of ammonium loaded biochar harvested from the biochar adsorber in the proposed process fig 4b was supplied to one hectare of agricultural land according to the discussion above this would lead to a reduced carbon dioxide emission by 53 2 tons ha i e 2 66 tons ton biochar 20 tons ha while returning 128 5 kg ha of ammonium as fertilizer to the land with the adsorption capacity of biochar around 5 mg ammonium n g it is apparent that ammonium loaded biochar produced from the proposed integrated process fig 4b could innovatively achieve the three goals of wastewater reclamation carbon sequestration and ammonium recovered as fertilizer 5 conclusions in the global municipal wastewater management sector technological innovations are urgently needed for addressing the emerging while highly complex water energy resource carbon emissions nexus facing to such a highly vibrant and challenging situation this study showed the engineering feasibility of an innovative integrated anmbr biochar adsorption ro process towards the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation with the direct capture of wastewater cod in anmbr the energy consumption in this process were reduced by 42 compared to the current newater production process the indirect carbon emissions in the current cas mf ro and anmbr biochar ro processes both were found to be much more pronounced than the corresponding direct carbon emissions indicating that the control of indirect carbon emissions would be a game changer toward the carbon neutral process operation these clearly suggested that the energy neutrality is a perquisite for the carbon neutrality it was further demonstrated that ammonia recovery via biochar adsorption could offset about 0 503 kwh m3 of electrical energy that was originally utilized for chemically synthesizing the recovered ammonia via the haber bosch reaction leading to a significant carbon offsetting of 498 g co2e m3 wastewater with this carbon offsetting the carbon emissions in the proposed process was substantially reduced to only about 12 of that in the cuurent cas mf ro process in addition this study also revealed that biochar adsorption could remove divalent cations in the anmbr permeate with the benefit for mitigating ro fouling and reducing the operation cost and energy consumption associated to the ro unit in conclusion it appears from this study that the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation would be possible with the concurrent carbon reduction through enhanced energy generation and carbon offsetting via resource

16316,with the speedy evolution of global climate change and water shortage there is a growing need for the energy and carbon neutral wastewater reclamation technology to tackle this challenge an innovative anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr biochar adsorption ro process was developed for reclaiming municipal wastewater to high grade product water with the aims for achieving the energy and carbon neutrality it was found that about 95 6 of influent cod was removed by anmbr with direct generation of biomethane while ammonium n in anmbr permeate was fully recovered through biochar adsorption the effluent from biochar adsorber with significantly lowered divalent ions concentrations was further reclaimed by ro at reduced cost and energy consumption the energy demand and the total carbon emissions in the proposed process were estimated to be 0 50 kwh m3 and 633 g co2e m3 against 0 86 kwh m3 and 1101 g co2e m3 in the current conventional activated sludge cas microfiltration ro process it was further shown that the ammonium recovery via biochar adsorption could offset about 0 503 kwh m3 that was originally utilized for chemically producing recovered ammonia by the haber bosch method equivalent to a carbon offsetting of 498 g co2e m3 leading to a net carbon emission of 135 co2e m3 in the proposed process which was only about 12 of that in the current cas mf ro process these suggested that a carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation might be achievable through concurrent carbon reduction and offsetting while carbon offsetting via ammonia recovery appeared to be a game changer towards the carbon neutral operation consequently it is expected that this study can shed lights on how energy and carbon neutrality would be achieved by innovating municipal wastewater reclamation technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic mbr biochar adsorption reverse osmosis municipal wastewater reclamation energy and resource recovery carbon neutrality 1 introduction the world s population has been projected to hit 9 7 billion by 2050 and more than 25 of population will live in regions exposed to extreme water shortages vakilifard et al 2018 this implies that there is an urgent need to exploit emerging untraditional water sources for sustaining future water supply it has been widely accepted that municipal wastewater instead of a simple waste should be regarded as an emerging while regenerative water resource for producing high grade product water however the current municipal wastewater reclamation technologies suffer from high energy demand generation of excessive waste sludge carbon emissions large footprint and no resource recovery zhang and liu 2022 2020 zhang et al 2019 in singapore the combined activated sludge microfiltration ultrafiltration reverse osmosis ro and uv disinfection process has been applied for reclamation of municipal wastewater to the high grade product water knowns as newater it had been reported that the energy consumption for newater production was in the range of 0 7 1 2 kwh m3 vincent et al 2014 equivalent to an energy associated indirect carbon emission of 693 1188 g co2e m3 wastewater with a factor of 0 99 kg co2e kwh of electricity produced from the combustion of coal https www eia gov tools faqs faq php id 74 t 11 moreover most of ammonium in municipal wastewater was biologically converted to the nitrogen gas together with high energy and chemicals consumptions for example in the conventional nitrification denitrification process about 2 6 6 2 kwh of energy should be needed for removing one kilogram of ammonium n cruz et al 2019 on the other hand it should also be realized that a portion of ammonium could be oxidized to n2o during biological nitrogen removal bnr which has been known as a potent greenhouse gas he et al 2020 these seem to imply that the current municipal wastewater reclamation process is not favourable for the energy and carbon neutrality obviously innovative technology is strongly needed for realizing the synergetic water reclamation energy and resource recovery with minimized carbon emissions ammonium fertilizer has been playing a vital role in sustaining the global agricultural productivity ye et al 2018 so far bnr via different biochemical pathways e g nitrification denitrification partial nitritation denitritation autotrophic anaerobic ammonia oxidation etc has been commonly practiced in municipal wastewater treatment however these bnr processes have been developed on the basis of biological oxidation reduction by which most of wastewater ammonium is ultimately transformed to nitrogen gas making ammonium recovery impossible zhang and liu 2021 zhang et al 2019 these in turn challenge the environmental sustainability and economic viability of the current bnr processes on the other hand almost all ammonium products originate from ammonia chemically synthesized through a highly energy intensive haber bosch reaction bonmatı and flotats 2003 erisman et al 2008 indicating a hidden environmental and economic cost in wastewater ammonium it has been believed that ammonium recovery is to game change the landscape of future municipal wastewater treatment which indeed is aligned with the concept and practice of circular economy adsorption with a simple process configuration has showed the potential and feasibility for ammonium removal and recovery han et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 so far many different types of adsorbents e g zeolite ion exchange resin modified materials etc have been reported for ammonium removal from wastewater han et al 2020 however the post regeneration and processing with intensive usages of chemicals and energy e g sodium chloride acids alkaline etc are needed for ammonium recovery resulting in a substantial production of waste chemical solutions making the recovery of ammonium through adsorption technically unfeasible environmentally unfriendly and economically inviable zhang and liu 2021 therefore there is an urgent need to explore an innovative engineering solution for concurrent wastewater reclamation and ammonium recovery without chemical regeneration biochar derived from pyrolysis of a wide spectrum of biomasses has been shown to be an excellent soil amendment that can improve the soil fertility and agricultural productivity while providing protection against soil borne diseases alhashimi and aktas 2017 e g 139 268 of growth enhancements for lettuce and 111 241 for cabbage were achieved with the applications of biochar carter et al 2013 on the other hand biochar had also been explored for adsorption of ammonium zhang and liu 2021 thus it is reasonable to consider that biochar after adsorption of ammonium should be directly deployed as an ammonium loaded soil ameliorant for agricultural applications without the needs for further regeneration and processing making the whole process nearly chemical free and more environmentally sustainable in addition it should also be noted that such direct application of ammonium loaded biochar is helpful for promoting carbon sequestration by the mean of carbon capture and storage in biochar shen et al 2020 facing to the situation described above this study aimed to developing an innovative integrated anaerobic fixed film mbr biochar adsorption ro process for concurrent wastewater reclamation and enhanced energy and resource recovery carbon neutral in this process might be achievable through carbon reduction and offsetting this process for the first time innovatively integrated anmbr for enhancing energy recovery biochar adsorption for environmentally friendly recovery of ammonium and ultimate water reclamation by ro in holistic manner meanwhile the energy and carbon emission analysis were also performed which showed a great possibility of realizing the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation it is expected that this study could open a new horizon about the way towards energy and carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation 2 materials and methods 2 1 process design and operation an integrated anmbr biochar adsorber ro process was developed in this study fig 1 the anmbr with a working volume of 5 l was operated at a hydraulic retention time of 6 4 h and the temperature of 30 1 c and the anaerobic biofilms were cultivated on bio ropes in the anmbr a side stream polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane with a pore size of 0 02 μm creflux china was adopted running in a 9 min on and 1 min off mode with biogas scouring for membrane fouling control and the membrane permeate flux was controlled at 10 l m2 h the composition of municipal wastewater used consisted of 400 mg cod l 45 mg l nh4 n 5 mg l po4 3 p 500 mg l nahco3 45 mg l cacl2 2h2o 20 mg l mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l feso4 7h2o and trace elements more details of anmbr operation could be found in gu et al 2019 a biochar column with the dimensions of 1 6 cm in diameter and 21 cm in length was packed with modified biochar and operated at different empty bed contact times ebct of 10 to 20 min the influent was introduced from the top of biochar column and flowed downward a ro unit with an effective membrane surface area of 33 34 cm2 bw espa2 nitto denko usa was run at a pressure of 10 bar and the crossflow velocity of the ro unit was maintained at 0 10 m s 2 2 modification and characterization of biochar the biochar derived from natural wood waste green back singapore was sieved to 1 0 1 4 mm in size then washed with distilled water and ethanol the prepared biochar was first activated with 4 m of nitric acid hno3 60 sigma aldrich at an impregnation ratio weight volume of 1 5 for 12 h at 40 rpm afterwards the biochar was rinsed with deionized water followed by soaking in 0 3 m of sodium hydroxide naoh sigma aldrich at an impregnation ratio of 1 20 weight volume for 12 h lastly the collected biochar was washed with deionized water till a solution ph of 8 9 and then dried at 105 c for 24 h the physicochemical properties and adsorption performance of modified biochar were summarized in the supplementary materials s1 and table s1 in this study the

analytical methods total organic carbon toc reflecting organic concentration was measured by a toc tn analyzer shimadzu japan and nh4 n and po4 3 p were quantified according to standard methods apha

an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer optima 8300 usa the concentrations of chloride and sulfate were determined by an ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 sunnyvale ca usa the morphology and energy dispersive spectrum eds of ro membranes were characterized for determination of the elemental compositions of foulants on ro membrane surfaces using a scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7600 f microscope japan with ro membrane sputter coated by a thin layer of gold 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anmbr biochar adsorber in the integrated process illustrated in fig 1 the anmbr was primarily designed for direct cod capture with the aims to maximize biogas generation while minimizing waste sludge production the anmbr was steadily operated for about two years it was observed that about 95 6 of influent cod was removed in the steady state anmbr with 76 8 of the cod converted to methane in anmbr nearly no removal of ammonium was achieved while the dynamic changes of the cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in the anmbr could be found in gu et al 2019 the observed biomass yield in the anmbr was found to be as low as 0 03 g vss g cod which was much lower than that observed in activated sludge i e 0 3 0 5 g vss g cod liu et al 2020b leading to a significant reduction in the waste sludge production in the proposed integrated process a total of 105 6 l of methane was produced from one cubic meter of wastewater treated with 34 2 of produced methane was in the dissolved form anaerobic biofilms were cultivated on bio ropes in the anmbr thus the suspended solids concentration in the reactor was determined to be 10 39 1 19 mg l with the on and off operation mode and biogas sparging the membrane fouling rate was found to be very low in the first 5 days i e dtmp dt 0 037 kpa h afterwards the tmp was gradually increased to 0 30 bar after 10 4 day operation gu et al 2019 a simulated effluent prepared according to a blended effluent from the steady state anmbr with averaged concentrations of major substances was used for subsequent biochar adsorption with the aim to investigate the effect of major cations on the performance of ro unit in fact simulated anaerobic effluent has been commonly used in various investigations chen et al 2021 iddya et al 2020 fig 2 showed the performances of the biochar adsorber at different ebcts as can be seen almost all influent nh4 n could be removed by biochar in 50 to 300 min from the perspective of recovery more ammonium retained via biochar adsorption is preferable the actual adsorption capacities of biochar determined from fig 2 were found to be 3 63 4 99 and 5 89 mg nh4 n g at the ebcts of 10 to 20 min which were lower than the adsorption capacity calculated from the langmuir isotherm fig s1 likely due to the co adsorption of divalent cations in the anmbr permeate e g ca2 mg2 etc table 1 it can be seen in table 1 that the divalent cations e g calcium magnesium iron etc in the anmbr permeate were significantly removed by biochar through adsorption for example the calcium magnesium and iron concentrations were reduced from 8 92 mg l to 0 16 mg l 1 53 mg l to 0 0039 mg l and 0 3 mg l to 0 0084 mg l respectively these suggested that the biochar adsorber in the proposed integrated process could serve two fold purposes i e ammonium recovery and removal of divalent cations as such the chance for the divalent cations to form inorganic colloidal particles or precipitates on ro membrane surface should be substantially reduced while greatly helping to mitigate membrane fouling in the subsequent ro operation fig 1 in fact it had been shown that divalent ions had a higher inorganic fouling potential to ro membranes mo et al 2008 yin et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 3 2 performance of ro unit table 1 showed that the toc concentration in the ro permeate decreased to 0 28 0 01 mg l while the ammonium and phosphate in the ro permeate were not detectable such permeate quality could meet the singapore s typical newater standards in terms of toc and major ions table 1 obviously this high grade product water is suitable for direct industrial and indirect portable uses https www pub gov sg watersupply waterquality newater fig 3 a further illustrated the respective flux profiles of the ro unit fed with the anmbr permeate and the effluent from the biochar adsorber for the ro unit receiving the effluent from the biochar adsorber no fouling was observed in the first 30 min as compared to that fed with the anmbr permeate followed by a slower fouling development according to fig 3a the linear fouling rate of ro fed with the anmbr permeate was determined to be 2 82 lmh h that was 3 3 fold higher than that in the case with the biochar adsorber effluent i e 0 86 lmh h as both anmbr permeate and effluent from the biochar adsorber had a similar toc concentration the fouling propensities observed in fig 3a could be reasonably attributed to different divalent cations concentrations in the two feed waters as shown in table 1 for example the total divalent cation concentration in the anmbr permeate was 0 59 meq l against 0 0086 meq l in the effluent from the biochar adsorber suggesting that inorganic scaling was a main cause of the ro fouling observed with the anmbr permeate sem and eds were used to determine the elemental compositions of the foulants on the ro membrane surfaces as can be seen in figs 3b 3d more inorganic crystal like substances were found on the ro membrane fed with the anmbr permeate and such observations were consistent with the fouling profile in fig 3a in addition it appears from table 2 and fig s2 that the fraction of ca2 in the foulants on the ro membrane surfaces fed with the anmbr permeate was 13 times higher than that in the ro fed with the effluent from the biochar adsorber while a similar trend was also observed for phosphate moreover the iron content in the foulants on the surfaces of ro membrane fed with the anmbr permeate was as high as 2 9 but the iron on the ro membrane fed with the effluent of the biochar adsorber was not detectable in fact the elemental compositions of the foulants table 2 clearly suggested that inorganic fouling was dominant over organic fouling in the ro unit according to the fe ca and p contents in the foulants table 2 the crystal like yellowish brown substances observed on the ro membrane surfaces might be attributed to ferrous phosphate and hydroxyapatite hap which had been known as the major inorganic foulants on ro membranes zheng et al 2018 in this study the ph in the biochar effluent was found to be around 7 6 in fact it had been reported that highly insoluble hap was the predominant foulant at a neutral or alkaline ph chesters 2009 in addition the cost associated with fouling control accounted for about 24 of the total operation cost in ro systems jafari et al 2021 while the energy consumption could be reduced by around 16 6 in ro with pre removal of major ions in feed water through reverse electrodialysis tufa et al 2019 consequently the biochar adsorber in the proposed integrated process fig 1 was not only meant for ammonium recovery but was also helpful for the control of ro fouling leading to lowered overall ro operation cost i e one stone killing two birds 4 engineering implications 4 1 energy demand and recovery in the current newater production process denoted as cas mf ro fig 4 a the energy consumption in the activated sludge unit with anaerobic digestion ad had been reported to be 0 45 kwh m3 on average cao 2011 on the other hand the respective energy consumptions of microfiltration mf and ro determined to be 0 13 kwh m3 and 0 396 kwh m3 of wastewater treated with 75 recovery rate liu et al 2020a for municipal wastewater with an influent cod concentration of 400 mg l and a cod removal efficiency of 90 the waste activated sludge generated in the cas mf ro process fig 4a could be roughly calculated to be 400 mg cod l 90 0 40 g vss g cod 144 g vss m3 of wastewater treated with an average sludge growth yield of 0 40 g vss g cod the biochemical methane potential of activated sludge had been reported to be 0 19 to 0 24 nm3 kg vss i e 0 21 to 0 27 m3 kg vss at 30 c which were averaged at 0 24 m3 kg vss bachmann et al 2015 thus the methane produced through ad of waste activated sludge could be calculated to be 144 g vss m3 0 24 m3 ch4 kg vss 0 0346 m3 ch4 m3 wastewater treated however the fugitive loss of methane given by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc generally varies in between 0 and 10 of the produced methane from facility to facility and an average value of about 3 was adopted in previous study by møller et al 2009 as such the potentially recoverable electrical energy from ad of waste sludge was estimated to be 0 0346 m3 ch4 m3 1 0 03 37 8 mj m3 ch4 35 3 6 mj kwh 0 12 kwh m3 assuming that methane has an energy content of 37 8 mj m3 based on the averaged heating value with a heat to electricity conversion efficiency of 35 mccarty et al 2011 smyth et al 2010 thus the total energy consumption in the cas mf ro process for newater production fig 4a could be determined to be 0 45 kwh m3 cas 0 13 kwh m3 mf 0 396 kwh m3 ro 0 12 kwh m3 energy recovered from ad 0 86 kwh m3 wastewater treated the energy utilization in the anmbr equipped with biogas sparging for membrane fouling control was reported to be about 0 41 kwh m3 on average shin and bae 2018 as the observed sludge yield in the anmbr was less than 10 of that in the activated sludge process the energy consumption associated with sludge handling as well as the energy potentially recovered from ad of waste sludge in the anmbr biochar ro process would be negligible in the anmbr wastewater cod was directly captured for methane production while the dissolved methane in its effluent was detected to be averaged at 29 mg l approximately 90 of the dissolved methane i e 32 5 l m3 could be recoverable with the assistance of a methane recovery degasser at an energy cost of 0 12 kwh m3 gu et al 2017 as the result a total of 102 l ch4 m3 could be collected with a residual dissolved methane of about 2 9 mg l being eventually emitted into the atmosphere therefore the recoverable energy from the anmbr could reach 0 102 m3 ch4 m3 1 0 03 37 8 mj m3 methane 35 3 6 mj kwh 0 36 kwh m3 wastewater treated indicating that the energy recovery efficiency in the anmbr was 3 times of that obtained through ad of waste sludge in the cas mf ro process i e 0 12 kwh m3 these clearly showed that direct cod capture from municipal wastewater was more energy efficient than the energy harvesting through ad of waste sludge in the current cas mf ro process for the biochar adsorber the energy was mainly consumed by the influent pump in this study the influent was introduced into the biochar adsorber from the top and flowed downwards in this case it is reasonable to consider that the associated energy usage could be negligible on the other hand it should be noted that the energy consumption of the ro unit in the proposed process could be reduced by approximately 16 6 with pre removal of major ions tufa et al 2019 thus the net energy demand in the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b was determined to be 0 41 kwh m3 anmbr 0 396 1 0 166 kwh m3 ro 0 12 kwh m3 dissolved methane recovery 0 36 kwh m3 energy recovered from methane 0 50 kwh m3 of wastewater treated which was about 42 lower than that in the current cas mf ro process fig 4a making the reclamation of municipal wastewater more energy efficient 4 2 greenhouse gas emissions in the current cas mf ro process fig 4a the direct ghg emissions primarily resulted from carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane as reported by cao et al 2013 about 52 9 of wastewater cod was oxidized to co2 with the rest being converted to biomass in the cas process it should be noted that municipal wastewater may contain fossil organic carbon and biogenic organic carbon according to the ipcc guidelines degradation of biogenic organic carbon in a municipal wastewater plant would not result in significant lasting increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ipcc 2006 as such the biogenic co2 from wastewater treatment is not required to be included in the ghg inventory towards global climate change on the other hand it had been reported that approximately 10 of organic carbon in municipal wastewater was of non biogenic origin de haas et al 2009 2014 møller et al 2009 therefore the direct non biogenic co2 emission due to aerobic oxidation of influent cod was determined to be 400 g cod m3 10 52 9 44 32 29 1 g co2 m3 wastewater treated according to the recommendation by ipcc 2019 a default emission factor of 0 016 mg n2on released mg tn removed was adopted in this study to determine the n2o emission in the cas process with 60 of tn removal cao et al 2013 i e 0 016 mg n2on mg tn 45 mg tn l 60 44 28 0 68 mg n2o l equivalent to 0 68 298 203 g co2e m3 wastewater treated given the global warming potential of n2o being 298 fold of co2 referring to a time framework of 100 years climate carbon feedbacks https www epa gov ghgemissions understanding global warming potentials learn 20why it should be noted that the generation of n2o in a wwtp in fact is strongly related to the removal efficiency of tn as for the ch4 emission from the ad unit in wwtp it has been agreed that ch4 emissions are likely to be close to zero if technical standards for biogas plants could ensure that unintentional ch4 emissions are flared møller et al 2009 in the cas mf ro process fig 4a produced methane was used for energy recovery with unused biogas being flared hsien et al 2019 these imply that only 3 of fugitive loss of methane should be counted towards the carbon emission i e 0 0346 m3 ch4 m3 3 637 g m3 density of methane at 30 c 28 18 5 g co2e m3 given the global warming potential of ch4 being 28 fold of co2 referring to a time framework of 100 years climate carbon feedbacks therefore the direct ghg emissions from the current cas mf ro process fig 4a was determined to be 29 1 g co2 m3 non biogenic co2 from cas 203 g co2e m3 n2o 18 5 g co2e m3 fugitive loss methane during ad 250 g co2e m3 wastewater treated it should also be realized that the electricity supply in most wwtps still relies on fossil fuels leading to the indirect co2 emission with a factor of 0 99 kg co2e kwh produced from the combustion of fossil coal useia 2020 with these the indirect co2 emission in the current cas mbr ro process fig 4a was calculated to be 0 86 kwh m3 0 99 kg co2e kwh 851 g co2e m3 therefore the total ghg emissions from the current cas mbr ro process could reach 1101 g co2e m3 wastewater treated also it is worth noting that the indirect carbon emission was the major carbon source which was more than three times of the direct carbon emission implying that the energy neutrality is essential towards the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation in this study biogenic carbon emission was not counted in as recommended by ipcc however it has been generally agreeable that any carbon currently sequestered is helpful for reducing the peak carbon dioxide concentration in atmosphere and it is a matter of time scale biotechnology industry organization 2010 biogenic carbon in municipal wastewater treatment plant can be degraded within hours much faster than its natural decomposition over a time scale of years this in turn suggests that decomposition of wastewater biogenic carbon could inevitably lead to an increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide if biogenic carbon is not rapidly renewable through a natural cycle it is apparent that municipal wastewater treatment plants could transfer biogenic carbon in municipal wastewater from the slow domain with a longer turnover time to the fast domain with a shorter turnover time in the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b the ratio of gaseous co2 to ch4 was found to be 0 2 implying that the direct non biogenic co2 emission from the anmbr could be determined to be 102 32 5 l ch4 m3 0 2 1 75 kg m3 density of co2 at 30 c 10 2 4 g co2e m3 on the other hand it should be realized that the n2o emission was negligible in the proposed anmbr biochar ro process just because biological nitrogen removal was not engaged at all the carbon emissions associated to fugitive loss of methane was further estimated to be 102 l ch4 m3 3 637 g m3 density of methane at 30 c 28 54 6 g co2e m3 in addition as discussed above after harvesting of dissolved methane the residual dissolved methane concentration of 2 9 g m3 led to a potential carbon emission of 81 2 g co2e m3 thus the direct ghg emissions from the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b was determined to be 138 g co2e m3 wastewater treated while the indirect co2 emission associated to the energy consumption in the proposed process could be determined to be 0 50 kwh m3 990 g co2e kwh 495 g co2e m3 wastewater treated thus the total ghg emissions from the proposed anmbr biochar ro process was estimated to be 633 g co2e m3 wastewater treated which was only about 57 5 of that emitted from the current cas mbr ro process fig 4a suggesting a step further close to carbon neutral reclamation of municipal wastewater to high grade product water similar to the situation in the current cas mbr ro process it was observed again that the indirect carbon emission was about 3 6 times higher than the direct carbon emissions in the anmbr biochar ro process it should also be noted that the carbon emissions and energy consumption discussed above were primarily derived from this study and the related information available in the literature and obviously they deserve a further study in a more holistic manner as shown above the indirect carbon emission primarily resulted from the electrical energy consumed during municipal wastewater reclamation obviously the energy neutrality is the prerequisite for the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation almost all ammonium in municipal wastewater could be recovered via biochar adsorption fig 2 the biochar loaded with ammonium in fact can be directly deployed as an ammonium rich solid fertilizer as well as a soil ameliorant for increasing agricultural productivity because the porous structure of biochar is helpful for effectively retaining water and nutrients in soil with reduced leaching of fertilizer into surrounding surface water and groundwater yao et al 2012 on the other hand it should be realized that recovered ammonium used as fertilizer could substitute that primarily produced via the haber bosch reaction a highly energy intensive process in which about 10 kwh is required for producing one kg of ammonia zhang and liu 2021 these clearly suggest that ammonium recovered through biochar adsorption in the proposed integrated process in fact could offset the energy consumption by 41 4 g m3 ammonium n 17 14 10 kwh kg ammonia 0 503 kwh m3 while offsetting 498 g co2e m3 wastewater as such the net carbon emissions from the proposed anmbr biochar ro process fig 4b was determined to be 633 g co2e m3 498 g co2e m3 135 co2e m3 which was only about 12 of that in the current cas mf ro process i e 1101 co2e m3 it should be noted that the carbon emissions described above were only meant for the purpose of discussion which were estimated based on the information gathered from this and the related literature the comparisons of the energy consumption and ghgs emissions in the proposed process against the current newater production process were summarized in table s2 consequently it appears that the combined carbon reduction and carbon offsetting as demonstrated in this study are essential for achieving the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation biochar added to agricultural soils could help to mitigate global climate change through carbon sequestration e g the maximum sustainable technical potential of biochar to store greenhouse gasses e g co2 ch4 and n2o had been reported to be 1 8 gt co2 c eq year at the global scale woolf et al 2010 moreover biochar at a dosage rate of 22 4 ton ha was able to improve the shoot and root biomass of wheat bista et al 2019 while vaccari et al 2011 also reported 30 increase in biomass production after 30 tons of biochar ha were returned to a durum wheat field the other benefit of returning biochar to soils is its carbon sequestrating potential e g about 0 61 to 0 80 ton of carbon i e 2 2 to 2 93 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent averaged at 2 66 tons of carbon dioxide could be sequestered by one ton of biochar blasing et al 2004 for the purpose of illustration provided 20 tons of ammonium loaded biochar harvested from the biochar adsorber in the proposed process fig 4b was supplied to one hectare of agricultural land according to the discussion above this would lead to a reduced carbon dioxide emission by 53 2 tons ha i e 2 66 tons ton biochar 20 tons ha while returning 128 5 kg ha of ammonium as fertilizer to the land with the adsorption capacity of biochar around 5 mg ammonium n g it is apparent that ammonium loaded biochar produced from the proposed integrated process fig 4b could innovatively achieve the three goals of wastewater reclamation carbon sequestration and ammonium recovered as fertilizer 5 conclusions in the global municipal wastewater management sector technological innovations are urgently needed for addressing the emerging while highly complex water energy resource carbon emissions nexus facing to such a highly vibrant and challenging situation this study showed the engineering feasibility of an innovative integrated anmbr biochar adsorption ro process towards the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation with the direct capture of wastewater cod in anmbr the energy consumption in this process were reduced by 42 compared to the current newater production process the indirect carbon emissions in the current cas mf ro and anmbr biochar ro processes both were found to be much more pronounced than the corresponding direct carbon emissions indicating that the control of indirect carbon emissions would be a game changer toward the carbon neutral process operation these clearly suggested that the energy neutrality is a perquisite for the carbon neutrality it was further demonstrated that ammonia recovery via biochar adsorption could offset about 0 503 kwh m3 of electrical energy that was originally utilized for chemically synthesizing the recovered ammonia via the haber bosch reaction leading to a significant carbon offsetting of 498 g co2e m3 wastewater with this carbon offsetting the carbon emissions in the proposed process was substantially reduced to only about 12 of that in the cuurent cas mf ro process in addition this study also revealed that biochar adsorption could remove divalent cations in the anmbr permeate with the benefit for mitigating ro fouling and reducing the operation cost and energy consumption associated to the ro unit in conclusion it appears from this study that the carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation would be possible with the concurrent carbon reduction through enhanced energy generation and carbon offsetting via resource

16317,the safe and efficient treatment and resource recovery of the large amount of liquid digestate ld produced by biogas plants has become an important factor limiting the development of the biogas industry in this study a solar evaporation system was developed based on low cost high efficiency and high nutrient recovery of ld concentration the effects of different parameters including solar radiation ld flowrate and daily treatment capacity on the concentration efficiency nutrient recovery and thermal efficiency were investigated economic and enviroeconomic analyses were conducted to comprehensively assess the feasibility and environmental benefits of the system for large scale biogas plants the results showed that the higher the solar radiation the higher the air temperature and its saturation vapor pressure which led to an increase in the concentration efficiency of ld the ld concentration efficiency can reach up to 43 33 when the average daily solar radiation was 773 08 w m2 high solar radiation also contributed to high ld temperature leading to an increase in the percentage of free ammonia nh3 in the ld which was not conducive to the recovery of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n by increasing the ld flow rate the heat and mass exchange between air and ld in the spray chamber was enhanced resulting in higher concentration efficiency the variation of ld flow rate and daily treatment capacity had little effect on nutrient recovery the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in the concentrated phase could be as high as 78 39 and 84 19 respectively when the initial ph of ld was 5 the air flow rate was 0 03 m3 s and the ld flow rate was 6 l min in addition the economic analysis indicated that the concentration cost of the system in treating a daily ld production of 100 tons was 1 08 usd ton the solar evaporation system can reduce co2 emissions by 2 40 105 tons and earn carbon credits of 3 48 106 usd over its lifetime this study provides a new direction and reference for ld concentration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar evaporation system liquid digestate concentration nutrient recovery heater efficiency economic analysis enviroeconomic analysis 1 introduction the output of organic waste has presented an increasing trend in recent years which poses significant environmental and health challenges to our society it has been reported that almost 3 8 billion tons of livestock manure and more than 150 million tons of municipal organic waste are produced in china each year li et al 2021 anaerobic digestion a typical value added process for organic waste can effectively reduce the volume and mass of organic waste while converting it into value added products such as bioenergy cai et al 2018 pirelli et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 however the liquid digestate ld is produced in large quantities as a by product during anaerobic digestion annually more than one billion tons of ld were produced by 3800 large scale biogas plants in china from 2010 du et al 2019 although ld can be applied as agricultural fertilizer its continuous and substantial production exceeds the carrying capacity of local farmland excessive irrigation of ld to farmland may damage the soil structure and microbial ecosystem as well as cause serious environmental issues because of nutrient leaching and runoff ruan et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 in addition in some cases the distance between biogas plants and farmland is too far to economically justify the transportation cost limiting the farmland application of ld han et al 2015 therefore it is profitable to reduce the volume while enriching the nutrient concentration of ld and saving transportation costs current alternatives for reducing the volume of ld include membrane processes and evaporation román et al 2021 over the past decade several membrane processes have been successfully performed for ld concentration these mainly include microfiltration alengebawy et al 2021 ultrafiltration ledda et al 2013 nanofiltration yang et al 2020 reverse osmosis ruan et al 2015 ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis chiumenti et al 2013b forward osmosis wu et al 2021 and membrane distillation he et al 2018 despite the promise of membrane processes in ld treatment its practical application is limited as membrane processes still face several challenges the critical issue is membrane fouling especially in the case of high initial total solids ts content of the ld which without effective pretreatment and proper membrane filtration will reduce membrane life thereby increasing operating costs and making it very difficult for commercial applications chiumenti et al 2013b wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 vacuum evaporation is also used for ld concentration chiumenti et al 2013a built pilot scale vacuum evaporation plants 0 1 and 0 025 m3 to treat the ld the result showed the considerable capability of the vacuum evaporation process especially in the two stage configuration with acidification in full scale plants energy consumption was estimated to be 5 8 kwhe m3 of digestate and 350 kwht m3 of evaporated water a further possibility to concentrate ld is evaporation with waste heat from the combined heat and power chp unit of a biogas plant in germany ld treatment techniques that use heat are being used more frequently because of the subsidies for waste heat utilization in biogas chp a multi stage vacuum evaporation technology had been executed for ld concentration with a volume reduction of 50 causing a correspondent reduction in transportation costs fuchs and drosg 2013 nevertheless the high requirement of heat and vacuum is economically unfavorable it is necessary to develop a low energy consumption and high concentration efficiency technology to concentrate ld an additional attractive technique is the unconventional composting process of ld chiumenti 2011 composted ld with a clf modil digester which consisted of processing liquid inputs on a bed of bulking absorbing dry material straw wood chips sawdust corn stalks etc to yield a solid product the aerobic conditions introduced by aeration of the biomass caused self heating of the feedstock up to 60 c with relevant evaporation of water leaving a residual solid of about 15 of the input li et al 2012 evaluated the feasibility of co composting of wheat straw and dairy waste according to the findings co composting of wheat straw and ld can consume 1 8 t of ld per 1 0 t of wheat straw however the long compost cycle leads to the low efficiency of ld treatment recently there has been an increasing interest in humidification dehumidification hdh technology for seawater desalination this technology is simple construction convenient operation and control low investment and operating costs and able to run at a low temperature which is beneficial for hdh to integrate with sustainable but low grade energy sources such as solar energy li et al 2019 santosh et al 2020 the hdh technology is based on the principle that air can carry significant amounts of water vapor in the humidification stage the brine comes into direct contact with the air while the water vapor produced by evaporation transfers to the air in the dehumidification stage the water vapor in the air is condensed to produce freshwater ayati et al 2020 our research established a solar evaporation system based on the hdh desalination technology for ld concentration a series of experiments were performed under different solar radiation ld flowrate and daily treatment capacity to investigate the effects of operational parameters on system performance including concentration efficiency nutrient recovery and thermal efficiency furthermore the analysis of economic and enviroeconomic for the solar evaporation system based on a real scale biogas plant with an ld treatment capacity of 100 t d was conducted to assess the system application potential in large and medium scale biogas plants the innovation of this work is to determine the technical economic and environmental feasibility of the solar evaporation system for ld concentration which provides valuable information for the application of this technology in large and medium scale biogas plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials raw liquid digestate rld was collected from an anaerobic digester in wuhan hubei china the digester used swine manure as input for mesophilic anaerobic fermentation the hydraulic retention time was 7 10 d the volume of the anaerobic digester was 2300 m3 and the biogas production was 100 300 m3 d the rld taken from the digester was stored anaerobically at ambient temperature before experiments until no biogas was produced the rld was flocculated to remove the large particle impurities before the experiment 100 g l poly aluminum ferric chloride pafc solution stored in ventilated and protected from light used within 3 d and 2 g l cationic polyacrylamide cpam solution dissolved for more than 1 h within 24 h use were prepared for the rld flocculation pafc solution and cpam solution were added to the rld at dosages of 8 ml l and 3 5 ml l respectively the mixed rld was stirred at a speed of 350 r min for 30 s then stirred at a speed of 40 r min for 20 min wu et al 2019 after standing for about 2 h the supernatant was collected for the experiment the physicochemical properties of the rld and the supernatant of rld after flocculation fld are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental apparatus fig 1 presents a schematic diagram and a photograph of the solar evaporation system the solar evaporation system consists mainly of the solar ld heater solar air heater spray chamber cooling chamber pumps blower and insulated buckets etc the test facility arrangement can be found in fig 1 a the fld was heated as it flowed on the absorber plate in the solar ld heater and the solar energy was thus converted into thermal energy in the form of sensible heat the hot fld was then sprayed into the spray chamber which was filled with filler so that the hot fld was distributed evenly over its surface at the same time the outdoor air was conveyed into the solar air heater and heated by it subsequently the hot air was blown into the spray chamber where the relative humidity of the hot air increased because of heat and mass transfer between the hot air and the hot fld film part of the fld was taken away as the wet air entered the cooling chamber where the wet air was processed to get liquid water the remaining fld flowed from the spray chamber was collected into the bottom basin and return to the insulated bucket to be sprayed again since it was still hot and not so much concentrated the liquid water in the cooling chamber was the cooling phase and the remaining solution in the spray chamber was the concentrated phase 2 2 1 solar ld heater referring to the cascade solar still farshchi tabrizi et al 2010 a solar ld heater was designed which was mainly composed of an absorber plate weirs glass cover and insulation fig s1 the heater was made of 20 steps where each step had specific dimensional characteristics shown in fig s1b each step was staggered equipped with a 1 cm height and 95 cm length weir to force the flowing fld to pass through the absorber plate which led to the residence time increase of fld on the absorber plate a schematic top view of the fld flow path on the absorber plate surface was shown in fig s1c the absorber plate of every layer was with a size of 100 cm 5 cm and coated with matte black paint to increase the absorptivity a glass sheet of 4 mm thick was used to seal the heater the bottom and sidewalls of the heater were well insulated with rubber plastic cotton to reduce heat loss the inclination of the heater was 30 corresponding to the latitude of wuhan china 2 2 2 solar air heater the structure and size of the solar air heater were the same as the solar ld heater except for the length of the weir which was consistent with the absorber plate of 100 cm 2 2 3 spray chamber the spray chamber also called the cooling tower has been used in many chemical processes yuan et al 2011 at the top of the spray chamber a sprayer was installed to feed the spray chamber with hot fld heated by the solar ld heater under the sprayer corrugated polyvinyl chloride filler was filled which could enhance the residence time of fld in the spray chamber and the interface area between the fld and laterally flowing air thus increasing the heat and mass transfer efficiency the insulation bucket at the bottom of the spray chamber was used to collect the concentrated phase after air liquid transfer the spray chamber was well insulated with rubber plastic cotton from all sides the cross sectional area of the spray chamber was 0 8 m 1 5 m 2 2 4 cooling chamber the cooling chamber was composed mainly of the heat transfer of copper tubes with fins the numbers of the tube in the row were 11 with 5 mm spacing the cross sectional area of the cooling chamber was 0 9 m 0 5 m the hot and humid air from the spray chamber went through the cooling chamber and was cooled by cooling water moist air out of the cooling chamber became dry and cold 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments were constructed at the college of engineering huazhong agricultural university china longitude 114 36 e and latitude 30 47 n from sep to nov 2020 first the fld in insulation bucket 1 was pumped into the solar ld heater valve 1 was used to control the flow rate of the fld in the heater the heated fld flowed into bucket 2 and then was sprayed into the spray chamber valve 2 was used to adjust the fld spray rate in the spray chamber so that it was the same as the flow rate in the heater after the heat and mass transfer between the fld and air in the spray chamber the remaining fld flowed back into the insulation bucket 1 to be cyclically concentrated with a cycle time of 8 h d the concentrated phase and the cooling phase were collected after the daily experiment for analysis 2 4 chemical analysis there are many indicators to determine the nutrient recovery efficiency including ph electrical conductivity ec ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and chemical oxygen demand cod the chemical analysis has been reported previously wang et al 2020 2 5 system performance evaluation index the evaluation indexes of the solar evaporation system include concentration efficiency nutrient recovery the thermal efficiency of solar ld heater and solar air heater and the air humidification efficiency of the spray chamber the calculation process and uncertainty analysis are shown in s1 2 6 enviroeconomic analysis the solar evaporation system uses renewable energy as a heat source reducing fossil fuel consumption and helping to reduce co2 emissions unfortunately the raw materials such as iron steel insulation and glass which are fabricated using the electricity produced by fossil fuels resources used to manufacture the solar evaporation system come with the release of co2 yousef and hassan 2019 yousef et al 2019 2 6 1 co2 emissions the accumulated energy from the initial production of raw materials to the final fabrication installation and operation of the equipment is called embodied energy which is calculated by multiplying the energy density of each section of the solar evaporation system by their corresponding mass omidi et al 2020 yousef et al 2019 co2 emissions can be considered to be generated by the embodied energy of the solar evaporation system module the amount of co2 produced is 2 kg kw h omidi et al 2020 thus 1 c o 2 emissions during the lifetime ton e e m 2 1000 where e e m is the embodied energy of the solar evaporation system kw h 2 6 2 co2 mitigation the solar evaporation system uses renewable energy and without the consumption of fossil fuels which reduces co2 emissions therefore co2 mitigation during the lifetime from the solar evaporation system is given as elbar et al 2019 2 c o 2 mitigation during the lifetime ton e t h n 2 1000 where e t h is the annual thermal energy needed for ld concentration kw h and n is the lifetime of the system the environmental analysis can be defined as follows 3 c o 2 e t h n e e m 2 1000 where c o 2 is the total co2 mitigation over the lifetime of the solar evaporation system ton 2 6 3 carbon credit gained the enviroeconomic approach defines the annual revenue from co2 mitigation over the lifetime for the solar evaporation system elbar et al 2019 currently the price of co2 mitigation is estimated to be about 14 5 usd ton yousef et al 2019 the enviroeconomic parameter can be presented as follows 4 z c o 2 c o 2 14 5 where z c o 2 is the carbon credit gained by the solar evaporation system over the lifetime usd 3 results and discussion 3 1 acid pretreatment of fld previous studies chiumenti et al 2013a wang et al 2020 have shown that concentrating ld by evaporation can lead to a significant loss of nh3 n while acidic conditions ph 6 facilitate nh3 n recovery in addition evaporation has little effect on tp and tk in ld bai et al 2015 wang et al 2020 before the experiment of fld concentration by the solar evaporation system the initial ph of fld was adjusted to 5 with sulfuric acid and the nutrient content in the two phases concentrated phase and cooling phase after concentration was analyzed the effect of acid pretreatment on nutrient recovery after concentration was investigated on 7 sep and 8 sep it can be seen from fig s2 that the daily average solar radiation of 7 sep 794 74 w m2 and 8 sep 773 08 w m2 was almost the same and the air temperature and fld temperature before and after heating were not much different fig 2 shows the changes of the components in the two phases after fld concentration under different initial ph when the initial ph of fld was 8 65 7 sep the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in the concentrated phase was only 6 42 and 38 21 while the nh3 n concentration and ec value in the cooling phase reached 2896 68 mg l and 0 31 ms cm respectively when the initial ph of fld was 5 8 sep the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salt in the concentrated phase increased to 53 31 and 63 88 and the nh3 n concentration and ec value in the cooling phase fell to 159 30 mg l and 0 15 ms cm respectively the cod concentration in the cooling phase reduced from 100 65 mg l to 86 6 mg l when the fld initial ph was from 8 65 to 5 nitrogen in the ld usually exists in the form of free ammonia nh3 and ammonium nh 4 and the nh 4 is more stable compared to nh3 liao et al 1995 the concentration of nh3 and nh 4 is in dynamic equilibrium in ld mainly influenced by temperature and ph guštin and marinšek logar 2011 the relationship between nh3 and nh 4 in ld is given as lei et al 2007 5 n h 3 n h 3 nh 4 1 h k a where n h 3 is the nh3 concentration mol l n h 3 nh 4 is the total ammonia concentration mol l h is the hydrogen ion concentration mol l and k a is the acid ionization constant of ammonia mol l pka can be expressed as a function of temperature by the following equation eq 6 6 p k a 4 10 8 t 3 9 10 5 t 2 0 0356 t 10 072 based on eq 5 and 6 the percentage of nh3 in the ld under different temperatures and ph was calculated table 2 it can be seen that the percentage of nh3 increased with increasing temperature and initial ph of the ld which was unfavorable to the recovery of nh3 n and this finding was consistent with our experimental results the trend of ec recovery was consistent with that of nh3 n the main reason was that the content of nh3 n in the ld varied greatly during evaporation while other salt ions such as so2 4 cl na and k were non volatile substances and the concentrations changed little which had less influence on the ec value of the concentrated phase guo et al 2018 table 1 shows the physicochemical properties of each fraction before and after concentration initial ph 5 the concentration of cod and tp in the fld decreased obviously whereas the other components changed slightly adjusting the initial ph of the fld to 5 had little effect on the concentration of the components the ec value cod and tk concentration in the concentrated phase was higher than the input indicating that the organic matter e g proteins humic acids amino acids etc and soluble salt ions in the fld were effectively concentrated the concentration of nh3 n in the concentrated phase on the other hand was slightly lower than the input which occurred probably because of the concentration difference of ammonia between the fld and air during the mass transfer resulting in a considerable ammonia loss guštin and marinšek logar 2011 due to the low input concentration of tp almost no tp was obtained in the concentrated phase the content of each component in the cooling phase was low and the concentration of cod and tp met the emission requirements for the livestock and poultry breeding industry the maximum allowable daily discharge standards of pollutants were not higher than 400 mg l for cod and not higher than 8 0 mg l for tp according to gb 18 596 2001 fig 3 displays the visual appearance of rld fld ph 5 concentrated phase and cooling phase the chroma of the fld ph 5 was obviously lighter due to the reduction of cod table 1 the chroma of the concentrated phase was slightly darker than the fld ph 5 as the soluble salt ions organic matter and tk were concentrated the cooling phase was clarified and transparent 3 2 effect of solar radiation due to the variability of the outdoor weather the fld concentrated efficiency and nutrient recovery from the solar evaporation system were investigated at different solar radiation intensities fig 4 a shows the solar radiation intensity variation on 8 sep 30 oct and 7 nov the concentration efficiency of fld increased with the increase of average daily solar radiation which was 43 33 30 89 and 25 78 when the daily average solar radiation was 773 08 w m2 8 sep 645 63 w m2 7 nov and 487 89 w m2 30 oct respectively fig 4 b the higher the solar radiation the higher the temperature of air and fld after heating fig 4 c the average air temperatures at the heater outlet reached 48 71 c on 8 sep 36 41 c on 7 nov and 32 05 c on 30 oct respectively the average temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the solar air heater was 13 40 c 11 44 c and 8 83 c on these three days similarly the average fld temperatures at the outlet of solar ld heater were 1 98 c 0 96 c and 0 62 c higher than the inlet temperatures which were 43 31 c 35 73 c and 32 34 c the maximum solar radiation was occurred at around1 20 p m on 30 oct corresponding to the air and fld temperatures of the heater outlet also achieved a maximum of 40 5 c and 37 5 c after 1 20 p m the solar radiation dropped sharply followed by a rapid decrease in air and fld temperature of the heater outlet increasing the air temperature at the outlet of the solar air heater i e the air temperature at the inlet of the spray chamber increased its saturated vapor pressure eq s 8 which resulted in more water vapor being carried into the cooling chamber and accelerated the evaporation rajaseenivasan and srithar 2017 as can be seen from fig 4 d the maximum air specific humidity reached 0 077 kgwater kgdry air 0 050 kgwater kgdry air and 0 040 kgwater kgdry air in these three days the average air specific humidity differences between inlet and outlet were 0 038 kgwater kgdry air 0 023 kgwater kgdry air and 0 016 kgwater kgdry air on these three days fig 4 e and f demonstrate the changes of the chemical components in two phases after concentration the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in the concentrated phase declined with the increase of solar radiation by contrast the concentration of nh3 n and soluble salts in the cooling phase raised with increasing solar radiation it occurred because the higher the average daily solar radiation the higher the temperature of fld after heating fig 4 c leading to an increase in the proportion of nh3 in fld which was not favorable for ammonia nitrogen recovery bai et al 2015 this result was in line with those of previous studies wang et al 2020 the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts reached the maximum values of 74 57 and 80 14 on 30 oct there was no distinct difference for cod concentration in the cooling phase it seemed possible that the result was due to the strong chemical bonds of organic compounds e g proteins humic acids amino acids etc which were not easily broken at low temperatures despite the difficulty in decomposing macromolecular organic compounds into small molecular organic compounds the volatile fatty acids released and small molecules carried by air during gas liquid contact result in a small amount of organic matter in the cooling phase de la rubia et al 2010 the ph of the cooling phase was slightly higher than that of the concentrated phase this was due to the higher mass concentration of nh3 n in the dilute phase which made the dilute phase alkaline fig s3a presents the instantaneous efficiency of the solar air heater it can be observed that the thermal efficiency fitted curves of 8 sep and 7 nov were almost identical but the instantaneous efficiency of 30 oct showed a wide variation with fluctuations in solar radiation the average thermal efficiency of the solar air heater was 49 62 on 8 sep 51 55 on 7 nov and 49 58 on 30 oct the average thermal efficiency of the solar ld heater was 56 50 53 16 and 48 13 which decreased slightly with the decrease of solar radiation one reason was that the heat loss of the heater increased when the ambient temperature was low shi et al 2018 the average air humidification efficiency for the three days was 82 11 80 15 and 75 92 respectively 3 3 effect of fld flowrate the fld flowrate may influence the fld temperature at the heater outlet and the transfer of heat and mass in the spray chamber four typical experimental days of 12 and 13 oct 2 and 7 nov were selected for the fld concentration at the flow rate of 6 and 4 l min 4 and 6 l min respectively the daily average solar radiation on these four days was 702 77 w m2 709 62 w m2 699 48 w m2 and 645 63 w m2 and the trends of the instantaneous solar radiation were consistent fig s4 a positive correlation was found between the concentration efficiency and the fld flowrate on 12 and 13 oct and the same result was observed on 2 and 7 nov as presented in fig 5 a the concentration efficiency increased from 33 33 to 35 78 by increasing fld flowrate in the range of 4 l min to 6 l min on 12 and 13 oct and the concentration efficiency increased 2 25 by increasing the fld flowrate in the range of 4 l min to 6 l min on 2 and 7 nov with the increase of fld flowrate the residence time of fld on the absorber plate reduced and less heat was gained resulting in the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the solar ld heater decreased fig 5 c when the fld flowrate increased from 4 l min to 6 l min the average temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the solar ld heater decreased from 1 23 c to 1 00 c on the 12 and 13 oct and 1 12 c to 0 96 c on the 2 and 7 nov it can be seen from fig 5 b and c the air temperature after heating by the air heater was higher than the fld temperature after heating by the ld heater with the full heat and mass transfer between hot air and hot fld in the spray chamber the fld temperature increased accordingly and the higher the fld flowrate the stronger the transfer of the heat and mass which led to a rapid increased in the fld temperature omidi et al 2020 as a result a larger value of vapor was generated and this led to an increase in the productivity of the solar evaporation system the maximum air specific humidify at the outlet of the spray chamber on these four days was 0 061 kgwater kgdry 0 58 kgwater kgdry 0 043 kgwater kgdry and 0 050 kgwater kgdry air respectively fig 5 d the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts on these four days were 60 41 60 12 67 83 63 89 and 70 11 73 29 80 24 75 25 respectively fig 5 e fld flowrate had little effect on the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in contrast the temperature had a greater effect on them which explained the higher recovery for the last two days than the first two days similar results were found for the mass concentration of nh3 n cod and soluble salts the average values of the ph of the concentrated and cooling phases for these four days were 7 43 and 8 42 it is worth noting that the average thermal efficiency of the solar air heater was 63 38 63 75 51 07 and 51 55 which rose with increasing ambient temperature fig s5 a possible explanation for this might be that more heat was lost at low temperatures the average thermal efficiency of the solar ld heater was 49 33 46 80 45 46 and 53 16 the increase of the fld flowrate caused the increase of the heat transfer coefficient and thus resulted in higher efficiency mandal and ghosh 2020 3 4 effect of daily treatment capacity fig 6 a presents the fld concentration efficiency of the solar evaporation system under different daily treatment capacities the fld treatment capacities on 30 oct 3 nov and 4 nov were 45 l 100 l and 200 l respectively although the instantaneous solar radiation of these three days varied widely the average daily solar radiation was close respectively 487 89 w m2 440 46 w m2 and 508 99 w m2 fig s6 the fld concentration efficiency as expected decreased with increasing daily treatment capacity interestingly the cooling water volume increased from 11 60 l to 12 42 l when the daily treatment capacity increased from 45 l to 100 l continued to increase the daily treatment capacity to 200 l however leading to a reduction in condensate volume to 12 03 l it can be seen from fig 6 b that there was no remarkable difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the solar air heater for the three days and the temperature trends were consistent with the instantaneous solar radiation it was worth noting that the fld temperature after heating was up to 37 5 c when the daily treatment volume was 45 l which was visibly higher than the temperature at a daily treatment volume of 100 l and 200 l fig 6 c reducing the daily treatment capacity the cycle number of fld in the heater increased and the fld temperature at the outlet rose the higher the fld temperature the greater energy obtained by the water molecules which made it easier to overcome the gravitation of the neighboring molecules into the air and accelerated evaporation however we found that the highest air specific humidity and the lowest cooling volume were got on 30 oct which can be attributed to the low moisture carrying capacity due to the high air relative humidity at the inlet of the spray chamber the average air relative humidity of the spray chamber inlet was 44 28 36 18 and 32 34 respectively as the fld daily treatment capacity increased from 100 l to 200 l the average fld temperature at the outlet of the solar ld heater decreased from 30 27 c to 28 61 c which caused less water vapor production and a decline in cooling water volume compared to the air humidification efficiency the thermal efficiency of the solar air heater and solar ld heater showed large fluctuations with solar radiation fig s7 after the system runs for about 1 h the air humidification efficiency at the spray chamber outlet was stabilized at 77 82 82 12 and 81 48 as shown in fig 6 e and f the difference of the recovery and the mass concentration of the chemical components under different daily treatment capacities was not apparent which could be explained by the low fld temperature at the heater outlet the average fld temperatures at the heater outlet for these three days were only 32 34 c 30 27 c and 28 61 c which was favorable to the nutrient recovery the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in three days could reach up to 78 39 and 84 19 respectively 3 5 economic analysis the economic study is of great importance to evaluate the cost of the ld concentration by the solar evaporation system because the cost is the key for engineering application based on the actual scale of the biogas plant with an ld treatment capacity of 100 t d the economic analysis was evaluated which hopefully provided a reference in the application of the solar evaporation system for ld concentration the cost mainly included investment cost and operating cost according to the above experimental results the designed ld concentration efficiency was 30 that is 30 t d of the cooling phase obtained table 3 shows the investment and operating cost of the solar evaporation system the investment cost mainly consisted of the solar heater and gas liquid transfer unit and the operating cost was mainly composed of electricity and chemical costs assuming that the solar evaporation system would operate steadily for 20 years the investment cost of the system is 54 06 usd d in addition the operating cost of the system is 54 31 usd d table 3 thus the total concentration cost for ld is 108 37 usd d in other words the concentration cost for a biogas plant with an ld production of 100 t d is 1 08 usd ton 3 6 enviroeconomic analysis in this study the environmental benefits of the solar evaporation system in terms of carbon mitigation were evaluated the total embodied energy of the system was calculated according to the embodied energy of various materials used to manufacture this solar system provided in yousef and hassan 2019 yousef et al 2019 the enviroeconomic parameters for the solar evaporation system are illustrated in table 4 over a lifetime of 20 years the system can reduce co2 emissions by 2 40 105 tons and earn carbon credits of 3 48 106 usd 4 conclusions in this study a solar evaporation system was developed to concentrate liquid digestate ld the system performance under different conditions was evaluated and the economic and enviroeconomic of the solar evaporation system were also analyzed the results indicate that the higher the solar radiation the higher the air temperature and its saturation vapor pressure which led to an increase in the concentration efficiency of ld the ld concentration efficiency can reach up to 43 33 when the average daily solar radiation was 773 08 w m2 the ld concentration efficiency increased with the increase of ld flow rate due to the enhanced heat mass exchange between air and ld in the spray chamber the variation of ld flow rate and daily treatment capacity had little effect on the nutrient recovery however the increase in solar radiation was not conducive to ammonia nitrogen nh3 n recovery mainly because the increased ld temperature led to an increase in the percentage of free ammonia nh3 which was easily lost through volatilization the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts could be as high as 78 39 and 84 19 respectively when the initial ph of ld was 5 the air flow rate was 0 03 m3 s and the ld flow rate was 6 l min in addition the concentration cost of the system in treating a daily ld production of 100 tons was 1 08 usd ton the system can reduce co2 mitigation by 2 40 105 tons and earn carbon credits of 3 48 106 usd over its lifetime the solar evaporation system unlimited by the concentration multiple can be combined with membrane concentration to increase the ld

16317,the safe and efficient treatment and resource recovery of the large amount of liquid digestate ld produced by biogas plants has become an important factor limiting the development of the biogas industry in this study a solar evaporation system was developed based on low cost high efficiency and high nutrient recovery of ld concentration the effects of different parameters including solar radiation ld flowrate and daily treatment capacity on the concentration efficiency nutrient recovery and thermal efficiency were investigated economic and enviroeconomic analyses were conducted to comprehensively assess the feasibility and environmental benefits of the system for large scale biogas plants the results showed that the higher the solar radiation the higher the air temperature and its saturation vapor pressure which led to an increase in the concentration efficiency of ld the ld concentration efficiency can reach up to 43 33 when the average daily solar radiation was 773 08 w m2 high solar radiation also contributed to high ld temperature leading to an increase in the percentage of free ammonia nh3 in the ld which was not conducive to the recovery of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n by increasing the ld flow rate the heat and mass exchange between air and ld in the spray chamber was enhanced resulting in higher concentration efficiency the variation of ld flow rate and daily treatment capacity had little effect on nutrient recovery the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in the concentrated phase could be as high as 78 39 and 84 19 respectively when the initial ph of ld was 5 the air flow rate was 0 03 m3 s and the ld flow rate was 6 l min in addition the economic analysis indicated that the concentration cost of the system in treating a daily ld production of 100 tons was 1 08 usd ton the solar evaporation system can reduce co2 emissions by 2 40 105 tons and earn carbon credits of 3 48 106 usd over its lifetime this study provides a new direction and reference for ld concentration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar evaporation system liquid digestate concentration nutrient recovery heater efficiency economic analysis enviroeconomic analysis 1 introduction the output of organic waste has presented an increasing trend in recent years which poses significant environmental and health challenges to our society it has been reported that almost 3 8 billion tons of livestock manure and more than 150 million tons of municipal organic waste are produced in china each year li et al 2021 anaerobic digestion a typical value added process for organic waste can effectively reduce the volume and mass of organic waste while converting it into value added products such as bioenergy cai et al 2018 pirelli et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 however the liquid digestate ld is produced in large quantities as a by product during anaerobic digestion annually more than one billion tons of ld were produced by 3800 large scale biogas plants in china from 2010 du et al 2019 although ld can be applied as agricultural fertilizer its continuous and substantial production exceeds the carrying capacity of local farmland excessive irrigation of ld to farmland may damage the soil structure and microbial ecosystem as well as cause serious environmental issues because of nutrient leaching and runoff ruan et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 in addition in some cases the distance between biogas plants and farmland is too far to economically justify the transportation cost limiting the farmland application of ld han et al 2015 therefore it is profitable to reduce the volume while enriching the nutrient concentration of ld and saving transportation costs current alternatives for reducing the volume of ld include membrane processes and evaporation román et al 2021 over the past decade several membrane processes have been successfully performed for ld concentration these mainly include microfiltration alengebawy et al 2021 ultrafiltration ledda et al 2013 nanofiltration yang et al 2020 reverse osmosis ruan et al 2015 ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis chiumenti et al 2013b forward osmosis wu et al 2021 and membrane distillation he et al 2018 despite the promise of membrane processes in ld treatment its practical application is limited as membrane processes still face several challenges the critical issue is membrane fouling especially in the case of high initial total solids ts content of the ld which without effective pretreatment and proper membrane filtration will reduce membrane life thereby increasing operating costs and making it very difficult for commercial applications chiumenti et al 2013b wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 vacuum evaporation is also used for ld concentration chiumenti et al 2013a built pilot scale vacuum evaporation plants 0 1 and 0 025 m3 to treat the ld the result showed the considerable capability of the vacuum evaporation process especially in the two stage configuration with acidification in full scale plants energy consumption was estimated to be 5 8 kwhe m3 of digestate and 350 kwht m3 of evaporated water a further possibility to concentrate ld is evaporation with waste heat from the combined heat and power chp unit of a biogas plant in germany ld treatment techniques that use heat are being used more frequently because of the subsidies for waste heat utilization in biogas chp a multi stage vacuum evaporation technology had been executed for ld concentration with a volume reduction of 50 causing a correspondent reduction in transportation costs fuchs and drosg 2013 nevertheless the high requirement of heat and vacuum is economically unfavorable it is necessary to develop a low energy consumption and high concentration efficiency technology to concentrate ld an additional attractive technique is the unconventional composting process of ld chiumenti 2011 composted ld with a clf modil digester which consisted of processing liquid inputs on a bed of bulking absorbing dry material straw wood chips sawdust corn stalks etc to yield a solid product the aerobic conditions introduced by aeration of the biomass caused self heating of the feedstock up to 60 c with relevant evaporation of water leaving a residual solid of about 15 of the input li et al 2012 evaluated the feasibility of co composting of wheat straw and dairy waste according to the findings co composting of wheat straw and ld can consume 1 8 t of ld per 1 0 t of wheat straw however the long compost cycle leads to the low efficiency of ld treatment recently there has been an increasing interest in humidification dehumidification hdh technology for seawater desalination this technology is simple construction convenient operation and control low investment and operating costs and able to run at a low temperature which is beneficial for hdh to integrate with sustainable but low grade energy sources such as solar energy li et al 2019 santosh et al 2020 the hdh technology is based on the principle that air can carry significant amounts of water vapor in the humidification stage the brine comes into direct contact with the air while the water vapor produced by evaporation transfers to the air in the dehumidification stage the water vapor in the air is condensed to produce freshwater ayati et al 2020 our research established a solar evaporation system based on the hdh desalination technology for ld concentration a series of experiments were performed under different solar radiation ld flowrate and daily treatment capacity to investigate the effects of operational parameters on system performance including concentration efficiency nutrient recovery and thermal efficiency furthermore the analysis of economic and enviroeconomic for the solar evaporation system based on a real scale biogas plant with an ld treatment capacity of 100 t d was conducted to assess the system application potential in large and medium scale biogas plants the innovation of this work is to determine the technical economic and environmental feasibility of the solar evaporation system for ld concentration which provides valuable information for the application of this technology in large and medium scale biogas plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials raw liquid digestate rld was collected from an anaerobic digester in wuhan hubei china the digester used swine manure as input for mesophilic anaerobic fermentation the hydraulic retention time was 7 10 d the volume of the anaerobic digester was 2300 m3 and the biogas production was 100 300 m3 d the rld taken from the digester was stored anaerobically at ambient temperature before experiments until no biogas was produced the rld was flocculated to remove the large particle impurities before the experiment 100 g l poly aluminum ferric chloride pafc solution stored in ventilated and protected from light used within 3 d and 2 g l cationic polyacrylamide cpam solution dissolved for more than 1 h within 24 h use were prepared for the rld flocculation pafc solution and cpam solution were added to the rld at dosages of 8 ml l and 3 5 ml l respectively the mixed rld was stirred at a speed of 350 r min for 30 s then stirred at a speed of 40 r min for 20 min wu et al 2019 after standing for about 2 h the supernatant was collected for the experiment the physicochemical properties of the rld and the supernatant of rld after flocculation fld are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental apparatus fig 1 presents a schematic diagram and a photograph of the solar evaporation system the solar evaporation system consists mainly of the solar ld heater solar air heater spray chamber cooling chamber pumps blower and insulated buckets etc the test facility arrangement can be found in fig 1 a the fld was heated as it flowed on the absorber plate in the solar ld heater and the solar energy was thus converted into thermal energy in the form of sensible heat the hot fld was then sprayed into the spray chamber which was filled with filler so that the hot fld was distributed evenly over its surface at the same time the outdoor air was conveyed into the solar air heater and heated by it subsequently the hot air was blown into the spray chamber where the relative humidity of the hot air increased because of heat and mass transfer between the hot air and the hot fld film part of the fld was taken away as the wet air entered the cooling chamber where the wet air was processed to get liquid water the remaining fld flowed from the spray chamber was collected into the bottom basin and return to the insulated bucket to be sprayed again since it was still hot and not so much concentrated the liquid water in the cooling chamber was the cooling phase and the remaining solution in the spray chamber was the concentrated phase 2 2 1 solar ld heater referring to the cascade solar still farshchi tabrizi et al 2010 a solar ld heater was designed which was mainly composed of an absorber plate weirs glass cover and insulation fig s1 the heater was made of 20 steps where each step had specific dimensional characteristics shown in fig s1b each step was staggered equipped with a 1 cm height and 95 cm length weir to force the flowing fld to pass through the absorber plate which led to the residence time increase of fld on the absorber plate a schematic top view of the fld flow path on the absorber plate surface was shown in fig s1c the absorber plate of every layer was with a size of 100 cm 5 cm and coated with matte black paint to increase the absorptivity a glass sheet of 4 mm thick was used to seal the heater the bottom and sidewalls of the heater were well insulated with rubber plastic cotton to reduce heat loss the inclination of the heater was 30 corresponding to the latitude of wuhan china 2 2 2 solar air heater the structure and size of the solar air heater were the same as the solar ld heater except for the length of the weir which was consistent with the absorber plate of 100 cm 2 2 3 spray chamber the spray chamber also called the cooling tower has been used in many chemical processes yuan et al 2011 at the top of the spray chamber a sprayer was installed to feed the spray chamber with hot fld heated by the solar ld heater under the sprayer corrugated polyvinyl chloride filler was filled which could enhance the residence time of fld in the spray chamber and the interface area between the fld and laterally flowing air thus increasing the heat and mass transfer efficiency the insulation bucket at the bottom of the spray chamber was used to collect the concentrated phase after air liquid transfer the spray chamber was well insulated with rubber plastic cotton from all sides the cross sectional area of the spray chamber was 0 8 m 1 5 m 2 2 4 cooling chamber the cooling chamber was composed mainly of the heat transfer of copper tubes with fins the numbers of the tube in the row were 11 with 5 mm spacing the cross sectional area of the cooling chamber was 0 9 m 0 5 m the hot and humid air from the spray chamber went through the cooling chamber and was cooled by cooling water moist air out of the cooling chamber became dry and cold 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments were constructed at the college of engineering huazhong agricultural university china longitude 114 36 e and latitude 30 47 n from sep to nov 2020 first the fld in insulation bucket 1 was pumped into the solar ld heater valve 1 was used to control the flow rate of the fld in the heater the heated fld flowed into bucket 2 and then was sprayed into the spray chamber valve 2 was used to adjust the fld spray rate in the spray chamber so that it was the same as the flow rate in the heater after the heat and mass transfer between the fld and air in the spray chamber the remaining fld flowed back into the insulation bucket 1 to be cyclically concentrated with a cycle time of 8 h d the concentrated phase and the cooling phase were collected after the daily experiment for analysis 2 4 chemical analysis there are many indicators to determine the nutrient recovery efficiency including ph electrical conductivity ec ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and chemical oxygen demand cod the chemical analysis has been reported previously wang et al 2020 2 5 system performance evaluation index the evaluation indexes of the solar evaporation system include concentration efficiency nutrient recovery the thermal efficiency of solar ld heater and solar air heater and the air humidification efficiency of the spray chamber the calculation process and uncertainty analysis are shown in s1 2 6 enviroeconomic analysis the solar evaporation system uses renewable energy as a heat source reducing fossil fuel consumption and helping to reduce co2 emissions unfortunately the raw materials such as iron steel insulation and glass which are fabricated using the electricity produced by fossil fuels resources used to manufacture the solar evaporation system come with the release of co2 yousef and hassan 2019 yousef et al 2019 2 6 1 co2 emissions the accumulated energy from the initial production of raw materials to the final fabrication installation and operation of the equipment is called embodied energy which is calculated by multiplying the energy density of each section of the solar evaporation system by their corresponding mass omidi et al 2020 yousef et al 2019 co2 emissions can be considered to be generated by the embodied energy of the solar evaporation system module the amount of co2 produced is 2 kg kw h omidi et al 2020 thus 1 c o 2 emissions during the lifetime ton e e m 2 1000 where e e m is the embodied energy of the solar evaporation system kw h 2 6 2 co2 mitigation the solar evaporation system uses renewable energy and without the consumption of fossil fuels which reduces co2 emissions therefore co2 mitigation during the lifetime from the solar evaporation system is given as elbar et al 2019 2 c o 2 mitigation during the lifetime ton e t h n 2 1000 where e t h is the annual thermal energy needed for ld concentration kw h and n is the lifetime of the system the environmental analysis can be defined as follows 3 c o 2 e t h n e e m 2 1000 where c o 2 is the total co2 mitigation over the lifetime of the solar evaporation system ton 2 6 3 carbon credit gained the enviroeconomic approach defines the annual revenue from co2 mitigation over the lifetime for the solar evaporation system elbar et al 2019 currently the price of co2 mitigation is estimated to be about 14 5 usd ton yousef et al 2019 the enviroeconomic parameter can be presented as follows 4 z c o 2 c o 2 14 5 where z c o 2 is the carbon credit gained by the solar evaporation system over the lifetime usd 3 results and discussion 3 1 acid pretreatment of fld previous studies chiumenti et al 2013a wang et al 2020 have shown that concentrating ld by evaporation can lead to a significant loss of nh3 n while acidic conditions ph 6 facilitate nh3 n recovery in addition evaporation has little effect on tp and tk in ld bai et al 2015 wang et al 2020 before the experiment of fld concentration by the solar evaporation system the initial ph of fld was adjusted to 5 with sulfuric acid and the nutrient content in the two phases concentrated phase and cooling phase after concentration was analyzed the effect of acid pretreatment on nutrient recovery after concentration was investigated on 7 sep and 8 sep it can be seen from fig s2 that the daily average solar radiation of 7 sep 794 74 w m2 and 8 sep 773 08 w m2 was almost the same and the air temperature and fld temperature before and after heating were not much different fig 2 shows the changes of the components in the two phases after fld concentration under different initial ph when the initial ph of fld was 8 65 7 sep the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in the concentrated phase was only 6 42 and 38 21 while the nh3 n concentration and ec value in the cooling phase reached 2896 68 mg l and 0 31 ms cm respectively when the initial ph of fld was 5 8 sep the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salt in the concentrated phase increased to 53 31 and 63 88 and the nh3 n concentration and ec value in the cooling phase fell to 159 30 mg l and 0 15 ms cm respectively the cod concentration in the cooling phase reduced from 100 65 mg l to 86 6 mg l when the fld initial ph was from 8 65 to 5 nitrogen in the ld usually exists in the form of free ammonia nh3 and ammonium nh 4 and the nh 4 is more stable compared to nh3 liao et al 1995 the concentration of nh3 and nh 4 is in dynamic equilibrium in ld mainly influenced by temperature and ph guštin and marinšek logar 2011 the relationship between nh3 and nh 4 in ld is given as lei et al 2007 5 n h 3 n h 3 nh 4 1 h k a where n h 3 is the nh3 concentration mol l n h 3 nh 4 is the total ammonia concentration mol l h is the hydrogen ion concentration mol l and k a is the acid ionization constant of ammonia mol l pka can be expressed as a function of temperature by the following equation eq 6 6 p k a 4 10 8 t 3 9 10 5 t 2 0 0356 t 10 072 based on eq 5 and 6 the percentage of nh3 in the ld under different temperatures and ph was calculated table 2 it can be seen that the percentage of nh3 increased with increasing temperature and initial ph of the ld which was unfavorable to the recovery of nh3 n and this finding was consistent with our experimental results the trend of ec recovery was consistent with that of nh3 n the main reason was that the content of nh3 n in the ld varied greatly during evaporation while other salt ions such as so2 4 cl na and k were non volatile substances and the concentrations changed little which had less influence on the ec value of the concentrated phase guo et al 2018 table 1 shows the physicochemical properties of each fraction before and after concentration initial ph 5 the concentration of cod and tp in the fld decreased obviously whereas the other components changed slightly adjusting the initial ph of the fld to 5 had little effect on the concentration of the components the ec value cod and tk concentration in the concentrated phase was higher than the input indicating that the organic matter e g proteins humic acids amino acids etc and soluble salt ions in the fld were effectively concentrated the concentration of nh3 n in the concentrated phase on the other hand was slightly lower than the input which occurred probably because of the concentration difference of ammonia between the fld and air during the mass transfer resulting in a considerable ammonia loss guštin and marinšek logar 2011 due to the low input concentration of tp almost no tp was obtained in the concentrated phase the content of each component in the cooling phase was low and the concentration of cod and tp met the emission requirements for the livestock and poultry breeding industry the maximum allowable daily discharge standards of pollutants were not higher than 400 mg l for cod and not higher than 8 0 mg l for tp according to gb 18 596 2001 fig 3 displays the visual appearance of rld fld ph 5 concentrated phase and cooling phase the chroma of the fld ph 5 was obviously lighter due to the reduction of cod table 1 the chroma of the concentrated phase was slightly darker than the fld ph 5 as the soluble salt ions organic matter and tk were concentrated the cooling phase was clarified and transparent 3 2 effect of solar radiation due to the variability of the outdoor weather the fld concentrated efficiency and nutrient recovery from the solar evaporation system were investigated at different solar radiation intensities fig 4 a shows the solar radiation intensity variation on 8 sep 30 oct and 7 nov the concentration efficiency of fld increased with the increase of average daily solar radiation which was 43 33 30 89 and 25 78 when the daily average solar radiation was 773 08 w m2 8 sep 645 63 w m2 7 nov and 487 89 w m2 30 oct respectively fig 4 b the higher the solar radiation the higher the temperature of air and fld after heating fig 4 c the average air temperatures at the heater outlet reached 48 71 c on 8 sep 36 41 c on 7 nov and 32 05 c on 30 oct respectively the average temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the solar air heater was 13 40 c 11 44 c and 8 83 c on these three days similarly the average fld temperatures at the outlet of solar ld heater were 1 98 c 0 96 c and 0 62 c higher than the inlet temperatures which were 43 31 c 35 73 c and 32 34 c the maximum solar radiation was occurred at around1 20 p m on 30 oct corresponding to the air and fld temperatures of the heater outlet also achieved a maximum of 40 5 c and 37 5 c after 1 20 p m the solar radiation dropped sharply followed by a rapid decrease in air and fld temperature of the heater outlet increasing the air temperature at the outlet of the solar air heater i e the air temperature at the inlet of the spray chamber increased its saturated vapor pressure eq s 8 which resulted in more water vapor being carried into the cooling chamber and accelerated the evaporation rajaseenivasan and srithar 2017 as can be seen from fig 4 d the maximum air specific humidity reached 0 077 kgwater kgdry air 0 050 kgwater kgdry air and 0 040 kgwater kgdry air in these three days the average air specific humidity differences between inlet and outlet were 0 038 kgwater kgdry air 0 023 kgwater kgdry air and 0 016 kgwater kgdry air on these three days fig 4 e and f demonstrate the changes of the chemical components in two phases after concentration the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in the concentrated phase declined with the increase of solar radiation by contrast the concentration of nh3 n and soluble salts in the cooling phase raised with increasing solar radiation it occurred because the higher the average daily solar radiation the higher the temperature of fld after heating fig 4 c leading to an increase in the proportion of nh3 in fld which was not favorable for ammonia nitrogen recovery bai et al 2015 this result was in line with those of previous studies wang et al 2020 the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts reached the maximum values of 74 57 and 80 14 on 30 oct there was no distinct difference for cod concentration in the cooling phase it seemed possible that the result was due to the strong chemical bonds of organic compounds e g proteins humic acids amino acids etc which were not easily broken at low temperatures despite the difficulty in decomposing macromolecular organic compounds into small molecular organic compounds the volatile fatty acids released and small molecules carried by air during gas liquid contact result in a small amount of organic matter in the cooling phase de la rubia et al 2010 the ph of the cooling phase was slightly higher than that of the concentrated phase this was due to the higher mass concentration of nh3 n in the dilute phase which made the dilute phase alkaline fig s3a presents the instantaneous efficiency of the solar air heater it can be observed that the thermal efficiency fitted curves of 8 sep and 7 nov were almost identical but the instantaneous efficiency of 30 oct showed a wide variation with fluctuations in solar radiation the average thermal efficiency of the solar air heater was 49 62 on 8 sep 51 55 on 7 nov and 49 58 on 30 oct the average thermal efficiency of the solar ld heater was 56 50 53 16 and 48 13 which decreased slightly with the decrease of solar radiation one reason was that the heat loss of the heater increased when the ambient temperature was low shi et al 2018 the average air humidification efficiency for the three days was 82 11 80 15 and 75 92 respectively 3 3 effect of fld flowrate the fld flowrate may influence the fld temperature at the heater outlet and the transfer of heat and mass in the spray chamber four typical experimental days of 12 and 13 oct 2 and 7 nov were selected for the fld concentration at the flow rate of 6 and 4 l min 4 and 6 l min respectively the daily average solar radiation on these four days was 702 77 w m2 709 62 w m2 699 48 w m2 and 645 63 w m2 and the trends of the instantaneous solar radiation were consistent fig s4 a positive correlation was found between the concentration efficiency and the fld flowrate on 12 and 13 oct and the same result was observed on 2 and 7 nov as presented in fig 5 a the concentration efficiency increased from 33 33 to 35 78 by increasing fld flowrate in the range of 4 l min to 6 l min on 12 and 13 oct and the concentration efficiency increased 2 25 by increasing the fld flowrate in the range of 4 l min to 6 l min on 2 and 7 nov with the increase of fld flowrate the residence time of fld on the absorber plate reduced and less heat was gained resulting in the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the solar ld heater decreased fig 5 c when the fld flowrate increased from 4 l min to 6 l min the average temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the solar ld heater decreased from 1 23 c to 1 00 c on the 12 and 13 oct and 1 12 c to 0 96 c on the 2 and 7 nov it can be seen from fig 5 b and c the air temperature after heating by the air heater was higher than the fld temperature after heating by the ld heater with the full heat and mass transfer between hot air and hot fld in the spray chamber the fld temperature increased accordingly and the higher the fld flowrate the stronger the transfer of the heat and mass which led to a rapid increased in the fld temperature omidi et al 2020 as a result a larger value of vapor was generated and this led to an increase in the productivity of the solar evaporation system the maximum air specific humidify at the outlet of the spray chamber on these four days was 0 061 kgwater kgdry 0 58 kgwater kgdry 0 043 kgwater kgdry and 0 050 kgwater kgdry air respectively fig 5 d the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts on these four days were 60 41 60 12 67 83 63 89 and 70 11 73 29 80 24 75 25 respectively fig 5 e fld flowrate had little effect on the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in contrast the temperature had a greater effect on them which explained the higher recovery for the last two days than the first two days similar results were found for the mass concentration of nh3 n cod and soluble salts the average values of the ph of the concentrated and cooling phases for these four days were 7 43 and 8 42 it is worth noting that the average thermal efficiency of the solar air heater was 63 38 63 75 51 07 and 51 55 which rose with increasing ambient temperature fig s5 a possible explanation for this might be that more heat was lost at low temperatures the average thermal efficiency of the solar ld heater was 49 33 46 80 45 46 and 53 16 the increase of the fld flowrate caused the increase of the heat transfer coefficient and thus resulted in higher efficiency mandal and ghosh 2020 3 4 effect of daily treatment capacity fig 6 a presents the fld concentration efficiency of the solar evaporation system under different daily treatment capacities the fld treatment capacities on 30 oct 3 nov and 4 nov were 45 l 100 l and 200 l respectively although the instantaneous solar radiation of these three days varied widely the average daily solar radiation was close respectively 487 89 w m2 440 46 w m2 and 508 99 w m2 fig s6 the fld concentration efficiency as expected decreased with increasing daily treatment capacity interestingly the cooling water volume increased from 11 60 l to 12 42 l when the daily treatment capacity increased from 45 l to 100 l continued to increase the daily treatment capacity to 200 l however leading to a reduction in condensate volume to 12 03 l it can be seen from fig 6 b that there was no remarkable difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures of the solar air heater for the three days and the temperature trends were consistent with the instantaneous solar radiation it was worth noting that the fld temperature after heating was up to 37 5 c when the daily treatment volume was 45 l which was visibly higher than the temperature at a daily treatment volume of 100 l and 200 l fig 6 c reducing the daily treatment capacity the cycle number of fld in the heater increased and the fld temperature at the outlet rose the higher the fld temperature the greater energy obtained by the water molecules which made it easier to overcome the gravitation of the neighboring molecules into the air and accelerated evaporation however we found that the highest air specific humidity and the lowest cooling volume were got on 30 oct which can be attributed to the low moisture carrying capacity due to the high air relative humidity at the inlet of the spray chamber the average air relative humidity of the spray chamber inlet was 44 28 36 18 and 32 34 respectively as the fld daily treatment capacity increased from 100 l to 200 l the average fld temperature at the outlet of the solar ld heater decreased from 30 27 c to 28 61 c which caused less water vapor production and a decline in cooling water volume compared to the air humidification efficiency the thermal efficiency of the solar air heater and solar ld heater showed large fluctuations with solar radiation fig s7 after the system runs for about 1 h the air humidification efficiency at the spray chamber outlet was stabilized at 77 82 82 12 and 81 48 as shown in fig 6 e and f the difference of the recovery and the mass concentration of the chemical components under different daily treatment capacities was not apparent which could be explained by the low fld temperature at the heater outlet the average fld temperatures at the heater outlet for these three days were only 32 34 c 30 27 c and 28 61 c which was favorable to the nutrient recovery the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts in three days could reach up to 78 39 and 84 19 respectively 3 5 economic analysis the economic study is of great importance to evaluate the cost of the ld concentration by the solar evaporation system because the cost is the key for engineering application based on the actual scale of the biogas plant with an ld treatment capacity of 100 t d the economic analysis was evaluated which hopefully provided a reference in the application of the solar evaporation system for ld concentration the cost mainly included investment cost and operating cost according to the above experimental results the designed ld concentration efficiency was 30 that is 30 t d of the cooling phase obtained table 3 shows the investment and operating cost of the solar evaporation system the investment cost mainly consisted of the solar heater and gas liquid transfer unit and the operating cost was mainly composed of electricity and chemical costs assuming that the solar evaporation system would operate steadily for 20 years the investment cost of the system is 54 06 usd d in addition the operating cost of the system is 54 31 usd d table 3 thus the total concentration cost for ld is 108 37 usd d in other words the concentration cost for a biogas plant with an ld production of 100 t d is 1 08 usd ton 3 6 enviroeconomic analysis in this study the environmental benefits of the solar evaporation system in terms of carbon mitigation were evaluated the total embodied energy of the system was calculated according to the embodied energy of various materials used to manufacture this solar system provided in yousef and hassan 2019 yousef et al 2019 the enviroeconomic parameters for the solar evaporation system are illustrated in table 4 over a lifetime of 20 years the system can reduce co2 emissions by 2 40 105 tons and earn carbon credits of 3 48 106 usd 4 conclusions in this study a solar evaporation system was developed to concentrate liquid digestate ld the system performance under different conditions was evaluated and the economic and enviroeconomic of the solar evaporation system were also analyzed the results indicate that the higher the solar radiation the higher the air temperature and its saturation vapor pressure which led to an increase in the concentration efficiency of ld the ld concentration efficiency can reach up to 43 33 when the average daily solar radiation was 773 08 w m2 the ld concentration efficiency increased with the increase of ld flow rate due to the enhanced heat mass exchange between air and ld in the spray chamber the variation of ld flow rate and daily treatment capacity had little effect on the nutrient recovery however the increase in solar radiation was not conducive to ammonia nitrogen nh3 n recovery mainly because the increased ld temperature led to an increase in the percentage of free ammonia nh3 which was easily lost through volatilization the recovery of nh3 n and soluble salts could be as high as 78 39 and 84 19 respectively when the initial ph of ld was 5 the air flow rate was 0 03 m3 s and the ld flow rate was 6 l min in addition the concentration cost of the system in treating a daily ld production of 100 tons was 1 08 usd ton the system can reduce co2 mitigation by 2 40 105 tons and earn carbon credits of 3 48 106 usd over its lifetime the solar evaporation system unlimited by the concentration multiple can be combined with membrane concentration to increase the ld

16318,this study investigated the overall occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of 19 progestogens in 608 samples collected from 17 wastewater treatment plants wwtps distributed across china during four seasons the aqueous removal efficiencies of progestogens were calculated and the efficacies of process segments secondary and advanced processes and process units in the removal of progestogens were explored the results indicated that progestogens were widely detected in investigating wwtps with the progesterone dydrogesterone dienogest ethisterone and norethindrone were always dominant in the influent secondary effluent final effluent and excess sludge seasonally the influent exhibited more variability than the other matrices that 10 progestogens concentrations varied significantly during the four seasons spatially the influent concentrations of progestogens were generally higher in northern wwtps than that in southern wwtps during spring and summer eight progestogens were stably removed by the wwtps across seasons and most progestogens varied considerably in removal in different wwtps the conventional process segment was the dominant contributor to progestogen removal the anaerobic anoxic oxic process and a combined process consisting of densadeg and cloth media filter and ultraviolet disinfection showed the highest removal of progestogens among various secondary and advanced treatment processes respectively mass balance analysis showed that most progestogens were effectively eliminated in the aerobic unit with biodegradation being the primary removal pathway this study presents the first picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the distribution of progestogens in wwtps of china and provides valuable information for better understanding of the occurrence and removal of progestogens in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords progestogens wastewater treatment plants spatiotemporal distribution removal 1 introduction environmental progestogens a category of endocrine disruptors have been widely detected in environmental matrices such as surface water in recent years weizel et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 progestogens can adversely affect the reproduction and behavior of indigenous aquatic organisms at low concentrations ng l which has drawn widespread concern among researchers and the public sauer et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are perceived to be a substantial contributor to progestogens discharged into the environment sauer et al 2018 yarahmadi et al 2018 understanding the occurrence and removal of progestogens in wwtps could improve the abatement of progestogen contamination the occurrence of certain progestogens in wwtps from several countries has been reported in previous studies viglino et al 2008 weizel et al 2018 yarahmadi et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 for example progesterone was widely detected in six wwtps surveyed in switzerland at concentrations reaching 73 ng l in influent and 3 3 ng l in effluent zhang et al 2017 norethindrone and levonorgestrel were the two dominant progestogens in the investigated wwtps in canada with concentrations up to 205 and 170 ng l in influent and 53 and 30 ng l in effluent respectively viglino et al 2008 yarahmadi et al 2018 reports on the occurrence of progestogens in wwtps have focused on short term investigations of a few progestogens in wwtps or on the investigations of a few wwtps fernandez et al 2007 viglino et al 2008 vulliet et al 2007 yu et al 2019 to adequately profile the occurrence of micropollutants in wwtps vigorous monitoring campaigns are required including the sampling of contaminants across seasons in well organized spatial resolution tran et al 2018 yarahmadi et al 2018 however information on the temporal or spatial variation of multiple progestogens in wwtps is limited manickum and john 2014 reported that the concentrations of progesterone in influent varied by sampling seasons and sauer et al 2018 reported that the concentrations of progesterone megestrol acetate and dienogest in the influent varied by sampling citiy a systematic investigation of the overall occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of diverse categories of progestogens in wwtps distributed across china during different seasons has not yet been conducted research on the removal efficiency of progestogens by wwtps has primarily focused on the removal efficiency in a specific season shen et al 2019 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2016 for example the removal of norethindrone in wwtps was reported in summer with removal efficiencies ranging from 70 to 100 xu et al 2016 seasonal differences in the removal efficiency of estrogens from wwtps have been observed lopez velazquez et al 2021 manickum and john 2014 however information on the removal efficiency of progestogens in wwtps in different seasons has not been well documented removal efficiencies of progestogens in wwtps commonly vary considerably in some countries sauer et al 2018 xu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 for example removal efficiencies of dienogest in wwtps from czech and slovak republics ranged from 2 6 to 93 7 and that of drospirenone in chinese wwtps ranged from 135 to 100 sauer et al 2018 yu et al 2019 treatment processes are essential components of wwtps and understanding the removal of progestogens from a treatment process perspective could contribute to improving their treatment in wwtps patel et al 2019 the removal of certain progestogens has been extensively studied by specific treatment processes in lab scale such as activated sludge and ultraviolet photolysis processes narvaez et al 2019 weizel et al 2021 yu et al 2018 comparatively comparisons of the contribution of different process segments of wwtps to the overall removal of progestogens and the removal performance of progestogens by the treatment processes used in wwtps are still lacking the objectives of this study were to concurrently investigate the overall occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of progestogens in wwtps distributed across 17 cities in china during four seasons the aqueous removal efficiency of progestogens in wwtps was calculated during the four seasons and the contributions of conventional and advanced treatment segments were compared the removal performance of various secondary and advanced treatment processes in wwtps for progestogens was evaluated using quantitative meta analysis furthermore the removal of progestogens by anaerobic anoxic and aerobic units of the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process was explored using mass balance analysis to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive and large scale investigation of the spatiotemporal distribution of progestogens in wwtps of china and to enhance understanding of progestogens removal by wwtps through the treatment process perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents nineteen target progestogens belonging to nine categories

n 446 and excess sludge n 162 samples were obtained from 17 municipal wwtps located in 17 cities in china four sampling campaigns were conducted from september 2018 to august 2019 and the sampling interval of each wwtp was controlled at approximately three months during the sampling campaigns the wwtps were operated under normal conditions information on the investigated wwtps including geographical location treatment processes and influent quality is provided in figs s1 s2 and table s2 the influent secondary effluent and excess sludge were taken from 17 wwtps and the final effluent was collected from 14 wwtps other than the three wwtps hlj fj and bj at least two replicates of each sample type were obtained from each site mass flux samples were collected from a wwtp zj located in zhejiang province and detailed information is shown in text s2 the wastewater treatment process was divided into conventional and advanced process segments by the boundary of the secondary sedimentation tank with the samples of conventional and advanced process segments taken from the influent secondary effluent and final effluent of 14 wwtps twenty four hour composite wastewater samples were collected by refrigerated automatic samplers br 8000d boshirui china with a sampling time interval of 2 h prior to sampling 4 m sulfuric acid was spiked in all sampling bottles 1 2000 v v to prevent biodegradation secondary and final effluents were sampled while considering the hydraulic retention time hrt of the wastewater in the wwtp sludge samples were generally collected three times randomly morning afternoon and evening and mixed in stainless steel buckets on the sampling day wastewater and sludge samples were sub sampled into pre cleaned amber glass bottles 1 l wastewater samples were adjusted to ph 3 with 4 m sulfuric acid and sodium azide was added to the sludge sample at a final concentration of approximately 1 g kg to prevent degradation of the compounds liu et al 2014 after sealing without headspace samples were immediately transported back to the laboratory in the darkness and kept around 4 c throughout the process wastewater samples were filtered with gf f 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters whatman maidstone uk after filtration 100 μl of internal standard 1 mg l was added to 500 ml of influent and 1 l of effluent respectively wastewater samples were extracted immediately and were completed within 12 h sludge samples were freeze dried homogenized and sieved 100 mesh and the internal standard 10 ng was added to the sludge samples 0 5 g immediately extracted after adequate mixture 2 3 analytical procedure and quality control analytical procedures for the samples were slightly modified based on previous studies liu et al 2014 briefly samples were extracted using oasis hlb cartridges text s3 and fig s3 after cartridge pretreatment the samples were loaded onto the cartridge and eluted with 10 ml ethyl acetate the eluate was dried under nitrogen flow and then re dissolved with 0 5 ml of methanol sludge samples were extracted by ultrasonication with ethyl acetate three times and the extract was re dissolved in 1 ml methanol and then further purified using oasis hlb cartridges and the extracts were reconstituted to 0 5 ml by methanol after centrifugation the supernatants were transferred to a 200 μl glass lined pipe and analyzed by the ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms waters corp milford ma usa during the whole procedure quality assurance and quality control qa qc were carried out field and transport blanks were performed for the sampling campaigns of each wwtp the limit of quantification loq was calculated with an analyte signal to noise ratio of 10 1 and the loq of progestogens ranged from 0 10 ng l to 1 99 ng l in wastewater and 0 16 ng g to 0 87 ng g dry weight dw in sludge the mean spiked recoveries of progestogens in different matrices ranged from 70 to 116 table s3 detailed analytical procedures and qa qc are shown in text s4 2 4 quantitative meta analysis quantitative meta analysis provides a comprehensive data presentation of different processes the results of each process are presented using the average standardized removal efficiency sre of all progestogens 95 confidence intervals to avoid possible bias caused by the anomalous results of different processes the sre values for each progestogen were weighted according to the number of data points available for each process the sre for each process for each progestogen was calculated using eq 1 1 sre χ μ σ n n where χ represents the removal efficiency of each progestogen μ represents the average removal efficiency for each progestogen across all processes σ represents the standard deviation of the removal efficiencies of each progestogen across all processes n is the number of data points obtained for each process and n is the total number of data points for a specific compound across all processes 2 5 mass balances analysis the mass flux from each unit of the aao process was calculated by multiplying the concentration of individual progestogens by the average daily flux for each treatment unit equation in text s2 mass change percentage for each progestogen in the aao process was calculated using eq 2 2 mcp m i n f l o w m o u t f l o w m i n f l o w 100 where mcp represents the mass change percentage of individual progestogens and mf inflow and mf outflow represent the mass flux of individual progestogens in the inflow and outflow from the treatment unit respectively 2 6 statistical analysis concentrations less than method limit of detection lod were set at zero and those below loq but above lod were defined as half of the respective loq for statistical analysis non parametric kruskal wallis test or mann whitney u test was used to compare differences in the concentrations of progestogens in samples from different seasons or locations and correlation analysis was performed using spearman s rank correlation test the significant differences of average sre for all progestogens were analyzed using permutation tests student s t test was used to compare differences in mass change percentages of each progestogen in the treatment unit statistical analysis was performed using the software program ibm spss version 20 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa and statistical significance was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall occurrence of progestogens in seventeen wwtps during four seasons the detection frequencies dfs concentrations and compositions of progestogens in 17 wwtps over a span of four seasons are shown in figs 1 s4 s5 and table s4 in influent ten out of nineteen target progestogens demonstrated the dfs above 70 with the concentration of individual progestogens ranging from non detected nd to 138 ng l the p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete were the predominant progestogens fig 2 a which could be closely associated with the widespread application of these progestogens in china zhang et al 2014b progestogens including p4 and ddg were the main consumption in countries where progestogens consumption statistics are available britain switzerland and france besse and garric 2009 fent 2015 runnalls et al 2010 the concentrations of p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete in influent were nd 138 ng l nd 109 ng l nd 29 3 ng l nd 31 7 ng l and nd 44 6 ng l which were higher or comparable to the majority of those in the literature golovko et al 2018 sauer et al 2018 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 this could be attributed to discrepancies in the consumption of progestogens across various countries fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 the dfs and concentrations of most progestogens were decreased after treatment by the wwtps specifically the dfs of only five and six target progestogens were above 70 in secondary and final effluent respectively with the concentration of individual progestogens ranging from nd to 21 6 ng l the p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete were remained the predominant progestogens in secondary and final effluents respectively the concentrations of p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete in secondary and final effluent were nd 21 6 ng l nd 14 9 ng l nd 7 01 ng l nd 5 80 ng l and nd 7 63 ng l respectively which were lower or comparable than most of the reported values al odaini et al 2010 fernandez et al 2007 sauer et al 2018 vulliet et al 2007 this could be attributed to discrepancies in influent concentrations of these progestogens yarahmadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and the removal performance of wwtps fent 2015 weizel et al 2018 the concentration of individual progestogens in excess sludge ranged from nd to 16 2 ng g dw and the p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete were the predominant progestogens in excess sludge compared with the influent and effluent the dfs of progestogens were lower in excess sludge with only two progestogens ddg and dsp were above 70 which could be associated with the low octanol water partitioning coefficients kow of most progestogens previous studies have indicated that hydrophobic compounds log kow 4 were more readily adsorbed on solid particles kumar et al 2015 3 2 temporal and spatial variation of progestogens in wwtps overall a significant seasonal difference was observed in progestogens concentrations detected in the wwtps kruskal wallis test p 0 05 fig 2b specifically the total concentrations of progestogens detected in influent of individual wwtps showed seasonal differences in which over 80 of wwtps were significantly varied in the four seasons kruskal wallis test p 0 05 the highest concentrations of most progestogens were detected in winter where nine progestogens including ddg ete and dnt were detected at the highest concentrations in winter and the concentrations of six progestogens including p4 and ntd were detected at the second highest in winter fig 2a additionally concentrations of cma cpa ddg dnt ete gde mga nga ntd and p4 were significantly varied kruskal wallis test p 0 05 among the four seasons fig s6 for example the concentration of ddg was significantly higher in winter median 40 3 ng l and lower in spring median 5 11 ng l than in other seasons while the concentrations of p4 were significantly higher in autumn median 30 3 ng l than in other seasons mann whitney u test p 0 01 seasonal variation of p4 concentrations was also observed in influent of wwtps in greece which had higher concentrations in spring nd 213 ng l and winter nd 275 ng l but was not detected in summer and autumn papageorgiou et al 2016 in this context the concentration of progestogens in wwtps may be underestimated or overestimated when sampling was conducted in only one season the seasonal variation in the concentrations of progestogens in secondary effluent final effluent and excess sludge was dramatically smaller than that in influent figs 2a and s7 this could be mainly attributed to the removal of progestogens by the wwtps which eliminated the seasonal variation of some progestogens in influent manickum and john 2014 nevertheless concentrations of dnt lng mta and p4 in secondary effluent and cpa ddg dnt p4 in final effluent and ddg and mp in excess sludge were still significantly varied kruskal wallis test p 0 05 among different seasons figs s8 s10 generally spatial patterns of progestogens in influent varied by the sampling season concentrations of individual progestogens in influent of various wwtps had significant variations at the overall level in spring kruskal wallis test p 0 05 fig 2c but these significant differences were not observed in summer autumn and winter fig s11 interestingly differences in progestogens concentrations among different wwtps were confirmed sideways by using the median concentrations of individual progestogens in all wwtps as a baseline for example in winter compared with the median concentrations of individual progestogens for all wwtps the concentration of individual progestogens in wwtp sd was significantly higher while the wwtp cs was significantly lower mann whitney u test p 0 01 these differences could be related to the different characteristics of the wwtps such as the urban characteristics where wwtps are located population size served by wwtps and influent quality petrie et al 2015 yu et al 2019 notably concentrations of progestogens were commonly observed to be higher in northern than in southern wwtps in spring and summer mann whitney u test p 0 05 and the concentrations of progestogens in wwtps located in northern were generally comparable to those in southern wwtps in autumn and winter figs 2d and s12 this could be associated with consumption patterns of these regions during different seasons zhang et al 2014b factors driving the spatiotemporal variation of progestogens concentrations in influent of wwtps were explored using canonical correspondence analysis cca various variables including urban characteristics influent quality and wwtp characteristics were considered details in text s5 the results indicated that the spatiotemporal variation of progestogens was driven by various factors such as gross domestic product gdp chemical oxygen demand cod and service population with a greater effect of the urban characteristics and the influent quality fig 2e specifically the gdp cod and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n showed a statistically significant positive correlation mann whitney u test p 0 05 previous studies have found that estrogens concentrations were considerably influenced by the development level of regions where wwtps are located nas et al 2021 the concentrations of certain progestogens in influent were influenced by the influent quality yu et al 2019 besides the progestogens usage pattern was also speculated as a driver in the current study but was not statistically analyzed due to the absence of corresponding usage data in china 3 3 aqueous removal efficiencies of progestogens aqueous removal efficiencies of progestogens except for ngm dfs 20 in influent were calculated by comparing the concentrations of individual progestogens in influent and final effluent the removal efficiency of progestogens over a span of four seasons ranged from 298 nga to 100 mta figs 3 a and s13 specifically eight progestogens were stably removed by the wwtps in the four seasons with median removal efficiencies of 96 3 04 for cma 94 4 47 for mta 91 3 25 for ddg 90 5 91 for cm 89 5 07 for dsp 89 4 91 for nta 88 5 63 for ntd and 87 5 71 for p4 similar removal efficiencies of these progestogens in several wwtps have been reported for example ntd and nta could be almost removed in wwtps besse and garric 2009 wu et al 2017 additionally p4 was effectively removed in swiss wwtps with removal efficiencies of 94 12 respectively zhang et al 2017 the median removal efficiencies of six progestogens varied considerably across the four seasons with median removal efficiencies of 87 12 4 for dnt 89 18 8 for 21α hp 78 21 3 for mp 74 25 3 for nga 67 39 3 for lng and 61 32 2 for gde the reasons for these discrepancies could be the wide seasonal variation in concentrations of those progestogens in influent and that the removal was affected greatly by heterogeneity from different seasons such as influent quality and temperature manickum and john 2014 patel et al 2019 comparatively discrepancies in the removal efficiency of progestogens by different wwtps were more commonly observed even in the same season for example in spring the removal efficiencies of ete ranged from 210 to 96 and ndt ranged from 66 to 100 in the investigated wwtps similarly several studies also observed the considerable differences in the removal efficiencies of progestogens from different wwtps sauer et al 2018 xu et al 2016 this could be attributed to different factors in specific wwtps such as treatment processes ben et al 2018 di marcantonio et al 2020 patel et al 2019 3 4 exploring progestogens removal from the treatment process perspective 3 4 1 contributions of conventional and advanced processes segment contributions of conventional and advanced process segments in wwtps to the removal efficiency of progestogens were compared by calculating the concentrations of influent secondary effluent and final effluent the results showed that the conventional process segment was the dominant contributor to the removal of target progestogens in different seasons the lowest removal contributions of different target progestogens by the conventional process segments were up to 70 ete 85 nga 73 nga and 73 cm in spring summer autumn and winter respectively figs 3b and s14 this could be attributed to the excellent bioavailability of the progestogens weizel et al 2021 yu et al 2018 for some micropollutants that are relatively susceptible to biodegradation biological treatment tends to have higher removal efficiencies than physicochemical treatment lajeunesse et al 2012 wu et al 2020 besides conventional processes segment commonly have longer hrt which contributes to more efficient removal of micropollutants gros et al 2010 comparably the advanced processes segment had a lower removal contribution of progestogens in different seasons the highest removal contributions of different target progestogens in spring summer autumn and winter were only 30 ete 15 nga 27 nga and 27 cm respectively although the removal contribution of the advanced process segment was relatively lower for progestogens it still played a non negligible role in the removal of progestogens in wwtps fig 3b in swiss wwtps ozonation was effective in further removing the remaining concentrations of p4 after activated sludge treatment to concentrations lower than 1 ng l zhang et al 2017 in some cases the removal contribution of certain progestogens was negative by the advanced processes segment which may be due to the desorption of compounds from the suspended particles into the aqueous phase under fast water flow pflug et al 2017 moreover this could also be caused by the conversion of the conjugated compounds to the free state chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 3 4 2 comparison of various treatment processes generally secondary treatment processes were the dominant contributors to the removal of progestogens in the conventional treatment segment shen et al 2019 yu et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 a in the secondary treatment processes the oxidation ditch od process had the lowest sre followed by the unitank and sequencing batch reactor sbr the removal of progestogens by the ao process was greatly improved compared to the od process but no significant differences were identified between ao and other processes the greatest comparative sre was achieved by the aao process in which the sre values were significantly different from the od unitank and sbr processes p 0 05 this may be associated with the generally higher srt of the aao process previous studies have indicated that a longer srt was suitable for bacterial growth and establishing a diverse microbial community which enhances the removal of compounds nam et al 2014 ben et al 2018 also reported that the aao process was more efficient in removing micropollutants such as antibiotics additionally the aao process generally exhibited comparatively constant removal efficiencies in winter that is less affected by low temperatures which was further substantiated by the effluent quality recently the aao process has been widely used for nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater from china this study confirms another advantage of the aao process namely that it provides better removal of most progestogens the aao process showed the greatest heterogeneity compared to other processes which may have been caused by the different operating parameters in the aao process table s2 previous studies have reported that the operating parameters of the treatment process could also affect the removal of contaminants ben et al 2018 the advanced processes could be divided into chlorine sodium hypochlorite based processes and ultraviolet uv based processes according to the disinfection used as shown in fig 4b in chlorine based processes the chlorine cl alone showed the lowest sre and the coagulatory settler and v filter and chlorine disinfection combined process cs vf cl exhibited a higher sre than the other chlorine disinfection processes but no significant differences were identified among the four treatment processes the investigated uv based processes generally achieved better removal of the target progestogens than the chlorine based processes fig s15 the densadeg and cloth media filter and uv disinfection combined processes ds cmf uv in uv based processes had the highest sre in all treatment processes previous studies indicated that coagulation and cmf could effectively reduce suspended solids which may avoid the re release of compounds adsorbed on suspended solids into the wastewater nam et al 2014 wang et al 2018 uv irradiation can increase the formation of hydroxyl radicals to further enhance the decomposition of organic pollutants wang et al 2020 the results provide interesting direction in that the current ao process could be relatively easily upgraded to an aao process for improved progestogens removal moreover the replacement of cl with uv in the tandem process of advanced treatment could also contribute to improved progestogens removal notably the aforementioned comparison of different secondary and advanced treatment processes has inadequacies mainly limited by insufficient data on different heterogeneities e g temperature hydraulic flow rate were not further heterogeneity tested nevertheless the current process comparison provides a preliminary evaluation of the overall performance of each type of treatment process for all target compounds removal ben et al 2018 di marcantonio et al 2020 3 4 3 removal in the treatment units of aao processes based on the aforementioned results the aao process was selected to further investigate the contribution of different treatment units to the removal of progestogens the results showed that the mass fluxes of total progestogens were eliminated for 20 8 4 95 g d by the aao process in zj fig 5 and table s5 in the anaerobic tank the mass fluxes of total progestogens decreased from 35 7 3 58 g d to 24 9 2 36 g d with 11progestogens showing a mass fluxes decrease specially nga and gde were significantly decreased by 100 16 and 100 12 respectively p 0 01 this may be because these compounds contain electron withdrawing groups which can facilitate the biotransformation by reductive reactions under anaerobic conditions ghattas et al 2017 by contrast the mass fluxes of total progestogens increased in the anoxic tank from 31 1 2 92 g d to 45 8 4 20 g d with p4 ddg ete dnt 21α hp and lng increased by 130 33 89 28 122 30 46 22 41 18 and 36 28 respectively except for cpa and mp which were significantly decreased by 100 13 and 74 11 respectively p 0 01 mass fluxes of these progestogens showed an increase in treatment units which could be caused by the deconjugation of the conjugate or release from adsorbed into the sludge during treatment blair et al 2015 notably the increased mass fluxes of progestogens in the sludge phase in the anaerobic and anoxic units were caused by the large quantities of recirculated sludge from the return sludge and internal recirculation in the aerobic tank mass fluxes of total progestogens decreased from 45 8 4 20 g d to 14 9 1 36 g d with 14 progestogens showing a mass fluxes decrease the p4 dsp mga mp and 21α hp decreased significantly by 80 12 100 14 100 16 94 11 and 100 7 respectively p 0 01 indicating that these progestogens could be effectively removed in the aerobic tank notably the mass fluxes reduction of progestogens showed compound specific variations in the three treatment units for example the mass fluxes of nga and gde were mainly eliminated in the anaerobic unit and the cpa and p4 in the anoxic and aerobic units respectively compared to the anaerobic and anoxic units mass fluxes of most progestogens were mainly eliminated in the aerobic unit the dominant mechanisms of progestogens in the aao process may include biodegradation adsorption and deconjugation mass fluxes of progestogens showed a significant decrease across the aao process implying that biodegradation was the primary mechanism for the loss of progestogens previous studies have also shown that progestogens can be biodegraded by microorganisms liu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 the mass change percentages were 52 71 and 119 for anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks respectively indicating that the biodegradation of the aerobic tank played a primary role in the removal of progestogens weizel et al 2021 reported that nine progestogens were rapidly degraded within 6 h in activated sludge under aerobic conditions with the half lives of less than 1 h to 8 65 h additionally liu et al 2020a found that two progestogens dissipated faster under oxic conditions than under anoxic conditions at the lab scale notably some progestogens e g p4 dsp mga and cm showed a significant increase after treatment table s5 for example the concentration of p4 in the external return flux in both the dissolved and sludge phases was higher than that in the aerobic tank this may be caused by the decoupling of conjugated progestogens it had been reported that steroid hormones could exist as glucuronide and or sulfate conjugates in wwtps ben et al 2017 liu et al 2020b zhang et al 2014a ben et al 2017 confirmed the widespread presence of estrogen conjugates with the conjugation ratio increasing gradually along with the biological treatment units these results confirmed the non negligible role of the conjugated compounds in progestogens removal which requires further study 4 conclusions this study is the first to provide information on the spatiotemporal distribution of progestogens in wwtps of china and explores the removal of progestogens in wwtps from the perspective of the treatment process results indicated that p4 ddg dnt ete and ntd were the dominant progestogens in different matrices seasonal variations in the concentration of most progestogens in wwtps were found in which the influent exhibited considerable variability compared with other matrices and the highest concentrations of most progestogens were detected in winter spatial patterns of progestogens in influent varied by sampling season and the concentrations of progestogens were generally higher in northern wwtps than that in southern wwtps during spring and summer the removal of progestogens varied considerably by season and wwtp with removal efficiencies of 298 nga 100 mta the conventional process segment was the dominant contributor to the removal of progestogens as compared with the advanced process segments in wwtps the aao process overall exhibited the superior removal performance for progestogens whereby the aerobic unit of the aao process was the dominant contributor to the removal of most progestogens although substantial amounts of progestogens in influent were removed by the wwtps the residual progestogens in final effluent remained non negligible further research should develop cost effective treatment technologies

16318,this study investigated the overall occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of 19 progestogens in 608 samples collected from 17 wastewater treatment plants wwtps distributed across china during four seasons the aqueous removal efficiencies of progestogens were calculated and the efficacies of process segments secondary and advanced processes and process units in the removal of progestogens were explored the results indicated that progestogens were widely detected in investigating wwtps with the progesterone dydrogesterone dienogest ethisterone and norethindrone were always dominant in the influent secondary effluent final effluent and excess sludge seasonally the influent exhibited more variability than the other matrices that 10 progestogens concentrations varied significantly during the four seasons spatially the influent concentrations of progestogens were generally higher in northern wwtps than that in southern wwtps during spring and summer eight progestogens were stably removed by the wwtps across seasons and most progestogens varied considerably in removal in different wwtps the conventional process segment was the dominant contributor to progestogen removal the anaerobic anoxic oxic process and a combined process consisting of densadeg and cloth media filter and ultraviolet disinfection showed the highest removal of progestogens among various secondary and advanced treatment processes respectively mass balance analysis showed that most progestogens were effectively eliminated in the aerobic unit with biodegradation being the primary removal pathway

and removal of progestogens in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords progestogens wastewater treatment plants spatiotemporal distribution removal 1 introduction environmental progestogens a category of endocrine disruptors have been widely detected in environmental matrices such as surface water in recent years weizel et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 progestogens can adversely affect the reproduction and behavior of indigenous aquatic organisms at low concentrations ng l which has drawn widespread concern among researchers and the public sauer et al 2020 zhao et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are perceived to be a substantial contributor to progestogens discharged into the environment sauer et al 2018 yarahmadi et al 2018 understanding the occurrence and removal of progestogens in wwtps could improve the abatement of progestogen contamination the occurrence of certain progestogens in wwtps from several countries has been reported in previous studies viglino et al 2008 weizel et al 2018 yarahmadi et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 for example progesterone was widely detected in six wwtps surveyed in switzerland at concentrations reaching 73 ng l in influent and 3 3 ng l in effluent zhang et al 2017 norethindrone and levonorgestrel were the two dominant progestogens in the investigated wwtps in canada with concentrations up to 205 and 170 ng l in influent and 53 and 30 ng l in effluent respectively viglino et al 2008 yarahmadi et al 2018 reports on the occurrence of progestogens in wwtps have focused on short term investigations of a few progestogens in wwtps or on the investigations of a few wwtps fernandez et al 2007 viglino et al 2008 vulliet et al 2007 yu et al 2019 to adequately profile the occurrence of micropollutants in wwtps vigorous monitoring campaigns are required including the sampling of contaminants across seasons in well organized spatial resolution tran et al 2018 yarahmadi et al 2018 however information on the temporal or spatial variation of multiple progestogens in wwtps is limited manickum and john 2014 reported that the concentrations of progesterone in influent varied by sampling seasons and sauer et al 2018 reported that the concentrations of progesterone megestrol acetate and dienogest in the influent varied by sampling citiy a systematic investigation of the overall occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of diverse categories of progestogens in wwtps distributed across china during different seasons has not yet been conducted research on the removal efficiency of progestogens by wwtps has primarily focused on the removal efficiency in a specific season shen et al 2019 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2016 for example the removal of norethindrone in wwtps was reported in summer with removal efficiencies ranging from 70 to 100 xu et al 2016 seasonal differences in the removal efficiency of estrogens from wwtps have been observed lopez velazquez et al 2021 manickum and john 2014 however information on the removal efficiency of progestogens in wwtps in different seasons has not been well documented removal efficiencies of progestogens in wwtps commonly vary considerably in some countries sauer et al 2018 xu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 for example removal efficiencies of dienogest in wwtps from czech and slovak republics ranged from 2 6 to 93 7 and that of drospirenone in chinese wwtps ranged from 135 to 100 sauer et al 2018 yu et al 2019 treatment processes are essential components of wwtps and understanding the removal of progestogens from a treatment process perspective could contribute to improving their treatment in wwtps patel et al 2019 the removal of certain progestogens has been extensively studied by specific treatment processes in lab scale such as activated sludge and ultraviolet photolysis processes narvaez et al 2019 weizel et al 2021 yu et al 2018 comparatively comparisons of the contribution of different process segments of wwtps to the overall removal of progestogens and the removal performance of progestogens by the treatment processes used in wwtps are still lacking the objectives of this study were to concurrently investigate the overall occurrence and spatiotemporal variation of progestogens in wwtps distributed across 17 cities in china during four seasons the aqueous removal efficiency of progestogens in wwtps was calculated during the four seasons and the contributions of conventional and advanced treatment segments were compared the removal performance of various secondary and advanced treatment processes in wwtps for progestogens was evaluated using quantitative meta analysis furthermore the removal of progestogens by anaerobic anoxic and aerobic units of the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process was explored using mass balance analysis to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive and large scale investigation of the spatiotemporal distribution of progestogens in wwtps of china and to enhance understanding of progestogens removal by wwtps through the treatment process perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents nineteen target progestogens belonging to nine categories

n 446 and excess sludge n 162 samples were obtained from 17 municipal wwtps located in 17 cities in china four sampling campaigns were conducted from september 2018 to august 2019 and the sampling interval of each wwtp was controlled at approximately three months during the sampling campaigns the wwtps were operated under normal conditions information on the investigated wwtps including geographical location treatment processes and influent quality is provided in figs s1 s2 and table s2 the influent secondary effluent and excess sludge were taken from 17 wwtps and the final effluent was collected from 14 wwtps other than the three wwtps hlj fj and bj at least two replicates of each sample type were obtained from each site mass flux samples were collected from a wwtp zj located in zhejiang province and detailed information is shown in text s2 the wastewater treatment process was divided into conventional and advanced process segments by the boundary of the secondary sedimentation tank with the samples of conventional and advanced process segments taken from the influent secondary effluent and final effluent of 14 wwtps twenty four hour composite wastewater samples were collected by refrigerated automatic samplers br 8000d boshirui china with a sampling time interval of 2 h prior to sampling 4 m sulfuric acid was spiked in all sampling bottles 1 2000 v v to prevent biodegradation secondary and final effluents were sampled while considering the hydraulic retention time hrt of the wastewater in the wwtp sludge samples were generally collected three times randomly morning afternoon and evening and mixed in stainless steel buckets on the sampling day wastewater and sludge samples were sub sampled into pre cleaned amber glass bottles 1 l wastewater samples were adjusted to ph 3 with 4 m sulfuric acid and sodium azide was added to the sludge sample at a final concentration of approximately 1 g kg to prevent degradation of the compounds liu et al 2014 after sealing without headspace samples were immediately transported back to the laboratory in the darkness and kept around 4 c throughout the process wastewater samples were filtered with gf f 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters whatman maidstone uk after filtration 100 μl of internal standard 1 mg l was added to 500 ml of influent and 1 l of effluent respectively wastewater samples were extracted immediately and were completed within 12 h sludge samples were freeze dried homogenized and sieved 100 mesh and the internal standard 10 ng was added to the sludge samples 0 5 g immediately extracted after adequate mixture 2 3 analytical procedure and quality control analytical procedures for the samples were slightly modified based on previous studies liu et al 2014 briefly samples were extracted using oasis hlb cartridges text s3 and fig s3 after cartridge pretreatment the samples were loaded onto the cartridge and eluted with 10 ml ethyl acetate the eluate was dried under nitrogen flow and then re dissolved with 0 5 ml of methanol sludge samples were extracted by ultrasonication with ethyl acetate three times and the extract was re dissolved in 1 ml methanol and then further purified using oasis hlb cartridges and the extracts were reconstituted to 0 5 ml by methanol after centrifugation the supernatants were transferred to a 200 μl glass lined pipe and analyzed by the ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms waters corp milford ma usa during the whole procedure quality assurance and quality control qa qc were carried out field and transport blanks were performed for the sampling campaigns of each wwtp the limit of quantification loq was calculated with an analyte signal to noise ratio of 10 1 and the loq of progestogens ranged from 0 10 ng l to 1 99 ng l in wastewater and 0 16 ng g to 0 87 ng g dry weight dw in sludge the mean spiked recoveries of progestogens in different matrices ranged from 70 to 116 table s3 detailed analytical procedures and qa qc are shown in text s4 2 4 quantitative meta analysis quantitative meta analysis provides a comprehensive data presentation of different processes the results of each process are presented using the average standardized removal efficiency sre of all progestogens 95 confidence intervals to avoid possible bias caused by the anomalous results of different processes the sre values for each progestogen were weighted according to the number of data points available for each process the sre for each process for each progestogen was calculated using eq 1 1 sre χ μ σ n n where χ represents the removal efficiency of each progestogen μ represents the average removal efficiency for each progestogen across all processes σ represents the standard deviation of the removal efficiencies of each progestogen across all processes n is the number of data points obtained for each process and n is the total number of data points for a specific compound across all processes 2 5 mass balances analysis the mass flux from each unit of the aao process was calculated by multiplying the concentration of individual progestogens by the average daily flux for each treatment unit equation in text s2 mass change percentage for each progestogen in the aao process was calculated using eq 2 2 mcp m i n f l o w m o u t f l o w m i n f l o w 100 where mcp represents the mass change percentage of individual progestogens and mf inflow and mf outflow represent the mass flux of individual progestogens in the inflow and outflow from the treatment unit respectively 2 6 statistical analysis concentrations less than method limit of detection lod were set at zero and those below loq but above lod were defined as half of the respective loq for statistical analysis non parametric kruskal wallis test or mann whitney u test was used to compare differences in the concentrations of progestogens in samples from different seasons or locations and correlation analysis was performed using spearman s rank correlation test the significant differences of average sre for all progestogens were analyzed using permutation tests student s t test was used to compare differences in mass change percentages of each progestogen in the treatment unit statistical analysis was performed using the software program ibm spss version 20 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa and statistical significance was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall occurrence of progestogens in seventeen wwtps during four seasons the detection frequencies dfs concentrations and compositions of progestogens in 17 wwtps over a span of four seasons are shown in figs 1 s4 s5 and table s4 in influent ten out of nineteen target progestogens demonstrated the dfs above 70 with the concentration of individual progestogens ranging from non detected nd to 138 ng l the p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete were the predominant progestogens fig 2 a which could be closely associated with the widespread application of these progestogens in china zhang et al 2014b progestogens including p4 and ddg were the main consumption in countries where progestogens consumption statistics are available britain switzerland and france besse and garric 2009 fent 2015 runnalls et al 2010 the concentrations of p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete in influent were nd 138 ng l nd 109 ng l nd 29 3 ng l nd 31 7 ng l and nd 44 6 ng l which were higher or comparable to the majority of those in the literature golovko et al 2018 sauer et al 2018 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 this could be attributed to discrepancies in the consumption of progestogens across various countries fent 2015 kumar et al 2015 the dfs and concentrations of most progestogens were decreased after treatment by the wwtps specifically the dfs of only five and six target progestogens were above 70 in secondary and final effluent respectively with the concentration of individual progestogens ranging from nd to 21 6 ng l the p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete were remained the predominant progestogens in secondary and final effluents respectively the concentrations of p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete in secondary and final effluent were nd 21 6 ng l nd 14 9 ng l nd 7 01 ng l nd 5 80 ng l and nd 7 63 ng l respectively which were lower or comparable than most of the reported values al odaini et al 2010 fernandez et al 2007 sauer et al 2018 vulliet et al 2007 this could be attributed to discrepancies in influent concentrations of these progestogens yarahmadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and the removal performance of wwtps fent 2015 weizel et al 2018 the concentration of individual progestogens in excess sludge ranged from nd to 16 2 ng g dw and the p4 ddg ntd dnt and ete were the predominant progestogens in excess sludge compared with the influent and effluent the dfs of progestogens were lower in excess sludge with only two progestogens ddg and dsp were above 70 which could be associated with the low octanol water partitioning coefficients kow of most progestogens previous studies have indicated that hydrophobic compounds log kow 4 were more readily adsorbed on solid particles kumar et al 2015 3 2 temporal and spatial variation of progestogens in wwtps overall a significant seasonal difference was observed in progestogens concentrations detected in the wwtps kruskal wallis test p 0 05 fig 2b specifically the total concentrations of progestogens detected in influent of individual wwtps showed seasonal differences in which over 80 of wwtps were significantly varied in the four seasons kruskal wallis test p 0 05 the highest concentrations of most progestogens were detected in winter where nine progestogens including ddg ete and dnt were detected at the highest concentrations in winter and the concentrations of six progestogens including p4 and ntd were detected at the second highest in winter fig 2a additionally concentrations of cma cpa ddg dnt ete gde mga nga ntd and p4 were significantly varied kruskal wallis test p 0 05 among the four seasons fig s6 for example the concentration of ddg was significantly higher in winter median 40 3 ng l and lower in spring median 5 11 ng l than in other seasons while the concentrations of p4 were significantly higher in autumn median 30 3 ng l than in other seasons mann whitney u test p 0 01 seasonal variation of p4 concentrations was also observed in influent of wwtps in greece which had higher concentrations in spring nd 213 ng l and winter nd 275 ng l but was not detected in summer and autumn papageorgiou et al 2016 in this context the concentration of progestogens in wwtps may be underestimated or overestimated when sampling was conducted in only one season the seasonal variation in the concentrations of progestogens in secondary effluent final effluent and excess sludge was dramatically smaller than that in influent figs 2a and s7 this could be mainly attributed to the removal of progestogens by the wwtps which eliminated the seasonal variation of some progestogens in influent manickum and john 2014 nevertheless concentrations of dnt lng mta and p4 in secondary effluent and cpa ddg dnt p4 in final effluent and ddg and mp in excess sludge were still significantly varied kruskal wallis test p 0 05 among different seasons figs s8 s10 generally spatial patterns of progestogens in influent varied by the sampling season concentrations of individual progestogens in influent of various wwtps had significant variations at the overall level in spring kruskal wallis test p 0 05 fig 2c but these significant differences were not observed in summer autumn and winter fig s11 interestingly differences in progestogens concentrations among different wwtps were confirmed sideways by using the median concentrations of individual progestogens in all wwtps as a baseline for example in winter compared with the median concentrations of individual progestogens for all wwtps the concentration of individual progestogens in wwtp sd was significantly higher while the wwtp cs was significantly lower mann whitney u test p 0 01 these differences could be related to the different characteristics of the wwtps such as the urban characteristics where wwtps are located population size served by wwtps and influent quality petrie et al 2015 yu et al 2019 notably concentrations of progestogens were commonly observed to be higher in northern than in southern wwtps in spring and summer mann whitney u test p 0 05 and the concentrations of progestogens in wwtps located in northern were generally comparable to those in southern wwtps in autumn and winter figs 2d and s12 this could be associated with consumption patterns of these regions during different seasons zhang et al 2014b factors driving the spatiotemporal variation of progestogens concentrations in influent of wwtps were explored using canonical correspondence analysis cca various variables including urban characteristics influent quality and wwtp characteristics were considered details in text s5 the results indicated that the spatiotemporal variation of progestogens was driven by various factors such as gross domestic product gdp chemical oxygen demand cod and service population with a greater effect of the urban characteristics and the influent quality fig 2e specifically the gdp cod and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n showed a statistically significant positive correlation mann whitney u test p 0 05 previous studies have found that estrogens concentrations were considerably influenced by the development level of regions where wwtps are located nas et al 2021 the concentrations of certain progestogens in influent were influenced by the influent quality yu et al 2019 besides the progestogens usage pattern was also speculated as a driver in the current study but was not statistically analyzed due to the absence of corresponding usage data in china 3 3 aqueous removal efficiencies of progestogens aqueous removal efficiencies of progestogens except for ngm dfs 20 in influent were calculated by comparing the concentrations of individual progestogens in influent and final effluent the removal efficiency of progestogens over a span of four seasons ranged from 298 nga to 100 mta figs 3 a and s13 specifically eight progestogens were stably removed by the wwtps in the four seasons with median removal efficiencies of 96 3 04 for cma 94 4 47 for mta 91 3 25 for ddg 90 5 91 for cm 89 5 07 for dsp 89 4 91 for nta 88 5 63 for ntd and 87 5 71 for p4 similar removal efficiencies of these progestogens in several wwtps have been reported for example ntd and nta could be almost removed in wwtps besse and garric 2009 wu et al 2017 additionally p4 was effectively removed in swiss wwtps with removal efficiencies of 94 12 respectively zhang et al 2017 the median removal efficiencies of six progestogens varied considerably across the four seasons with median removal efficiencies of 87 12 4 for dnt 89 18 8 for 21α hp 78 21 3 for mp 74 25 3 for nga 67 39 3 for lng and 61 32 2 for gde the reasons for these discrepancies could be the wide seasonal variation in concentrations of those progestogens in influent and that the removal was affected greatly by heterogeneity from different seasons such as influent quality and temperature manickum and john 2014 patel et al 2019 comparatively discrepancies in the removal efficiency of progestogens by different wwtps were more commonly observed even in the same season for example in spring the removal efficiencies of ete ranged from 210 to 96 and ndt ranged from 66 to 100 in the investigated wwtps similarly several studies also observed the considerable differences in the removal efficiencies of progestogens from different wwtps sauer et al 2018 xu et al 2016 this could be attributed to different factors in specific wwtps such as treatment processes ben et al 2018 di marcantonio et al 2020 patel et al 2019 3 4 exploring progestogens removal from the treatment process perspective 3 4 1 contributions of conventional and advanced processes segment contributions of conventional and advanced process segments in wwtps to the removal efficiency of progestogens were compared by calculating the concentrations of influent secondary effluent and final effluent the results showed that the conventional process segment was the dominant contributor to the removal of target progestogens in different seasons the lowest removal contributions of different target progestogens by the conventional process segments were up to 70 ete 85 nga 73 nga and 73 cm in spring summer autumn and winter respectively figs 3b and s14 this could be attributed to the excellent bioavailability of the progestogens weizel et al 2021 yu et al 2018 for some micropollutants that are relatively susceptible to biodegradation biological treatment tends to have higher removal efficiencies than physicochemical treatment lajeunesse et al 2012 wu et al 2020 besides conventional processes segment commonly have longer hrt which contributes to more efficient removal of micropollutants gros et al 2010 comparably the advanced processes segment had a lower removal contribution of progestogens in different seasons the highest removal contributions of different target progestogens in spring summer autumn and winter were only 30 ete 15 nga 27 nga and 27 cm respectively although the removal contribution of the advanced process segment was relatively lower for progestogens it still played a non negligible role in the removal of progestogens in wwtps fig 3b in swiss wwtps ozonation was effective in further removing the remaining concentrations of p4 after activated sludge treatment to concentrations lower than 1 ng l zhang et al 2017 in some cases the removal contribution of certain progestogens was negative by the advanced processes segment which may be due to the desorption of compounds from the suspended particles into the aqueous phase under fast water flow pflug et al 2017 moreover this could also be caused by the conversion of the conjugated compounds to the free state chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 3 4 2 comparison of various treatment processes generally secondary treatment processes were the dominant contributors to the removal of progestogens in the conventional treatment segment shen et al 2019 yu et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 a in the secondary treatment processes the oxidation ditch od process had the lowest sre followed by the unitank and sequencing batch reactor sbr the removal of progestogens by the ao process was greatly improved compared to the od process but no significant differences were identified between ao and other processes the greatest comparative sre was achieved by the aao process in which the sre values were significantly different from the od unitank and sbr processes p 0 05 this may be associated with the generally higher srt of the aao process previous studies have indicated that a longer srt was suitable for bacterial growth and establishing a diverse microbial community which enhances the removal of compounds nam et al 2014 ben et al 2018 also reported that the aao process was more efficient in removing micropollutants such as antibiotics additionally the aao process generally exhibited comparatively constant removal efficiencies in winter that is less affected by low temperatures which was further substantiated by the effluent quality recently the aao process has been widely used for nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater from china this study confirms another advantage of the aao process namely that it provides better removal of most progestogens the aao process showed the greatest heterogeneity compared to other processes which may have been caused by the different operating parameters in the aao process table s2 previous studies have reported that the operating parameters of the treatment process could also affect the removal of contaminants ben et al 2018 the advanced processes could be divided into chlorine sodium hypochlorite based processes and ultraviolet uv based processes according to the disinfection used as shown in fig 4b in chlorine based processes the chlorine cl alone showed the lowest sre and the coagulatory settler and v filter and chlorine disinfection combined process cs vf cl exhibited a higher sre than the other chlorine disinfection processes but no significant differences were identified among the four treatment processes the investigated uv based processes generally achieved better removal of the target progestogens than the chlorine based processes fig s15 the densadeg and cloth media filter and uv disinfection combined processes ds cmf uv in uv based processes had the highest sre in all treatment processes previous studies indicated that coagulation and cmf could effectively reduce suspended solids which may avoid the re release of compounds adsorbed on suspended solids into the wastewater nam et al 2014 wang et al 2018 uv irradiation can increase the formation of hydroxyl radicals to further enhance the decomposition of organic pollutants wang et al 2020 the results provide interesting direction in that the current ao process could be relatively easily upgraded to an aao process for improved progestogens removal moreover the replacement of cl with uv in the tandem process of advanced treatment could also contribute to improved progestogens removal notably the aforementioned comparison of different secondary and advanced treatment processes has inadequacies mainly limited by insufficient data on different heterogeneities e g temperature hydraulic flow rate were not further heterogeneity tested nevertheless the current process comparison provides a preliminary evaluation of the overall performance of each type of treatment process for all target compounds removal ben et al 2018 di marcantonio et al 2020 3 4 3 removal in the treatment units of aao processes based on the aforementioned results the aao process was selected to further investigate the contribution of different treatment units to the removal of progestogens the results showed that the mass fluxes of total progestogens were eliminated for 20 8 4 95 g d by the aao process in zj fig 5 and table s5 in the anaerobic tank the mass fluxes of total progestogens decreased from 35 7 3 58 g d to 24 9 2 36 g d with 11progestogens showing a mass fluxes decrease specially nga and gde were significantly decreased by 100 16 and 100 12 respectively p 0 01 this may be because these compounds contain electron withdrawing groups which can facilitate the biotransformation by reductive reactions under anaerobic conditions ghattas et al 2017 by contrast the mass fluxes of total progestogens increased in the anoxic tank from 31 1 2 92 g d to 45 8 4 20 g d with p4 ddg ete dnt 21α hp and lng increased by 130 33 89 28 122 30 46 22 41 18 and 36 28 respectively except for cpa and mp which were significantly decreased by 100 13 and 74 11 respectively p 0 01 mass fluxes of these progestogens showed an increase in treatment units which could be caused by the deconjugation of the conjugate or release from adsorbed into the sludge during treatment blair et al 2015 notably the increased mass fluxes of progestogens in the sludge phase in the anaerobic and anoxic units were caused by the large quantities of recirculated sludge from the return sludge and internal recirculation in the aerobic tank mass fluxes of total progestogens decreased from 45 8 4 20 g d to 14 9 1 36 g d with 14 progestogens showing a mass fluxes decrease the p4 dsp mga mp and 21α hp decreased significantly by 80 12 100 14 100 16 94 11 and 100 7 respectively p 0 01 indicating that these progestogens could be effectively removed in the aerobic tank notably the mass fluxes reduction of progestogens showed compound specific variations in the three treatment units for example the mass fluxes of nga and gde were mainly eliminated in the anaerobic unit and the cpa and p4 in the anoxic and aerobic units respectively compared to the anaerobic and anoxic units mass fluxes of most progestogens were mainly eliminated in the aerobic unit the dominant mechanisms of progestogens in the aao process may include biodegradation adsorption and deconjugation mass fluxes of progestogens showed a significant decrease across the aao process implying that biodegradation was the primary mechanism for the loss of progestogens previous studies have also shown that progestogens can be biodegraded by microorganisms liu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 the mass change percentages were 52 71 and 119 for anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks respectively indicating that the biodegradation of the aerobic tank played a primary role in the removal of progestogens weizel et al 2021 reported that nine progestogens were rapidly degraded within 6 h in activated sludge under aerobic conditions with the half lives of less than 1 h to 8 65 h additionally liu et al 2020a found that two progestogens dissipated faster under oxic conditions than under anoxic conditions at the lab scale notably some progestogens e g p4 dsp mga and cm showed a significant increase after treatment table s5 for example the concentration of p4 in the external return flux in both the dissolved and sludge phases was higher than that in the aerobic tank this may be caused by the decoupling of conjugated progestogens it had been reported that steroid hormones could exist as glucuronide and or sulfate conjugates in wwtps ben et al 2017 liu et al 2020b zhang et al 2014a ben et al 2017 confirmed the widespread presence of estrogen conjugates with the conjugation ratio increasing gradually along with the biological treatment units these results confirmed the non negligible role of the conjugated compounds in progestogens removal which requires further study 4 conclusions this study is the first to provide information on the spatiotemporal distribution of progestogens in wwtps of china and explores the removal of progestogens in wwtps from the perspective of the treatment process results indicated that p4 ddg dnt ete and ntd were the dominant progestogens in different matrices seasonal variations in the concentration of most progestogens in wwtps were found in which the influent exhibited considerable variability compared with other matrices and the highest concentrations of most progestogens were detected in winter spatial patterns of progestogens in influent varied by sampling season and the concentrations of progestogens were generally higher in northern wwtps than that in southern wwtps during spring and summer the removal of progestogens varied considerably by season and wwtp with removal efficiencies of 298 nga 100 mta the conventional process segment was the dominant contributor to the removal of progestogens as compared with the advanced process segments in wwtps the aao process overall exhibited the superior removal performance for progestogens whereby the aerobic unit of the aao process was the dominant contributor to the removal of most progestogens although substantial amounts of progestogens in influent were removed by the wwtps the residual progestogens in final effluent remained non negligible further research should develop cost effective treatment technologies

16319,biphasic decay has been observed for indicators and pathogens in bench scale and in situ water experiments for decades however first order decay kinetics continue to be applied to persistence data because of their simplicity and ease of application model uncertainty introduced by broadly applying first order decay kinetics to persistence data may lead to erroneous decision making in the fields of water management and protection as surface waters are exposed to highly variable environmental and water quality factors that influence microbial and viral persistence it is expected that first order decay kinetics are not representative of most of the persistence literature for indicators and pathogens in surface water matrices this review compiled the methods and results of 61 studies that conducted experiments evaluating the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria fib bacteriophages pathogenic bacteria viruses and protozoa in natural surface water matrices the goals of this review were trifold 1 collate studies in the literature with data available for future persistence modeling 2 present the current state of knowledge with regards to the environmental and water quality factors affecting persistence in natural surface waters and 3 identify recurrent evidence for interactions between the frequently studied factors to inform future factor analyses comparing the methods and results across the 61 studies suggest potential interactions between sunlight and water type sunlight and method of detection predation and water type predation and temperature and water type and method of detection the majority of the identified literature evaluated fib or bacteria persistence future experiments are needed that focus on protozoa brackish or marine water types and molecular based methods of detection keywords surface waters pathogens indicators persistence decay 1 introduction indicator and pathogen decay in surface waters has typically been assumed to follow first order decay kinetics de brauwere et al 2014 pachepsky et al 2006 crane and moore 1986 the simplicity of models such as the exponential or log linear model and the ease of their application continue to motivate the use of first order decay kinetics for modeling pathogen fate crane and moore 1986 however there is significant evidence in the literature that challenges the assumption of first order decay easton et al 2005 benham et al 2006 pachpesky et al 2006 blaustien et al 2013 park et al 2016 biphasic decay in which there are two stages of decay described by two different first order rates has been observed for a variety of targets easton et al 2005 hellweger and masopust 2008 brouwer et al 2017 and the fitting of alternative model forms in previous analyses within the global water pathogens project suggest models that capture shouldering and tailing decay dynamics better describe target persistence in various water matrices mitchell and akram 2017 assumptions of first order decay kinetics can lead to potential underestimations of residual pathogens deviations from classic linear decay have been hypothesized to be due to population heterogeneity resistant states viable but not culturable states and possibly quorum sensing effects brouwer et al 2017 easton et al 2005 additionally there are a wide range of environmental water quality and species related factors that influence a target s persistence in a matrix of concern it is possible that the application of first order decay kinetics for data analysis in prior studies has limited our interpretation of the experimental factors influencing persistence this is perhaps reflected in distributions of optimized first order decay rates that have been shown to be highly variable spanning orders of magnitude within pathogen groups boehm et al 2018 simplifications in pathogen fate modeling can possibly lead to erroneous decision making in the fields of water management and protection and as such reducing model uncertainty by applying a more appropriate model form to indicator and pathogen decay is an important goal as natural surface waters are impacted by a number of natural stressors that impact decay it is hypothesized that two or three parameter persistence models will be more representative of indicator and pathogen persistence in surface waters in general than traditional first order kinetics reducing this uncertainty may yield more accurate decay metrics that can be used to further explore the relationships between indicator and pathogen persistence and typical natural stressors such as temperature sunlight predation or water composition to facilitate the future testing of these hypotheses this review aims to evaluate the quantity and quality of indicator and pathogen persistence experiments in surface waters available in the literature that could be used to explore the implications of first order decay kinetic assumptions this is the qualitative summary of the identified literature and serves to summarize the current state of the knowledge of the water quality and environmental factors affecting indicator and pathogen persistence in surface waters the relevant methods modeling techniques and results from each study described herein will aid future researchers in experimental design and data analysis this compilation of experiments and methodologies will facilitate the identification of potential interactions that can be further explored to reduce uncertainties associated with pathogen behavior in natural water matrices 2 selection criteria for a study to be included in this review the researchers needed to sample natural surface waters or conduct the experiments in situ the primary objective of this review was the identification of experiments with data for persistence modeling and as such the experiments found in the literature needed to document target concentrations or log reduction values for at least four time points to be selected as a minimum of four time points would facilitate the fitting of alternative persistence models with more than one parameter additionally the following factors were documented from each study in this review target type fecal indicator bacteria fib bacteriophages bacteria viruses protozoa water type fresh marine brackish temperature sunlight presence absence predation presence absence and method of detection culture based molecular based if a light source was not mentioned in the study it was assumed the experiments were conducted in the dark if the sampled surface water was filtered or autoclaved in any way the dataset was identified as predation absent studies that included experiments with targets not of focus in this review mst markers animal fish pathogens were not extracted and included in the review this literature review describes the results of each study qualitatively in some cases not all of the experiments included in a study had enough documented timepoints to facilitate the fitting of models other than those representing first order decay although all the experiments are described qualitatively herein table 1 only reflects the characteristics of the experiments that have the aforementioned criteria that could be leveraged in future analyses of alternative persistence modeling methods 3 results the systematic literature review was conducted following prisma guidelines using the methods outlined in s1 sixty one studies of the 3949 identified fig s1 were included in this review and are summarized in table 1 based on the factors of concern relevant to the experiments within each study that included the necessary detail for modeling experiments were categorized by water type fresh marine brackish sunlight presence absence predation presence absence and method of detection culture based molecular based the following qualitative summaries are divided into target groups fib bacteria viruses bacteriophages and protozoa 3 1 fecal indicator bacteria the majority of the identified literature focused on the persistence or decay of fib targets most commonly escherichia coli and enterococcus spp of the 41 studies that addressed fib persistence 24 assessed fib persistence independently and 17 compared fib persistence to that of another target of concern as shown in table 1 the majority of the identified studies focused on freshwater 29 41 and the inclusion of a light source was a common experimental factor some or all of the experiments were exposed to light in 25 of the 41 studies predation was a less commonly studied manipulated factor and the methods used in the 41 studies were predominantly culture based 3 1 1 water type water type did not consistently affect decay in the identified literature ahmed et al 2019 explored the relationship between the decay of molecular based targets for e coli and enterococcus spp in fresh and marine mesocosms and although fib decay was faster in water than sediment differences in fib decay between water types were not noted turbidity and temperature were found to be significantly and positively associated with fib decay sunlight and ph did not have statistically significant correlations the conclusions about water type echoed those of a previous study that used culture based methods ahmed et al 2014 in which nonfiltered marine and fresh water were inoculated with raw sewage and the first log reduction t90s of e coli and enterococci in the two water types were not significantly different water type was a significant factor in two studies employing outdoor mesocosms korajkic et al 2013 2019 in general korajkic et al 2013 observed significantly more decay when indigenous microbiota were present in the mesocosms and greater decay in marine water experiments than freshwater experiments regardless of indigenous microbiota presence water type accounted for 40 1 of the variation in e coli decay the presence absence of indigenous microbiota accounted for 49 2 of the variation in decay and interactions between the two factors water type and predation accounted for 9 74 of the variation korajkic et al 2013 korajkic et al 2019 monitored both molecular and culturable targets for fib originating from cattle manure in mesocosms while manipulating water type sunlight and predation korajkic et al 2019 concluded that water type was the most influential factor affecting decay with most targets decaying faster in marine water than fresh additionally there were clear differences between culture and molecular target decay patterns in freshwater but not in marine korajkic et al 2019 fujioka 1981 studied fecal coliform and fecal streptococci survival in fresh and marine water and also observed greater persistence in freshwater than marine jeanneau et al 2012 observed target specific water type differences in microcosms that simulated contamination from a wastewater input the t90 of e coli was 3 4 times lower than in marine water than freshwater while the t90s for enterococci in the two water types were not significantly different jeanneau et al 2012 water type also had conflicting effects in a study conducted by liang et al 2017 although increasing sunlight intensity resulted in increasing decay rates the effects of salinity on decay were less obvious increased salinity was associated with increased decay in e coli and decreased decay of enterococci liang et al 2017 target specific salinity effects were also observed in a study by okabe and shimazu 2007 in which increasing salinity increased the decay of total coliforms in non filtered river water but not fecal coliforms okabe and shimazu 2007 3 1 2 sunlight sunlight was a commonly evaluated environmental factor in both bench scale and in situ experiments korajkic et al 2014 evaluated how biotic interactions and sunlight influenced fib persistence in an in situ mesocosm located near a recreational beach the culturable fib decayed the fastest there was a strong correlation between the mst markers and the molecular fib targets but not the culturable the effect of sunlight was more pronounced during the initial stages of decay and over the course of time biotic interactions had a greater influence on decay than sunlight both sunlight and predation significantly impacted culturable enterococci but only sunlight was an influential factor in the decay of culturable e coli korajkic et al 2014 sunlight was also found to be a primary driver for the inactivation of culturable bacterial indicators in pond water experiments conducted by greaves et al 2020 and for the freshwater experiments conducted by bailey et al 2018 temperature and mixing speed however were not found to significantly impact fib decay bailey et al 2018 sunlight did not have a pronounced effect on the relative decay of mst markers and e coli in freshwater microcosms where sunlight temperature predation and sediment were manipulated but the high turbidity value of the source water 102 ntu and the strength of the artificial light source were noted as potential causes dick et al 2010 gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 studied the effects of both turbidity and sunlight on fib decay in experiments using culture and molecular based methods e coli and e faecalis were inoculated into the environmental water with turbidity values of 900 ntu or 3 ntu there was quite a bit of variability depending on the experiment conditions but in general sunlight presence caused faster decay as did the presence of solid particles in the water the persistence of e faecalis dna was greater than that of the culturable cells gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 sunlight was only found to significantly affect the decay rates of enterococci as measured with culture based methods as opposed to molecular based in the light and dark seawater microcosms constructed by walters et al 2009 and the effects of sunlight were found to be target dependent in the study conducted by walters and fields 2009 in mesocosms exploring the decay of mst markers and human and cattle associated fib light influenced the rate of survival more so for enterococci than e coli walters and fields 2009 in two of the studies that focused on estuarine water only sunlight was a significant factor affecting fib decay bordalo et al 2002 chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 bordalo et al 2002 noted that the effect of sunlight was more prevalent in higher salinity experiments suggesting a possible sunlight water type interaction chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 observed significant inactivation of e coli and s typhimurium in estuarine water due to predation and sunlight but deemed sunlight the most important inactivating factor chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 the effects of sunlight on fib decay in marine water was more frequently studied than estuarine water yukselen et al 2003 evaluated the effects of temperature and solar radiation on coliform bacteria die off rates and concluded that sunlight exposure was the most significant factor affecting decay and the effect of increasing temperatures was more pronounced in the dark mattioli et al 2017 looked at fib persistence at different water depths in marine water using molecular and culture based methods both enterococci and e coli decayed faster at shallower depths where more photoinactivation could occur although there were some seasonal differences in decay noble et al 2004 addressed the inactivation of various indicators in seawater temperature and sunlight significantly affected decay but there were no significant interactions with nutrients tss or initial concentrations maracinni et al 2016 explored the inactivation of enterococci and e coli at different depths 5 18 and 99 cm in all three water types fresh brackish and marine decay rates were faster in high light conditions than in low light conditions suggesting endogenous photoinactivation is a major pathway for bacterial decay maracinni et al 2016 3 1 3 predation the effects of predation were also commonly assessed in the studies identified in the literature in the experiments already discussed predation was associated with significant inactivation of e coli in fresh marine and estuarine waters dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2013 chandra and hatha 2005 and culturable enterococci in freshwater korajkic et al 2014 chandran et al 2011 completed microcosm studies with e coli s paratyphi and v parahaemolyticus in freshwater and sediments the decay of e coli in sterile water was slower than that in nonfiltered water highlighting a significant effect from the presence of biological factors wanjugi et al 2016 used e coli to explore interactions between predation nutrient levels and competition on target survival in river water microcosms set up in an open greenhouse overall predation and competition had negative effects on survival while nutrient addition increased survival specifically predation accounted for the greatest amount of decay variation 40 followed by nutrients 25 and competition 15 solecki et al 2011 compared fib persistence to the persistence of various microbial and chemical pig manure markers in dark fresh and marine microcosms and the observed biphasic decay was hypothesized to be due to predation as the waters used were unfiltered both generic and pathogenic e coli were studied in agricultural surface water microcosms constructed by topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 and the most rapid decay was observed in the non sterile waters medema et al 1997 investigated the persistence of e coli clostridium perfringens and enterococci in autoclaved and natural river water microcosms that were maintained in the dark die off of e coli and enterococci were faster in the natural river water at both tested temperatures with possible multiplication of both fib observed in the autoclaved water maintained at 15 c medema et al 1997 ahmed et al 2021 explored the persistence of various targets including fib with culture based techniques the mesocosms were constructed with water sampled from two lakes either filtered or left natural and kept at 15 c or 25 c for the experiments there was not a pronounced effect from predation however this was hypothesized to be likely due to the sewage inoculum which could have introduced predators to the filtered water experiments for the e coli trials decay was significantly faster at 25 c than 15 c in three of the four microcosms ahmed et al 2021 3 1 4 other factors although the majority of the studies identified focused on water type sunlight or predation as the influencing factors a few of the studies assessed site specific fib decay irankhah et al 2016 or modified variables such as temperature mixing speeds initial fib loads and sediment or vegetation inclusion increasing temperatures were associated with increased decay of e coli in chlorinated and untreated lake water lund 1996 fresh water terzieva and mcfeters 1991 easton et al 2005 nasser et al 2003 brackish water and marine water nasser et al 2003 mixing speed of fresh surface water samples did not significantly affect the decay of indigenous microbiota bailey et al 2018 and the initial seed concentration of e coli was shown to affect decay rates in fresh and brackish water studies beckinghausen et al 2014 gronewold et al 2011 when comparing the decay of human and bovine e coli in freshwater microcosms liang et al 2012 concluded that human e coli decayed faster than bovine zhang et al 2015 monitored the decay of fib in seawater and beach sand microcosms enterococci and c perfringens decayed more slowly in beach sand than water but e coli decayed similarly in water and sand matrices mezrioui et al 1995 looked at e coli and s typhimurium decay in brackish water and sewage mixtures mimicking slow or rapid marine stress survival was greater when predators were removed in the fall and summer experiments but not in the winter experiments mezrioui et al 1995 four of the identified studies addressed the influence of vegetation or natural aquatic plant life on the persistence of fib submerged aquatic vegetation indirectly facilitated the persistence of enterococci in freshwater microcosms badgley et al 2010 algae presence in freshwater microcosms led to greater persistence under uv conditions of e coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium beckinghausen et al 2014 and the presence of wrack was associated with increased levels of fib in water and sediments imamura et al 2011 tiwari et al 2019 compared decay of indicators and vibrio spp in a brackish beach mesocosm with and without the presence of an aquatic plant myriophyllum sibiricum the molecular enterococcus spp markers decayed more slowly than the culturable enterococci and biphasic decay was observed for both culturable and molecular targets in water 3 1 5 summary in summary some studies noted differential decay of fib based on water type greater decay of fib was observed in marine waters for fecal coliforms streptococci and e coli fujioka 1981 korajkic et al 2013 2019 liang et al 2017 jeanneau et al 2012 the literature also suggests the possibility of interactions between water type and sunlight presence and water type and method one study found that the effects of sunlight were more prevalent in higher salinity waters bordalo et al 2002 and another identified differences in decay rates between molecular and culture based targets only in freshwater matrices korajkic et al 2019 the majority of the studies found that sunlight significantly accelerated decay bailey et al 2018 bordalo et al 2002 chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 fujioka 1981 korajkic et al 2014 gutierrez cacciabue et al 2013 greaves et al 2020 liang et al 2017 maracinni et al 2016 mattioli et al 2017 noble et al 2004 yukselen et al 2003 however there were a few studies that determined it was not a significant factor or found its impact to be variable ahmed et al 2019 dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2019 walters and fields 2009 walters et al 2009 this was hypothesized to be due to the water having a high turbidity or a potential shading issue dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2019 in general increasing temperature was correlated with increasing decay ahmed et al 2019 2021 lund et al 1996 easton et al 2005 nasser et al 2003 noble et al 2004 terzieva and mcfeters 1991 yukselen et al 2003 medema et al 1997 however a few studies did not observe this typical pattern bailey et al 2018 okabe and shimanzu 2007 predation was also commonly found to be a significant factor affecting decay chandran et al 2005 chandran et al 2011 dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2013 topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 wanjugi et al 2016 medema et al 1997 but in some cases the effects of predation were unclear or fib dependent korajkic et al 2019 2014 when molecular based methods were used they were typically associated with slower decay gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 irankhah et al 2016 korajkic et al 2014 tiwari et al 2019 walters et al 2009 but korajkic et al 2019 only found this to be the case in freshwater matrices turbidity was a significant water quality parameter affecting decay ahmed et al 2019 gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 and more generally the presence of vegetation or algae in the water was also associated with greater persistence badgley et al 2010 beckinghausen et al 2014 imamura et al 2011 3 2 bacteria pathogenic bacteria were the next target type most commonly studied in the identified literature twenty studies focused on the persistence of bacteria with targets such as pathogenic e coli strains salmonella spp vibrio spp listeria spp campylobacter spp staphylococcus spp and yersinia enterocolitica freshwater was the water type studied most frequently 15 20 and the majority of the studies conducted experiments in the dark 12 20 varying predation status was slightly more variable across the studies and the method type was the least variable documented factor 18 of the 20 identified studies quantified the pathogenic bacteria concentrations with culture based methods 3 2 1 water type the two studies that compared bacteria decay in different water types observed some potential differences boehm et al 2012 levin edens et al 2011 levin edens et al 2011 evaluated the persistence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in sterilized marine and freshwater and both temperature and salinity were found to significantly influence decay decay rates were higher at the higher temperature and in freshwater boehm et al 2012 addressed the inactivation of salmonella serovars in filter sterilized fresh and marine water matrices with sunlight as a stressor exponential decay was observed for the serovars studied in seawater under light conditions but little to no decay was observed for the serovars studied in seawater under dark conditions a similar effect from sunlight was observed in freshwater however the freshwater experiments exposed to sunlight exhibited a clear shoulder effect not observed in the marine water the shoulder period was only 1 1 5 h in length and the observed t90s were less than 1 day in length indicating that the potential sunlight water type interaction may not greatly impact decay observations boehm et al 2012 3 2 2 sunlight beckinghausen et al 2014 also observed rapid decay for salmonella s typhimurium had t90 values of 1 day or less in freshwater microcosms exposed to natural sunlight regardless of initial seed concentration and results indicated that the pathogen persists longer than the studied indicator as highlighted in section 3 1 4 the presence of algae in the microcosm the main factor studied by beckinghausen et al 2014 led to greater persistence for both e coli and s typhimurium the t90s for s typhimurium in raw estuarine water maintained in the dark at 20 and 30 c were less than 2 days and less than 1 day respectively chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 the presence of biological factors raw water was deemed an important influence on persistence however sunlight caused the greatest inactivation in the experiments overall chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 rodríguez and araujo 2012 specifically looked at campylobacter persistence in river water microcosms in situ and in the laboratory temperature and sunlight were found to significantly affect decay in the in situ experiments but ph oxygen concentration and water conductivity did not silvester et al 2021 explored the survival kinetics of five vibrio species in a study that looked at the effect of biotic factors protozoan grazing temperature salinity sunlight and chemical composition in estuarine water the researchers observed better survival in sediment versus water and the biological factors chemical composition and sunlight increased the removal of the vibrio species 3 2 3 predation avery et al 2008 evaluated e coli o157 h7 persistence in a variety of water sources including lake and river waters sampled waters were autoclaved or non autoclaved inoculated with e coli o157 h7 and kept at 10 c the authors concluded that sterilization was significantly correlated with decay avery et al 2008 topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 examined the fate of generic and pathogenic e coli in agricultural surface water microcosms and the bacteria decreased most rapidly in non sterile waters wang and doyle 1998 sampled water from a filtered and autoclaved municipal source a reservoir and two recreational lakes inoculated e coli o157 h7 and monitored decay at 8 15 and 25 c in the dark for all water types survival was greatest at 8 c and the greatest survival was observed in the filtered and autoclaved municipal water wang and doyle 1998 the effects of predation on other pathogens such as s paratyphi and v parahaemolyticus were observed in a study by chandran et al 2011 the t90s for the pathogens were more rapid in the nonsterile waters illustrating the effect of predation or other biological factors chandran et al 2011 silvester et al 2021 also observed higher mortality rates of vibrio spp in raw sediments and waters compared to autoclaved sediments and waters the experiments conducted by lund et al 1996 used untreated and autoclaved lake water that was kept at 4 c or 10 c in the dark survival was better at 4 c and y enterolitica survived better at lower temperatures than c jejuni y enterolitica also survived much longer in autoclaved water than untreated water there was possibly some seasonal variation in the effects of predation as observed by mezrioui et al 1995 as the survival of s typhimurium was greater when predation was absent in the fall and summer experiments not in the winter predation did not play a key role in the only study identified in this review that used molecular based methods to quantify bacteria persistence in addition to fib and mst markers ahmed et al 2021 explored campylobacter spp persistence with freshwater mesocosms exposed to artificial sunlight conditions campylobacter spp decayed linearly at faster rates at 25 c than at 15 c and at similar rates between filtered and nonfiltered experiments suggesting predation did not significantly impact decay as noted in the fib section although the water was filtered for the predation absent experiments the sewage inoculum still had the potential to introduce predators potentially masking the effect of predation in this study although it is hard to make any inferences given the limited number of studies the use of the sewage inoculum and the different targets between the studies campylobacter spp vs e coli s paratyphi vibrio spp and y enterolitica predation not significantly affecting decay in ahmed et al 2021 in the context of this review suggests a potential interaction between predation and the method of detection culture vs molecular based for pathogenic bacteria 3 2 4 other factors ibrahim et al 2019 studied e coli o157 h7 s typhimurium human adenovirus serotype 2 and murine norovirus 1 survival while stored in sterilized river water microcosms stored at 20 4 24 c and 37 c in the dark the highest t90 values for the bacterial pathogens were observed in the 4 c trials higher temperatures were associated with faster decay of listeria monocytogenes in river water sampled near the outfall of a meat industry plant budzińska et al 2012 e coli o157 h7 in sampled creek water easton et al 2005 and e coli c jejuni and y enterocolitica in sampled stream water terzieva and mcfeters 1991 c jejuni however was less affected by temperature and y enterocolitica had the greatest survival at both temperatures terzieva and mcfeters 1991 some of the identified studies addressed the persistence of a bacterial target without manipulating any water or environmental factor directly and others studied alternative water quality factors changing salinities aquatic plant presence or turbidity el mejri et al 2012 studied the survival of environmental and laboratory adapted strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in marine water and the authors calculated an average t90 of 25 30 h for all the strains notably total cell count data suggested the bacteria were entering a viable but not culturable state el mejri et al 2012 in brackish beach mesocosms vibrio spp genetic markers exhibited biphasic decay and there were positive correlations between the culturable enterococcus targets and v cholerae molecular targets only for the first few days of the experiment suggesting a limitation in current monitoring practices tiwari et al 2019 except for vibrio rrna the decay of the bacterial targets was greater in water than sediment and vegetation tiwari et al 2019 turbidity related factors were significant in a study conducted by czajkowska et al 2005 e coli serotype o157 h7 was inoculated into freshwater sampled from several different polish lakes and rivers and maintained at 4 or 24 c the researchers conducted experiments using water muddy water and bottom shore sediments the bacteria survived slightly longer in muddy water experiments and the survival times were shorter for the experiments maintained at 24 c the authors did not detect a significant effect from the varying chemical oxygen demand or ph levels czajkowska et al 2005 3 2 5 summary looking at the selected literature as a whole for pathogenic bacteria some expected relationships were consistently observed in general decay is higher at higher temperatures as expected levin edens et al 2011 rodríguez and araujo 2012 wang and doyle 1998 budzińska et al 2012 ahmed et al 2021 lund et al 1996 czajkowska et al 2005 terzieva and mcfeters 1991 easton et al 2005 the presence of a light source consistently accelerates decay beckinhausen et al 2014 chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 rodríguez and araujo 2012 silvester et al 2021 however one study identified some potential differences between the effect of sunlight in fresh and marine waters boehm et al 2012 predation was found to significantly increase decay in a variety of targets including pathogenic e coli strains salmonella spp vibrio spp and y enterolitica avery et al 2008 chandran et al 2011 lund et al 1996 silvester et al 2021 topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 wang and doyle 1998 the effects of predation were less obvious in a study by mezriouia et al 1995 in which s typhimurium survival was only greater in sterile waters during autumn and summer seasons and predation was not found to influence the decay of campylobacter spp at all in a freshwater mesocosm study ahmed et al 2021 although it was evaluated directly and indirectly less in the pathogenic bacteria literature than the fib literature turbidity seems to again be a factor potentially influencing decay czajkowska et al 2005 other water quality factors such as ph dissolved oxygen and water conductivity were not found to significantly affect the inactivation of pathogenic bacterial targets rodríguez and araujo 2012 czajkowska et al 2005 3 3 bacteriophages nine of the studies identified in the literature review assessed the persistence of bacteriophages in surface water matrices six of the studies used freshwater marine water was studied in three studies and one study used brackish water sunlight was absent from most of the experiments and predation was predominantly present all nine studies used culture based methods to quantify the bacteriophage concentrations over time booncharoen et al 2018 evaluated the persistence of human sewage specific enterococcal bacteriophage persistence from the myoviridae a2 podoviridae s1 and siphoviridae a1 s4 families in highly and lowly populated fresh and marine water sources in thailand the highest decay rates of a1 a2 and s4 were in the highly polluted seawater matrix the highest decay rate of s1 was in the highly polluted freshwater matrix all bacteriophages exhibited slower decay in filtered samples and in lower pollution waters suggesting predation does play an important role in bacteriophage persistence additional experiments at 5 c indicated that temperature significantly affects bacteriophage decay the effects of salinity on decay varied with the pollution level of the water boonchareon et al 2018 marine water was tested in an additional study in which the marine bacteriophage h6 was inoculated into unfiltered marine water and maintained at 22 c olive et al 2020 minimal decay was observed over the 16 day experiments suggesting that the existence of predators in the water affected the bacteriophage decay minimally olive et al 2020 somatic coliphages from the myroviridae and siphoviridae family were also evaluated in another study identified in this review lee and sobsey 2011 lee and sobsey 2011 conducted experiments using reagent water and natural surface waters sampled from a freshwater body experiments were conducted at 4 c and 25 c the analysis suggested that water type reagent vs fresh temperature and incubation time were strong predictors of inactivation for most of the coliphages decay was slower at 4 c lee and sobsey 2011 greaves et al 2020 included a somatic coliphage in their large scale freshwater mesocosm experiments the mesocosms were either exposed to sunlight or left covered and somatic coliphage was detectable for two days in the uncovered experiments and five days in the covered experiments indicating that sunlight significantly affects decay notably the viral indicators in this study were more resistant to uv inactivation than the bacterial indicators studied greaves et al 2020 long and sobsey 2004 addressed the persistence of f rna and f dna coliphages in freshwater microcosms water was sampled from a surface drinking water source spiked with an individual phage to a target concentration and maintained at 4 c or 20 c in the dark the authors noted tailing in the survival curves and for all coliphages decay was slower at the lower temperature the differences between the temperatures was statistically significant for the f dna coliphages and the group ii and group iv f rna coliphages long and sobsey 2004 ravva and sarreal 2016 evaluated the persistence of f specific rna coliphages in the presence and absence of bacterial host in fresh surface waters the experiments were kept in the dark and maintained at temperatures that simulated summer 25 c or winter 10 c conditions the addition of the host resulted in greater phage persistence with phages in the absence of host disappearing relatively rapidly temperature significantly affected persistence as greater survival was observed at 10 c as compared to 25 c and there were significant differences between environmental and prototype isolate survival the chemical composition of the waters did not appear to affect decay although qb was assayed in waters with higher suspended solids than the other strains it decayed similarly ravva and sarreal 2016 qb may not be representative of coliphage suspended solids interactions as a whole however as it was an exception in a study conducted by yang and griffiths 2013 using river water experiments the study manipulated temperatures ph values and some samples were autoclaved and filtered except for qb all the other f rna phages persisted for longer in the heat treated water predation absent and were less stable when suspended solids were removed the researchers concluded that temperature and ph were major factors that affected the phage survival yang and griffiths 2013 tiwari et al 2019 detected ms2 with culture based methods in their study of decay patterns in brackish beach mesocosms ms2 decayed log linearly and had higher decay in the mesocosms without vegetation ms2 counts was strongly correlated with culturable enterococci for the first 6 8 days tiwari et al 2019 3 3 1 summary overall the studies identified in the literature provided limited insight into the factors potentially affecting decay temperature was the most frequently addressed factor and it was consistently determined to significantly affect bacteriophage decay boonchareon et al 2018 greaves et al 2020 lee and sobsey 2011 long and sobsey 2004 ravva et al 2016 yang and griffiths 2013 sunlight was shown to increase decay rates of bacteriophages noble et al 2004 but bacteriophages may be more resistant to uv inactivation than fib greaves et al 2020 predation also impacts bacteriophage decay although the impact may be sub type dependent boonchareon et al 2018 yang and griffiths 2013 and this review did not select any studies that suggested significant differences between bacteriophage decay rates in different water types boonchareon et al 2018 as only culture based methods were used in the described studies no conclusions could be drawn about method related decay differences however as opposed to the conclusions drawn in the fib and bacteria other factors sections 3 1 4 and 3 2 4 the bacteriophage literature suggests that ph does significantly affect decay yang and griffiths 2013 3 4 viruses there were 10 studies identified in the literature review that studied the persistence of viruses eight of the 10 studies used freshwater five used marine water and only one used brackish water the presence or absence of sunlight was fairly variable with two studies exposing all experiments to sunlight four studies keeping all experiments in the dark and four studies manipulating the presence of sunlight predation was predominantly present in the experiments assessing virus persistence and the virus target group had the greatest variety of method type four of the ten studies used molecular based methods adenovirus was the virus type most frequently studied in the identified literature liang et al 2017 assessed the effects of salinity and sunlight on adenovirus and found that increasing salinity was associated with greater adenovirus persistence increasing sunlight intensity increased adenovirus decay rates and results suggested that the viral targets in this study were more susceptible to sunlight than their bacterial counterparts regardless of salinity or sunlight intact cells decayed faster than total dna liang et al 2017 human adenovirus 40 41 was also studied in freshwater mesocosms that manipulated predation status and temperatures ahmed et al 2021 in one set of the experiments the decay rates were similar between predation treatments with higher decay rates observed at 25 c compared to 15 c in the other set of experiments the effects of the increased temperature were only prominent in the filtered treatments ahmed et al 2021 the effect of temperature on virus persistence was also evaluated in a study using dark sterilized river water microcosms stored at 20 c 4 c 24 c or 37 c ibrahim et al 2019 adenovirus had the slowest decay in 20 c with a t90 of almost 200 days and the fastest decay at 37 c with a t90 of 27 h norovirus was not affected by increasing temperatures in the typical manner with the fastest decay occurring in the 24 c trials and the slowest decay occurring in the 4 c ibrahim et al 2019 carratalà et al 2013 evaluated the persistence of adenoviruses in a range of water matrices but the experiments conducted in seawater were the only ones that met the natural surface water criteria for the review human adenovirus type 2 was inoculated into the seawater reactors and dark conditions were tested at 7 c 20 c and 37 c and experiments were conducted with uvb and uva light sources both classified as sunlight present herein for the dark experiments no significant inactivation was observed at 7 c or 20 c but higher inactivation was observed at 37 c the authors concluded that biotic factors may be more relevant to virus inactivation than indirect photo inactivation by uva radiation especially at higher temperatures carratalà et al 2013 olive et al 2020 investigated the microbial control of echovirus 11 adenovirus 2 and the bacteriophage h6 decay in different water types echovirus 11 was incubated in sterilized and non sterilized lake water maintained at room temperature and echovirus 11 adenovirus 2 and the bacteriophage h6 were inoculated into the eukaryotic fraction isolated from lake and ocean water the eukaryotic fraction and bacteria fraction waters discussed in this study were merely classified as predation present for this review the authors concluded that the microbial virus control was temperature dependent with more obvious reductions at 22 c as compared to 16 c dependent on the virus olive et al 2020 bergstein et al 1997 evaluated the persistence of poliovirus with in situ experiments in a freshwater lake located at different depths with variable light exposure and during different seasons winter summer very little poliovirus decay was observed during the winter experiments regardless of light presence in the summer experiment light exposure resulted in a 1 log reduction within 4 days compared to minimal observed decay in the dark nasser et al 2003 assessed the persistence of coxsackie a9 virus in fresh marine and brackish waters and virus persistence was found to be temperature dependent with faster decay observed at 30 c than 15 c die off of coxsackie a9 virus at 15 c and 30 c was greatest in marine water nasser et al 2003 the survival of rhesus rotavirus and human astrovirus was characterized in both groundwater and contaminated surface water in a study conducted by espinosa et al 2008 only the surface water experiments met the natural waters criteria outlined in section s1 results indicated that virus infectivity persisted longer in groundwater than surface water and that rotavirus persistence was more stable than astrovirus good correlation between virus infectivity and genomic material detection was noted espinosa et al 2008 the decay of enteroviruses using molecular based methods was assessed in light and dark seawater microcosms in a study conducted by walters et al 2009 the infectious enterovirus remained detectable longer in the dark microcosms than the light no difference in genome decay rates was observed between the two treatments suggesting a potential method sunlight interaction for virus targets walters et al 2009 de oliveira et al 2021 assessed the viability of sars cov 2 in filtered and nonfiltered river water experiments kept at 4 c and 24 c nonfiltered and higher temperature river water experiments were associated with faster decay de oliveira et al 2021 3 4 1 summary overall the results of the studies that manipulated water type suggest that the decay of viruses may be faster in marine waters than in fresh nasser et al 2003 although liang et al 2017 observed greater persistence with increasing salinities in general sunlight increased viral decay carratalà et al 2013 bergstein et al 1997 liang et al 2017 but there was no difference between genome decay rates in a study conducted by walters et al 2009 similarly to the bacteriophage literature the studies identified herein suggest that the relationship between virus persistence and predation may be complicated de oliveira et al 2021 observed clear differences between sars cov 2 persistence when predation was present versus absent but the effects of predation on adenovirus persistence were unclear ahmed et al 2021 olive et al 2020 concluded that the microbial control of virus populations may be temperature dependent as the differences between the predation status was less obvious at lower temperatures the effects of temperature seem to be relatively consistent with the rest of the aforementioned targets with the exception of norovirus most studies found that decay increased with increasing temperatures 2021 carratalà et al 2013 nasser et al 2003 de oliviera et al 2021 however norovirus in one study had the highest decay rate at the second highest temperature 24 c ibrahim et al 2019 3 5 protozoa protozoa were the least frequently studied target in the literature identified in this review only four studies assessed the persistence of protozoa and as such there was minimal water quality and environmental factor variation to facilitate comparisons multiple water matrices fresh brackish and marine were used by nasser et al 2003 to test the persistence of cryptosporidium at two different temperatures 15 c or 30 c the persistence of cryptosporidium was not influenced by temperature in any of the water types in general little to no decay was observed for cryptosporidium across all the experiments and it was concluded that e coli was not a suitable indicator for cryptosporidium robertson et al 2006 studied cryptosporidium oocyst and giardia cyst persistence in a freshwater river the river water temperature throughout the experiment fluctuated from 1 1 c to 7 3 c river water was also sampled for a control experiment maintained in the refrigerator 4 c cryptosporidium oocysts were detected as viable up until 20 weeks and giardia cysts were detected until about 1 month comparisons between control and river environments suggest that temperature changes and other physical chemical and biological factors do not significantly impact the decay of the studied parasites robertson et al 2006 medema et al 1997 evaluated the persistence of cryptosporidium parvum in autoclaved and natural river water microcosms that were maintained in the dark the effects of predation were evident at 15 c but not at 5 c die off of c parvum was faster at the higher temperature medema et al 1997 the freshwater mesocosms constructed by ahmed et al 2021 also evaluated the persistence of c parvum c parvum genome decay was best described by a biphasic model and a greater reduction was observed at 25 c than 15 c for all trials vital dye assays were used to assess c parvum viability and the relationship with temperature and filtration status was found to be variable 3 5 1 summary the four studies addressing protozoa persistence described herein suggest that cryptosporidium is relatively resistant to the factors that have been shown to increase decay rates of the other target types as expected two of the studies found no increase in decay rate with increased temperatures and decay was similar between the sunlight present and absent studies conducted by robertson et al 2006 the study conducted by medema et al 1997 suggests that c parvum may be affected by predation at some temperatures again suggesting that interactions between predation and temperature may be significantly affecting the decay of pathogens in surface waters however the other study assessing predation suggested there was minimal impact from predation presence ahmed et al 2021 4 discussion 4 1 observed decay kinetics the majority of the studies identified in this review used first order kinetics to describe the observed decay a number of the studies described herein however observed biphasic decay patterns ahmed et al 2019 dick et al 2010 solecki et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 mattioli et al 2017 tiwari et al 2019 carratalà et al 2013 de oliviera et al 2021 easton et al 2005 medema et al 1997 some of these studies noted biphasic decay but only fit log linear models while others fit alternative model forms of the 61 studies included in this review less than 20 analyzed their data with biphasic or nonlinear model forms in addition to the traditionally assumed first order decay kinetic profiles ahmed et al 2019 2021 bailey et al 2019 carratalà et al 2013 de oliviera et al 2021 jeanneau et al 2012 lee and sobsey 2011 mattioli et al 2017 solecki et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 the most frequently applied model form in these studies was the so termed biphasic decay model represented by eqs 1 and 2 where c t is the concentration at time t c0 is the concentration at time 0 t is the time point where the second phase of decay begins and k1 and k2 are the first order decay constants for the two phases zhang et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019 2021 the biphasic decay model provided a good fit to cultured fib in marine water zhang et al 2015 molecular targets for fib in fresh and marine water ahmed et al 2019 and c parvum molecular targets in freshwater ahmed et al 2021 1 ln c t c 0 k 1 t t t 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t k 2 t t t t solecki et al 2011 also observed biphasic decay in their fib experiments however the model applied to the data slightly differed from eqs 1 2 as shown in eq 3 the two first order decay rates were applied to different proportions of the initial population of c0 designated with the parameter f the observed biphasic decay was hypothesized to be due to rapid die off until a carrying capacity was reached or the microorganisms using quorum sensing to regulate their numbers solecki et al 2011 the same model was applied to the decay of fib jeanneau et al 2012 somatic coliphages lee and sobsey 2011 and adenovirus carratalà et al 2013 albeit with f defined as a mixing parameter designated as ω in the study of adenovirus inactivation 3 c t c 0 f e k 1 t 1 f e k 2 t mattioli et al 2017 fit the shoulder log linear model to fib persistence experiments and found that the shoulder log linear model provided the best fit to enterococci molecular data instead of a second decay rate as is the case for eqs 1 3 the shoulder log linear model s second parameter s represents the shoulder or lag time where there is minimal inactivation eq 4 the other studies that applied nonlinear model forms such as the exponential biphasic weibull and gompertz models found that the nonlinear models provided better fits to virus inactivation data under all tested conditions de oliviera et al 2021 and bacteriophage inactivation data from the experiments evaluating the effect of their highest tested temperature 25 c vs 4 c lee and sobsey 2011 4 c t c 0 e k t e k s 1 e k s 1 e k t of the few studies discussed herein that analyzed the fit of both nonlinear and linear models to persistence data the nonlinear models were found to provide a good fit to fib bacteriophage virus and protozoa data from experiments representing different water types temperatures and methods of detection biphasic decay has also been described in other persistence studies regarding matrices with conditions that did not meet the requirements of the review herein easton et al 2005 park et al 2016 these studies and the results of previous modeling studies mitchell and akram 2017 dean et al 2020 suggest that two or three parameter models are better able to capture the dynamics of decay than the traditionally assumed first order kinetics one of the aims of this review was to determine the quantity of available pathogen and indicator persistence data for surface waters that could be explored in analyses that expand past the assumption of first order decay kinetics this review differed from some of the previous systematic literature reviews in that the studies had to include raw data that met the requirements for model fitting more than three time points as opposed to previous reviews that aimed to extract reported first order decay rates boehm et al 2018 2019 the 61 studies described herein represent over 600 experiments available in the literature for this purpose 4 2 environment and water quality factor interactions in addition to quantifying the available data in the literature for persistence modeling purposes this review also aimed to assess the current state of the knowledge regarding the water quality and environmental factors that impact indicator and pathogen decay in surface waters previous factor analyses have used dependent variables derived from the assumed first order decay kinetics boehm et al 2018 2019 it is possible that the reduction in model uncertainty through the application of more accurate persistence models will also facilitate factor analyses capable of elucidating the finer relationships between environment and water quality factors affecting target persistence previous analyses that fit alternative persistence models to a large database of experiments did not complete an adjoining factor analysis mitchell and akram 2017 the studies discussed herein analyzed the effect of water quality and environmental variables with a variety of methods correlation coefficients and analyses ahmed et al 2019 tiwari et al 2019 korajkic et al 2014 espinosa et al 2008 two way and three way anovas korajkic et al 2013 2019 wanjugi et al 2016 avery et al 2008 multiple linear regression liang et al 2017 levin edens et al 2011 and generalized linear mixed models wanjugi et al 2016 were some of the methods implemented as illustrated in fig 1 the factors most frequently addressed by the studies identified in this literature review were temperature sunlight and predation temperature consistently was associated with decay for fib pathogenic bacteria bacteriophages and viruses but increasing temperatures had little effect on protozoan decay in the identified literature robertson et al 2006 nasser et al 2003 the presence of artificial or natural sunlight was frequently one of the main drivers of inactivation for the studied target types except for protozoa however fib may be more susceptible to uv inactivation than viral indicators greaves et al 2020 the fib and pathogenic bacteria literature suggest that there may be possible interactions between sunlight and water type boehm et al 2012 bordalo et al 2002 as well as sunlight and method of detection culture vs molecular based walters et al 2009 korajkic et al 2019 it is important to note however that other factors such as turbidity uv wavelength or water depth that were not consistently documented may be impacting the interpretation of the effects of sunlight presence on target persistence the presence of predation typically was found to increase decay for fib pathogenic bacteria viruses and bacteriophages but the effects of predation were in some cases unclear korajkic et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021 and possible water type predation interactions for fib korajkic et al 2013 and temperature predation interactions for viral and protozoan targets were observed olive et al 2020 medema et al 1997 fewer studies identified in the literature addressed the effects of water type and method of detection for the targets of concern decay differed by water type for some fib with increasing salinities generally associated with faster decay fujioka 1981 korajkic et al 2013 liang et al 2017 jeanneau et al 2012 marine water was also associated with faster decay of viral targets in one study nasser et al 2003 which differs from conclusions in a previous review boehm et al 2019 the fib literature also suggested potential water type method of detection interactions as differences in fib decay between culture based and molecular based methods were identified in the freshwater experiments but not the marine water korajkic et al 2019 one study of pathogenic bacteria suggested decay may be faster in freshwater than marine levin edens et al 2011 and the studies identified in this review did not have enough data to draw any conclusions about the effects of water type on bacteriophage or protozoan decay turbidity was found to influence decay in the fib and pathogenic bacteria literature and ph was a potential factor of significance in the bacteriophage literature notably the majority of the studies focused on fib and pathogenic bacteria and the factors affecting their persistence additional research manipulating water quality factors as they influence virus bacteriophage and protozoa decay are needed to better understand those relationships the majority 75 of the identified studies addressed persistence in freshwater matrices and only 38 and 13 addressed persistence in marine and brackish matrices respectively in general there was a lack of data for molecular based methods the lack of data on water type comparisons and persistence measured with molecular based methods were research gaps noted in a previous review boehm et al 2018 it is important to note however that the qualitative synthesis of the studies discussed in this review reflect the water quality and environmental conditions assessed in experiments shared in the peer reviewed literature that also documented target concentrations for more than three independent time points 5 conclusions this systematic review identified 61 studies that addressed the persistence of indicators or pathogens in natural surface water matrices and these studies represent over 600 experiments in the literature that provided quantitative data to further explore persistence models that challenge traditional first order decay kinetic assumptions strong relationships between sunlight predation temperature and persistence were consistently discussed for the majority of the target types the effects of water type method of detection turbidity and ph were less consistent across target types and should be further explored in future analyses this review highlighted several potential interactions between the water quality and experimental factors that could further complicate the relationships between factor and decay future experiments can be designed to test these potential interactions more thoroughly and this review provides the foundation for the intentional inclusion of interaction terms in factor analyses as opposed to exploratory analyses with forward or backwards selection which is needed in the experimental design phase for such work the methods frequently used to study persistence in surface waters microcosms mesocosms models used to describe decay and the techniques used to study factor relationships correlation analyses anovas regressions were reviewed herein to aid future researchers in the endeavor to better understand pathogen threats and human health risks in surface waters funding funding was provided from the national science foundation graduate research fellowship nsf grfp under grant no dge 1848739

16319,biphasic decay has been observed for indicators and pathogens in bench scale and in situ water experiments for decades however first order decay kinetics continue to be applied to persistence data because of their simplicity and ease of application model uncertainty introduced by broadly applying first order decay kinetics to persistence data may lead to erroneous decision making in the fields of water management and protection as surface waters are exposed to highly variable environmental and water quality factors that influence microbial and viral persistence it is expected that first order decay kinetics are not representative of most of the persistence literature for indicators and pathogens in surface water matrices this review compiled the methods and results of 61 studies that conducted experiments evaluating the persistence of fecal indicator bacteria fib bacteriophages pathogenic bacteria viruses and protozoa in natural surface water matrices the goals of this review were trifold 1 collate studies in the literature with data available for future persistence modeling 2 present the current state of knowledge with regards to the environmental and water quality factors affecting persistence in natural surface waters and 3 identify recurrent evidence for interactions between the frequently studied factors to inform future factor analyses comparing the methods and results across the 61 studies suggest potential interactions between sunlight and water type sunlight and method of detection predation and water type predation and temperature and water type and method of detection the majority of the identified literature evaluated fib or bacteria persistence future experiments are needed that focus on protozoa brackish or marine water types and molecular based methods of detection keywords surface waters pathogens indicators persistence decay 1 introduction indicator and pathogen decay in surface waters has typically been assumed to follow first order decay kinetics de brauwere et al 2014 pachepsky et al 2006 crane and moore 1986 the simplicity of models such as the exponential or log linear model and the ease of their application continue to motivate the use of first order decay kinetics for modeling pathogen fate crane and moore 1986 however there is significant evidence in the literature that challenges the assumption of first order decay easton et al 2005 benham et al 2006 pachpesky et al 2006 blaustien et al 2013 park et al 2016 biphasic decay in which there are two stages of decay described by two different first order rates has been observed for a variety of targets easton et al 2005 hellweger and masopust 2008 brouwer et al 2017 and the fitting of alternative model forms in previous analyses within the global water pathogens project suggest models that capture shouldering and tailing decay dynamics better describe target persistence in various water matrices mitchell and akram 2017 assumptions of first order decay kinetics can lead to potential underestimations of residual pathogens deviations from classic linear decay have been hypothesized to be due to population heterogeneity resistant states viable but not culturable states and possibly quorum sensing effects brouwer et al 2017 easton et al 2005 additionally there are a wide range of environmental water quality and species related factors that influence a target s persistence in a matrix of concern it is possible that the application of first order decay kinetics for data analysis in prior studies has limited our interpretation of the experimental factors influencing persistence this is perhaps reflected in distributions of optimized first order decay rates that have been shown to be highly variable spanning orders of magnitude within pathogen groups boehm et al 2018 simplifications in pathogen fate modeling can possibly lead to erroneous decision making in the fields of water management and protection and as such reducing model uncertainty by applying a more appropriate model form to indicator and pathogen decay is an important goal as natural surface waters are impacted by a number of natural stressors that impact decay it is hypothesized that two or three parameter persistence models will be more representative of indicator and pathogen persistence in surface waters in general than traditional first order kinetics reducing this uncertainty may yield more accurate decay metrics that can be used to further explore the relationships between indicator and pathogen persistence and typical natural stressors such as temperature sunlight predation or water composition to facilitate the future testing of these hypotheses this review aims to evaluate the quantity and quality of indicator and pathogen persistence experiments in surface waters available in the literature that could be used to explore the implications of first order decay kinetic assumptions this is the qualitative summary of the identified literature and serves to summarize the current state of the knowledge of the water quality and environmental factors affecting indicator and pathogen persistence in surface waters the relevant methods modeling techniques and results from each study described herein will aid future researchers in experimental design and data analysis this compilation of experiments and methodologies will facilitate the identification of potential interactions that can be further explored to reduce uncertainties associated with pathogen behavior in natural water matrices 2 selection criteria for a study to be included in this review the researchers needed to sample natural surface waters or conduct the experiments in situ the primary objective of this review was the identification of experiments with data for persistence modeling and as such the experiments found in the literature needed to document target concentrations or log reduction values for at least four time points to be selected as a minimum of four time points would facilitate the fitting of alternative persistence models with more than one parameter additionally the following factors were documented from each study in this review target type fecal indicator bacteria fib bacteriophages bacteria viruses protozoa water type fresh marine brackish temperature sunlight presence absence predation presence absence and method of detection culture based molecular based if a light source was not mentioned in the study it was assumed the experiments were conducted in the dark if the sampled surface water was filtered or autoclaved in any way the dataset was identified as predation absent studies that included experiments with targets not of focus in this review mst markers animal fish pathogens were not extracted and included in the review this literature review describes the results of each study qualitatively in some cases not all of the experiments included in a study had enough documented timepoints to facilitate the fitting of models other than those representing first order decay although all the experiments are described qualitatively herein table 1 only reflects the characteristics of the experiments that have the aforementioned criteria that could be leveraged in future analyses of alternative persistence modeling methods 3 results the systematic literature review was conducted following prisma guidelines using the methods outlined in s1 sixty one studies of the 3949 identified fig s1 were included in this review and are summarized in table 1 based on the factors of concern relevant to the experiments within each study that included the necessary detail for modeling experiments were categorized by water type fresh marine brackish sunlight presence absence predation presence absence and method of detection culture based molecular based the following qualitative summaries are divided into target groups fib bacteria viruses bacteriophages and protozoa 3 1 fecal indicator bacteria the majority of the identified literature focused on the persistence or decay of fib targets most commonly escherichia coli and enterococcus spp of the 41 studies that addressed fib persistence 24 assessed fib persistence independently and 17 compared fib persistence to that of another target of concern as shown in table 1 the majority of the identified studies focused on freshwater 29 41 and the inclusion of a light source was a common experimental factor some or all of the experiments were exposed to light in 25 of the 41 studies predation was a less commonly studied manipulated factor and the methods used in the 41 studies were predominantly culture based 3 1 1 water type water type did not consistently affect decay in the identified literature ahmed et al 2019 explored the relationship between the decay of molecular based targets for e coli and enterococcus spp in fresh and marine mesocosms and although fib decay was faster in water than sediment differences in fib decay between water types were not noted turbidity and temperature were found to be significantly and positively associated with fib decay sunlight and ph did not have statistically significant correlations the conclusions about water type echoed those of a previous study that used culture based methods ahmed et al 2014 in which nonfiltered marine and fresh water were inoculated with raw sewage and the first log reduction t90s of e coli and enterococci in the two water types were not significantly different water type was a significant factor in two studies employing outdoor mesocosms korajkic et al 2013 2019 in general korajkic et al 2013 observed significantly more decay when indigenous microbiota were present in the mesocosms and greater decay in marine water experiments than freshwater experiments regardless of indigenous microbiota presence water type accounted for 40 1 of the variation in e coli decay the presence absence of indigenous microbiota accounted for 49 2 of the variation in decay and interactions between the two factors water type and predation accounted for 9 74 of the variation korajkic et al 2013 korajkic et al 2019 monitored both molecular and culturable targets for fib originating from cattle manure in mesocosms while manipulating water type sunlight and predation korajkic et al 2019 concluded that water type was the most influential factor affecting decay with most targets decaying faster in marine water than fresh additionally there were clear differences between culture and molecular target decay patterns in freshwater but not in marine korajkic et al 2019 fujioka 1981 studied fecal coliform and fecal streptococci survival in fresh and marine water and also observed greater persistence in freshwater than marine jeanneau et al 2012 observed target specific water type differences in microcosms that simulated contamination from a wastewater input the t90 of e coli was 3 4 times lower than in marine water than freshwater while the t90s for enterococci in the two water types were not significantly different jeanneau et al 2012 water type also had conflicting effects in a study conducted by liang et al 2017 although increasing sunlight intensity resulted in increasing decay rates the effects of salinity on decay were less obvious increased salinity was associated with increased decay in e coli and decreased decay of enterococci liang et al 2017 target specific salinity effects were also observed in a study by okabe and shimazu 2007 in which increasing salinity increased the decay of total coliforms in non filtered river water but not fecal coliforms okabe and shimazu 2007 3 1 2 sunlight sunlight was a commonly evaluated environmental factor in both bench scale and in situ experiments korajkic et al 2014 evaluated how biotic interactions and sunlight influenced fib persistence in an in situ mesocosm located near a recreational beach the culturable fib decayed the fastest there was a strong correlation between the mst markers and the molecular fib targets but not the culturable the effect of sunlight was more pronounced during the initial stages of decay and over the course of time biotic interactions had a greater influence on decay than sunlight both sunlight and predation significantly impacted culturable enterococci but only sunlight was an influential factor in the decay of culturable e coli korajkic et al 2014 sunlight was also found to be a primary driver for the inactivation of culturable bacterial indicators in pond water experiments conducted by greaves et al 2020 and for the freshwater experiments conducted by bailey et al 2018 temperature and mixing speed however were not found to significantly impact fib decay bailey et al 2018 sunlight did not have a pronounced effect on the relative decay of mst markers and e coli in freshwater microcosms where sunlight temperature predation and sediment were manipulated but the high turbidity value of the source water 102 ntu and the strength of the artificial light source were noted as potential causes dick et al 2010 gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 studied the effects of both turbidity and sunlight on fib decay in experiments using culture and molecular based methods e coli and e faecalis were inoculated into the environmental water with turbidity values of 900 ntu or 3 ntu there was quite a bit of variability depending on the experiment conditions but in general sunlight presence caused faster decay as did the presence of solid particles in the water the persistence of e faecalis dna was greater than that of the culturable cells gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 sunlight was only found to significantly affect the decay rates of enterococci as measured with culture based methods as opposed to molecular based in the light and dark seawater microcosms constructed by walters et al 2009 and the effects of sunlight were found to be target dependent in the study conducted by walters and fields 2009 in mesocosms exploring the decay of mst markers and human and cattle associated fib light influenced the rate of survival more so for enterococci than e coli walters and fields 2009 in two of the studies that focused on estuarine water only sunlight was a significant factor affecting fib decay bordalo et al 2002 chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 bordalo et al 2002 noted that the effect of sunlight was more prevalent in higher salinity experiments suggesting a possible sunlight water type interaction chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 observed significant inactivation of e coli and s typhimurium in estuarine water due to predation and sunlight but deemed sunlight the most important inactivating factor chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 the effects of sunlight on fib decay in marine water was more frequently studied than estuarine water yukselen et al 2003 evaluated the effects of temperature and solar radiation on coliform bacteria die off rates and concluded that sunlight exposure was the most significant factor affecting decay and the effect of increasing temperatures was more pronounced in the dark mattioli et al 2017 looked at fib persistence at different water depths in marine water using molecular and culture based methods both enterococci and e coli decayed faster at shallower depths where more photoinactivation could occur although there were some seasonal differences in decay noble et al 2004 addressed the inactivation of various indicators in seawater temperature and sunlight significantly affected decay but there were no significant interactions with nutrients tss or initial concentrations maracinni et al 2016 explored the inactivation of enterococci and e coli at different depths 5 18 and 99 cm in all three water types fresh brackish and marine decay rates were faster in high light conditions than in low light conditions suggesting endogenous photoinactivation is a major pathway for bacterial decay maracinni et al 2016 3 1 3 predation the effects of predation were also commonly assessed in the studies identified in the literature in the experiments already discussed predation was associated with significant inactivation of e coli in fresh marine and estuarine waters dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2013 chandra and hatha 2005 and culturable enterococci in freshwater korajkic et al 2014 chandran et al 2011 completed microcosm studies with e coli s paratyphi and v parahaemolyticus in freshwater and sediments the decay of e coli in sterile water was slower than that in nonfiltered water highlighting a significant effect from the presence of biological factors wanjugi et al 2016 used e coli to explore interactions between predation nutrient levels and competition on target survival in river water microcosms set up in an open greenhouse overall predation and competition had negative effects on survival while nutrient addition increased survival specifically predation accounted for the greatest amount of decay variation 40 followed by nutrients 25 and competition 15 solecki et al 2011 compared fib persistence to the persistence of various microbial and chemical pig manure markers in dark fresh and marine microcosms and the observed biphasic decay was hypothesized to be due to predation as the waters used were unfiltered both generic and pathogenic e coli were studied in agricultural surface water microcosms constructed by topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 and the most rapid decay was observed in the non sterile waters medema et al 1997 investigated the persistence of e coli clostridium perfringens and enterococci in autoclaved and natural river water microcosms that were maintained in the dark die off of e coli and enterococci were faster in the natural river water at both tested temperatures with possible multiplication of both fib observed in the autoclaved water maintained at 15 c medema et al 1997 ahmed et al 2021 explored the persistence of various targets including fib with culture based techniques the mesocosms were constructed with water sampled from two lakes either filtered or left natural and kept at 15 c or 25 c for the experiments there was not a pronounced effect from predation however this was hypothesized to be likely due to the sewage inoculum which could have introduced predators to the filtered water experiments for the e coli trials decay was significantly faster at 25 c than 15 c in three of the four microcosms ahmed et al 2021 3 1 4 other factors although the majority of the studies identified focused on water type sunlight or predation as the influencing factors a few of the studies assessed site specific fib decay irankhah et al 2016 or modified variables such as temperature mixing speeds initial fib loads and sediment or vegetation inclusion increasing temperatures were associated with increased decay of e coli in chlorinated and untreated lake water lund 1996 fresh water terzieva and mcfeters 1991 easton et al 2005 nasser et al 2003 brackish water and marine water nasser et al 2003 mixing speed of fresh surface water samples did not significantly affect the decay of indigenous microbiota bailey et al 2018 and the initial seed concentration of e coli was shown to affect decay rates in fresh and brackish water studies beckinghausen et al 2014 gronewold et al 2011 when comparing the decay of human and bovine e coli in freshwater microcosms liang et al 2012 concluded that human e coli decayed faster than bovine zhang et al 2015 monitored the decay of fib in seawater and beach sand microcosms enterococci and c perfringens decayed more slowly in beach sand than water but e coli decayed similarly in water and sand matrices mezrioui et al 1995 looked at e coli and s typhimurium decay in brackish water and sewage mixtures mimicking slow or rapid marine stress survival was greater when predators were removed in the fall and summer experiments but not in the winter experiments mezrioui et al 1995 four of the identified studies addressed the influence of vegetation or natural aquatic plant life on the persistence of fib submerged aquatic vegetation indirectly facilitated the persistence of enterococci in freshwater microcosms badgley et al 2010 algae presence in freshwater microcosms led to greater persistence under uv conditions of e coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium beckinghausen et al 2014 and the presence of wrack was associated with increased levels of fib in water and sediments imamura et al 2011 tiwari et al 2019 compared decay of indicators and vibrio spp in a brackish beach mesocosm with and without the presence of an aquatic plant myriophyllum sibiricum the molecular enterococcus spp markers decayed more slowly than the culturable enterococci and biphasic decay was observed for both culturable and molecular targets in water 3 1 5 summary in summary some studies noted differential decay of fib based on water type greater decay of fib was observed in marine waters for fecal coliforms streptococci and e coli fujioka 1981 korajkic et al 2013 2019 liang et al 2017 jeanneau et al 2012 the literature also suggests the possibility of interactions between water type and sunlight presence and water type and method one study found that the effects of sunlight were more prevalent in higher salinity waters bordalo et al 2002 and another identified differences in decay rates between molecular and culture based targets only in freshwater matrices korajkic et al 2019 the majority of the studies found that sunlight significantly accelerated decay bailey et al 2018 bordalo et al 2002 chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 fujioka 1981 korajkic et al 2014 gutierrez cacciabue et al 2013 greaves et al 2020 liang et al 2017 maracinni et al 2016 mattioli et al 2017 noble et al 2004 yukselen et al 2003 however there were a few studies that determined it was not a significant factor or found its impact to be variable ahmed et al 2019 dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2019 walters and fields 2009 walters et al 2009 this was hypothesized to be due to the water having a high turbidity or a potential shading issue dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2019 in general increasing temperature was correlated with increasing decay ahmed et al 2019 2021 lund et al 1996 easton et al 2005 nasser et al 2003 noble et al 2004 terzieva and mcfeters 1991 yukselen et al 2003 medema et al 1997 however a few studies did not observe this typical pattern bailey et al 2018 okabe and shimanzu 2007 predation was also commonly found to be a significant factor affecting decay chandran et al 2005 chandran et al 2011 dick et al 2010 korajkic et al 2013 topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 wanjugi et al 2016 medema et al 1997 but in some cases the effects of predation were unclear or fib dependent korajkic et al 2019 2014 when molecular based methods were used they were typically associated with slower decay gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 irankhah et al 2016 korajkic et al 2014 tiwari et al 2019 walters et al 2009 but korajkic et al 2019 only found this to be the case in freshwater matrices turbidity was a significant water quality parameter affecting decay ahmed et al 2019 gutiérrez cacciabue et al 2016 and more generally the presence of vegetation or algae in the water was also associated with greater persistence badgley et al 2010 beckinghausen et al 2014 imamura et al 2011 3 2 bacteria pathogenic bacteria were the next target type most commonly studied in the identified literature twenty studies focused on the persistence of bacteria with targets such as pathogenic e coli strains salmonella spp vibrio spp listeria spp campylobacter spp staphylococcus spp and yersinia enterocolitica freshwater was the water type studied most frequently 15 20 and the majority of the studies conducted experiments in the dark 12 20 varying predation status was slightly more variable across the studies and the method type was the least variable documented factor 18 of the 20 identified studies quantified the pathogenic bacteria concentrations with culture based methods 3 2 1 water type the two studies that compared bacteria decay in different water types observed some potential differences boehm et al 2012 levin edens et al 2011 levin edens et al 2011 evaluated the persistence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in sterilized marine and freshwater and both temperature and salinity were found to significantly influence decay decay rates were higher at the higher temperature and in freshwater boehm et al 2012 addressed the inactivation of salmonella serovars in filter sterilized fresh and marine water matrices with sunlight as a stressor exponential decay was observed for the serovars studied in seawater under light conditions but little to no decay was observed for the serovars studied in seawater under dark conditions a similar effect from sunlight was observed in freshwater however the freshwater experiments exposed to sunlight exhibited a clear shoulder effect not observed in the marine water the shoulder period was only 1 1 5 h in length and the observed t90s were less than 1 day in length indicating that the potential sunlight water type interaction may not greatly impact decay observations boehm et al 2012 3 2 2 sunlight beckinghausen et al 2014 also observed rapid decay for salmonella s typhimurium had t90 values of 1 day or less in freshwater microcosms exposed to natural sunlight regardless of initial seed concentration and results indicated that the pathogen persists longer than the studied indicator as highlighted in section 3 1 4 the presence of algae in the microcosm the main factor studied by beckinghausen et al 2014 led to greater persistence for both e coli and s typhimurium the t90s for s typhimurium in raw estuarine water maintained in the dark at 20 and 30 c were less than 2 days and less than 1 day respectively chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 the presence of biological factors raw water was deemed an important influence on persistence however sunlight caused the greatest inactivation in the experiments overall chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 rodríguez and araujo 2012 specifically looked at campylobacter persistence in river water microcosms in situ and in the laboratory temperature and sunlight were found to significantly affect decay in the in situ experiments but ph oxygen concentration and water conductivity did not silvester et al 2021 explored the survival kinetics of five vibrio species in a study that looked at the effect of biotic factors protozoan grazing temperature salinity sunlight and chemical composition in estuarine water the researchers observed better survival in sediment versus water and the biological factors chemical composition and sunlight increased the removal of the vibrio species 3 2 3 predation avery et al 2008 evaluated e coli o157 h7 persistence in a variety of water sources including lake and river waters sampled waters were autoclaved or non autoclaved inoculated with e coli o157 h7 and kept at 10 c the authors concluded that sterilization was significantly correlated with decay avery et al 2008 topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 examined the fate of generic and pathogenic e coli in agricultural surface water microcosms and the bacteria decreased most rapidly in non sterile waters wang and doyle 1998 sampled water from a filtered and autoclaved municipal source a reservoir and two recreational lakes inoculated e coli o157 h7 and monitored decay at 8 15 and 25 c in the dark for all water types survival was greatest at 8 c and the greatest survival was observed in the filtered and autoclaved municipal water wang and doyle 1998 the effects of predation on other pathogens such as s paratyphi and v parahaemolyticus were observed in a study by chandran et al 2011 the t90s for the pathogens were more rapid in the nonsterile waters illustrating the effect of predation or other biological factors chandran et al 2011 silvester et al 2021 also observed higher mortality rates of vibrio spp in raw sediments and waters compared to autoclaved sediments and waters the experiments conducted by lund et al 1996 used untreated and autoclaved lake water that was kept at 4 c or 10 c in the dark survival was better at 4 c and y enterolitica survived better at lower temperatures than c jejuni y enterolitica also survived much longer in autoclaved water than untreated water there was possibly some seasonal variation in the effects of predation as observed by mezrioui et al 1995 as the survival of s typhimurium was greater when predation was absent in the fall and summer experiments not in the winter predation did not play a key role in the only study identified in this review that used molecular based methods to quantify bacteria persistence in addition to fib and mst markers ahmed et al 2021 explored campylobacter spp persistence with freshwater mesocosms exposed to artificial sunlight conditions campylobacter spp decayed linearly at faster rates at 25 c than at 15 c and at similar rates between filtered and nonfiltered experiments suggesting predation did not significantly impact decay as noted in the fib section although the water was filtered for the predation absent experiments the sewage inoculum still had the potential to introduce predators potentially masking the effect of predation in this study although it is hard to make any inferences given the limited number of studies the use of the sewage inoculum and the different targets between the studies campylobacter spp vs e coli s paratyphi vibrio spp and y enterolitica predation not significantly affecting decay in ahmed et al 2021 in the context of this review suggests a potential interaction between predation and the method of detection culture vs molecular based for pathogenic bacteria 3 2 4 other factors ibrahim et al 2019 studied e coli o157 h7 s typhimurium human adenovirus serotype 2 and murine norovirus 1 survival while stored in sterilized river water microcosms stored at 20 4 24 c and 37 c in the dark the highest t90 values for the bacterial pathogens were observed in the 4 c trials higher temperatures were associated with faster decay of listeria monocytogenes in river water sampled near the outfall of a meat industry plant budzińska et al 2012 e coli o157 h7 in sampled creek water easton et al 2005 and e coli c jejuni and y enterocolitica in sampled stream water terzieva and mcfeters 1991 c jejuni however was less affected by temperature and y enterocolitica had the greatest survival at both temperatures terzieva and mcfeters 1991 some of the identified studies addressed the persistence of a bacterial target without manipulating any water or environmental factor directly and others studied alternative water quality factors changing salinities aquatic plant presence or turbidity el mejri et al 2012 studied the survival of environmental and laboratory adapted strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in marine water and the authors calculated an average t90 of 25 30 h for all the strains notably total cell count data suggested the bacteria were entering a viable but not culturable state el mejri et al 2012 in brackish beach mesocosms vibrio spp genetic markers exhibited biphasic decay and there were positive correlations between the culturable enterococcus targets and v cholerae molecular targets only for the first few days of the experiment suggesting a limitation in current monitoring practices tiwari et al 2019 except for vibrio rrna the decay of the bacterial targets was greater in water than sediment and vegetation tiwari et al 2019 turbidity related factors were significant in a study conducted by czajkowska et al 2005 e coli serotype o157 h7 was inoculated into freshwater sampled from several different polish lakes and rivers and maintained at 4 or 24 c the researchers conducted experiments using water muddy water and bottom shore sediments the bacteria survived slightly longer in muddy water experiments and the survival times were shorter for the experiments maintained at 24 c the authors did not detect a significant effect from the varying chemical oxygen demand or ph levels czajkowska et al 2005 3 2 5 summary looking at the selected literature as a whole for pathogenic bacteria some expected relationships were consistently observed in general decay is higher at higher temperatures as expected levin edens et al 2011 rodríguez and araujo 2012 wang and doyle 1998 budzińska et al 2012 ahmed et al 2021 lund et al 1996 czajkowska et al 2005 terzieva and mcfeters 1991 easton et al 2005 the presence of a light source consistently accelerates decay beckinhausen et al 2014 chandran and mohamed hatha 2005 rodríguez and araujo 2012 silvester et al 2021 however one study identified some potential differences between the effect of sunlight in fresh and marine waters boehm et al 2012 predation was found to significantly increase decay in a variety of targets including pathogenic e coli strains salmonella spp vibrio spp and y enterolitica avery et al 2008 chandran et al 2011 lund et al 1996 silvester et al 2021 topalcengiz and danyluk 2019 wang and doyle 1998 the effects of predation were less obvious in a study by mezriouia et al 1995 in which s typhimurium survival was only greater in sterile waters during autumn and summer seasons and predation was not found to influence the decay of campylobacter spp at all in a freshwater mesocosm study ahmed et al 2021 although it was evaluated directly and indirectly less in the pathogenic bacteria literature than the fib literature turbidity seems to again be a factor potentially influencing decay czajkowska et al 2005 other water quality factors such as ph dissolved oxygen and water conductivity were not found to significantly affect the inactivation of pathogenic bacterial targets rodríguez and araujo 2012 czajkowska et al 2005 3 3 bacteriophages nine of the studies identified in the literature review assessed the persistence of bacteriophages in surface water matrices six of the studies used freshwater marine water was studied in three studies and one study used brackish water sunlight was absent from most of the experiments and predation was predominantly present all nine studies used culture based methods to quantify the bacteriophage concentrations over time booncharoen et al 2018 evaluated the persistence of human sewage specific enterococcal bacteriophage persistence from the myoviridae a2 podoviridae s1 and siphoviridae a1 s4 families in highly and lowly populated fresh and marine water sources in thailand the highest decay rates of a1 a2 and s4 were in the highly polluted seawater matrix the highest decay rate of s1 was in the highly polluted freshwater matrix all bacteriophages exhibited slower decay in filtered samples and in lower pollution waters suggesting predation does play an important role in bacteriophage persistence additional experiments at 5 c indicated that temperature significantly affects bacteriophage decay the effects of salinity on decay varied with the pollution level of the water boonchareon et al 2018 marine water was tested in an additional study in which the marine bacteriophage h6 was inoculated into unfiltered marine water and maintained at 22 c olive et al 2020 minimal decay was observed over the 16 day experiments suggesting that the existence of predators in the water affected the bacteriophage decay minimally olive et al 2020 somatic coliphages from the myroviridae and siphoviridae family were also evaluated in another study identified in this review lee and sobsey 2011 lee and sobsey 2011 conducted experiments using reagent water and natural surface waters sampled from a freshwater body experiments were conducted at 4 c and 25 c the analysis suggested that water type reagent vs fresh temperature and incubation time were strong predictors of inactivation for most of the coliphages decay was slower at 4 c lee and sobsey 2011 greaves et al 2020 included a somatic coliphage in their large scale freshwater mesocosm experiments the mesocosms were either exposed to sunlight or left covered and somatic coliphage was detectable for two days in the uncovered experiments and five days in the covered experiments indicating that sunlight significantly affects decay notably the viral indicators in this study were more resistant to uv inactivation than the bacterial indicators studied greaves et al 2020 long and sobsey 2004 addressed the persistence of f rna and f dna coliphages in freshwater microcosms water was sampled from a surface drinking water source spiked with an individual phage to a target concentration and maintained at 4 c or 20 c in the dark the authors noted tailing in the survival curves and for all coliphages decay was slower at the lower temperature the differences between the temperatures was statistically significant for the f dna coliphages and the group ii and group iv f rna coliphages long and sobsey 2004 ravva and sarreal 2016 evaluated the persistence of f specific rna coliphages in the presence and absence of bacterial host in fresh surface waters the experiments were kept in the dark and maintained at temperatures that simulated summer 25 c or winter 10 c conditions the addition of the host resulted in greater phage persistence with phages in the absence of host disappearing relatively rapidly temperature significantly affected persistence as greater survival was observed at 10 c as compared to 25 c and there were significant differences between environmental and prototype isolate survival the chemical composition of the waters did not appear to affect decay although qb was assayed in waters with higher suspended solids than the other strains it decayed similarly ravva and sarreal 2016 qb may not be representative of coliphage suspended solids interactions as a whole however as it was an exception in a study conducted by yang and griffiths 2013 using river water experiments the study manipulated temperatures ph values and some samples were autoclaved and filtered except for qb all the other f rna phages persisted for longer in the heat treated water predation absent and were less stable when suspended solids were removed the researchers concluded that temperature and ph were major factors that affected the phage survival yang and griffiths 2013 tiwari et al 2019 detected ms2 with culture based methods in their study of decay patterns in brackish beach mesocosms ms2 decayed log linearly and had higher decay in the mesocosms without vegetation ms2 counts was strongly correlated with culturable enterococci for the first 6 8 days tiwari et al 2019 3 3 1 summary overall the studies identified in the literature provided limited insight into the factors potentially affecting decay temperature was the most frequently addressed factor and it was consistently determined to significantly affect bacteriophage decay boonchareon et al 2018 greaves et al 2020 lee and sobsey 2011 long and sobsey 2004 ravva et al 2016 yang and griffiths 2013 sunlight was shown to increase decay rates of bacteriophages noble et al 2004 but bacteriophages may be more resistant to uv inactivation than fib greaves et al 2020 predation also impacts bacteriophage decay although the impact may be sub type dependent boonchareon et al 2018 yang and griffiths 2013 and this review did not select any studies that suggested significant differences between bacteriophage decay rates in different water types boonchareon et al 2018 as only culture based methods were used in the described studies no conclusions could be drawn about method related decay differences however as opposed to the conclusions drawn in the fib and bacteria other factors sections 3 1 4 and 3 2 4 the bacteriophage literature suggests that ph does significantly affect decay yang and griffiths 2013 3 4 viruses there were 10 studies identified in the literature review that studied the persistence of viruses eight of the 10 studies used freshwater five used marine water and only one used brackish water the presence or absence of sunlight was fairly variable with two studies exposing all experiments to sunlight four studies keeping all experiments in the dark and four studies manipulating the presence of sunlight predation was predominantly present in the experiments assessing virus persistence and the virus target group had the greatest variety of method type four of the ten studies used molecular based methods adenovirus was the virus type most frequently studied in the identified literature liang et al 2017 assessed the effects of salinity and sunlight on adenovirus and found that increasing salinity was associated with greater adenovirus persistence increasing sunlight intensity increased adenovirus decay rates and results suggested that the viral targets in this study were more susceptible to sunlight than their bacterial counterparts regardless of salinity or sunlight intact cells decayed faster than total dna liang et al 2017 human adenovirus 40 41 was also studied in freshwater mesocosms that manipulated predation status and temperatures ahmed et al 2021 in one set of the experiments the decay rates were similar between predation treatments with higher decay rates observed at 25 c compared to 15 c in the other set of experiments the effects of the increased temperature were only prominent in the filtered treatments ahmed et al 2021 the effect of temperature on virus persistence was also evaluated in a study using dark sterilized river water microcosms stored at 20 c 4 c 24 c or 37 c ibrahim et al 2019 adenovirus had the slowest decay in 20 c with a t90 of almost 200 days and the fastest decay at 37 c with a t90 of 27 h norovirus was not affected by increasing temperatures in the typical manner with the fastest decay occurring in the 24 c trials and the slowest decay occurring in the 4 c ibrahim et al 2019 carratalà et al 2013 evaluated the persistence of adenoviruses in a range of water matrices but the experiments conducted in seawater were the only ones that met the natural surface water criteria for the review human adenovirus type 2 was inoculated into the seawater reactors and dark conditions were tested at 7 c 20 c and 37 c and experiments were conducted with uvb and uva light sources both classified as sunlight present herein for the dark experiments no significant inactivation was observed at 7 c or 20 c but higher inactivation was observed at 37 c the authors concluded that biotic factors may be more relevant to virus inactivation than indirect photo inactivation by uva radiation especially at higher temperatures carratalà et al 2013 olive et al 2020 investigated the microbial control of echovirus 11 adenovirus 2 and the bacteriophage h6 decay in different water types echovirus 11 was incubated in sterilized and non sterilized lake water maintained at room temperature and echovirus 11 adenovirus 2 and the bacteriophage h6 were inoculated into the eukaryotic fraction isolated from lake and ocean water the eukaryotic fraction and bacteria fraction waters discussed in this study were merely classified as predation present for this review the authors concluded that the microbial virus control was temperature dependent with more obvious reductions at 22 c as compared to 16 c dependent on the virus olive et al 2020 bergstein et al 1997 evaluated the persistence of poliovirus with in situ experiments in a freshwater lake located at different depths with variable light exposure and during different seasons winter summer very little poliovirus decay was observed during the winter experiments regardless of light presence in the summer experiment light exposure resulted in a 1 log reduction within 4 days compared to minimal observed decay in the dark nasser et al 2003 assessed the persistence of coxsackie a9 virus in fresh marine and brackish waters and virus persistence was found to be temperature dependent with faster decay observed at 30 c than 15 c die off of coxsackie a9 virus at 15 c and 30 c was greatest in marine water nasser et al 2003 the survival of rhesus rotavirus and human astrovirus was characterized in both groundwater and contaminated surface water in a study conducted by espinosa et al 2008 only the surface water experiments met the natural waters criteria outlined in section s1 results indicated that virus infectivity persisted longer in groundwater than surface water and that rotavirus persistence was more stable than astrovirus good correlation between virus infectivity and genomic material detection was noted espinosa et al 2008 the decay of enteroviruses using molecular based methods was assessed in light and dark seawater microcosms in a study conducted by walters et al 2009 the infectious enterovirus remained detectable longer in the dark microcosms than the light no difference in genome decay rates was observed between the two treatments suggesting a potential method sunlight interaction for virus targets walters et al 2009 de oliveira et al 2021 assessed the viability of sars cov 2 in filtered and nonfiltered river water experiments kept at 4 c and 24 c nonfiltered and higher temperature river water experiments were associated with faster decay de oliveira et al 2021 3 4 1 summary overall the results of the studies that manipulated water type suggest that the decay of viruses may be faster in marine waters than in fresh nasser et al 2003 although liang et al 2017 observed greater persistence with increasing salinities in general sunlight increased viral decay carratalà et al 2013 bergstein et al 1997 liang et al 2017 but there was no difference between genome decay rates in a study conducted by walters et al 2009 similarly to the bacteriophage literature the studies identified herein suggest that the relationship between virus persistence and predation may be complicated de oliveira et al 2021 observed clear differences between sars cov 2 persistence when predation was present versus absent but the effects of predation on adenovirus persistence were unclear ahmed et al 2021 olive et al 2020 concluded that the microbial control of virus populations may be temperature dependent as the differences between the predation status was less obvious at lower temperatures the effects of temperature seem to be relatively consistent with the rest of the aforementioned targets with the exception of norovirus most studies found that decay increased with increasing temperatures 2021 carratalà et al 2013 nasser et al 2003 de oliviera et al 2021 however norovirus in one study had the highest decay rate at the second highest temperature 24 c ibrahim et al 2019 3 5 protozoa protozoa were the least frequently studied target in the literature identified in this review only four studies assessed the persistence of protozoa and as such there was minimal water quality and environmental factor variation to facilitate comparisons multiple water matrices fresh brackish and marine were used by nasser et al 2003 to test the persistence of cryptosporidium at two different temperatures 15 c or 30 c the persistence of cryptosporidium was not influenced by temperature in any of the water types in general little to no decay was observed for cryptosporidium across all the experiments and it was concluded that e coli was not a suitable indicator for cryptosporidium robertson et al 2006 studied cryptosporidium oocyst and giardia cyst persistence in a freshwater river the river water temperature throughout the experiment fluctuated from 1 1 c to 7 3 c river water was also sampled for a control experiment maintained in the refrigerator 4 c cryptosporidium oocysts were detected as viable up until 20 weeks and giardia cysts were detected until about 1 month comparisons between control and river environments suggest that temperature changes and other physical chemical and biological factors do not significantly impact the decay of the studied parasites robertson et al 2006 medema et al 1997 evaluated the persistence of cryptosporidium parvum in autoclaved and natural river water microcosms that were maintained in the dark the effects of predation were evident at 15 c but not at 5 c die off of c parvum was faster at the higher temperature medema et al 1997 the freshwater mesocosms constructed by ahmed et al 2021 also evaluated the persistence of c parvum c parvum genome decay was best described by a biphasic model and a greater reduction was observed at 25 c than 15 c for all trials vital dye assays were used to assess c parvum viability and the relationship with temperature and filtration status was found to be variable 3 5 1 summary the four studies addressing protozoa persistence described herein suggest that cryptosporidium is relatively resistant to the factors that have been shown to increase decay rates of the other target types as expected two of the studies found no increase in decay rate with increased temperatures and decay was similar between the sunlight present and absent studies conducted by robertson et al 2006 the study conducted by medema et al 1997 suggests that c parvum may be affected by predation at some temperatures again suggesting that interactions between predation and temperature may be significantly affecting the decay of pathogens in surface waters however the other study assessing predation suggested there was minimal impact from predation presence ahmed et al 2021 4 discussion 4 1 observed decay kinetics the majority of the studies identified in this review used first order kinetics to describe the observed decay a number of the studies described herein however observed biphasic decay patterns ahmed et al 2019 dick et al 2010 solecki et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 mattioli et al 2017 tiwari et al 2019 carratalà et al 2013 de oliviera et al 2021 easton et al 2005 medema et al 1997 some of these studies noted biphasic decay but only fit log linear models while others fit alternative model forms of the 61 studies included in this review less than 20 analyzed their data with biphasic or nonlinear model forms in addition to the traditionally assumed first order decay kinetic profiles ahmed et al 2019 2021 bailey et al 2019 carratalà et al 2013 de oliviera et al 2021 jeanneau et al 2012 lee and sobsey 2011 mattioli et al 2017 solecki et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 the most frequently applied model form in these studies was the so termed biphasic decay model represented by eqs 1 and 2 where c t is the concentration at time t c0 is the concentration at time 0 t is the time point where the second phase of decay begins and k1 and k2 are the first order decay constants for the two phases zhang et al 2015 ahmed et al 2019 2021 the biphasic decay model provided a good fit to cultured fib in marine water zhang et al 2015 molecular targets for fib in fresh and marine water ahmed et al 2019 and c parvum molecular targets in freshwater ahmed et al 2021 1 ln c t c 0 k 1 t t t 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t k 2 t t t t solecki et al 2011 also observed biphasic decay in their fib experiments however the model applied to the data slightly differed from eqs 1 2 as shown in eq 3 the two first order decay rates were applied to different proportions of the initial population of c0 designated with the parameter f the observed biphasic decay was hypothesized to be due to rapid die off until a carrying capacity was reached or the microorganisms using quorum sensing to regulate their numbers solecki et al 2011 the same model was applied to the decay of fib jeanneau et al 2012 somatic coliphages lee and sobsey 2011 and adenovirus carratalà et al 2013 albeit with f defined as a mixing parameter designated as ω in the study of adenovirus inactivation 3 c t c 0 f e k 1 t 1 f e k 2 t mattioli et al 2017 fit the shoulder log linear model to fib persistence experiments and found that the shoulder log linear model provided the best fit to enterococci molecular data instead of a second decay rate as is the case for eqs 1 3 the shoulder log linear model s second parameter s represents the shoulder or lag time where there is minimal inactivation eq 4 the other studies that applied nonlinear model forms such as the exponential biphasic weibull and gompertz models found that the nonlinear models provided better fits to virus inactivation data under all tested conditions de oliviera et al 2021 and bacteriophage inactivation data from the experiments evaluating the effect of their highest tested temperature 25 c vs 4 c lee and sobsey 2011 4 c t c 0 e k t e k s 1 e k s 1 e k t of the few studies discussed herein that analyzed the fit of both nonlinear and linear models to persistence data the nonlinear models were found to provide a good fit to fib bacteriophage virus and protozoa data from experiments representing different water types temperatures and methods of detection biphasic decay has also been described in other persistence studies regarding matrices with conditions that did not meet the requirements of the review herein easton et al 2005 park et al 2016 these studies and the results of previous modeling studies mitchell and akram 2017 dean et al 2020 suggest that two or three parameter models are better able to capture the dynamics of decay than the traditionally assumed first order kinetics one of the aims of this review was to determine the quantity of available pathogen and indicator persistence data for surface waters that could be explored in analyses that expand past the assumption of first order decay kinetics this review differed from some of the previous systematic literature reviews in that the studies had to include raw data that met the requirements for model fitting more than three time points as opposed to previous reviews that aimed to extract reported first order decay rates boehm et al 2018 2019 the 61 studies described herein represent over 600 experiments available in the literature for this purpose 4 2 environment and water quality factor interactions in addition to quantifying the available data in the literature for persistence modeling purposes this review also aimed to assess the current state of the knowledge regarding the water quality and environmental factors that impact indicator and pathogen decay in surface waters previous factor analyses have used dependent variables derived from the assumed first order decay kinetics boehm et al 2018 2019 it is possible that the reduction in model uncertainty through the application of more accurate persistence models will also facilitate factor analyses capable of elucidating the finer relationships between environment and water quality factors affecting target persistence previous analyses that fit alternative persistence models to a large database of experiments did not complete an adjoining factor analysis mitchell and akram 2017 the studies discussed herein analyzed the effect of water quality and environmental variables with a variety of methods correlation coefficients and analyses ahmed et al 2019 tiwari et al 2019 korajkic et al 2014 espinosa et al 2008 two way and three way anovas korajkic et al 2013 2019 wanjugi et al 2016 avery et al 2008 multiple linear regression liang et al 2017 levin edens et al 2011 and generalized linear mixed models wanjugi et al 2016 were some of the methods implemented as illustrated in fig 1 the factors most frequently addressed by the studies identified in this literature review were temperature sunlight and predation temperature consistently was associated with decay for fib pathogenic bacteria bacteriophages and viruses but increasing temperatures had little effect on protozoan decay in the identified literature robertson et al 2006 nasser et al 2003 the presence of artificial or natural sunlight was frequently one of the main drivers of inactivation for the studied target types except for protozoa however fib may be more susceptible to uv inactivation than viral indicators greaves et al 2020 the fib and pathogenic bacteria literature suggest that there may be possible interactions between sunlight and water type boehm et al 2012 bordalo et al 2002 as well as sunlight and method of detection culture vs molecular based walters et al 2009 korajkic et al 2019 it is important to note however that other factors such as turbidity uv wavelength or water depth that were not consistently documented may be impacting the interpretation of the effects of sunlight presence on target persistence the presence of predation typically was found to increase decay for fib pathogenic bacteria viruses and bacteriophages but the effects of predation were in some cases unclear korajkic et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021 and possible water type predation interactions for fib korajkic et al 2013 and temperature predation interactions for viral and protozoan targets were observed olive et al 2020 medema et al 1997 fewer studies identified in the literature addressed the effects of water type and method of detection for the targets of concern decay differed by water type for some fib with increasing salinities generally associated with faster decay fujioka 1981 korajkic et al 2013 liang et al 2017 jeanneau et al 2012 marine water was also associated with faster decay of viral targets in one study nasser et al 2003 which differs from conclusions in a previous review boehm et al 2019 the fib literature also suggested potential water type method of detection interactions as differences in fib decay between culture based and molecular based methods were identified in the freshwater experiments but not the marine water korajkic et al 2019 one study of pathogenic bacteria suggested decay may be faster in freshwater than marine levin edens et al 2011 and the studies identified in this review did not have enough data to draw any conclusions about the effects of water type on bacteriophage or protozoan decay turbidity was found to influence decay in the fib and pathogenic bacteria literature and ph was a potential factor of significance in the bacteriophage literature notably the majority of the studies focused on fib and pathogenic bacteria and the factors affecting their persistence additional research manipulating water quality factors as they influence virus bacteriophage and protozoa decay are needed to better understand those relationships the majority 75 of the identified studies addressed persistence in freshwater matrices and only 38 and 13 addressed persistence in marine and brackish matrices respectively in general there was a lack of data for molecular based methods the lack of data on water type comparisons and persistence measured with molecular based methods were research gaps noted in a previous review boehm et al 2018 it is important to note however that the qualitative synthesis of the studies discussed in this review reflect the water quality and environmental conditions assessed in experiments shared in the peer reviewed literature that also documented target concentrations for more than three independent time points 5 conclusions this systematic review identified 61 studies that addressed the persistence of indicators or pathogens in natural surface water matrices and these studies represent over 600 experiments in the literature that provided quantitative data to further explore persistence models that challenge traditional first order decay kinetic assumptions strong relationships between sunlight predation temperature and persistence were consistently discussed for the majority of the target types the effects of water type method of detection turbidity and ph were less consistent across target types and should be further explored in future analyses this review highlighted several potential interactions between the water quality and experimental factors that could further complicate the relationships between factor and decay future experiments can be designed to test these potential interactions more thoroughly and this review provides the foundation for the intentional inclusion of interaction terms in factor analyses as opposed to exploratory analyses with forward or backwards selection which is needed in the experimental design phase for such work the methods frequently used to study persistence in surface waters microcosms mesocosms models used to describe decay and the techniques used to study factor relationships correlation analyses anovas regressions were reviewed herein to aid future researchers in the endeavor to better understand pathogen threats and human health risks in surface waters funding funding was provided from the national science foundation graduate research fellowship nsf grfp under grant no dge 1848739
