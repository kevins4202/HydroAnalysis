22315,oblique water entry of marine structure involves complex hydrodynamics phenomena including splash formation asymmetrical cavity and pinch off that have been observed in previous systematic experiments however very few studies focus on such phenomena induced by oblique impact of object in a two layer liquid system in this paper we present an experimental investigation of oblique entry of a sphere into a deep pool of water within a layer of highly viscous dimethicone floating on the water in the experiment a high speed digital camera is established to obtain the instantaneous cavity and motion trajectories for both qualitative and quantitative analysis the results show that the upper layer viscous liquid introduces a significant change in the splash formation mechanism and the special behaviors are characterized by stratified splash and corresponding asymmetrical shrinkage structures meanwhile it is observed that the difference in splash characteristics caused by different thicknesses of viscous fluid layer is obvious and the pinch off depth is independent of the thickness value which studied in our experiments in addition it is found that increasing the horizontal impact velocity will cause a delay in the splash closure and the vertical displacement of the sphere during the dimethicone water enter process is independent of the horizontal impact velocity hydrodynamic force model is established to explain the trajectory of the sphere furthermore the splash angle pinch off depth pinch off time and the water entry depth at pinch off locations and the corresponding change tendency are obtained qualitatively and quantitatively these results indicate that the dimethicone layer is critical in determining the cavity dynamics especially splash formation and pinch off characteristics keywords oblique impact two layer liquid splash formation cavity dynamics pinch off 1 introduction studies of objects impacting into the water has attracted the attention of researchers for over a century and is still a hot topic of current research worthington and cole 1897 wang et al 2019 the water entry problem is relevant to application of air to sea projectile may 1952 ship slamming faltinsen 1990 and stone skipping rosellini et al 2005 the phenomenon of solid liquid impact is accompanied by many modern cavity dynamics such as splash inception cavity formation splash seal and pinch off aristoff et al 2010 chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 mansoor et al 2014 sun et al 2019 particularly one of the important problems has long been studying is the splash behavior and cavity dynamics during a solid object impacting liquid process water entry is a challenging problem and associated with the complex hydrodynamic feature the pioneering experiments were conducted by worthington and cole 1897 1900 and worthington 1908 they obtained the first high speed photographs of the impact dynamics and cavity formation following worthington s works may 1951 1952 experimentally studied the effects of surface conditions on splashes formations and the types of cavity closures since then surface characteristic of water entry objects has been studied extended to wettability duez et al 2007 hydrophobicity korkmaz and güzel 2017 and temperature li et al 2018 the effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface of spheres on cavity formation was studied by truscott and techet 2009a they found that transverse spin altered the spheres surface velocity distribution and cavity formation in addition to these notable studies other works on water entry problems involves the influence of object shape on cavity dynamics such as spheres may and woodhull 1948 belden et al 2016 rigid projectile lee et al 1997 slender axisymmetric bodies bodily et al 2014 and wedges shams et al 2015 duclaux et al 2007 performed an experimental study on the collapse of a transient cavity of air in water created by the impact of a sphere and analyzed the cavity evolution and pinch off features speirs et al 2019 used spheres to investigate the cavity shape splash crown and scale pinch off times they found that there were three kinds of splash crowns including thick rim forms thin crown and classical cavities li et al 2019 investigated the multiphase flow during water entry of spheres with different surface wettability at low froude numbers the results showed that the impact of the hydrophilic case creates a smaller splash and the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres experience different cavity regimes as the froude number increases particular attention was paid to address the influence of liquid properties on cavity dynamics the associated experiments involved multiple characteristic liquids including glycerine water mixture bell 1924 viscoelastic liquid cheny and walters 1996 and ethanol grumstrup et al 2007 driscoll et al 2010 performed an experiment to address the thin film formation during splashing of viscous liquids they found that the time of sheet ejection depends on impact velocity liquid viscosity molecular weight and gas pressure le goff et al 2013 experimentally investigated the process of spheres impacted the viscous newtonian liquids they found that there was no cavity entrainment due to the spheres stopped before the cavity retracted marston et al 2016 compared the splash characteristics produced by water and perfluorohexane they found that surface tension played an important role in the crown closure the interesting buckling phenomena occurred in both water and perfluorohexane crowns indicated much finer and more numerous rib structures for perfluorohexane these novel observations and founding provided a new perspective for impact features of single phase liquid system more recently tan and thomas 2018 experimentally studied the influence of an upper layer liquid on the phenomena and cavity formation an unusual shallow seal of cavity pinching off close to the liquid surface had seen in their experiments moreover according to the impact experiments of two layer system of immiscible liquids conducted by tan 2019 the influence of the viscosity of an upper layer liquid on cavity formation and overall dynamics was further highlighted these works have contributed much to our understanding of water entry although the study on water entry has significantly increased during the past decades little attention is paid to the cavity dynamics involving highly viscous liquid moreover the influence of surface viscous liquid content and froude number on cavity formation and dynamics mechanism during water entry of objects are still not well understood hence the aim of this experimental study is to provide new phenomenon of a thin layer of highly viscous liquid resting on a deep pool of water to alter splash characteristics and cavity dynamics of oblique impact spheres experiments with clean water using the same spheres are investigated to highlight and support the present findings in sec ii we present our experimental setup including the facility parameters liquid properties and test cases section iii first summarizes the effect of the highly viscous liquid layer on the cavity formation mechanism subsequently the influence of the thickness of viscous liquid layer and the horizontal impact velocity on the cavity dynamics are analyzed moreover we mainly analyze the characteristic of the splash angle pinch off time and pinch off depth finally the conclusions are presented in section iv 2 experimental setup fig 1 shows the schematic of the experimental setup we conducted the impact using a 1 5 m 0 8 m 1 0 m length width depth glass tank a standard billiard ball as the test model with a diameter d 57 2 mm and mass of the sphere is m s 0 18 kg the release mechanism consists of a pneumatic finger fixed on a car the horizontal initial velocity u 0 of the sphere is generated by a motor driving the car and the vertical entry velocity at the still free surface is generated by free fall with v 0 2 g h where g 9 81 m s2 is the gravity acceleration and h is the release height the water in the glass tank was covered by a layer of dimethicone with a density of ρ 941 kg m3 surface tension σ 19 4 mn m and dynamic viscosity μ 0 01 pa s the density of dimethicone is similar to that of water but the surface tension and viscosity are significantly different from water it is helpful to analyze the influence of upper layer highly viscous liquid on cavity dynamics the thickness of the dimethicone layer h was 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm 5 mm 6 mm 7 mm 8 mm respectively the spheres were released at the height of h 0 95 m to acquire the vertical impact velocity of v 0 4 32 m s and the horizontal impact velocity of the sphere is in a range of u 0 0 49 1 3 m s due to the equipment limitations the motion of the sphere and the cavity dynamics were recorded with a high speed camera phantom v12 1 at a frame rate of 3000 frames per second with an image resolution of 1280 800 pixels the value of exposure time used in the present experiments is 1 3000 s meanwhile throughout the experiments the liquid temperature was kept constant at 16 c to minimize temperature induced physical properties variation table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions in the present study 3 results and discussions 3 1 cavity formation mechanism induced by a thin layer of highly viscous liquid floating on water following the discussions of may 1975 and truscott and techet 2009b we analyze the cavity formation problem in four distinct stages 1 the flow forming stage 2 the open cavity and splash growth stage 3 the closed cavity and pinch off stage and 4 the collapsing cavity stage fig 2 presents sequence of images of the cavity formation of the sphere falls into the water dimethicone and water in stage 1 of the impact sequence t 10 ms and t 20 ms an initial horizontal splash of fluids forms as the sphere impact the still free surface and this splash extends radially outwards as the sphere descends into the liquids at t 20 ms the splash transitions from outwards to upwards growth during stage 1 we can clearly see that the cavity formed by the impact of water dimethicone are almost the same as the cavity formed by the impact of the water in stage 2 of the impact sequence t 30 60 ms the entire sphere passes below the still free surface and an open air cavity begins to form in its wake it is observed that the splash crown and the top of the subsurface air cavity bases connected to the free surface increase in diameter interestingly left right asymmetry in cavity below free surface and splash above free surface can be observed in stage 2 it is well known that the initial stages of impact of object on the free surface are dominated by inertial effects hence the subsurface air cavity both grows radially outwards and elongates vertically as the sphere descends however the splash of sphere entry onto the two layer liquid system formed by a dimethicone layer floating on the water are quite different than onto only water for the water dimethicone entry case as shown in fig 2 a the splash appears stratified and is characterized by upper and lower layers this unique phenomenon has not been observed by other experiments worthington 1908 truscott and techet 2009b smolka and mclaughlin 2019 moreover obvious buckling instability occurs around the upper right part of the splash wall in the water dimethicone entry case which is marked by arrow at t 40 ms in fig 2 a whereas the event of buckling instability is weak in water entry case according to marston et al 2016 the collapse of the splash is mainly driven by surface tension and the buckling occurs when collapse rate is faster than the vertical velocity of the splash crown hence we speculate that small surface tension is beneficial to accelerate the radial shrinkage and the corresponding buckling instability is easy to occur in water dimethicone entry case in stage 3 of the impact sequence t 70 100 ms the subsurface air cavity continues to stretch and curve as the sphere descends the cavity evolution below the free surface in water entry case and water dimethicone entry case is similar meanwhile as shown in fig 2 b the splash film is closed and no more air can flow into the cavity however for the two layer liquid system presented in fig 2 a the lower left corner of the upper layer splash shrinks then the bottom boundary of the upper layer splash is lower than the upper boundary of the lower layer splash at the same time the upper right corner of the upper layer splash goes downwards which leads the upper layer splash collapses therefore the presence of the dimethicone layer modifies the splash evolution and seal patterns in the early stage 4 the cavity below the still free surface appears pinch off and it splits into two distinct cavities a lower air cavity still fully attached to the sphere and an upper air cavity connected to the free surface it is worth noting that the pinch off time of the two layer liquid system is earlier than the water entry case after pinch off t 110 ms the cavity begins a rapid collapse below the free surface distinct jet of fluid ejects away from the point of pinch off can be seen both in water entry case and water dimethicone entry case this jet phenomenon is also seen by other researchers e g worthington and cole 1897 truscott and techet 2009b in order to gain further insight into the effect of the upper layer dimethicone on cavity formation of the oblique impact of a sphere the comparison of cavity shape between water entry and upper layer dimethicone entry is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a it should be noted that the wall of the cavity formed under the free surface is smooth which is consistent with the observations of single phase liquid system may 1952 mansoor et al 2017 hou et al 2018 however it is interesting to note that the cavity wall for water dimethicone entry case is relatively rough and it is characterized by wave like instability structure due to the difference in viscosity between water and dimethicone the generation of the wave like structures is driven by the shear induced instability which occurs at the contact line between the surrounding water and the entrained dimethicone of the sphere moreover note that ribbed structure is observed around the upper left part of the splash wall in water dimethicone entry case whereas the splash wall in the water still maintains good continuity by comparing the pinch off locations of the two conditions presented in fig 3 b an interesting observation is that the film wall at the rim of the lower splash breaks into a finger like structure the wave and rib structure features can be observed more clearly by the zoomed views in fig 3 it further highlights the upper layer dimethicone plays an important role on splash formation and seal pattern surface tension is considered to play an important role in determining the splash evolution mechanism and the corresponding important parameter is the weber number mansoor et al 2014 it is well known that the weber number is the ratio between the inertial force and the surface tension force and it is expressed as we ρlv 2 2σ where l is the characteristic length v is the velocity of fluid in the splash the relevant velocity and length scales must reflect the motion hence the splash weber number is defined as we s ρδv s 2 σ where δ is the thickness of the splash film v s is splash velocity to analyze the splash stratification patterns splash formation images at two typical moments and the corresponding schematic of the cavity wall profile and motion velocity at the stratified boundary are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a obvious splash stratification can be seen on the splash film of the experimental image based on the intersection line structure between the lower layer and the upper layer of the splash we can conclude that the velocity distribution along the intersection line is linear the instantaneous average velocity of the splash motion in fig 4 a is approximately v s 1 2 m s meanwhile the value of the film thickness is δ 10 μm according to experimental findings by zhang et al 2012 and marston et al 2016 hence taking δ ο 10 μm and the splash velocity v s ο 10 0 m s we can obtain that w e s ο 10 1 for water and w e s ο 10 0 for dimethicone this indicates surface tension does play a significant role in the splash formation more importantly the discontinuity of weber number at the interface between the upper and lower layers is cause of the splash stratification moreover as shown in fig 4 b it is observed that the shrinkage near the intersection line on the left and right sides of the splash is asymmetrical actually from the schematic illustration of fig 4 b we can know that the splash motion velocity v sl on the left side is greater than the velocity v sr on the right side in other words the difference in velocity will lead to the difference in weber numbers therefore the surface tension significantly changes the evolution mechanism of splash during the entry process in the two layer liquid system to further elucidate the splash stratification patterns the schematic representation of instantaneous motion state and cavity profile in xoy plane is shown in fig 5 gillbarg and anderson 1948 stated that the cavity splash is subject to two chief forces surface tension σ and a pressure drop δp caused by the air flow behind the sphere it is conceivable that the presence of the pressure drop across the splash film can play a role in splash shrinkage visual inspection of the splash formation just prior to shrinkage and seal as presented in fig 2 at these instantaneous moments of the upward motion of the cavity splash the surface tension in the radial direction is not enough to overcome the inertial force therefore no splash shrinkage is formed along the crown wall near the intersection line however the surface tension in the radial direction becomes prominent when the upper layer splashes slowly or even stops rising meanwhile the cavity splash formed by water below the intersection line continues to expand due to inertial effects and from energy transfer by sphere at its instantaneous location as a result splash shrinkage appears at the junction of dimethicone and water of the splash 3 2 influence of the thickness of viscous liquid layer on cavity formation to analyze the cavity evolution and splash formation quantitatively we introduce four parameters θ d p t p and d c the definition of these parameters are presented in the following and shown in fig 6 the angle between the splash layered line and the horizontal direction is denoted as θ the depth at which cavity pinch off occurs is denoted d p and the corresponding pinch off time is defined as t p the total entry depth of the sphere d c is defined as the distance from the undisturbed free surface to the leading edge of the sphere at any moment during the water entry process fig 7 shows the splash and cavity formation by the impact of spheres at different moments with the dimethicone layer thickness h of 0 8 mm for t 70 ms as shown in fig 7 a stratified splash can be observed when the dimethicone layer thickness varied from 2 mm to 8 mm and the stratified boundary height decreases as the thickness of the dimethicone layer increases on the one hand it is indicated that the source of the liquid that forms the splash is more than 8 mm and on the other hand also indicates that the energy of the sphere during the water entry process is distributed to different regions of the splash note that for the 4 mm and 5 mm cases the splash shrinkage appears on the left side of the stratified interface moreover compared with the water entry case a more pronounced ribbed structure can be seen in the splash seal region of the dimethicone water entry cases at the pinch off time as shown in fig 7 b it is observed that the obvious collapse of the upper layer splash occurs in the 3 mm and 4 mm thickness of the dimethicone water entry cases however the collapse intensity is weaker in the 2 mm and 5 mm dimethicone water entry cases at this moment as shown in fig 7 note that the water film in cavity splash of the 2 mm working condition is high enough to cause the splash seal to occur mainly on the upper side of the water film whereas for the 5 mm test case the rise height of the water film is limited due to the energy distribution of the falling sphere hence it is observed that splash seal occurs on the upper side of the dimethicone layer that is away from the position of the splash stratification especially the splash seal area is close to the stratified position resulting in a more pronounced collapse and shrinkage when the thickness of dimethicone layer is 3 mm and 4 mm therefore the thickness of dimethicone is an important factor for the collapse phenomenon in the cavity splash and we speculate that there may be a critical dimethicone thickness value between 2 mm and 5 mm in the present experiment meanwhile by comparing the pinch off depth d p marked by solid line in fig 7 b dimethicone water entry cases are marked by black line and water entry case is marked by red line and the entry depth d c marked by dashed line in fig 7 b dimethicone water entry cases are marked by black line and water entry case is marked by red line we found that the pinch off positions and the entry depth of the different thickness of dimethicone water entry cases are almost the same however the values of d p and d c in the dimethicone water entry cases are smaller than that of the water entry case this indicates that the high viscosity dimethicone floating above the water causes the pinch off to occur earlier but the thickness value range of the dimethicone we studied has almost no effect on the pinch off position for t 120 ms after pinch off moment as shown in fig 7 c it can be seen that the water film breaks into a finger like structure at the left rim of the lower crown in the 3 mm and 4 mm dimethicone water entry cases interestingly a connected bubbles trace can be observed between the upper cavity near the free surface and the cavity attached to the tail of the sphere and the closure depth of the upper cavity under the free surface almost the same as the dimethicone thickness increases the above results indicate that the thickness of dimethicone affects the splash formation and evolution process to further clarify the influence of the dimethicone layer and the thickness on the splash formation enlarged views of the splash morphology above the free surface in water entry case and dimethicone water entry cases with different thickness of dimethicone are shown in fig 8 fig 8 a compares the results at the same water entry time of t 60 ms it is noteworthy that the ribbed structures in the crown are more in number and larger in scale for the dimethicone water entry cases compared to the water entry therefore the presence of the dimethicone layer leads to a more complicated splash seal mechanism in addition the shrinkage tendency at the interface of the upper and lower layers of the splash becomes weaker as the thickness of the dimethicone increases fig 8 b presents the splash pattern when the angle between the splash layered line and the horizontal direction θ 12 5 as can be seen from fig 8 a the smaller the thickness of the dimethicone layer the shorter the time required to reach a certain angle in fact the splash for these four cases is in different stages of evolution for the h 2 mm case it is the development stage of the splash crown for the h 3 mm case the upper layer of the splash begins to occur buckling instability for the h 5 mm case it is in the early stage of splash seal of the upper layer cavity for the h 7 mm case the splash is almost closed due to the sphere liquid interaction the kinetic energy of the sphere transfers to the surrounding fluids as the sphere decelerates the water in splash will obtain less energy as the thickness of dimethicone increases as a result the angular velocity of the splash layered line of the thick dimethicone layer cases is smaller than that of the thin ones hence it will take more time to reach the same angle of the splash layered line for the thicker dimethicone layer cases due to the energy distribution and the presence of the dimethicone layer 3 3 influence of the horizontal impact velocity on cavity dynamics in order to analyze the effect of horizontal impact velocity on cavitation formation a comparison of the cavity morphology at four horizontal impact velocities with a dimethicone thickness of 2 mm is given in fig 9 for t 70 ms before pinch off moment as shown in fig 9 a it is important to note that the size of the opening at the top of the splash is different and appears to increase with the increase of horizontal impact velocity in other words increasing the horizontal impact velocity causes a delay in the splash closure moreover the angle θ increases as the speed increases indicating that the large horizontal impact velocity causes the cavity asymmetry to be more pronounced this observation is further confirmed at the pinch off position as shown in fig 9 b in particular a complete splash seal is formed when u 0 0 51 m s as shown in fig 9 c there is a line closure pattern observed as marked with arrows in fig 9 c in the experiments due to the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cavity under the still free surface it is worth noting that there is no bubbles trace generated after pinch off in the symmetrical water entry cases grumstrup et al 2007 aristoff and bush 2009 tan and thomas 2018 sun et al 2019 whereas the bubbles trace was found in the asymmetrical water entry process of projectiles bodily et al 2014 due to the formation of the jet and the asymmetry of cavity in the oblique entry cases the boundary of the cavity wall is easier to roll up into a ring vortex which entrains air along the cavity wall and the subsequent shedding of gas bubbles at the tail of the attached cavity over the sphere spurk 2002 karn et al 2016 moreover with the increase of horizontal impact velocity the connected bubbles trace shifts from curve to approximate straight line due to the inertia effects curves of the horizontal and vertical displacement as a function of time at the above four different initial vertical impact velocities are shown in fig 10 the curves indicate that relation between displacement and time follow a more non linear relationship note that the horizontal displacement of the sphere rise faster with increasing impact velocity however as can be seen in fig 10 b the values in the vertical displacement are almost the same for different initial vertical impact velocities therefore we speculate that the vertical drag force during the dimethicone water process is independent of the horizontal impact velocity to support this conclusion we will analyze the force model of sphere during the entry case in the next part in order to determine the sphere trajectory of the above analysis fig 11 presents the instantaneous force model of sphere motion the trajectory of the sphere at multiple times during the entry process is marked by red dashed line it is worth noting that the sphere almost keeps linear motion within the time range of the present study the coordinate directions have been defined in fig 1 b and are also shown in fig 11 c the force balance equation of oblique motion of the sphere is expressed as 3 1 m s m a a s g f b f d f t where m s ρ s v s p h e r e 4 3 π ρ s r s 3 is the mass of the sphere ρ s is the density of the sphere v s p h e r e is the volume of the sphere and r s is the radius of the sphere the force required to accelerate the surrounding liquid is expressed as the added mass m a c m ρ w v s p h e r e where c m is the added mass coefficient and ρ w is the liquid density a s is the acceleration of the sphere g m g is the gravity f b is the buoyancy force f d is the drag force f t is the surface tension force according to aristoff et al 2010 the added mass force m a a s should appear as an independent term at relatively small froude numbers during the process of water entry the maximum froude number in this paper is no more than 10 therefore the added mass force cannot be ignored meanwhile it is noted that the added mass coefficient c m is related to the submerged depth and it could go from zero at first impact and up to 0 5 when the sphere is one radius deep shepard et al 2019 however c m is usually considered to be a constant of 0 5 newman 1977 truscott et al 2012 tan 2019 wang et al 2019 hence we take it as a constant c m 0 5 for analysis in the present study and the added mass is given as m a 0 5 ρ w v s p h e r e for the buoyancy force ignoring the initial partial submerged process it can be expressed as f b ρ w g v sphere the drag force is f d 0 5 c d ρ w a p w 2 where c d is the drag coefficient and it is typically taken to be constant for varying impact velocities and penetration depth in studies of subsonic water entry cases lee et al 1997 abraham et al 2014 a p is the projected wetted area of the submerged portion w u v is the total velocity meanwhile as shown in fig 11 b the dynamic contact angles on the left and right sides of the sphere are defined as α and β respectively it is worth noting that both α and β are almost constant in the stable entry stage of the sphere the projected wetted area can be expressed as a p π r s 2 in direction of movement of the sphere when the entry is more than one diameter depth however the effects of initial impact conditions and gravity will cause the values of α and β to be different therefore we introduce a correction coefficient k o which is a constant close to 1 and the corresponding projected wetted area becomes a p k o π r s 2 moreover the surface tension force f t can be neglected as it is less than 1 of the gravitational force for the water entry of standard billiard balls truscott and techet 2009b as mentioned in section 2 the surface tension coefficient of dimethicone is much smaller than that of water and tan 2019 demonstrated that f t was on a much lower percentage of f d therefore even if there is a dimethicone layer the surface tension can be negligible in the force model by making a s the subject and simplifying eq 3 1 the equations in the x and y directions can be expressed as 3 2 x a s x c d k o 4 r s ρ w ρ s u 2 sin φ y a s y 2 3 1 ρ w ρ s g c d k o 4 r s ρ w ρ s v 2 cos φ where φ is the angle between f d and j ˆ as shown in fig 11 c based on the previous analysis the value of φ is almost a constant due to the straight track of the sphere in the present study in eq 3 2 it is indicated that the sphere will receive larger horizontal acceleration at higher initial horizontal impact velocity this can better explain the variation trend of the displacement curve at different initial horizontal impact velocities in fig 10 a according to a sy in eq 3 2 since the initial vertical impact velocities of the four conditions in fig 10 b are the same the vertical displacement versus time curves under different conditions present the same trend the force model in eq 3 2 is mainly suitable for oblique impact of sphere into water for a relatively short time in the present study we can speculate that the trajectory of the sphere will not remain straight at all times if the experimental recording time is long enough as a result the parameters k o and φ in eq 3 2 will be time dependent however it should be noted that the measurement of these forces are also very difficult until now and the subtleties of these differences difficult to pinpoint in order to better establish the force model more measurement methods and flow field information are necessary in the future work 3 4 splash angle and typical pinch off parameters characteristics in this section we further quantitatively assess the effects of dimethicone and initial impact velocity on the cavity dynamics fig 12 presents the angle θ mentioned above as a function of non dimensional velocity parameter u 0 at the pinch off locations where u 0 u 0 h g from fig 7 b it is observed that no obvious oil and water boundary line is formed in the splash for the dimethicone water entry case of h 2 mm hence the thickness of the dimethicone layer is in the range 3 mm h 8 mm in fig 12 in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to angles yields an uncertainty of 1 it should be noted that the symbols denote experimental data and the corresponding fitted curves are presented with second order function it indicates that the value of θ increases as the decreases of the thickness of dimethicone layer and it decreases as the increases of the original horizontal impact velocity pinch off time is non dimensionalized as t p t p u 0 d in fig 13 in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to times yields an uncertainty of 0 66 ms in t p it should be noted that deep seal is driven by hydrostatic pressure and thus pinch off time scales with froude number fr speirs et al 2018 the dimensionless time t p is plotted against fr in fig 13 where fr u 0 g d 2 u 0 is the initial horizontal impact velocity at the still free surface g is the gravitational acceleration and d is the diameter of the sphere interestingly we observe roughly linear relationships between t p and fr based on the experimental data fitting the measured dimensionless pinch off time is t p 0 96 fr and t p increases as the froude number increases lee et al 1997 rationalized the experiments of gilbarg and anderson 1948 regarding the apparent independence of the dimensionless pinch off time on the vertical impact velocity more recently truscott and techet 2009b provided further experimental evidence that the pinch off time t p v 0 d fr is roughly constant in water entry our experimental findings are generally similar to their measurements however our fr is based on the horizontal impact velocity and is different from their vertical velocity definition moreover the measured pinch off time is t p 1 92 d 2 g for all the water dimethicone entry cases in the present study duclaux et al 2007 found the prefactor k to be 2 06 for the impact of spheres and the corresponding relationship is t p 2 06 d 2 g the difference of the prefactor k between water dimethicone entry cases and water entry cases indicates the pinch off time is effected by the dimethicone layer hence we conclude that the presence of high viscosity dimethicone contributes to the cavity shrinkage and the pinch off occurs earlier furthermore based on the pinch off time t p we can also draw that the cavity pinch off time is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer and the horizontal impact velocity fig 14 shows our experimental data for the dimensionless pinch off depth d p as a function of fr 1 where d p is expressed as d p u 0 t p in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to millimeters yields an uncertainty of 1 94 mm in d p the scatter points with the same shape in fig 14 represent different thickness of dimethicone layer at the same horizontal impact velocity we observe that a robust linear relationship between the dimensionless pinch off depth and fr 1 the slope k of d p fr 1 for all the water dimethicone entry cases is 6 15 meanwhile the pinch off depth d p 5 9 d it indicates that the pinch off depth d p is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer and the horizontal impact velocity fig 15 shows the values of the water entry depth d c of the water entry cases and the dimethicone water entry cases at the pinch off moments as a function of the froude number fr in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to millimeters yields an uncertainty of 1 94 mm in d c it is worth noting that the values of d c almost keep constant with the increase of fr for the both types of water entry case and the dimethicone water entry cases in other words here in fig 15 the d c is independent of the horizontal impact velocity or if a dependence existed it is very weak hence combined with the experimental results in fig 7 b it is further confirmed here that the values of d c in water are larger than that of dimethicone water it indicates that the presence of the dimethicone layer will affect the falling trajectory of the sphere meanwhile an interesting finding is that the d c is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer under the experimental conditions in the present study fig 16 shows the values of the pinch off depth as a function of the thickness of dimethicone layer based on the experimental data we can get the value of the pinch off depth is almost constant where d p 0 161 m for water entry cases duclaux et al 2007 found the ratio of pinch off depth to total entry depth is constant at d p d c 0 5 and it was also experimentally confirmed by speirs et al 2018 however the ratio of d p to d c is approximately 0 48 for the dimethicone water entry cases in the present study in other words the pinch off depth is less than half of the total depth it indicates that the highly viscous dimethicone layer can promote the shrinkage of the cavity under the undisturbed free surface and subsequently leads to the early occurrence of pinch off 4 conclusions in the present study the cavity dynamics of oblique entry of sphere through a viscous liquid floating on the water at low froude number was investigated experimentally high speed camera system was used to captures the cavity formation and dynamics features for both qualitative and quantitative analysis meanwhile water entry case was also performed as a comparison to highlight the unique nature of cavity dynamics induced by the upper layer of highly viscous liquid from the experiments results the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the highly viscous liquid floating on the water substantially modifies the cavity formation mechanism compared to continuous splash in water the splash appears stratified and is characterized by upper and lower layers for the water dimethicone entry case the discontinuity of weber number at the interface of water and dimethicone due to the difference in surface tension is the most likely reason of stratified splash 2 the thickness of dimethicone layer affects the cavity evolution patterns compared with the water entry case a more pronounced ribbed structure can be seen in the splash seal region of the dimethicone water entry cases the high viscosity dimethicone floating on the water causes the pinch off to occur earlier but the thickness value range of the dimethicone we studied has almost no effect on the pinch off position moreover we found that the smaller the thickness of the dimethicone layer the faster the intersection line in the splash reaches the same angle due to difference in the energy distribution of the dimethicone layer 3 through the analysis of the cavity formation trajectory and force models of the sphere at different horizontal impact velocity it is found that increasing the horizontal impact velocity will causes a delay in the splash closure meanwhile it is observed that the vertical displacement during the dimethicone water process is independent of the horizontal impact velocity the hydrodynamic force model of the sphere is established and subsequent explanation for the oblique water entry problem with a high viscosity dimethicone floating on the water 4 splash angle pinch off depth pinch off time and the water entry depth at pinch off locations are obtained qualitatively and quantitatively by processing the experimental images it is observed that roughly linear relationships between the dimensionless pinch off time t p u 0 d and the froude number and the expression is t p u 0 d 0 96 fr meanwhile the pinch off depth d p is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer and the horizontal impact velocity moreover the entry depth d c almost keep constant at the pinch off time as the increase of fr for the both types of water entry case and the dimethicone water entry cases within thickness range in the present study the present work has provided experimental results to advance the understanding of the effects of highly viscous liquid layer on the cavity dynamics of oblique impact of sphere as for the future research a group of experiments with large thickness value of dimethicone layer would beneficial to expand some conclusions in this paper in addition although we have explained the splash stratification it still needs to be strengthened in the future especially setting up liquid dynamics model based on mathematical method with viscosity and density as changing parameters at the junction of dimethicone and water will help us improve understanding of the mechanism of splash stratification

22315,oblique water entry of marine structure involves complex hydrodynamics phenomena including splash formation asymmetrical cavity and pinch off that have been observed in previous systematic experiments however very few studies focus on such phenomena induced by oblique impact of object in a two layer liquid system in this paper we present an experimental investigation of oblique entry of a sphere into a deep pool of water within a layer of highly viscous dimethicone floating on the water in the experiment a high speed digital camera is established to obtain the instantaneous cavity and motion trajectories for both qualitative and quantitative analysis the results show that the upper layer viscous liquid introduces a significant change in the splash formation mechanism and the special behaviors are characterized by stratified splash and corresponding asymmetrical shrinkage structures meanwhile it is observed that the difference in splash characteristics caused by different thicknesses of viscous fluid layer is obvious and the pinch off depth is independent of the thickness value which studied in our experiments in addition it is found that increasing the horizontal impact velocity will cause a delay in the splash closure and the vertical displacement of the sphere during the dimethicone water enter process is independent of the horizontal impact velocity hydrodynamic force model is established to explain the trajectory of the sphere furthermore the splash angle pinch off depth pinch off time and the water entry depth at pinch off locations and the corresponding change tendency are obtained qualitatively and quantitatively these results indicate that the dimethicone layer is critical in determining the cavity dynamics especially splash formation and pinch off characteristics keywords oblique impact two layer liquid splash formation cavity dynamics pinch off 1 introduction studies of objects impacting into the water has attracted the attention of researchers for over a century and is still a hot topic of current research worthington and cole 1897 wang et al 2019 the water entry problem is relevant to application of air to sea projectile may 1952 ship slamming faltinsen 1990 and stone skipping rosellini et al 2005 the phenomenon of solid liquid impact is accompanied by many modern cavity dynamics such as splash inception cavity formation splash seal and pinch off aristoff et al 2010 chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 mansoor et al 2014 sun et al 2019 particularly one of the important problems has long been studying is the splash behavior and cavity dynamics during a solid object impacting liquid process water entry is a challenging problem and associated with the complex hydrodynamic feature the pioneering experiments were conducted by worthington and cole 1897 1900 and worthington 1908 they obtained the first high speed photographs of the impact dynamics and cavity formation following worthington s works may 1951 1952 experimentally studied the effects of surface conditions on splashes formations and the types of cavity closures since then surface characteristic of water entry objects has been studied extended to wettability duez et al 2007 hydrophobicity korkmaz and güzel 2017 and temperature li et al 2018 the effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface of spheres on cavity formation was studied by truscott and techet 2009a they found that transverse spin altered the spheres surface velocity distribution and cavity formation in addition to these notable studies other works on water entry problems involves the influence of object shape on cavity dynamics such as spheres may and woodhull 1948 belden et al 2016 rigid projectile lee et al 1997 slender axisymmetric bodies bodily et al 2014 and wedges shams et al 2015 duclaux et al 2007 performed an experimental study on the collapse of a transient cavity of air in water created by the impact of a sphere and analyzed the cavity evolution and pinch off features speirs et al 2019 used spheres to investigate the cavity shape splash crown and scale pinch off times they found that there were three kinds of splash crowns including thick rim forms thin crown and classical cavities li et al 2019 investigated the multiphase flow during water entry of spheres with different surface wettability at low froude numbers the results showed that the impact of the hydrophilic case creates a smaller splash and the hydrophilic and hydrophobic spheres experience different cavity regimes as the froude number increases particular attention was paid to address the influence of liquid properties on cavity dynamics the associated experiments involved multiple characteristic liquids including glycerine water mixture bell 1924 viscoelastic liquid cheny and walters 1996 and ethanol grumstrup et al 2007 driscoll et al 2010 performed an experiment to address the thin film formation during splashing of viscous liquids they found that the time of sheet ejection depends on impact velocity liquid viscosity molecular weight and gas pressure le goff et al 2013 experimentally investigated the process of spheres impacted the viscous newtonian liquids they found that there was no cavity entrainment due to the spheres stopped before the cavity retracted marston et al 2016 compared the splash characteristics produced by water and perfluorohexane they found that surface tension played an important role in the crown closure the interesting buckling phenomena occurred in both water and perfluorohexane crowns indicated much finer and more numerous rib structures for perfluorohexane these novel observations and founding provided a new perspective for impact features of single phase liquid system more recently tan and thomas 2018 experimentally studied the influence of an upper layer liquid on the phenomena and cavity formation an unusual shallow seal of cavity pinching off close to the liquid surface had seen in their experiments moreover according to the impact experiments of two layer system of immiscible liquids conducted by tan 2019 the influence of the viscosity of an upper layer liquid on cavity formation and overall dynamics was further highlighted these works have contributed much to our understanding of water entry although the study on water entry has significantly increased during the past decades little attention is paid to the cavity dynamics involving highly viscous liquid moreover the influence of surface viscous liquid content and froude number on cavity formation and dynamics mechanism during water entry of objects are still not well understood hence the aim of this experimental study is to provide new phenomenon of a thin layer of highly viscous liquid resting on a deep pool of water to alter splash characteristics and cavity dynamics of oblique impact spheres experiments with clean water using the same spheres are investigated to highlight and support the present findings in sec ii we present our experimental setup including the facility parameters liquid properties and test cases section iii first summarizes the effect of the highly viscous liquid layer on the cavity formation mechanism subsequently the influence of the thickness of viscous liquid layer and the horizontal impact velocity on the cavity dynamics are analyzed moreover we mainly analyze the characteristic of the splash angle pinch off time and pinch off depth finally the conclusions are presented in section iv 2 experimental setup fig 1 shows the schematic of the experimental setup we conducted the impact using a 1 5 m 0 8 m 1 0 m length width depth glass tank a standard billiard ball as the test model with a diameter d 57 2 mm and mass of the sphere is m s 0 18 kg the release mechanism consists of a pneumatic finger fixed on a car the horizontal initial velocity u 0 of the sphere is generated by a motor driving the car and the vertical entry velocity at the still free surface is generated by free fall with v 0 2 g h where g 9 81 m s2 is the gravity acceleration and h is the release height the water in the glass tank was covered by a layer of dimethicone with a density of ρ 941 kg m3 surface tension σ 19 4 mn m and dynamic viscosity μ 0 01 pa s the density of dimethicone is similar to that of water but the surface tension and viscosity are significantly different from water it is helpful to analyze the influence of upper layer highly viscous liquid on cavity dynamics the thickness of the dimethicone layer h was 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm 5 mm 6 mm 7 mm 8 mm respectively the spheres were released at the height of h 0 95 m to acquire the vertical impact velocity of v 0 4 32 m s and the horizontal impact velocity of the sphere is in a range of u 0 0 49 1 3 m s due to the equipment limitations the motion of the sphere and the cavity dynamics were recorded with a high speed camera phantom v12 1 at a frame rate of 3000 frames per second with an image resolution of 1280 800 pixels the value of exposure time used in the present experiments is 1 3000 s meanwhile throughout the experiments the liquid temperature was kept constant at 16 c to minimize temperature induced physical properties variation table 1 summarizes the experimental conditions in the present study 3 results and discussions 3 1 cavity formation mechanism induced by a thin layer of highly viscous liquid floating on water following the discussions of may 1975 and truscott and techet 2009b we analyze the cavity formation problem in four distinct stages 1 the flow forming stage 2 the open cavity and splash growth stage 3 the closed cavity and pinch off stage and 4 the collapsing cavity stage fig 2 presents sequence of images of the cavity formation of the sphere falls into the water dimethicone and water in stage 1 of the impact sequence t 10 ms and t 20 ms an initial horizontal splash of fluids forms as the sphere impact the still free surface and this splash extends radially outwards as the sphere descends into the liquids at t 20 ms the splash transitions from outwards to upwards growth during stage 1 we can clearly see that the cavity formed by the impact of water dimethicone are almost the same as the cavity formed by the impact of the water in stage 2 of the impact sequence t 30 60 ms the entire sphere passes below the still free surface and an open air cavity begins to form in its wake it is observed that the splash crown and the top of the subsurface air cavity bases connected to the free surface increase in diameter interestingly left right asymmetry in cavity below free surface and splash above free surface can be observed in stage 2 it is well known that the initial stages of impact of object on the free surface are dominated by inertial effects hence the subsurface air cavity both grows radially outwards and elongates vertically as the sphere descends however the splash of sphere entry onto the two layer liquid system formed by a dimethicone layer floating on the water are quite different than onto only water for the water dimethicone entry case as shown in fig 2 a the splash appears stratified and is characterized by upper and lower layers this unique phenomenon has not been observed by other experiments worthington 1908 truscott and techet 2009b smolka and mclaughlin 2019 moreover obvious buckling instability occurs around the upper right part of the splash wall in the water dimethicone entry case which is marked by arrow at t 40 ms in fig 2 a whereas the event of buckling instability is weak in water entry case according to marston et al 2016 the collapse of the splash is mainly driven by surface tension and the buckling occurs when collapse rate is faster than the vertical velocity of the splash crown hence we speculate that small surface tension is beneficial to accelerate the radial shrinkage and the corresponding buckling instability is easy to occur in water dimethicone entry case in stage 3 of the impact sequence t 70 100 ms the subsurface air cavity continues to stretch and curve as the sphere descends the cavity evolution below the free surface in water entry case and water dimethicone entry case is similar meanwhile as shown in fig 2 b the splash film is closed and no more air can flow into the cavity however for the two layer liquid system presented in fig 2 a the lower left corner of the upper layer splash shrinks then the bottom boundary of the upper layer splash is lower than the upper boundary of the lower layer splash at the same time the upper right corner of the upper layer splash goes downwards which leads the upper layer splash collapses therefore the presence of the dimethicone layer modifies the splash evolution and seal patterns in the early stage 4 the cavity below the still free surface appears pinch off and it splits into two distinct cavities a lower air cavity still fully attached to the sphere and an upper air cavity connected to the free surface it is worth noting that the pinch off time of the two layer liquid system is earlier than the water entry case after pinch off t 110 ms the cavity begins a rapid collapse below the free surface distinct jet of fluid ejects away from the point of pinch off can be seen both in water entry case and water dimethicone entry case this jet phenomenon is also seen by other researchers e g worthington and cole 1897 truscott and techet 2009b in order to gain further insight into the effect of the upper layer dimethicone on cavity formation of the oblique impact of a sphere the comparison of cavity shape between water entry and upper layer dimethicone entry is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a it should be noted that the wall of the cavity formed under the free surface is smooth which is consistent with the observations of single phase liquid system may 1952 mansoor et al 2017 hou et al 2018 however it is interesting to note that the cavity wall for water dimethicone entry case is relatively rough and it is characterized by wave like instability structure due to the difference in viscosity between water and dimethicone the generation of the wave like structures is driven by the shear induced instability which occurs at the contact line between the surrounding water and the entrained dimethicone of the sphere moreover note that ribbed structure is observed around the upper left part of the splash wall in water dimethicone entry case whereas the splash wall in the water still maintains good continuity by comparing the pinch off locations of the two conditions presented in fig 3 b an interesting observation is that the film wall at the rim of the lower splash breaks into a finger like structure the wave and rib structure features can be observed more clearly by the zoomed views in fig 3 it further highlights the upper layer dimethicone plays an important role on splash formation and seal pattern surface tension is considered to play an important role in determining the splash evolution mechanism and the corresponding important parameter is the weber number mansoor et al 2014 it is well known that the weber number is the ratio between the inertial force and the surface tension force and it is expressed as we ρlv 2 2σ where l is the characteristic length v is the velocity of fluid in the splash the relevant velocity and length scales must reflect the motion hence the splash weber number is defined as we s ρδv s 2 σ where δ is the thickness of the splash film v s is splash velocity to analyze the splash stratification patterns splash formation images at two typical moments and the corresponding schematic of the cavity wall profile and motion velocity at the stratified boundary are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a obvious splash stratification can be seen on the splash film of the experimental image based on the intersection line structure between the lower layer and the upper layer of the splash we can conclude that the velocity distribution along the intersection line is linear the instantaneous average velocity of the splash motion in fig 4 a is approximately v s 1 2 m s meanwhile the value of the film thickness is δ 10 μm according to experimental findings by zhang et al 2012 and marston et al 2016 hence taking δ ο 10 μm and the splash velocity v s ο 10 0 m s we can obtain that w e s ο 10 1 for water and w e s ο 10 0 for dimethicone this indicates surface tension does play a significant role in the splash formation more importantly the discontinuity of weber number at the interface between the upper and lower layers is cause of the splash stratification moreover as shown in fig 4 b it is observed that the shrinkage near the intersection line on the left and right sides of the splash is asymmetrical actually from the schematic illustration of fig 4 b we can know that the splash motion velocity v sl on the left side is greater than the velocity v sr on the right side in other words the difference in velocity will lead to the difference in weber numbers therefore the surface tension significantly changes the evolution mechanism of splash during the entry process in the two layer liquid system to further elucidate the splash stratification patterns the schematic representation of instantaneous motion state and cavity profile in xoy plane is shown in fig 5 gillbarg and anderson 1948 stated that the cavity splash is subject to two chief forces surface tension σ and a pressure drop δp caused by the air flow behind the sphere it is conceivable that the presence of the pressure drop across the splash film can play a role in splash shrinkage visual inspection of the splash formation just prior to shrinkage and seal as presented in fig 2 at these instantaneous moments of the upward motion of the cavity splash the surface tension in the radial direction is not enough to overcome the inertial force therefore no splash shrinkage is formed along the crown wall near the intersection line however the surface tension in the radial direction becomes prominent when the upper layer splashes slowly or even stops rising meanwhile the cavity splash formed by water below the intersection line continues to expand due to inertial effects and from energy transfer by sphere at its instantaneous location as a result splash shrinkage appears at the junction of dimethicone and water of the splash 3 2 influence of the thickness of viscous liquid layer on cavity formation to analyze the cavity evolution and splash formation quantitatively we introduce four parameters θ d p t p and d c the definition of these parameters are presented in the following and shown in fig 6 the angle between the splash layered line and the horizontal direction is denoted as θ the depth at which cavity pinch off occurs is denoted d p and the corresponding pinch off time is defined as t p the total entry depth of the sphere d c is defined as the distance from the undisturbed free surface to the leading edge of the sphere at any moment during the water entry process fig 7 shows the splash and cavity formation by the impact of spheres at different moments with the dimethicone layer thickness h of 0 8 mm for t 70 ms as shown in fig 7 a stratified splash can be observed when the dimethicone layer thickness varied from 2 mm to 8 mm and the stratified boundary height decreases as the thickness of the dimethicone layer increases on the one hand it is indicated that the source of the liquid that forms the splash is more than 8 mm and on the other hand also indicates that the energy of the sphere during the water entry process is distributed to different regions of the splash note that for the 4 mm and 5 mm cases the splash shrinkage appears on the left side of the stratified interface moreover compared with the water entry case a more pronounced ribbed structure can be seen in the splash seal region of the dimethicone water entry cases at the pinch off time as shown in fig 7 b it is observed that the obvious collapse of the upper layer splash occurs in the 3 mm and 4 mm thickness of the dimethicone water entry cases however the collapse intensity is weaker in the 2 mm and 5 mm dimethicone water entry cases at this moment as shown in fig 7 note that the water film in cavity splash of the 2 mm working condition is high enough to cause the splash seal to occur mainly on the upper side of the water film whereas for the 5 mm test case the rise height of the water film is limited due to the energy distribution of the falling sphere hence it is observed that splash seal occurs on the upper side of the dimethicone layer that is away from the position of the splash stratification especially the splash seal area is close to the stratified position resulting in a more pronounced collapse and shrinkage when the thickness of dimethicone layer is 3 mm and 4 mm therefore the thickness of dimethicone is an important factor for the collapse phenomenon in the cavity splash and we speculate that there may be a critical dimethicone thickness value between 2 mm and 5 mm in the present experiment meanwhile by comparing the pinch off depth d p marked by solid line in fig 7 b dimethicone water entry cases are marked by black line and water entry case is marked by red line and the entry depth d c marked by dashed line in fig 7 b dimethicone water entry cases are marked by black line and water entry case is marked by red line we found that the pinch off positions and the entry depth of the different thickness of dimethicone water entry cases are almost the same however the values of d p and d c in the dimethicone water entry cases are smaller than that of the water entry case this indicates that the high viscosity dimethicone floating above the water causes the pinch off to occur earlier but the thickness value range of the dimethicone we studied has almost no effect on the pinch off position for t 120 ms after pinch off moment as shown in fig 7 c it can be seen that the water film breaks into a finger like structure at the left rim of the lower crown in the 3 mm and 4 mm dimethicone water entry cases interestingly a connected bubbles trace can be observed between the upper cavity near the free surface and the cavity attached to the tail of the sphere and the closure depth of the upper cavity under the free surface almost the same as the dimethicone thickness increases the above results indicate that the thickness of dimethicone affects the splash formation and evolution process to further clarify the influence of the dimethicone layer and the thickness on the splash formation enlarged views of the splash morphology above the free surface in water entry case and dimethicone water entry cases with different thickness of dimethicone are shown in fig 8 fig 8 a compares the results at the same water entry time of t 60 ms it is noteworthy that the ribbed structures in the crown are more in number and larger in scale for the dimethicone water entry cases compared to the water entry therefore the presence of the dimethicone layer leads to a more complicated splash seal mechanism in addition the shrinkage tendency at the interface of the upper and lower layers of the splash becomes weaker as the thickness of the dimethicone increases fig 8 b presents the splash pattern when the angle between the splash layered line and the horizontal direction θ 12 5 as can be seen from fig 8 a the smaller the thickness of the dimethicone layer the shorter the time required to reach a certain angle in fact the splash for these four cases is in different stages of evolution for the h 2 mm case it is the development stage of the splash crown for the h 3 mm case the upper layer of the splash begins to occur buckling instability for the h 5 mm case it is in the early stage of splash seal of the upper layer cavity for the h 7 mm case the splash is almost closed due to the sphere liquid interaction the kinetic energy of the sphere transfers to the surrounding fluids as the sphere decelerates the water in splash will obtain less energy as the thickness of dimethicone increases as a result the angular velocity of the splash layered line of the thick dimethicone layer cases is smaller than that of the thin ones hence it will take more time to reach the same angle of the splash layered line for the thicker dimethicone layer cases due to the energy distribution and the presence of the dimethicone layer 3 3 influence of the horizontal impact velocity on cavity dynamics in order to analyze the effect of horizontal impact velocity on cavitation formation a comparison of the cavity morphology at four horizontal impact velocities with a dimethicone thickness of 2 mm is given in fig 9 for t 70 ms before pinch off moment as shown in fig 9 a it is important to note that the size of the opening at the top of the splash is different and appears to increase with the increase of horizontal impact velocity in other words increasing the horizontal impact velocity causes a delay in the splash closure moreover the angle θ increases as the speed increases indicating that the large horizontal impact velocity causes the cavity asymmetry to be more pronounced this observation is further confirmed at the pinch off position as shown in fig 9 b in particular a complete splash seal is formed when u 0 0 51 m s as shown in fig 9 c there is a line closure pattern observed as marked with arrows in fig 9 c in the experiments due to the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cavity under the still free surface it is worth noting that there is no bubbles trace generated after pinch off in the symmetrical water entry cases grumstrup et al 2007 aristoff and bush 2009 tan and thomas 2018 sun et al 2019 whereas the bubbles trace was found in the asymmetrical water entry process of projectiles bodily et al 2014 due to the formation of the jet and the asymmetry of cavity in the oblique entry cases the boundary of the cavity wall is easier to roll up into a ring vortex which entrains air along the cavity wall and the subsequent shedding of gas bubbles at the tail of the attached cavity over the sphere spurk 2002 karn et al 2016 moreover with the increase of horizontal impact velocity the connected bubbles trace shifts from curve to approximate straight line due to the inertia effects curves of the horizontal and vertical displacement as a function of time at the above four different initial vertical impact velocities are shown in fig 10 the curves indicate that relation between displacement and time follow a more non linear relationship note that the horizontal displacement of the sphere rise faster with increasing impact velocity however as can be seen in fig 10 b the values in the vertical displacement are almost the same for different initial vertical impact velocities therefore we speculate that the vertical drag force during the dimethicone water process is independent of the horizontal impact velocity to support this conclusion we will analyze the force model of sphere during the entry case in the next part in order to determine the sphere trajectory of the above analysis fig 11 presents the instantaneous force model of sphere motion the trajectory of the sphere at multiple times during the entry process is marked by red dashed line it is worth noting that the sphere almost keeps linear motion within the time range of the present study the coordinate directions have been defined in fig 1 b and are also shown in fig 11 c the force balance equation of oblique motion of the sphere is expressed as 3 1 m s m a a s g f b f d f t where m s ρ s v s p h e r e 4 3 π ρ s r s 3 is the mass of the sphere ρ s is the density of the sphere v s p h e r e is the volume of the sphere and r s is the radius of the sphere the force required to accelerate the surrounding liquid is expressed as the added mass m a c m ρ w v s p h e r e where c m is the added mass coefficient and ρ w is the liquid density a s is the acceleration of the sphere g m g is the gravity f b is the buoyancy force f d is the drag force f t is the surface tension force according to aristoff et al 2010 the added mass force m a a s should appear as an independent term at relatively small froude numbers during the process of water entry the maximum froude number in this paper is no more than 10 therefore the added mass force cannot be ignored meanwhile it is noted that the added mass coefficient c m is related to the submerged depth and it could go from zero at first impact and up to 0 5 when the sphere is one radius deep shepard et al 2019 however c m is usually considered to be a constant of 0 5 newman 1977 truscott et al 2012 tan 2019 wang et al 2019 hence we take it as a constant c m 0 5 for analysis in the present study and the added mass is given as m a 0 5 ρ w v s p h e r e for the buoyancy force ignoring the initial partial submerged process it can be expressed as f b ρ w g v sphere the drag force is f d 0 5 c d ρ w a p w 2 where c d is the drag coefficient and it is typically taken to be constant for varying impact velocities and penetration depth in studies of subsonic water entry cases lee et al 1997 abraham et al 2014 a p is the projected wetted area of the submerged portion w u v is the total velocity meanwhile as shown in fig 11 b the dynamic contact angles on the left and right sides of the sphere are defined as α and β respectively it is worth noting that both α and β are almost constant in the stable entry stage of the sphere the projected wetted area can be expressed as a p π r s 2 in direction of movement of the sphere when the entry is more than one diameter depth however the effects of initial impact conditions and gravity will cause the values of α and β to be different therefore we introduce a correction coefficient k o which is a constant close to 1 and the corresponding projected wetted area becomes a p k o π r s 2 moreover the surface tension force f t can be neglected as it is less than 1 of the gravitational force for the water entry of standard billiard balls truscott and techet 2009b as mentioned in section 2 the surface tension coefficient of dimethicone is much smaller than that of water and tan 2019 demonstrated that f t was on a much lower percentage of f d therefore even if there is a dimethicone layer the surface tension can be negligible in the force model by making a s the subject and simplifying eq 3 1 the equations in the x and y directions can be expressed as 3 2 x a s x c d k o 4 r s ρ w ρ s u 2 sin φ y a s y 2 3 1 ρ w ρ s g c d k o 4 r s ρ w ρ s v 2 cos φ where φ is the angle between f d and j ˆ as shown in fig 11 c based on the previous analysis the value of φ is almost a constant due to the straight track of the sphere in the present study in eq 3 2 it is indicated that the sphere will receive larger horizontal acceleration at higher initial horizontal impact velocity this can better explain the variation trend of the displacement curve at different initial horizontal impact velocities in fig 10 a according to a sy in eq 3 2 since the initial vertical impact velocities of the four conditions in fig 10 b are the same the vertical displacement versus time curves under different conditions present the same trend the force model in eq 3 2 is mainly suitable for oblique impact of sphere into water for a relatively short time in the present study we can speculate that the trajectory of the sphere will not remain straight at all times if the experimental recording time is long enough as a result the parameters k o and φ in eq 3 2 will be time dependent however it should be noted that the measurement of these forces are also very difficult until now and the subtleties of these differences difficult to pinpoint in order to better establish the force model more measurement methods and flow field information are necessary in the future work 3 4 splash angle and typical pinch off parameters characteristics in this section we further quantitatively assess the effects of dimethicone and initial impact velocity on the cavity dynamics fig 12 presents the angle θ mentioned above as a function of non dimensional velocity parameter u 0 at the pinch off locations where u 0 u 0 h g from fig 7 b it is observed that no obvious oil and water boundary line is formed in the splash for the dimethicone water entry case of h 2 mm hence the thickness of the dimethicone layer is in the range 3 mm h 8 mm in fig 12 in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to angles yields an uncertainty of 1 it should be noted that the symbols denote experimental data and the corresponding fitted curves are presented with second order function it indicates that the value of θ increases as the decreases of the thickness of dimethicone layer and it decreases as the increases of the original horizontal impact velocity pinch off time is non dimensionalized as t p t p u 0 d in fig 13 in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to times yields an uncertainty of 0 66 ms in t p it should be noted that deep seal is driven by hydrostatic pressure and thus pinch off time scales with froude number fr speirs et al 2018 the dimensionless time t p is plotted against fr in fig 13 where fr u 0 g d 2 u 0 is the initial horizontal impact velocity at the still free surface g is the gravitational acceleration and d is the diameter of the sphere interestingly we observe roughly linear relationships between t p and fr based on the experimental data fitting the measured dimensionless pinch off time is t p 0 96 fr and t p increases as the froude number increases lee et al 1997 rationalized the experiments of gilbarg and anderson 1948 regarding the apparent independence of the dimensionless pinch off time on the vertical impact velocity more recently truscott and techet 2009b provided further experimental evidence that the pinch off time t p v 0 d fr is roughly constant in water entry our experimental findings are generally similar to their measurements however our fr is based on the horizontal impact velocity and is different from their vertical velocity definition moreover the measured pinch off time is t p 1 92 d 2 g for all the water dimethicone entry cases in the present study duclaux et al 2007 found the prefactor k to be 2 06 for the impact of spheres and the corresponding relationship is t p 2 06 d 2 g the difference of the prefactor k between water dimethicone entry cases and water entry cases indicates the pinch off time is effected by the dimethicone layer hence we conclude that the presence of high viscosity dimethicone contributes to the cavity shrinkage and the pinch off occurs earlier furthermore based on the pinch off time t p we can also draw that the cavity pinch off time is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer and the horizontal impact velocity fig 14 shows our experimental data for the dimensionless pinch off depth d p as a function of fr 1 where d p is expressed as d p u 0 t p in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to millimeters yields an uncertainty of 1 94 mm in d p the scatter points with the same shape in fig 14 represent different thickness of dimethicone layer at the same horizontal impact velocity we observe that a robust linear relationship between the dimensionless pinch off depth and fr 1 the slope k of d p fr 1 for all the water dimethicone entry cases is 6 15 meanwhile the pinch off depth d p 5 9 d it indicates that the pinch off depth d p is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer and the horizontal impact velocity fig 15 shows the values of the water entry depth d c of the water entry cases and the dimethicone water entry cases at the pinch off moments as a function of the froude number fr in the process of extracting test results conversion from pixels to millimeters yields an uncertainty of 1 94 mm in d c it is worth noting that the values of d c almost keep constant with the increase of fr for the both types of water entry case and the dimethicone water entry cases in other words here in fig 15 the d c is independent of the horizontal impact velocity or if a dependence existed it is very weak hence combined with the experimental results in fig 7 b it is further confirmed here that the values of d c in water are larger than that of dimethicone water it indicates that the presence of the dimethicone layer will affect the falling trajectory of the sphere meanwhile an interesting finding is that the d c is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer under the experimental conditions in the present study fig 16 shows the values of the pinch off depth as a function of the thickness of dimethicone layer based on the experimental data we can get the value of the pinch off depth is almost constant where d p 0 161 m for water entry cases duclaux et al 2007 found the ratio of pinch off depth to total entry depth is constant at d p d c 0 5 and it was also experimentally confirmed by speirs et al 2018 however the ratio of d p to d c is approximately 0 48 for the dimethicone water entry cases in the present study in other words the pinch off depth is less than half of the total depth it indicates that the highly viscous dimethicone layer can promote the shrinkage of the cavity under the undisturbed free surface and subsequently leads to the early occurrence of pinch off 4 conclusions in the present study the cavity dynamics of oblique entry of sphere through a viscous liquid floating on the water at low froude number was investigated experimentally high speed camera system was used to captures the cavity formation and dynamics features for both qualitative and quantitative analysis meanwhile water entry case was also performed as a comparison to highlight the unique nature of cavity dynamics induced by the upper layer of highly viscous liquid from the experiments results the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the highly viscous liquid floating on the water substantially modifies the cavity formation mechanism compared to continuous splash in water the splash appears stratified and is characterized by upper and lower layers for the water dimethicone entry case the discontinuity of weber number at the interface of water and dimethicone due to the difference in surface tension is the most likely reason of stratified splash 2 the thickness of dimethicone layer affects the cavity evolution patterns compared with the water entry case a more pronounced ribbed structure can be seen in the splash seal region of the dimethicone water entry cases the high viscosity dimethicone floating on the water causes the pinch off to occur earlier but the thickness value range of the dimethicone we studied has almost no effect on the pinch off position moreover we found that the smaller the thickness of the dimethicone layer the faster the intersection line in the splash reaches the same angle due to difference in the energy distribution of the dimethicone layer 3 through the analysis of the cavity formation trajectory and force models of the sphere at different horizontal impact velocity it is found that increasing the horizontal impact velocity will causes a delay in the splash closure meanwhile it is observed that the vertical displacement during the dimethicone water process is independent of the horizontal impact velocity the hydrodynamic force model of the sphere is established and subsequent explanation for the oblique water entry problem with a high viscosity dimethicone floating on the water 4 splash angle pinch off depth pinch off time and the water entry depth at pinch off locations are obtained qualitatively and quantitatively by processing the experimental images it is observed that roughly linear relationships between the dimensionless pinch off time t p u 0 d and the froude number and the expression is t p u 0 d 0 96 fr meanwhile the pinch off depth d p is independent of the thickness of the dimethicone layer and the horizontal impact velocity moreover the entry depth d c almost keep constant at the pinch off time as the increase of fr for the both types of water entry case and the dimethicone water entry cases within thickness range in the present study the present work has provided experimental results to advance the understanding of the effects of highly viscous liquid layer on the cavity dynamics of oblique impact of sphere as for the future research a group of experiments with large thickness value of dimethicone layer would beneficial to expand some conclusions in this paper in addition although we have explained the splash stratification it still needs to be strengthened in the future especially setting up liquid dynamics model based on mathematical method with viscosity and density as changing parameters at the junction of dimethicone and water will help us improve understanding of the mechanism of splash stratification

vortex is validated using an extensive convergence study with appropriate grid scale and time step the refined simulation with the les approach shows adequate feasibility to simulate the tip vortex of the crp the formation evolution and interaction of the tip vortex are discussed in the current study the complicated intertwinement of the tip vortices is also investigated keywords crp6 tip vortex les time step grid scale 1 introduction the contra rotating propeller is designed to improve the propulsive efficiency and an improvement of 10 20 in propulsive efficiency with crp has been proved rutundi 1934 lee et al 1995 chen tseng the most widely used crps are co centric shaft crp dual end crp and contra rotating azimuthal podded propellers the crp system has the advantages of high propulsive efficiency high critical speed and low noise level it appears that the field of hydrodynamics have been studied in detail however research on tip vortex shedding of crp is inadequate the tip vortex of the crp is directly related to cavitation vibrations noise and propulsion performances and the interaction between the forward and the aft propellers is complicated thus it is of great interest and importance to perform a detailed study on the vortex shedding and interaction of crp taylor model basin of america carried out a benchmark model test on the open water performance of two sets of crps following the experiment a lot of numerical researches on crp are performed based on the experimental data yang and wang yang et al 1991 yang et al 1992 improved the steady and unsteady lifting surface methods of crp gu and kinnas 2003 used the potential flow method based on vortex lattice method and finite volume method to analyze the steady hydrodynamic performance of crp the potential flow method does not take into account the influence of viscosity and the boundary layer of the flow in this respect the numerical method based on viscous flow theory has an advantage over the lifting surface method with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation based on viscous flow four turbulence models have been stablished these include direct numerical simulation reynold averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and detached eddy simulation des wang et al wang and xiong 2013 conducted studies on rans and the sliding grid method for the open water performance prediction of two kinds of crp crp6 and crp4 their analysis of the crps considered the effect of computational time step and turbulence model the crp6 consists of dtmb3686 and dtmb3687 while the crp4 consists of dtmb3686 and dtmb3849 by comparing the numerical results with those from the experiments the applicability of the rans simulation with the standard and shear stress transport k ω turbulence model was verified paik et al 2015 carried out a simulation of the wake flow and the tip vortex of the crp with a ship hull using a commercial cfd code based on a rans equations solver the flow measurement was performed with stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system the numerical results agree well with the experimental measurement the current study focuses on the tip vortex of the crp6 using the les approach although an exactly similar simulation with regard to the present problem does not exist many previous works can be referred and utilized for the current study the applicability of les on the tip vortex of a single propeller has been validated the numerical approach using the les technique has the potential to predict unsteady flows that include regions of large scale separation much more accurately compared to the rans computations in general ghias et al 2013 employed a les solver to simulate a compressible wing tip flow and examine the flow structure in the formation region of the tip vortex as well as the evolution of the vortex in the near wake yamanishi et al 2007 researched on the backflow vortex structure at the inlet of an inducer with the les approach fureby et al fureby and grinstein 2002 studied the high reynolds number free flows and wall bounded flows based on the modified les equations they came up with moreover muscari et al 2017 performed a numerical simulation on the vortex body interaction of a single bladed rotating propeller with a stationary rudder cavitation is always associated with the tip vortex vortex shedding occurs for many marine structures particularly the hydrofoil and the propeller les has been extensively applied in the related simulation pendar and roohi 2016 used les and rans k ω sst turbulence approaches as well as kunz and sauer mass transfer models to simulate the dynamic and unsteady behaviors of cavitation around 3d hemispherical head form body and a conical cavitator the one equation eddy viscosity model is used to model the sub grid scale terms in the simulation with les approach the same turbulence models and cavitation models are used to simulate the cavitation flow of a sphere at a constant reynolds number of 1 5 106 pendar and roohi 2018 roohi et al 2015 performed numerical investigations of the cavitating and supercavitating flow behind a three dimensional disk with a particular emphasis on detailed comparisons of various turbulence and mass transfer models the numerical approaches of les and k ω shear stress transport turbulence were coupled with various mass transfer model types e g kunz schnerr sauer and zwart models zahiri and roohi 2019 carried out a series of simulations on single phase and multi phase flows using les approach with different sub grid scale sgs models in the open source package openfoam a static type of eddy viscosity sgs model and an anisotropic minimum dissipation amd subgrid scale model were mainly discussed in their study anisotropic minimum dissipation sub grid models represent simple alternatives to the smagorinsky type approaches to the implementation of sub grid scales sgs effects in the large eddy simulation les approach rickard et al bensow and bark 2010 worked on the implicit les predictions of the cavitating flow on a propeller kumar and dewan 2016 assessed the effectiveness of four sub grid stress models in large eddy simulation of natural convection in a buoyant square cavity the four models are namely dynamic smagorinsky model vreman model one equation eddy viscosity model and buoyancy modified one equation eddy viscosity model the research shows that the vreman model over predicts the peak of the time averaged velocity and under predicts the peak of the root mean square fluctuations the one equation model and buoyancy modified one equation model can predict the time averaged field root mean square field turbulent shear stress and turbulent heat flux more accurately than those by the dynamic smagorinsky and vreman models obviously the present problem is different and more complicated because both the forward and the aft propellers shed tip vortex and the vortex implicate and entwine with each other in the present paper we have used an implicit les method with a dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale sgs model to calculate the wake flow of crp6 the numerical simulations are performed using commercial cfd software the star ccm v12 02 the open water characteristics of crp6 are provided first to verify the turbulence model then the influence of the time step and the grid scale on les are discussed based on an extensive convergence study the formation evolution and the interaction of the tip vortex for the advance coefficient j 0 9 are mainly investigated the numerical simulations reveal some interesting phenomena from the interaction of the vortex 1 1 numerical method and governing equations the essence of the les is avoiding the calculation of all small scale turbulences that are not available for numerical resolution and the effects of small scale motions on large scale eddies in the present study the les technique is used to perform turbulent flow simulations the les technique assumes that the larger eddies in the turbulent flow are dependent on the geometry while the smaller eddies behave universally han et al 2019 large scale motions are resolved by the filtered navier stokes equations while the small scale motions are modeled by the sgs models in the les models the velocity is decomposed into filtered velocity u and sgs velocity u sgs and velocity u u u sgs this equation is similar to that of reynolds decomposition in which the total velocity is decomposed into the average and fluctuating components however the filtered velocity differs from the mean velocity and the sgs velocity differs from the fluctuating velocity the filtering process is performed using a spatial filter function the filtered velocity is defined in eq 1 as follows 1 u i x t 1 δ 3 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 u i ξ t g x ξ d ξ 1 d ξ 2 d ξ 3 where δ denotes the filter length g x ξ denotes the filter function which is defined in eq 2 2 g η 1 η δ 2 0 η δ 2 the filtered navier stokes equation is defined in eq 3 as follows 3 u j t ρ u i u j x i p x j x j μ u j x i τ i j where u j denotes the filtered velocity ρ denotes density and p denotes the filtered pressure the term τ i j is known as the sgs stress and is defined in eq 4 as follows 4 τ i j u i u j u i u j in the present paper we have used an implicit les approach with a dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale ds ss model to calculate the wake flow of crp6 the ds ss model is an eddy viscosity subgrid scale stress model the smallest resolved scales are dynamically tested to predict the behavior of the subgrid scales germano et al 1991 this model is based on the algebraic identity between the resolved turbulent stresses and the subgrid scale stresses obtained using two filters the grid filter and the test filter the model coefficient is obtained dynamically as the calculations progress the model implicitly assumes similarity between the sgs stresses at the grid and test levels which are modeled using the same functional expression namely the smagorinsky model germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 the effect of subgrid scales is parameterized by the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity germano et al 1991 5 μ t ρ δ 2 s where ρ is the density s is the strain rate given by s s 2 s s t 2 s s s is the mean strain rate tensor the parameter δ2 is computed dynamically as a function of a number of test filtered variables 6 δ 2 c s 2 v 2 3 where c s is the model coefficient and v is the cell volume to capture the vortex in the fluid region a vortex criterion function is used for tip vortex simulation the existing vortex criterion functions are ω criterion q criterion δ criterion and λ c i criterion the q criterion function which was proposed by hunt et al is one of the most widely used vortex criterion functions q criterion function is used in the simulation of incompressible or a weakly compressible fluid to capture the vortex in a three dimensional flow by determining the fluid region with a vorticity tensor greater than the strain rate tensor the deformation of the fluid can be expressed using the velocity gradient tensor it can be separated into two parts symmetrical strain rate tensor s and asymmetrical vorticity tensor ω according to hunt if the vorticity tensor ω contributes more toward the deformation of the fluid rather than the strain rate tensor s then the vortex exists the q criterion function is defined as follows 7 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where is the two norm tensor 1 2 test case crp6 model consists of dtmb3686 and dtmb3687 model propellers the axial spacing distance between the disks of the forward and the aft propellers is 14 15 of the forward propeller diameter the rotational speeds of the forward and the aft propellers are both 720 rpm the main geometrical particulars of the models are listed in table 1 in which d is the diameter of the propeller p is the pitch of the propeller and a is the ratio of the part with even load distribution accounting for the whole chord length the forward and the aft propellers are installed with an initial phase angle difference of 45 the geometry of the forward and the aft propeller blades are described in fig 1 the offset table and the experimental data of crp6 can be found in reference miller 1976 the cartesian coordinate system can be seen in fig 1 the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is set at the center of the aft disk and the plane y o z coincides with the aft disk the computational domain consists of a cubic domain whose width and height are 10 5r each where r is defined as the radius of the forward propeller it has a length of 10 0r and it starts 2 7r before the forward propeller disk and extends until 7 0r after the forward propeller disk the computational domain with the boundary conditions is presented in fig 2 2 convergence validation 2 1 grid scale the computational grid is created with star ccm v12 02 this study used three different grid scales to analyze the influence of the grid size on the numerical simulation of a contra propeller tip vortex the grid settings are shown in table 2 the average wall normal resolution on the blades is set to y 1 0 overset grids are applied to simulate the rotational motions of the forward and aft propeller the grid topologies are all hexahedral except for the prism layer grids and arbitrary polyhedral grids between the prism layer grids and the hexahedral grids a cylinder that covers crp6 and extends up to 8 0r in the wake is added to refine the volume mesh in order to capture the tip vortex as shown in fig 3 the cells in this cylinder are isotropic which means that the grid sizes in all the three directions are identical the sizes of the grids in this cylinder for coarse medium and fine grids are equal to 0 005m 0 004m and 0 003m respectively the fine grid consists of 1 474 107 cells the local gridding at the blade tip for the fine grid is shown in fig 4 the time steps for the simulation with coarse grids and medium grids are 2 8935 10 5 s each which correspond to a 0 125 rotation and both courant numbers are equal to 1 5 the time steps for the three simulations with different grid scales should be the same however the amount of computation is gigantic for the simulation with fine grids moreover the time taken for the simulation with fine grids is much more than that of the other two simulations when the time step is 2 8935 10 5 s thus the time step of the simulation with fine grids is set to 5 878 10 5 s which corresponds to a 0 25 rotation and a corresponding courant number of 3 0 the instantaneous views of the tip vortex of crp6 for the advance coefficient j 0 9 are shown in fig 5 this presents the isosurface of the q criterion function when the value of q criterion function is set to 1000 s2 the isosurface is colored according to the reference values of the axial vorticity the tip vortex of crp6 as shown in fig 5 c is simulated with fine grids it is more clearly captured compared with the ones in the simulations with coarse and medium grids though its time step is twice as much as the other two sets of simulations the motioning and deforming regularity of the tip vortex of crp6 is clearly shown the intertwinement of the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller disk is also better calculated 2 2 time step the approach of the les turbulence model is unsteady therefore the following three time steps are set to analyze the influence of time step on the numerical simulation of the crp6 tip vortex with the medium grid scale mentioned in section 4 1 as follows 1 157 10 4 s 5 878 10 5 s and 2 8935 10 5 s these three time steps correspond to a rotation of 0 5 0 25 and 0 125 for a single propeller respectively the corresponding courant numbers are equal to 4 5 2 5 and 1 25 respectively the instantaneous views of the tip vortex of crp6 for the advance coefficient value j 0 9 simulated with different time steps are presented in fig 6 the tip vortex of crp6 lengthens much further in the wake flow the tip vortex of the forward propeller as shown in fig 6 a disappears when passing through the disk of the aft propeller and emerges at 0 75r behind the aft propeller when the time step is 1 157 10 4 s the diameter of the vortex tube of the forward propeller is much smaller than that of the aft propeller more details of the vortex are captured when the time step is 2 8935 10 5s the diameter of the vortex tube of the forward propeller tip vortex is similar to that of the aft propeller tip vortex furthermore the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller disk is calculated better as shown in fig 6 c according to the discussion in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 the tip vortex is well captured when the grid scale and the time step decrease the grid scale has greater impact on the simulation of the tip vortex thus the fine grid is used in the following simulation and the time step is 5 878 10 5 s 2 3 open water characteristics the comparison between the numerical results obtained from the les and the experimental data miller 1976 for different advance coefficient values are presented in fig 7 subscripts f and a denote the forward propeller and aft propeller respectively the rotation speeds of the forward and the aft propellers of crp6 are both 720 rpm the value of the advance coefficient j ranges from 0 7 to 1 1 the numerical results obtained from the les agree well with the experimental data as shown in fig 7 the error of the thrust and torque coefficient for the forward and the aft propellers are both under 5 when the value of j ranges from 0 8 to 0 9 the error increases when the advance coefficient is too high or too low overall it is validated that the les approach can be applied for the study of the tip vortex of crp6 3 results and discussion 3 1 pressure distribution on the surface of the blade tip j 0 9 a simulation with the advance coefficient value of 0 9 is performed to analyze the formation and evolution of crp6 tip vortex as a result of the analysis described in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 a simulation with fine grid and medium time step is used the fluid structure of the tip vortex near the blade tip is shown in detail during the following two moments the phase angle between the blades of the forward and the aft propellers θ equals 45 and the phase angle θ equals 0 fig 8 a figs 8 b fig 9 a and fig 9 b show the pressure distribution on the surface of the blade tip when the phase angle θ 45 it shows that a sharp pressure gradient exists on the suction surface of both the forward and the aft propeller near the leading edge the pressure in this area is much lower than that in the other area a cambered section which is perpendicular to the propeller disk is set along the low pressure region to capture the pressure near the blade tip the intersection line of the suction surface of the blade and the cambered section is set along the edge of the blade tip passing through the location with minimum pressure at the blade tip the exact position of the cambered section is shown in fig 8 d and the same method is used to define the cambered sections in figs 9 c fig 10 c and fig 11 c there is an intense spatial variation of pressure on the suction side of the blade tip as shown in figs 8 c and fig 9 c the low pressure region moves away from the blade surface gradually from the leading edge to the following edge and this corresponds to the shedding of the tip vortex the pressure distributions on the cambered sections of the forward and the aft propellers are different from each other the fluid separation on the suction surface of the forward propeller is delayed compared to that of the aft propeller after a rotation of 22 5 the phase angle θ 0 the pressure distribution at this moment is shown in figs 10 and 11 for the suction and pressure surface of the forward propeller the magnitude of pressure changes slightly while the pressure distribution is similar the magnitude of pressure on the blade tip of the aft propeller has increased considerably when θ 0 the pressure distribution on the suction surface of the aft propeller also changes the pressure distribution on the cambered sections of the forward and the aft propeller changes considerably as well it shows that the fluid separation on the suction surface at the blade tip of the forward propeller is advanced and that of the aft propeller is delayed 3 2 formation and evolution of the tip vortex j 0 9 a series of plans are set along the tip vortex to capture the fluid structure of the tip vortex flow when the phase angle between the forward and the aft propeller θ 45 and θ 0 as shown in fig 12 and fig 15 respectively the tip vortex of the forward propeller meets the blade tip of aft propeller when θ 45 the formation and the evolution of the tip vortex distribution of vorticity and the interaction between the tip vortices of the forward and the aft propellers are clearly shown in figs 13 and 14 in order to differentiate the tip vortex of the forward from that of the aft propeller these plans are colored according to the axial vorticity values the reference velocity values of the tip vortex flow are also shown on these plans the tip vortex flow of the forward propeller is mainly red due to the reverse rotation the blue area predominantly represents the flow region of the tip vortex of the aft propeller it shows a similar process of vortex shedding where the process occurs along the following edge of the blade however the vortex disappears rapidly after leaving the blade except for the tip vortex the tip vortex of the forward propeller suffers an intense disturbance when passing through the disk of the aft propeller as shown in fig 13 8 and fig 13 9 the magnitude of the axial vorticity of the forward propeller tip vortex decreases when it meets the blade tip of the aft propeller and the magnitude of the vorticity also decreases as shown in fig 21 c this is one of the factors that causes the forward propeller tip vortex to distort and twine around the tip vortex of aft propeller when moving downstream as shown in fig 13 7 and fig 13 8 in fig 14 plan 10 is set on the leading edge near the blade tip this shows that the tip vortex of the forward propeller is cut by the blade tip of the aft propeller in plans 11 and 12 the tip vortex of the forward propeller is weakened by the blade tip of the aft propeller the tip vortex of the aft propeller forms at the blade tip as shown in plan 12 and this can also be seen in fig 13 7 according to the velocity near the blade tip the flow from the pressure side to the suction side is also a factor that induces the tip vortex a series of plans are set along the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers as shown in fig 15 when θ 0 plans 11 and 12 are set at the intersection of the tip vortex the axial vorticity of the tip vortex of the forward propeller changes quickly after shedding from the blade tip as shown in fig 16 the initial status of the intersection of the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers is shown in fig 17 11 and fig 17 12 the tip vortex of the forward propeller is under that of the aft propeller after a rotation of 22 5 the phase angle θ 45 furthermore the flow structure of the intersection between the tip vortexes of the forward and aft propellers will change as shown in fig 14 16 and fig 14 17 3 3 interactions j 0 9 the tip vortex sheds from the suction side of the blade tip and moves downstream with the wake flow similarly the intersection of the tip vortexes of the forward and the aft propellers also moves downstream and deforms gradually as shown in fig 18 the fluid structure at the intersections of the tip vortex deforms during the downstream motion the details of the intersections are shown in figs 19 and 20 it can be observed that the tip vortex of the forward propeller intersects with the blade tip of the aft propeller bypasses under the tip vortex of the aft propeller and then moves downstream the tip vortex of the forward propeller is primarily induced and deformed by the blade tip and the tip vortex of the aft propeller the vorticity of the tip vortex of the forward propeller at the intersection is weaker which can be observed in fig 21 c it explains that the tip vortex of the forward propeller at intersection twines around that of the aft propeller in the wake flow similarly the tip vortex of the aft propeller is also deformed by that of the forward propeller intersection 1 deforms into intersection 5 gradually during the downstream motion the tip vortex of the aft propeller at the intersection is distorted gradually into a sigmoid curve the tip vortex of the forward propeller is induced to circle around that of the aft propeller 3 4 vorticity distribution j 0 9 crp6 works under a positive loading when the advance coefficient j ranges from 0 2 to 1 1 the tip vortex is maintained in the wake flow with a regular shape and a certain vorticity strength when j 0 9 as shown in fig 21 the axial vorticity of the forward propeller is opposite to that of the aft propeller the structure of both the tip vortex tubes of the forward and aft propellers is generally a helix however they are deformed from the helical path during downstream motion and the fluid structure of the tip vortex flow becomes complicated this is mainly due to the interaction between the tip vortex of the forward and aft propellers and the kinetic energy dissipation of the fluid in fig 21 the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller is shown in another perspective it can be observed that the projection of the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller is nearly an eight pointed star the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers deform into a constant form and move downstream owing to the interaction between them a part of the tip vortex of the forward propeller is deformed and rotated gradually and its axial vorticity becomes negative similar changes occur on the tip vortex of the aft propeller however a lot of details regarding the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller are unclear two longitudinal sections and six transverse sections are set to capture the wake flow for further study of the vortex flow as shown in fig 22 the transverse sections are set across the intersections of the tip vortex in the cartesian coordinate system shown in fig 1 for transverse section 1 6 the axial positions x 0 72r 1 31r 1 90r 2 52r 3 08r and 3 70r respectively longitudinal section 1 coincides with the plane x o z longitudinal section 2 coincides with the z axis and the angle between longitudinal section 2 and the plane x o z is equal to 22 5 fig 23 and fig 24 show the axial vorticity distribution of the wake flow the axial evolution of the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller disk can also be recognized from fig 23 longitudinal section 1 cuts through the intersections of the tip vortexes the angle between longitudinal sections 1 and 2 is equal to 22 5 longitudinal section 1 shows a different distribution of axial vorticity in fig 24 a a part of the vortex flow region with negative axial vorticity represents the tip vortex of the forward propeller when the simulation of the tip vortex is complete a series of probes are set at the section center of the tip vortex to monitor the velocity and pressure as shown in fig 25 probes 1 3 and 5 are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller while the rest of the probes are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the aft propeller in the cartesian coordinate system shown in fig 1 the space positions of probe1 6 are shown in table 3 after the setting of the probes is complete the simulation is continued as the tip vortex moves the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller will pass the probes 1 3 and 5 periodically and the frequency equals 48 hz the tip vortex of the aft propeller also causes velocity and pressure changes at probes 1 3 and 5 when it passes by these probes similarly probes 2 4 and 6 are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the aft propeller when the simulation is continued the probe is at the section center of the tip vortex tube the axial velocity pressure and axial vorticity at the probes are monitored during the simulation and the results are shown in fig 26 fig 27 and fig 28 the axial velocity at a probe decreases when the tip vortex passes through it the axial velocity curve at probe 1 is about a sinusoid and that at probe 5 has two crests in one period as shown in fig 26 a the prime reason is that the tip vortex of the aft propeller is deformed and its motion trail gradually approaches the probes which are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller the axial velocities at probes 2 4 and 6 demonstrate the same regularity a significant difference between the axial velocity in fig 26 a and b is that axial velocity of the tip vortex of the forward propeller decreases during moving downstream the axial velocity fluctuation of the tip vortex of the forward propeller decreases while it increases for the tip vortex of the aft propeller when moving downstream the pressures at probes 1 6 fluctuate drastically when the tip vortex passes through them as shown in fig 27 pressure fluctuations at probes 1 3 and 5 are smaller to each other but the amplitude of the fluctuation decreases gradually the pressure curves of probes 2 4 and 6 strongly resemble each other the axial vorticity at the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller is a positive number while it is negative for the tip vortex of aft propeller the absolute value of the former is much less than that of the latter as shown in fig 28 the axial vorticities at probes 1 3 and 5 reach the maximum when the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller passes by the respective probes and reach the minimum when the tip vortex of the aft propeller passes by the respective probes this is shown in fig 28 a the phenomenon is reverse in case of the axial vorticities at probes 2 4 and 6 the axial vorticities of the forward and the aft propeller decrease when there is downstream motion 3 5 advance coefficient the tip vortexes of crp6 with different advance coefficients are shown in fig 29 and all the values of the scalar function q criterion are set to 1000 s2 it is observed that the axial vorticity of the tip vortex decreases when the advance coefficient increases in fig 29 a the value of the advance coefficient is set to 1 1 which corresponds to a condition of large advance and low blade loading in this case the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers last a long distance in the wake flow with a relatively steady structure the hydrodynamic load on the blade increases when j 0 7 in comparison to the same in a simulation with j 0 9 the kinetic energy of the fluid dissipates rapidly when it leaves the propeller because of the small advance coefficient the tip vortex banks up gradually during the downstream motion finally the value of the advance coefficient is set to 0 5 which corresponds to a condition of high blade loading in this case the axial vorticity of the tip vortex becomes much stronger 3 6 q criterion j 0 9 the larger the value of q the more advantages asymmetrical vorticity tensor ω takes over the symmetrical strain rate tensor s when the advance coefficient j 0 9 the results of q 500 s2 2000 s2 and 3000 s2 are presented in fig 30 to show the distribution of the axial vorticity on the surface of the vortex tube when the diameters of the vortex tube are different the vorticity of the fluid increases when approaching the vortex core of the tip vortex the value of q is related to vorticity of the fluid thus the diameter of the tip vortex tube decreases and the axial vorticity on the face of the vortex tube increases when the value of q increases 3 7 densified grids j 0 9 a smaller grid size is considered to simulate the tip vortex of crp6 the grid number will be too large if the size of the grid continues to be decreased thus the method of mesh refinement should be changed the cylinder mentioned in subsection 4 1 is replaced by a hollow cone to densify the grids as shown in fig 31 to reduce the amount of the grids the length of the hollow cone extends up to 3 8r in the wake the cells in the hollow cone are isotropic and the size of the grid in the hollow cone is 0 0015 m each of the blades of the forward and the aft propellers contain approximately 48300 and 55500 surface grids respectively the number of the total grids in this simulation is equal to 1 871 107 the time step is set to 5 878 10 5 s and the corresponding courant number is 3 0 the advance coefficient is j 0 9 the tip vortex of crp6 simulated with the refined grids is shown in fig 32 and q 1000 s2 compared to the tip vortex simulated with fine grids shown in fig 5 c there is a more distinguishable view of the intertwinements of the tip vortexes the diameter of the tip vortex tube of the aft propeller is at first much smaller than that of the forward propeller fig 33 shows the distribution of the axial vorticity in the wake of crp6 longitudinal section 1 and longitudinal section 2 are defined in fig 22 in subsection 5 4 compared with fig 24 this tip vortex flow is simulated better the fluid structures at the intersections of the tip vortex as shown fig 33 b coincide well with the tip vortex structure as shown in fig 34 4 conclusion the capability of the numerical simulations with les approach to predict the complex flow past crp6 is presented in this study computations are performed for various advance coefficients and the computational result for the advance coefficient value j 0 9 is mainly discussed the predicted global quantities such as the thrust torque and the efficiency obtained using the les turbulence closure are in good agreement with the experimental data the convergence analyses of the grid scale and the time step are also considered in this study the tip vortex is well captured when the grid scale and the time step decrease and the grid scale has greater impact on the simulation of the tip vortex thus the fine grid is used in the investigation of the tip vortex and the time step is equal to 5 878 10 5 s the tip vortex shedding is associated with the distinct low pressure region located at the suction side of the blade tip the vortex shedding occurs along the following edge of the blade however the vortex disappears rapidly after leaving the blade except for the tip vortex it is observed that the tip vortex of the forward propeller is cut by the blade tip of the aft propeller periodically and its axial vorticity decreases suddenly after passing through the disk of the aft propeller the tip vortex lasts for a long distance behind crp6 the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers intertwine with each other and move downstream in the wake flow the original intertwinements of the tip vortexes can be clearly distinguished however the intertwinements of the tip vortexes become complex when moving far away from crp6 the tip vortex of the forward propeller is deformed directly by the blade tip of the aft propeller and with the mutual inductions between the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propeller the tip vortex of the forward propeller is deformed below the tip vortex of the aft propeller and then starts to surround around the tip vortex of the aft propeller gradually when moving downstream the gradients of velocity pressure and vorticity are sharp in the tip vortex flow the vorticity of the tip vortex increases with the decrease in the advance coefficient value acknowledgements this work was supported by harbin engineering university grant no heucgf201814 the national natural science foundation of

vortex is validated using an extensive convergence study with appropriate grid scale and time step the refined simulation with the les approach shows adequate feasibility to simulate the tip vortex of the crp the formation evolution and interaction of the tip vortex are discussed in the current study the complicated intertwinement of the tip vortices is also investigated keywords crp6 tip vortex les time step grid scale 1 introduction the contra rotating propeller is designed to improve the propulsive efficiency and an improvement of 10 20 in propulsive efficiency with crp has been proved rutundi 1934 lee et al 1995 chen tseng the most widely used crps are co centric shaft crp dual end crp and contra rotating azimuthal podded propellers the crp system has the advantages of high propulsive efficiency high critical speed and low noise level it appears that the field of hydrodynamics have been studied in detail however research on tip vortex shedding of crp is inadequate the tip vortex of the crp is directly related to cavitation vibrations noise and propulsion performances and the interaction between the forward and the aft propellers is complicated thus it is of great interest and importance to perform a detailed study on the vortex shedding and interaction of crp taylor model basin of america carried out a benchmark model test on the open water performance of two sets of crps following the experiment a lot of numerical researches on crp are performed based on the experimental data yang and wang yang et al 1991 yang et al 1992 improved the steady and unsteady lifting surface methods of crp gu and kinnas 2003 used the potential flow method based on vortex lattice method and finite volume method to analyze the steady hydrodynamic performance of crp the potential flow method does not take into account the influence of viscosity and the boundary layer of the flow in this respect the numerical method based on viscous flow theory has an advantage over the lifting surface method with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation based on viscous flow four turbulence models have been stablished these include direct numerical simulation reynold averaged navier stokes rans large eddy simulation les and detached eddy simulation des wang et al wang and xiong 2013 conducted studies on rans and the sliding grid method for the open water performance prediction of two kinds of crp crp6 and crp4 their analysis of the crps considered the effect of computational time step and turbulence model the crp6 consists of dtmb3686 and dtmb3687 while the crp4 consists of dtmb3686 and dtmb3849 by comparing the numerical results with those from the experiments the applicability of the rans simulation with the standard and shear stress transport k ω turbulence model was verified paik et al 2015 carried out a simulation of the wake flow and the tip vortex of the crp with a ship hull using a commercial cfd code based on a rans equations solver the flow measurement was performed with stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system the numerical results agree well with the experimental measurement the current study focuses on the tip vortex of the crp6 using the les approach although an exactly similar simulation with regard to the present problem does not exist many previous works can be referred and utilized for the current study the applicability of les on the tip vortex of a single propeller has been validated the numerical approach using the les technique has the potential to predict unsteady flows that include regions of large scale separation much more accurately compared to the rans computations in general ghias et al 2013 employed a les solver to simulate a compressible wing tip flow and examine the flow structure in the formation region of the tip vortex as well as the evolution of the vortex in the near wake yamanishi et al 2007 researched on the backflow vortex structure at the inlet of an inducer with the les approach fureby et al fureby and grinstein 2002 studied the high reynolds number free flows and wall bounded flows based on the modified les equations they came up with moreover muscari et al 2017 performed a numerical simulation on the vortex body interaction of a single bladed rotating propeller with a stationary rudder cavitation is always associated with the tip vortex vortex shedding occurs for many marine structures particularly the hydrofoil and the propeller les has been extensively applied in the related simulation pendar and roohi 2016 used les and rans k ω sst turbulence approaches as well as kunz and sauer mass transfer models to simulate the dynamic and unsteady behaviors of cavitation around 3d hemispherical head form body and a conical cavitator the one equation eddy viscosity model is used to model the sub grid scale terms in the simulation with les approach the same turbulence models and cavitation models are used to simulate the cavitation flow of a sphere at a constant reynolds number of 1 5 106 pendar and roohi 2018 roohi et al 2015 performed numerical investigations of the cavitating and supercavitating flow behind a three dimensional disk with a particular emphasis on detailed comparisons of various turbulence and mass transfer models the numerical approaches of les and k ω shear stress transport turbulence were coupled with various mass transfer model types e g kunz schnerr sauer and zwart models zahiri and roohi 2019 carried out a series of simulations on single phase and multi phase flows using les approach with different sub grid scale sgs models in the open source package openfoam a static type of eddy viscosity sgs model and an anisotropic minimum dissipation amd subgrid scale model were mainly discussed in their study anisotropic minimum dissipation sub grid models represent simple alternatives to the smagorinsky type approaches to the implementation of sub grid scales sgs effects in the large eddy simulation les approach rickard et al bensow and bark 2010 worked on the implicit les predictions of the cavitating flow on a propeller kumar and dewan 2016 assessed the effectiveness of four sub grid stress models in large eddy simulation of natural convection in a buoyant square cavity the four models are namely dynamic smagorinsky model vreman model one equation eddy viscosity model and buoyancy modified one equation eddy viscosity model the research shows that the vreman model over predicts the peak of the time averaged velocity and under predicts the peak of the root mean square fluctuations the one equation model and buoyancy modified one equation model can predict the time averaged field root mean square field turbulent shear stress and turbulent heat flux more accurately than those by the dynamic smagorinsky and vreman models obviously the present problem is different and more complicated because both the forward and the aft propellers shed tip vortex and the vortex implicate and entwine with each other in the present paper we have used an implicit les method with a dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale sgs model to calculate the wake flow of crp6 the numerical simulations are performed using commercial cfd software the star ccm v12 02 the open water characteristics of crp6 are provided first to verify the turbulence model then the influence of the time step and the grid scale on les are discussed based on an extensive convergence study the formation evolution and the interaction of the tip vortex for the advance coefficient j 0 9 are mainly investigated the numerical simulations reveal some interesting phenomena from the interaction of the vortex 1 1 numerical method and governing equations the essence of the les is avoiding the calculation of all small scale turbulences that are not available for numerical resolution and the effects of small scale motions on large scale eddies in the present study the les technique is used to perform turbulent flow simulations the les technique assumes that the larger eddies in the turbulent flow are dependent on the geometry while the smaller eddies behave universally han et al 2019 large scale motions are resolved by the filtered navier stokes equations while the small scale motions are modeled by the sgs models in the les models the velocity is decomposed into filtered velocity u and sgs velocity u sgs and velocity u u u sgs this equation is similar to that of reynolds decomposition in which the total velocity is decomposed into the average and fluctuating components however the filtered velocity differs from the mean velocity and the sgs velocity differs from the fluctuating velocity the filtering process is performed using a spatial filter function the filtered velocity is defined in eq 1 as follows 1 u i x t 1 δ 3 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 δ 2 u i ξ t g x ξ d ξ 1 d ξ 2 d ξ 3 where δ denotes the filter length g x ξ denotes the filter function which is defined in eq 2 2 g η 1 η δ 2 0 η δ 2 the filtered navier stokes equation is defined in eq 3 as follows 3 u j t ρ u i u j x i p x j x j μ u j x i τ i j where u j denotes the filtered velocity ρ denotes density and p denotes the filtered pressure the term τ i j is known as the sgs stress and is defined in eq 4 as follows 4 τ i j u i u j u i u j in the present paper we have used an implicit les approach with a dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale ds ss model to calculate the wake flow of crp6 the ds ss model is an eddy viscosity subgrid scale stress model the smallest resolved scales are dynamically tested to predict the behavior of the subgrid scales germano et al 1991 this model is based on the algebraic identity between the resolved turbulent stresses and the subgrid scale stresses obtained using two filters the grid filter and the test filter the model coefficient is obtained dynamically as the calculations progress the model implicitly assumes similarity between the sgs stresses at the grid and test levels which are modeled using the same functional expression namely the smagorinsky model germano et al 1991 lilly 1992 the effect of subgrid scales is parameterized by the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity germano et al 1991 5 μ t ρ δ 2 s where ρ is the density s is the strain rate given by s s 2 s s t 2 s s s is the mean strain rate tensor the parameter δ2 is computed dynamically as a function of a number of test filtered variables 6 δ 2 c s 2 v 2 3 where c s is the model coefficient and v is the cell volume to capture the vortex in the fluid region a vortex criterion function is used for tip vortex simulation the existing vortex criterion functions are ω criterion q criterion δ criterion and λ c i criterion the q criterion function which was proposed by hunt et al is one of the most widely used vortex criterion functions q criterion function is used in the simulation of incompressible or a weakly compressible fluid to capture the vortex in a three dimensional flow by determining the fluid region with a vorticity tensor greater than the strain rate tensor the deformation of the fluid can be expressed using the velocity gradient tensor it can be separated into two parts symmetrical strain rate tensor s and asymmetrical vorticity tensor ω according to hunt if the vorticity tensor ω contributes more toward the deformation of the fluid rather than the strain rate tensor s then the vortex exists the q criterion function is defined as follows 7 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where is the two norm tensor 1 2 test case crp6 model consists of dtmb3686 and dtmb3687 model propellers the axial spacing distance between the disks of the forward and the aft propellers is 14 15 of the forward propeller diameter the rotational speeds of the forward and the aft propellers are both 720 rpm the main geometrical particulars of the models are listed in table 1 in which d is the diameter of the propeller p is the pitch of the propeller and a is the ratio of the part with even load distribution accounting for the whole chord length the forward and the aft propellers are installed with an initial phase angle difference of 45 the geometry of the forward and the aft propeller blades are described in fig 1 the offset table and the experimental data of crp6 can be found in reference miller 1976 the cartesian coordinate system can be seen in fig 1 the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is set at the center of the aft disk and the plane y o z coincides with the aft disk the computational domain consists of a cubic domain whose width and height are 10 5r each where r is defined as the radius of the forward propeller it has a length of 10 0r and it starts 2 7r before the forward propeller disk and extends until 7 0r after the forward propeller disk the computational domain with the boundary conditions is presented in fig 2 2 convergence validation 2 1 grid scale the computational grid is created with star ccm v12 02 this study used three different grid scales to analyze the influence of the grid size on the numerical simulation of a contra propeller tip vortex the grid settings are shown in table 2 the average wall normal resolution on the blades is set to y 1 0 overset grids are applied to simulate the rotational motions of the forward and aft propeller the grid topologies are all hexahedral except for the prism layer grids and arbitrary polyhedral grids between the prism layer grids and the hexahedral grids a cylinder that covers crp6 and extends up to 8 0r in the wake is added to refine the volume mesh in order to capture the tip vortex as shown in fig 3 the cells in this cylinder are isotropic which means that the grid sizes in all the three directions are identical the sizes of the grids in this cylinder for coarse medium and fine grids are equal to 0 005m 0 004m and 0 003m respectively the fine grid consists of 1 474 107 cells the local gridding at the blade tip for the fine grid is shown in fig 4 the time steps for the simulation with coarse grids and medium grids are 2 8935 10 5 s each which correspond to a 0 125 rotation and both courant numbers are equal to 1 5 the time steps for the three simulations with different grid scales should be the same however the amount of computation is gigantic for the simulation with fine grids moreover the time taken for the simulation with fine grids is much more than that of the other two simulations when the time step is 2 8935 10 5 s thus the time step of the simulation with fine grids is set to 5 878 10 5 s which corresponds to a 0 25 rotation and a corresponding courant number of 3 0 the instantaneous views of the tip vortex of crp6 for the advance coefficient j 0 9 are shown in fig 5 this presents the isosurface of the q criterion function when the value of q criterion function is set to 1000 s2 the isosurface is colored according to the reference values of the axial vorticity the tip vortex of crp6 as shown in fig 5 c is simulated with fine grids it is more clearly captured compared with the ones in the simulations with coarse and medium grids though its time step is twice as much as the other two sets of simulations the motioning and deforming regularity of the tip vortex of crp6 is clearly shown the intertwinement of the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller disk is also better calculated 2 2 time step the approach of the les turbulence model is unsteady therefore the following three time steps are set to analyze the influence of time step on the numerical simulation of the crp6 tip vortex with the medium grid scale mentioned in section 4 1 as follows 1 157 10 4 s 5 878 10 5 s and 2 8935 10 5 s these three time steps correspond to a rotation of 0 5 0 25 and 0 125 for a single propeller respectively the corresponding courant numbers are equal to 4 5 2 5 and 1 25 respectively the instantaneous views of the tip vortex of crp6 for the advance coefficient value j 0 9 simulated with different time steps are presented in fig 6 the tip vortex of crp6 lengthens much further in the wake flow the tip vortex of the forward propeller as shown in fig 6 a disappears when passing through the disk of the aft propeller and emerges at 0 75r behind the aft propeller when the time step is 1 157 10 4 s the diameter of the vortex tube of the forward propeller is much smaller than that of the aft propeller more details of the vortex are captured when the time step is 2 8935 10 5s the diameter of the vortex tube of the forward propeller tip vortex is similar to that of the aft propeller tip vortex furthermore the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller disk is calculated better as shown in fig 6 c according to the discussion in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 the tip vortex is well captured when the grid scale and the time step decrease the grid scale has greater impact on the simulation of the tip vortex thus the fine grid is used in the following simulation and the time step is 5 878 10 5 s 2 3 open water characteristics the comparison between the numerical results obtained from the les and the experimental data miller 1976 for different advance coefficient values are presented in fig 7 subscripts f and a denote the forward propeller and aft propeller respectively the rotation speeds of the forward and the aft propellers of crp6 are both 720 rpm the value of the advance coefficient j ranges from 0 7 to 1 1 the numerical results obtained from the les agree well with the experimental data as shown in fig 7 the error of the thrust and torque coefficient for the forward and the aft propellers are both under 5 when the value of j ranges from 0 8 to 0 9 the error increases when the advance coefficient is too high or too low overall it is validated that the les approach can be applied for the study of the tip vortex of crp6 3 results and discussion 3 1 pressure distribution on the surface of the blade tip j 0 9 a simulation with the advance coefficient value of 0 9 is performed to analyze the formation and evolution of crp6 tip vortex as a result of the analysis described in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 a simulation with fine grid and medium time step is used the fluid structure of the tip vortex near the blade tip is shown in detail during the following two moments the phase angle between the blades of the forward and the aft propellers θ equals 45 and the phase angle θ equals 0 fig 8 a figs 8 b fig 9 a and fig 9 b show the pressure distribution on the surface of the blade tip when the phase angle θ 45 it shows that a sharp pressure gradient exists on the suction surface of both the forward and the aft propeller near the leading edge the pressure in this area is much lower than that in the other area a cambered section which is perpendicular to the propeller disk is set along the low pressure region to capture the pressure near the blade tip the intersection line of the suction surface of the blade and the cambered section is set along the edge of the blade tip passing through the location with minimum pressure at the blade tip the exact position of the cambered section is shown in fig 8 d and the same method is used to define the cambered sections in figs 9 c fig 10 c and fig 11 c there is an intense spatial variation of pressure on the suction side of the blade tip as shown in figs 8 c and fig 9 c the low pressure region moves away from the blade surface gradually from the leading edge to the following edge and this corresponds to the shedding of the tip vortex the pressure distributions on the cambered sections of the forward and the aft propellers are different from each other the fluid separation on the suction surface of the forward propeller is delayed compared to that of the aft propeller after a rotation of 22 5 the phase angle θ 0 the pressure distribution at this moment is shown in figs 10 and 11 for the suction and pressure surface of the forward propeller the magnitude of pressure changes slightly while the pressure distribution is similar the magnitude of pressure on the blade tip of the aft propeller has increased considerably when θ 0 the pressure distribution on the suction surface of the aft propeller also changes the pressure distribution on the cambered sections of the forward and the aft propeller changes considerably as well it shows that the fluid separation on the suction surface at the blade tip of the forward propeller is advanced and that of the aft propeller is delayed 3 2 formation and evolution of the tip vortex j 0 9 a series of plans are set along the tip vortex to capture the fluid structure of the tip vortex flow when the phase angle between the forward and the aft propeller θ 45 and θ 0 as shown in fig 12 and fig 15 respectively the tip vortex of the forward propeller meets the blade tip of aft propeller when θ 45 the formation and the evolution of the tip vortex distribution of vorticity and the interaction between the tip vortices of the forward and the aft propellers are clearly shown in figs 13 and 14 in order to differentiate the tip vortex of the forward from that of the aft propeller these plans are colored according to the axial vorticity values the reference velocity values of the tip vortex flow are also shown on these plans the tip vortex flow of the forward propeller is mainly red due to the reverse rotation the blue area predominantly represents the flow region of the tip vortex of the aft propeller it shows a similar process of vortex shedding where the process occurs along the following edge of the blade however the vortex disappears rapidly after leaving the blade except for the tip vortex the tip vortex of the forward propeller suffers an intense disturbance when passing through the disk of the aft propeller as shown in fig 13 8 and fig 13 9 the magnitude of the axial vorticity of the forward propeller tip vortex decreases when it meets the blade tip of the aft propeller and the magnitude of the vorticity also decreases as shown in fig 21 c this is one of the factors that causes the forward propeller tip vortex to distort and twine around the tip vortex of aft propeller when moving downstream as shown in fig 13 7 and fig 13 8 in fig 14 plan 10 is set on the leading edge near the blade tip this shows that the tip vortex of the forward propeller is cut by the blade tip of the aft propeller in plans 11 and 12 the tip vortex of the forward propeller is weakened by the blade tip of the aft propeller the tip vortex of the aft propeller forms at the blade tip as shown in plan 12 and this can also be seen in fig 13 7 according to the velocity near the blade tip the flow from the pressure side to the suction side is also a factor that induces the tip vortex a series of plans are set along the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers as shown in fig 15 when θ 0 plans 11 and 12 are set at the intersection of the tip vortex the axial vorticity of the tip vortex of the forward propeller changes quickly after shedding from the blade tip as shown in fig 16 the initial status of the intersection of the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers is shown in fig 17 11 and fig 17 12 the tip vortex of the forward propeller is under that of the aft propeller after a rotation of 22 5 the phase angle θ 45 furthermore the flow structure of the intersection between the tip vortexes of the forward and aft propellers will change as shown in fig 14 16 and fig 14 17 3 3 interactions j 0 9 the tip vortex sheds from the suction side of the blade tip and moves downstream with the wake flow similarly the intersection of the tip vortexes of the forward and the aft propellers also moves downstream and deforms gradually as shown in fig 18 the fluid structure at the intersections of the tip vortex deforms during the downstream motion the details of the intersections are shown in figs 19 and 20 it can be observed that the tip vortex of the forward propeller intersects with the blade tip of the aft propeller bypasses under the tip vortex of the aft propeller and then moves downstream the tip vortex of the forward propeller is primarily induced and deformed by the blade tip and the tip vortex of the aft propeller the vorticity of the tip vortex of the forward propeller at the intersection is weaker which can be observed in fig 21 c it explains that the tip vortex of the forward propeller at intersection twines around that of the aft propeller in the wake flow similarly the tip vortex of the aft propeller is also deformed by that of the forward propeller intersection 1 deforms into intersection 5 gradually during the downstream motion the tip vortex of the aft propeller at the intersection is distorted gradually into a sigmoid curve the tip vortex of the forward propeller is induced to circle around that of the aft propeller 3 4 vorticity distribution j 0 9 crp6 works under a positive loading when the advance coefficient j ranges from 0 2 to 1 1 the tip vortex is maintained in the wake flow with a regular shape and a certain vorticity strength when j 0 9 as shown in fig 21 the axial vorticity of the forward propeller is opposite to that of the aft propeller the structure of both the tip vortex tubes of the forward and aft propellers is generally a helix however they are deformed from the helical path during downstream motion and the fluid structure of the tip vortex flow becomes complicated this is mainly due to the interaction between the tip vortex of the forward and aft propellers and the kinetic energy dissipation of the fluid in fig 21 the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller is shown in another perspective it can be observed that the projection of the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller is nearly an eight pointed star the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers deform into a constant form and move downstream owing to the interaction between them a part of the tip vortex of the forward propeller is deformed and rotated gradually and its axial vorticity becomes negative similar changes occur on the tip vortex of the aft propeller however a lot of details regarding the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller are unclear two longitudinal sections and six transverse sections are set to capture the wake flow for further study of the vortex flow as shown in fig 22 the transverse sections are set across the intersections of the tip vortex in the cartesian coordinate system shown in fig 1 for transverse section 1 6 the axial positions x 0 72r 1 31r 1 90r 2 52r 3 08r and 3 70r respectively longitudinal section 1 coincides with the plane x o z longitudinal section 2 coincides with the z axis and the angle between longitudinal section 2 and the plane x o z is equal to 22 5 fig 23 and fig 24 show the axial vorticity distribution of the wake flow the axial evolution of the tip vortex 3 0r behind the aft propeller disk can also be recognized from fig 23 longitudinal section 1 cuts through the intersections of the tip vortexes the angle between longitudinal sections 1 and 2 is equal to 22 5 longitudinal section 1 shows a different distribution of axial vorticity in fig 24 a a part of the vortex flow region with negative axial vorticity represents the tip vortex of the forward propeller when the simulation of the tip vortex is complete a series of probes are set at the section center of the tip vortex to monitor the velocity and pressure as shown in fig 25 probes 1 3 and 5 are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller while the rest of the probes are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the aft propeller in the cartesian coordinate system shown in fig 1 the space positions of probe1 6 are shown in table 3 after the setting of the probes is complete the simulation is continued as the tip vortex moves the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller will pass the probes 1 3 and 5 periodically and the frequency equals 48 hz the tip vortex of the aft propeller also causes velocity and pressure changes at probes 1 3 and 5 when it passes by these probes similarly probes 2 4 and 6 are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the aft propeller when the simulation is continued the probe is at the section center of the tip vortex tube the axial velocity pressure and axial vorticity at the probes are monitored during the simulation and the results are shown in fig 26 fig 27 and fig 28 the axial velocity at a probe decreases when the tip vortex passes through it the axial velocity curve at probe 1 is about a sinusoid and that at probe 5 has two crests in one period as shown in fig 26 a the prime reason is that the tip vortex of the aft propeller is deformed and its motion trail gradually approaches the probes which are set at the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller the axial velocities at probes 2 4 and 6 demonstrate the same regularity a significant difference between the axial velocity in fig 26 a and b is that axial velocity of the tip vortex of the forward propeller decreases during moving downstream the axial velocity fluctuation of the tip vortex of the forward propeller decreases while it increases for the tip vortex of the aft propeller when moving downstream the pressures at probes 1 6 fluctuate drastically when the tip vortex passes through them as shown in fig 27 pressure fluctuations at probes 1 3 and 5 are smaller to each other but the amplitude of the fluctuation decreases gradually the pressure curves of probes 2 4 and 6 strongly resemble each other the axial vorticity at the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller is a positive number while it is negative for the tip vortex of aft propeller the absolute value of the former is much less than that of the latter as shown in fig 28 the axial vorticities at probes 1 3 and 5 reach the maximum when the section center of the tip vortex of the forward propeller passes by the respective probes and reach the minimum when the tip vortex of the aft propeller passes by the respective probes this is shown in fig 28 a the phenomenon is reverse in case of the axial vorticities at probes 2 4 and 6 the axial vorticities of the forward and the aft propeller decrease when there is downstream motion 3 5 advance coefficient the tip vortexes of crp6 with different advance coefficients are shown in fig 29 and all the values of the scalar function q criterion are set to 1000 s2 it is observed that the axial vorticity of the tip vortex decreases when the advance coefficient increases in fig 29 a the value of the advance coefficient is set to 1 1 which corresponds to a condition of large advance and low blade loading in this case the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers last a long distance in the wake flow with a relatively steady structure the hydrodynamic load on the blade increases when j 0 7 in comparison to the same in a simulation with j 0 9 the kinetic energy of the fluid dissipates rapidly when it leaves the propeller because of the small advance coefficient the tip vortex banks up gradually during the downstream motion finally the value of the advance coefficient is set to 0 5 which corresponds to a condition of high blade loading in this case the axial vorticity of the tip vortex becomes much stronger 3 6 q criterion j 0 9 the larger the value of q the more advantages asymmetrical vorticity tensor ω takes over the symmetrical strain rate tensor s when the advance coefficient j 0 9 the results of q 500 s2 2000 s2 and 3000 s2 are presented in fig 30 to show the distribution of the axial vorticity on the surface of the vortex tube when the diameters of the vortex tube are different the vorticity of the fluid increases when approaching the vortex core of the tip vortex the value of q is related to vorticity of the fluid thus the diameter of the tip vortex tube decreases and the axial vorticity on the face of the vortex tube increases when the value of q increases 3 7 densified grids j 0 9 a smaller grid size is considered to simulate the tip vortex of crp6 the grid number will be too large if the size of the grid continues to be decreased thus the method of mesh refinement should be changed the cylinder mentioned in subsection 4 1 is replaced by a hollow cone to densify the grids as shown in fig 31 to reduce the amount of the grids the length of the hollow cone extends up to 3 8r in the wake the cells in the hollow cone are isotropic and the size of the grid in the hollow cone is 0 0015 m each of the blades of the forward and the aft propellers contain approximately 48300 and 55500 surface grids respectively the number of the total grids in this simulation is equal to 1 871 107 the time step is set to 5 878 10 5 s and the corresponding courant number is 3 0 the advance coefficient is j 0 9 the tip vortex of crp6 simulated with the refined grids is shown in fig 32 and q 1000 s2 compared to the tip vortex simulated with fine grids shown in fig 5 c there is a more distinguishable view of the intertwinements of the tip vortexes the diameter of the tip vortex tube of the aft propeller is at first much smaller than that of the forward propeller fig 33 shows the distribution of the axial vorticity in the wake of crp6 longitudinal section 1 and longitudinal section 2 are defined in fig 22 in subsection 5 4 compared with fig 24 this tip vortex flow is simulated better the fluid structures at the intersections of the tip vortex as shown fig 33 b coincide well with the tip vortex structure as shown in fig 34 4 conclusion the capability of the numerical simulations with les approach to predict the complex flow past crp6 is presented in this study computations are performed for various advance coefficients and the computational result for the advance coefficient value j 0 9 is mainly discussed the predicted global quantities such as the thrust torque and the efficiency obtained using the les turbulence closure are in good agreement with the experimental data the convergence analyses of the grid scale and the time step are also considered in this study the tip vortex is well captured when the grid scale and the time step decrease and the grid scale has greater impact on the simulation of the tip vortex thus the fine grid is used in the investigation of the tip vortex and the time step is equal to 5 878 10 5 s the tip vortex shedding is associated with the distinct low pressure region located at the suction side of the blade tip the vortex shedding occurs along the following edge of the blade however the vortex disappears rapidly after leaving the blade except for the tip vortex it is observed that the tip vortex of the forward propeller is cut by the blade tip of the aft propeller periodically and its axial vorticity decreases suddenly after passing through the disk of the aft propeller the tip vortex lasts for a long distance behind crp6 the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propellers intertwine with each other and move downstream in the wake flow the original intertwinements of the tip vortexes can be clearly distinguished however the intertwinements of the tip vortexes become complex when moving far away from crp6 the tip vortex of the forward propeller is deformed directly by the blade tip of the aft propeller and with the mutual inductions between the tip vortex of the forward and the aft propeller the tip vortex of the forward propeller is deformed below the tip vortex of the aft propeller and then starts to surround around the tip vortex of the aft propeller gradually when moving downstream the gradients of velocity pressure and vorticity are sharp in the tip vortex flow the vorticity of the tip vortex increases with the decrease in the advance coefficient value acknowledgements this work was supported by harbin engineering university grant no heucgf201814 the national natural science foundation of

22317,in this study the wave induced mass transport and internal mixing under regular waves propagating in a flume are numerically investigated by a vof type volume of fluid method a two phase vof method based on a multi phase flow mathematical theory is implemented in a constraint interpolation profile cip based model to track the free surface and water water interface simultaneously under eulerian framework first the numerical validation is performed on stokes drift distribution under regular waves propagating in a flat bottom flume good grid convergence and mass conservation are verified the computed results show favorable agreement with theoretical solution and experimental data the regular waves propagating over a submerged breakwater are further investigated focusing on the mass transport and internal mixing in the long term evolution of flow field the mass transport and water exchange in the vicinity of breakwater are presented qualitatively a significant water mixing and broken interface are observed even if there is no regular waves breaking results indicate that the cip based model coupled with the two phase vof method can provide a different perspective to study wave induced mass transport and internal mixing in coastal zone keywords cip method internal wave maker vof method water water interface stokes drift internal mixing 1 introduction in ocean environment surface waves can be recorded by fixed eulerian probes or free floating lagrangian buoys in steep waves the differences between eulerian and lagrangian measurements can be very remarkable longuet higgins 1986 the differences are of considerable importance for progressive wave problems in the general ocean circulation which are referred to nonlinear wave induced stokes drift qiao et al 2010 the presence of stokes drift has a significant impact on the trajectories of suspended sediments as well as the mixing processes in oceans phillips 1977 henderson et al 2004 holmedal and myrhaug 2009 bever et al 2011 yu et al 2012 sulisz and paprota 2015 furthermore wave induced mass transport is greatly essential in estimating the transport of variable density solute plumes oil spill and plastic particles etc wang and shen 2010 drivdal et al 2014 guo et al 2014 liu and sheng 2014 thus a comprehensive understanding of wave induced mass transport mechanism and internal mixing is extremely important in coastal and offshore engineering there has been a wide study of mass transport in water waves gerstner 1809 first proposed trochoidal wave theory for periodic and permanent waves in infinite water depth this theory consists of the exact solutions required to express a possible form of gravity wave motion in the lagrangian system constantin 2001 and henry 2008 developed the gerstner s theory and indicated that the trajectory of water particle is described as circular orbit of which radius diminishes with water depth airy 1841 obtained the first order approximation solution of irrotational waves in the eulerian system he found that for small amplitude waves airy wave the surface profile and velocity motion are sinusoidal and the trajectory of water particle is circular in deep water and elliptic in intermediate water stokes 1847 first derived a irrotational second order solution for waves in finite water depth and a third order solution for waves in infinite water depth according to his theory the particle trajectory becomes an incomplete loop due to nonlinearity consequently free surface oscillations are accompanied by the progressive motion of water in the direction of wave propagation the velocity of the horizontal drift near the free surface is larger than that near the flume bottom wallet and ruellan 1950 took a series of photographs to study the trajectory motion in a wave flume in the case of pure progressive waves the trajectories are circular near the free surface and changed to be elliptic and finally flat when reaching the flume bottom in addition there are some open loops indicating that there is a slow drift in the wave propagating direction near the free surface and in the opposite direction near the flume bottom longuet higgins 1953 took the effect of viscosity into account and derived the formulas of the mass transport distribution for both irrotational and viscous fluid motion in a wave flume constantin 2006 and constantin and strauss 2010 solved a set of differential equations to investigate the particle path in a fixed eulerian system they estimated the stokes drift for random directional waves from satellite altimetry data and compared it with in situ buoy data huang 2007 experimentally investigated the lagrangian surface drift current induced by surface gravity waves in a wave flume using the particle tracking method wiegel and johnson 2010 used flow visualization technology and found that water particle velocity is greater in its forward movement under the wave crest than in its backward movement under the wave trough this results in mass transport in the direction of wave propagation huang et al 2011 carried out a series of experiments and studied the drift motion of small rigid floating objects driven by regular waves in deep water tamura et al 2012 studied the stokes drift and wave induced mass flux in the realistic wave fields and ocean currents using the third generation wave model paprota et al 2016 adopted the technique of particle image velocimetry piv and calculated the mass transport processes associated with propagating ocean waves later a theoretical model based on potential flow assumption was developed by paprota and sulisz 2018 to study the kinematics of water particles and mass transport of wave induced flow in a wave tank although achievements have been obtained by the previous studies most of them are based on physical experiment or theoretical analysis in terms of water particle velocity and trajectory the number of such numerical investigations is still limited and most of them only focused on the nonlinear wave shapes in the past few decades computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling has been an essential way in understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of flows in numerous industrial processes and academic research due to its advantages such as low cost and technical limitation scardovelli and zaleski 1999 glowinski et al 2001 colagrossi and landrini 2003 silva et al 2003 zhao and hu 2012 schmeeckle 2014 bayon et al 2018 there are two general categories in cfd models mesh free model and mesh based model for mesh free model the fluid is usually simulated by particles numerically the lagrangian description of the particles traces the trajectory of every particle making the study of air water and water water interface rather straightforward while there is no problem of interface tracing mesh free methods such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method monaghan 1994 colagrossi and landrini 2003 shao and lo 2003 xu and deng 2016 the moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 perez and garcia 2017 and the consistent particle method cpm koh et al 2012 luo et al 2016b have been widely applied in the numerical study of free surface and water water interface shao et al 2006 crespo et al 2008 khayyer and gotoh 2010 jian et al 2015 gong et al 2016 luo et al 2016a mesh based models use eulerian description to compute and capture free surface one of the most popular methods dealing with free surface motion is the vof method which captures free surface by the reconstruction of volume function in computational grids hirt and nichols 1981 xiao et al 2011 another widely used method is the level set method proposed by osher and sethian 1988 which implicitly determines the free surface by the zero contour of a signed distance function models based on these two methods have been widely applied in the studies of interfacial flow in addition to the free surface great results have also been obtained in the water water interface motion yasuda et al 1999 traced the water water interface under breaking waves by applying particle markers in eulerian grids and computing those particles in a lagrangian approach followed by this method lubin et al 2006 studied the water water interface in drop impact process however these models are usually complicated regarding the complex phenomena ye and zhao 2017 proposed a two liquid vof method based on the idea of original vof method by this method free surface and water water interface could be captured simultaneously in dam break flow relatively simple and with low computational cost the main objective of the present study is to numerically investigate wave induced mass transport internal flow and mixing processes under weakly nonlinear waves propagating in a wave tank the two liquid vof method proposed by ye and zhao 2017 is employed to trace both free surface and water water interface under the eulerian framework the cip based model coupled with the two liquid vof method is validated using the experimental data of paprota et al 2016 the mass transport and internal mixing under regular waves and interaction with a submerged breakwater are studied the outline of this paper is organized as follows model details including numerical procedures and implementations are presented in section 2 the model validation is presented in section 3 section 4 presents investigations of the mass transport and internal mixing during regular wave propagating over a submerged breakwater discussing the variation of water water interface and internal mixing in a long term evolution finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 numerical model and implementations 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for two dimensional incompressible viscous fluid flow are mass conservation and navier stokes equations expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i s i n a b u i where x i i 1 2 are the coordinates in a cartesian coordinate system u i i 1 2 are the velocity components t is time ρ is the fluid density μ is the dynamic viscosity p is the pressure g i are the body forces for example gravity s i n is momentum source function and a b is damping term coefficient the wave structure interaction is treated as a multi phase problem that includes water air and solid body a volume fraction field φ m m 1 2 and 3 indicate water air and solid respectively is adopted to represent and capture the phase interface firstly we treat liquid phase and solid phase as one phase φ 1 3 the governing equation for the water and body is as follows 3 φ 1 3 t u i φ 1 3 x i 0 where φ 1 3 φ 1 φ 3 φ 11 φ 12 φ 3 the value of the liquid and solid phase φ 1 3 is calculated by vof method the volume function for solid φ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a fixed rigid body is assumed the value of whole liquid phase φ 1 is obtained by the relationship φ 1 3 φ 1 φ 3 the volume function for air φ 2 is determined by φ 2 1 φ 1 φ 3 after the volume function is calculated the physical property λ such as the density ρ and viscosity μ in every grid can be defined as 4 λ m 1 3 φ m λ m 2 2 two liquid vof method during the past decades models based on vof method have been widely used to simulate free surface motion the vof method proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 is a methodology which deals with free boundaries within eulerian formulation it has been proved to be a powerful tool to deal with violent free surface flows traditional vof function can be expressed as 5 φ m t u φ m 0 where φ m indicates the volume function m 1 2 and 3 indicate water air and solid respectively by solving eq 5 the free surface of liquid phase can be constructed however this one liquid phase method does not have the ability of solving the inner interface and water mass exchange inside the liquid phase because the liquid phase has only one corresponding volume fraction function φ 1 in the entire calculation domain in order to capture both the free surface and water water interface under eulerian grids a two liquid vof method was proposed by ye and zhao 2017 to construct the interface between different liquid phases with same physical property except the whole liquid volume function φ 1 two additional volume fraction functions φ 11 and φ 12 are used to represent the water bodies at different initial positions the sketch of the two phase vof model in initial condition is shown in fig 1 here φ 11 and φ 12 satisfy the relationship 6 φ 1 i j φ 11 i j φ 12 i j which means the summation of sub liquid phases equals to the total volume of liquid phase the evolution of volume functions φ 11 and φ 12 can be described as 7 φ 11 t u φ 11 0 8 φ 12 t u φ 12 0 the total volume function can be obtained by the relationship in eq 5 and the two sub liquid phases can be solved by eq 7 and eq 8 respectively in this way both the air water interface and the water water interface can be constructed during the reconstruction process in two liquid vof method the total volume in each computational grid cell may be greater than 1 0 when taking summation of φ 11 and φ 12 this problem will cause error in multi phase computing in order to correct the volume function an intermediate step is taken at water water interface instead of the direct implementation of vof method shown as 9 φ 1 i j φ 1 i j 10 φ 11 i j φ 11 i j 1 2 φ 1 i j φ 11 i j φ 12 i j 11 φ 12 i j φ 12 i j 1 2 φ 1 i j φ 11 i j φ 12 i j where indicates another intermediate value finally the value of the total volume function is updated by taking summation of two liquid phases 12 φ 1 i j n 1 φ 11 i j n 1 φ 12 i j n 1 there are various schemes for vof method with different reconstruction processes hirt and nichols 1981 youngs 1982 harvie and fletcher 2001 aulisa et al 2003 xiao et al 2005 cervone et al 2009 xiao et al 2011 compared with other vof methods the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with slope weighting scheme thinc sw proposed by xiao et al 2011 uses a smoothed heaviside function with a variable steepness parameter which can keep the sharpness of interface and significantly improve the geometrical accuracy in this study the interface is calculated by the thinc sw scheme see the discussion in appendix 2 3 momentum source wave maker in this paper the momentum source function is adopted to generate waves which can avoid the re reflection wave from the structure according to choi and yoon 2009 ha et al 2013 liu et al 2015 the momentum source functions for the 2d linear monochromatic regular wave can be expressed as 13 s n g 2 β x exp β x 2 d ω sin ω t where the origin of x is in the middle of the source region d is the source function amplitude which can be determined from the desired wave characteristics β is the parameter associated with the width of source function and can be determined by the width of source w 2 5 β ω is the wave frequency to avoid a jerk of the initial fluid motion that may induce numerical instability a ramp function f t is introduced to the source function shown as 14 f t 3 t t r 4 8 t t r 3 6 t t r 2 t t r 1 t t r where t r is three times of wave period 2 4 wave absorbing method the numerical sponge layer proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 is employed in this study to prevent the undesirable secondary wave reflections the efficiently absorbing coefficient a b is adopted from wei and kirby 1995 it has been proved to be very powerful by many studies lin and liu 2004 liu et al 2015 shown in the following equation 15 a b c α exp x x s t x a b n c 1 exp 1 1 where a b is absorbing coefficient x s t and x a b are the starting position and length of the absorbing region respectively c α and n c are empirical damping coefficients determined via numerical test the damping coefficient must be defined inside the sponge layer and it is zero outside the sponge layer lin and liu 2004 used the empirical coefficients n c 10 and c α 200 in their study which works very well in the rans based model in this study n c 10 and c α min 200 0 9 δ t are adopted where δ t is computational time step 2 5 numerical implementations in this study a staggered grid system is used for the spatial discretization a fractional method is applied to solve navier stokes equations by three calculation steps corresponding to determination of the advection term the non advection term i and the non advection term ii the first step is to solve the adevection term as eq 16 shows 16 u i t u j u i x j 0 a cip approach which is a third order finite difference scheme is employed to solve the above equations yabe et al 2001 the basic principle of cip method is an interpolation in a grid by a cubic polynomial with the value and differential on the grid node 17 u i x x i u i δ t where x is the unknown coefficient function x i is the cubic polynomial to approximate the spatial profile of u i in an upwind cell the superscript denotes the intermediate time level after the advection step the second step is to solve the diffusion term momentum source term and damping term by a central difference scheme 18 u i u i δ t 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i s i n a b u i where u i is the solution of this diffusion term in the end the pressure term is solved by the projection method 19 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p n 1 x i 20 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u x i where the superscript n 1 denotes the new time step the red black successive over relaxation approach sor is employed to solve the above poisson equation after the total flow field is updated the φ 11 φ 12 and φ 1 are solved by a volume of fluid vof type method thinc sw scheme the solid phase φ 3 is treated by an immersed boundary method ibm proposed by peskin 1972 more details about the flow solver can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 ye and zhao 2017 and li et al 2018 3 model validations in this section the ability of the present model to simulate the mass transfer and flow field under nonlinear wave propagating is validated using the experimental data of paprota et al 2016 numerical results are also compared with available theoretical solutions the experiment was conducted in the wave flume located in institute of hydro engineering polish academy of sciences paprota et al 2016 the flume was 64 m long and 0 6 m wide with a still water depth h of 0 25 m the wave gauge g1 was installed 4 m away from the wave maker to record the elevation of free surface the particle image velocimetry piv measurement technology was employed to calculate particle trajectory and mass transport velocity the wave characteristics of the test cases are given in table 1 the set up of the numerical domain corresponding to the experiment is shown in fig 2 two velocity meters marked as v1 and v2 located 0 1 m and 0 2 m below the still water level respectively are set to detect the velocity variation the water body in the horizontal range from x 5 6 m is marked as liquid 1 φ 11 in eq 6 and the rest of the water body is marked as liquid 2 φ 12 in eq 7 numerical experiments are initially carried out to show the convergence of the spatial discretization three non uniform grids are used in the simulation the grid details are listed in table 2 case 1 in table 2 is chosen to carry out the test fig 3 depicts the free surface time history at g1 for three different grids it can be seen that the computed results obtained using the fine and medium grid sizes are almost on top of each other however for the coarse grid there is a slight phase shift furthermore mass conservation in each phase is tested for different grid sizes the error of mass conservation is defined as 21 e r r o r i j φ i j n δ x δ y i j φ i j 0 δ x δ y φ i j 0 δ x δ y where i j φ i j 0 δ x δ y is the initial total volume of the domain the mass conservation error in each phase after a long term simulation is also shown in table 2 modeled results show that using finer grid size results in smaller error it is worth noticing that for all grid sizes mass conservation error is in the order of 10 5 which proves a good accuracy of the proposed method regarding mass conservation overall the mesh convergence is achieved using the medium grid similar tests for different time steps t 200 t 500 and t 1000 are performed but not included here in brief it indicates that using the time step δ t t 500 is sufficient fig 4 shows the elevation of free surface at gauge g1 for three cases from fig 4 the initial wave amplitude growth is smooth due to the ramp function during a relatively long propagating process the free surface at the g1 remains quasi steady according to the second order stokes theory le méhauté 1969 all the simulated waves are regarded as weakly nonlinear the amplitude of the second order harmonic wave component constitutes 5 7 5 and 8 5 of the primary waves for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively good agreements are obtained by comparing the simulated results with the second order stokes theoretical solution in fig 4 figs 5 7 show the modeled time series of horizontal and vertical velocities at v1 and v2 compared with the measurements by paprota et al 2016 the variation of velocity field at v1 and v2 remains quasi steady the nonlinear velocity oscillations can be seen in fig 7 which corresponds to the case with the longest wave period t 1 5s the time series of horizontal velocity at v1 and v2 are very close to each other while the time series of vertical velocity at v2 is significantly smaller than v1 overall the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements figs 8 10 show computed mass transport velocity profiles compared with the theoretical second order irrotational solution hudspeth and sulisz 1991 and experimental measurements by paprota et al 2016 for all simulated cases the mass transport velocity profiles shown in figs 8 10 are obtained by averaging over 10 wave periods the time averaged lagrangian mass transport velocity u l is calculated by the averaged horizontal displacement of the right interface between liquid 1 and liquid 2 the profiles of eulerian mean current velocity are obtained by averaging horizontal velocity components at fixed points using the principle of mass flux conservation the stokes mass transport velocity profile under propagating waves is obtained by subtracting the eulerian mean current from the lagrangian mass transport velocity hudspeth and sulisz 1991 monismith et al 2007 figs 8 a 9 a and 10 a show the time averaged lagrangian mass transport velocity profiles it can be seen that the displacement of water particles at the upper part of the water column is in the same direction of wave propagation the magnitude trends decreasing along water depth until to the point located approximately half of the water depth after that the direction of drift is changed the eulerian mean current velocity profiles are shown in figs 8 b 9 b and 10 b from these figures it can be seen that the computed results of eulerian mean current velocity are consistent with the theoretical solution except the little difference near the water surface the stokes drift velocity profiles for simulated waves are presented in figs 8 c 9 c and 10 c overall good agreements are observed between model prediction theoretical solution and measurements the depth averaged stokes drift velocity obtained by multiplying the second power of the ratio of the wave height to water depth is shown in fig 11 two numerical methods are employed to get the results one mass is obtained by the mass change of liquid 2 see blue triangles in fig 11 other averaged velocity is obtained by averaging the vertical stokes mass transport velocity shown in figs 8 c 9 c and 10 c see black squares in fig 11 results obtained by the two mentioned methods are very close to each other and are in good agreements with the theoretical solution and experiments which confirms the accuracy of the two liquid vof method in simulating the mass transfer and inside flow 4 results and discussion in this section the mass transport and internal mixing process under regular waves propagating over a submerged breakwater are studied by the two liquid vof method a physical model by liu et al 2019 used for studying the wave structure interaction is numerically represented the physical experiments were conducted in a glass wall wave flume at ocean college zhejiang university china liu et al 2019 the flume was 75 m long 1 8 m wide and 2 m high a trapezoid submerged breakwater 1 8 m wide 3 08 m long and 0 36 m high was installed 32 m away from the wave maker six wave gauges g1 g6 were placed along the central line to monitor the water wave profiles in this paper a constant water depth h 0 0 5 m is used in all numerical tests which is corresponding to the experiment four cases with different wave heights and periods are simulated for detailed analysis see table 3 to save some computational effort a short domain links length is used in the model the sketch of numerical computational domain corresponding to the experimental set up is shown in fig 12 to investigate the effect of submerged breakwater in the flow field two different set ups which are in the flat bottom flume and in the flume with a submerged breakwater are carried out respectively the initial layouts of the two models are shown in fig 13 a and b the horizontal solid line is the still water level the water body with blue color is marked as φ 11 and the rest of water body is marked as φ 12 in fig 13 a for the cases without a submerged breakwater the vertical distribution of φ 11 extends from surface to the flume bottom in fig 13 b for the cases with a submerged breakwater the initial distribution of φ 11 in vertical direction ranges from still water surface to the top of the submerged breakwater 4 1 mass transport under regular waves in the flat bottom flume prior to the simulation of waves propagating over a submerged breakwater the flat bottom flume subjected to weakly nonlinear propagating waves are tested and studied in this part fig 14 shows the variation of φ 11 marked in blue color after 10 wave periods and 20 periods for all mentioned cases from fig 14 it can be seen that there is no wave breaking for the cases in the flat bottom flume the displacement of water body φ 11 is in the right side direction the drift near the water surface is largest with a decreasing trend for deeper water until the point located approximately half of the water depth with reversing the direction below that point comparing the water body φ 11 corresponding to the instants after 10 and 20 wave periods it can be seen that the drift accumulates under the successive waves the reason may be due to the conservation of the water mass in the flume if the water particles in a certain vertical column are transported in one direction the water level on the two sides of this column will be unbalanced this unbalanced water level will cause the non hydrodynamic pressure which is opposite to the wave propagation direction the trajectory of water particle is determined by wave driving force and pressure gradient force in the vicinity of wave surface the wave driving force is greater than the pressure gradient force so the water body is transported in the direction of wave propagation the effect of wave driving force decreases from the free surface to the flume bottom when the wave driving force is equal to pressure gradient force there is no mass transfer in this depth after the position of equilibrium force the wave driving force is smaller than the pressure gradient force and the water body produces a reverse transfer regarding case 1 fig 14 a and b the effect of non linearity on the deformation of water body φ 11 is weak due to the small wave height during the wave propagation the amount of mass transport is insignificant as the wave height increases the effect of wave driving force becomes larger more significant mass transport and more severe deformation of the water body are observed for case 2 fig 14 c and d comparing different wave periods the internal interface for cases with longer wave periods shown in fig 14 e h is relatively uniform over depth from free surface to the flume bottom insignificant deformation of the water body is observed the reason may be due to that the regular wave with long period has long wavelength so the wave driving force on water particles is relatively uniform over depth while for the regular wave with small period the wave driving force decreases sharply as the depth increases for the weak effect of wave driving force the wave driving force has almost no effect and the motion of water particles is mainly dominated by the non hydrodynamic pressure force near the flume bottom as a result the internal interface is titled observably which can also be found the similar trends in figs 9 a and fig 10 a due to the unbroken internal interface the quantitative analysis in terms of mass transportation under different wave conditions are carried out fig 15 shows the displacement of water body φ 11 case 1 and case 2 correspond to same wave lengths but different wave heights it can be seen that for the case with larger wave height case 2 the amount of mass transport is more significant compared to the small wave height case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 correspond to same wave heights but different wave lengths compared to the cases with larger wave lengths case 3 and case 4 the amount of mass transport is slightly larger for the case with shorter wave length case 2 4 2 mass transport under regular waves in the flume with a submerged breakwater in this part the free surface and flow field under nonlinear waves propagating over a submerged breakwater are analyzed numerically fig 16 shows the time series of free surface elevation corresponding to case 2 see table 3 during waves propagating over the submerged breakwater it can be seen that when the incident waves propagate over the seaside slope of the breakwater the wave non linearity becomes more significant as the wave height and steepness increase slightly at g2 due to the effect of wave shoaling furthermore the degree of non linearity increases as the waves propagate over the submerged breakwater which can be observed at g3 and g4 at the lee side of the breakwater g5 and g6 the wave energy is redistributed high order harmonic wave gains energy from the incoming wave and develops significantly causing extremely asymmetric waveform in fig 16 the computed results are also compared with the previous experimental data liu et al 2019 it can be seen that a good agreement with the measurements is obtained by the present model simulation except for small deviation at the peak instants in g6 where the harmonic effect becomes stronger fig 17 shows the fluid phases after 10 periods and 20 periods for all the simulated wave cases in the flume with a submerged breakwater in case 1 which is the case with the lowest wave height and wave period fig 17 a and b the tracked water body φ 11 is transported in the direction of wave propagation due to wave non linearity in this case there is a cumulative trend of transport under the successive propagating waves as the water body is further transported after 20 wave periods furthermore both left and right interfaces are not smooth which is due to the presence of the submerged breakwater compared with the flat bottom flume fig 14 a and b fig 17 c and d show the phases corresponding to the case 2 with higher wave height and the same wave period compared with the case 1 similar to the case 1 there is a cumulative trend of mass transport under successive propagating waves furthermore the rate of mass transport for the case 2 is larger than that in case 1 it is also seen that the interface irregularities are more significant for the case 2 interestingly after 20 wave periods the displacement is more significant near the water surface forming a tail shape at the lee side of the breakwater which is accompanied by transport of the phase φ 12 from the sea side to the top of the breakwater in a similar shape fig 17 e and f correspond to case 3 with the same wave height and the higher wave period compared with the case 2 it can be seen that the internal mixing between φ 11 and φ 12 is developed in this case furthermore after 20 wave periods no clear internal interface can be observed fig 17 g and h show the visual results of case 4 which is the case with the highest wave period and the same wave height as case 2 and case 3 it can be seen that the internal mixing is more drastic for this case moreover there are significant number of cells with the volume fraction of φ 11 between 0 and 1 dark blue close to 1 and light blue close to 0 a part of water body φ 11 propagating to the right along the water surface is spread outside of the image more importantly there is some mass transport in the offshore direction after 20 wave periods which can be seen in fig 17 h 5 summary and conclusion in this paper an eulerian two phase vof method coupled with the cip based model is employed to numerically simulate the wave induced mass transport and the internal mixing processes the model validation is performed by representing the previous physical experiment the profiles of the eulerian mean current velocity and the lagrangian mass transport velocity are obtained by time averaging over 10 wave periods the stokes drift velocity profiles are determined using the principle of kinematic conservation of mass flux the computed eulerian mean current lagrangian mass transport velocity and the stokes mass transport velocity are compared with a theoretical solution and experimental data all the comparisons indicate that the employed model is capable of predicting the transport and mixing processes under propagating waves the effect of submerged breakwater on the mass transport and internal mixing under propagating waves are further investigated by comparing the results of the flat bottom flume the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow field are analyzed model results show that under regular waves propagating along the flat bottom flume there is no wave breaking tracking a water body under waves it is observed that the water mass occupying the upper part of the fluid moves in the direction of wave propagation the forward drift decreases for deeper layer until the point located approximately half of the water depth with reversing the direction below that point comparing different wave heights more significant mass transport and more intense deformation of water body are observed under higher wave height comparing different wave periods the deformation of water body becomes less significant with increasing the wave period for the flume with a submerged breakwater the instabilities are observed in the internal interface under wave propagation in the form of mixing of the internal water bodies for the energetic waves significant wave breaking is observed at the location of the breakwater which causes severe internal mixing furthermore as a results of wave breaking a portion of the water body moves in the negative direction of wave propagation near the water surface overall it is found that in the presence of the submerged breakwater no clear internal interface can be observed tracking a water body due to severe mixing of the internal water bodies and the flow field is very

type algorithm is applied to capture the free surface different from the original vof method a smoothed hyperbolic tangent heaviside function is used in the thinc scheme to ensure the density or viscosity vary smoothly in the thinc sw method the slope of the interface is adaptively scaled to a proper thickness according to the interface orientation which significantly improves the geometrical accuracy of the original thinc scheme the 1 d advection equation of the vof function φ is written in a conservation form as follows 22 φ t φ u φ u x eq 22 is discretized by a finite volume method for a known velocity u n integrating eq 22 over one computational cell x i 1 2 x i 1 2 and one time interval t n t n 1 obtains 23 φ i n 1 φ i n 1 δ x i g i 1 2 g i 1 2 δ t δ x i φ i n u i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n

the thickness of the jump in the interpolation function in the original thinc scheme a constant β 3 5 is usually used that may result in ruffling the interface which aligns nearly in the direction of

n x n y is the unit norm vector of the interface after calculating χ i the flux g i 1 2 at the cell boundary can be obtained then the cell integrated value can be calculated by eq 23 this cell integrated value is used to determine the free surface position therefore mass conservation is automatically satisfied for the liquid phase 
22317,in this study the wave induced mass transport and internal mixing under regular waves propagating in a flume are numerically investigated by a vof type volume of fluid method a two phase vof method based on a multi phase flow mathematical theory is implemented in a constraint interpolation profile cip based model to track the free surface and water water interface simultaneously under eulerian framework first the numerical validation is performed on stokes drift distribution under regular waves propagating in a flat bottom flume good grid convergence and mass conservation are verified the computed results show favorable agreement with theoretical solution and experimental data the regular waves propagating over a submerged breakwater are further investigated focusing on the mass transport and internal mixing in the long term evolution of flow field the mass transport and water exchange in the vicinity of breakwater are presented qualitatively a significant water mixing and broken interface are observed even if there is no regular waves breaking results indicate that the cip based model coupled with the two phase vof method can provide a different perspective to study wave induced mass transport and internal mixing in coastal zone keywords cip method internal wave maker vof method water water interface stokes drift internal mixing 1 introduction in ocean environment surface waves can be recorded by fixed eulerian probes or free floating lagrangian buoys in steep waves the differences between eulerian and lagrangian measurements can be very remarkable longuet higgins 1986 the differences are of considerable importance for progressive wave problems in the general ocean circulation which are referred to nonlinear wave induced stokes drift qiao et al 2010 the presence of stokes drift has a significant impact on the trajectories of suspended sediments as well as the mixing processes in oceans phillips 1977 henderson et al 2004 holmedal and myrhaug 2009 bever et al 2011 yu et al 2012 sulisz and paprota 2015 furthermore wave induced mass transport is greatly essential in estimating the transport of variable density solute plumes oil spill and plastic particles etc wang and shen 2010 drivdal et al 2014 guo et al 2014 liu and sheng 2014 thus a comprehensive understanding of wave induced mass transport mechanism and internal mixing is extremely important in coastal and offshore engineering there has been a wide study of mass transport in water waves gerstner 1809 first proposed trochoidal wave theory for periodic and permanent waves in infinite water depth this theory consists of the exact solutions required to express a possible form of gravity wave motion in the lagrangian system constantin 2001 and henry 2008 developed the gerstner s theory and indicated that the trajectory of water particle is described as circular orbit of which radius diminishes with water depth airy 1841 obtained the first order approximation solution of irrotational waves in the eulerian system he found that for small amplitude waves airy wave the surface profile and velocity motion are sinusoidal and the trajectory of water particle is circular in deep water and elliptic in intermediate water stokes 1847 first derived a irrotational second order solution for waves in finite water depth and a third order solution for waves in infinite water depth according to his theory the particle trajectory becomes an incomplete loop due to nonlinearity consequently free surface oscillations are accompanied by the progressive motion of water in the direction of wave propagation the velocity of the horizontal drift near the free surface is larger than that near the flume bottom wallet and ruellan 1950 took a series of photographs to study the trajectory motion in a wave flume in the case of pure progressive waves the trajectories are circular near the free surface and changed to be elliptic and finally flat when reaching the flume bottom in addition there are some open loops indicating that there is a slow drift in the wave propagating direction near the free surface and in the opposite direction near the flume bottom longuet higgins 1953 took the effect of viscosity into account and derived the formulas of the mass transport distribution for both irrotational and viscous fluid motion in a wave flume constantin 2006 and constantin and strauss 2010 solved a set of differential equations to investigate the particle path in a fixed eulerian system they estimated the stokes drift for random directional waves from satellite altimetry data and compared it with in situ buoy data huang 2007 experimentally investigated the lagrangian surface drift current induced by surface gravity waves in a wave flume using the particle tracking method wiegel and johnson 2010 used flow visualization technology and found that water particle velocity is greater in its forward movement under the wave crest than in its backward movement under the wave trough this results in mass transport in the direction of wave propagation huang et al 2011 carried out a series of experiments and studied the drift motion of small rigid floating objects driven by regular waves in deep water tamura et al 2012 studied the stokes drift and wave induced mass flux in the realistic wave fields and ocean currents using the third generation wave model paprota et al 2016 adopted the technique of particle image velocimetry piv and calculated the mass transport processes associated with propagating ocean waves later a theoretical model based on potential flow assumption was developed by paprota and sulisz 2018 to study the kinematics of water particles and mass transport of wave induced flow in a wave tank although achievements have been obtained by the previous studies most of them are based on physical experiment or theoretical analysis in terms of water particle velocity and trajectory the number of such numerical investigations is still limited and most of them only focused on the nonlinear wave shapes in the past few decades computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling has been an essential way in understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of flows in numerous industrial processes and academic research due to its advantages such as low cost and technical limitation scardovelli and zaleski 1999 glowinski et al 2001 colagrossi and landrini 2003 silva et al 2003 zhao and hu 2012 schmeeckle 2014 bayon et al 2018 there are two general categories in cfd models mesh free model and mesh based model for mesh free model the fluid is usually simulated by particles numerically the lagrangian description of the particles traces the trajectory of every particle making the study of air water and water water interface rather straightforward while there is no problem of interface tracing mesh free methods such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method monaghan 1994 colagrossi and landrini 2003 shao and lo 2003 xu and deng 2016 the moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 perez and garcia 2017 and the consistent particle method cpm koh et al 2012 luo et al 2016b have been widely applied in the numerical study of free surface and water water interface shao et al 2006 crespo et al 2008 khayyer and gotoh 2010 jian et al 2015 gong et al 2016 luo et al 2016a mesh based models use eulerian description to compute and capture free surface one of the most popular methods dealing with free surface motion is the vof method which captures free surface by the reconstruction of volume function in computational grids hirt and nichols 1981 xiao et al 2011 another widely used method is the level set method proposed by osher and sethian 1988 which implicitly determines the free surface by the zero contour of a signed distance function models based on these two methods have been widely applied in the studies of interfacial flow in addition to the free surface great results have also been obtained in the water water interface motion yasuda et al 1999 traced the water water interface under breaking waves by applying particle markers in eulerian grids and computing those particles in a lagrangian approach followed by this method lubin et al 2006 studied the water water interface in drop impact process however these models are usually complicated regarding the complex phenomena ye and zhao 2017 proposed a two liquid vof method based on the idea of original vof method by this method free surface and water water interface could be captured simultaneously in dam break flow relatively simple and with low computational cost the main objective of the present study is to numerically investigate wave induced mass transport internal flow and mixing processes under weakly nonlinear waves propagating in a wave tank the two liquid vof method proposed by ye and zhao 2017 is employed to trace both free surface and water water interface under the eulerian framework the cip based model coupled with the two liquid vof method is validated using the experimental data of paprota et al 2016 the mass transport and internal mixing under regular waves and interaction with a submerged breakwater are studied the outline of this paper is organized as follows model details including numerical procedures and implementations are presented in section 2 the model validation is presented in section 3 section 4 presents investigations of the mass transport and internal mixing during regular wave propagating over a submerged breakwater discussing the variation of water water interface and internal mixing in a long term evolution finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 numerical model and implementations 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for two dimensional incompressible viscous fluid flow are mass conservation and navier stokes equations expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i s i n a b u i where x i i 1 2 are the coordinates in a cartesian coordinate system u i i 1 2 are the velocity components t is time ρ is the fluid density μ is the dynamic viscosity p is the pressure g i are the body forces for example gravity s i n is momentum source function and a b is damping term coefficient the wave structure interaction is treated as a multi phase problem that includes water air and solid body a volume fraction field φ m m 1 2 and 3 indicate water air and solid respectively is adopted to represent and capture the phase interface firstly we treat liquid phase and solid phase as one phase φ 1 3 the governing equation for the water and body is as follows 3 φ 1 3 t u i φ 1 3 x i 0 where φ 1 3 φ 1 φ 3 φ 11 φ 12 φ 3 the value of the liquid and solid phase φ 1 3 is calculated by vof method the volume function for solid φ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a fixed rigid body is assumed the value of whole liquid phase φ 1 is obtained by the relationship φ 1 3 φ 1 φ 3 the volume function for air φ 2 is determined by φ 2 1 φ 1 φ 3 after the volume function is calculated the physical property λ such as the density ρ and viscosity μ in every grid can be defined as 4 λ m 1 3 φ m λ m 2 2 two liquid vof method during the past decades models based on vof method have been widely used to simulate free surface motion the vof method proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 is a methodology which deals with free boundaries within eulerian formulation it has been proved to be a powerful tool to deal with violent free surface flows traditional vof function can be expressed as 5 φ m t u φ m 0 where φ m indicates the volume function m 1 2 and 3 indicate water air and solid respectively by solving eq 5 the free surface of liquid phase can be constructed however this one liquid phase method does not have the ability of solving the inner interface and water mass exchange inside the liquid phase because the liquid phase has only one corresponding volume fraction function φ 1 in the entire calculation domain in order to capture both the free surface and water water interface under eulerian grids a two liquid vof method was proposed by ye and zhao 2017 to construct the interface between different liquid phases with same physical property except the whole liquid volume function φ 1 two additional volume fraction functions φ 11 and φ 12 are used to represent the water bodies at different initial positions the sketch of the two phase vof model in initial condition is shown in fig 1 here φ 11 and φ 12 satisfy the relationship 6 φ 1 i j φ 11 i j φ 12 i j which means the summation of sub liquid phases equals to the total volume of liquid phase the evolution of volume functions φ 11 and φ 12 can be described as 7 φ 11 t u φ 11 0 8 φ 12 t u φ 12 0 the total volume function can be obtained by the relationship in eq 5 and the two sub liquid phases can be solved by eq 7 and eq 8 respectively in this way both the air water interface and the water water interface can be constructed during the reconstruction process in two liquid vof method the total volume in each computational grid cell may be greater than 1 0 when taking summation of φ 11 and φ 12 this problem will cause error in multi phase computing in order to correct the volume function an intermediate step is taken at water water interface instead of the direct implementation of vof method shown as 9 φ 1 i j φ 1 i j 10 φ 11 i j φ 11 i j 1 2 φ 1 i j φ 11 i j φ 12 i j 11 φ 12 i j φ 12 i j 1 2 φ 1 i j φ 11 i j φ 12 i j where indicates another intermediate value finally the value of the total volume function is updated by taking summation of two liquid phases 12 φ 1 i j n 1 φ 11 i j n 1 φ 12 i j n 1 there are various schemes for vof method with different reconstruction processes hirt and nichols 1981 youngs 1982 harvie and fletcher 2001 aulisa et al 2003 xiao et al 2005 cervone et al 2009 xiao et al 2011 compared with other vof methods the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with slope weighting scheme thinc sw proposed by xiao et al 2011 uses a smoothed heaviside function with a variable steepness parameter which can keep the sharpness of interface and significantly improve the geometrical accuracy in this study the interface is calculated by the thinc sw scheme see the discussion in appendix 2 3 momentum source wave maker in this paper the momentum source function is adopted to generate waves which can avoid the re reflection wave from the structure according to choi and yoon 2009 ha et al 2013 liu et al 2015 the momentum source functions for the 2d linear monochromatic regular wave can be expressed as 13 s n g 2 β x exp β x 2 d ω sin ω t where the origin of x is in the middle of the source region d is the source function amplitude which can be determined from the desired wave characteristics β is the parameter associated with the width of source function and can be determined by the width of source w 2 5 β ω is the wave frequency to avoid a jerk of the initial fluid motion that may induce numerical instability a ramp function f t is introduced to the source function shown as 14 f t 3 t t r 4 8 t t r 3 6 t t r 2 t t r 1 t t r where t r is three times of wave period 2 4 wave absorbing method the numerical sponge layer proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 is employed in this study to prevent the undesirable secondary wave reflections the efficiently absorbing coefficient a b is adopted from wei and kirby 1995 it has been proved to be very powerful by many studies lin and liu 2004 liu et al 2015 shown in the following equation 15 a b c α exp x x s t x a b n c 1 exp 1 1 where a b is absorbing coefficient x s t and x a b are the starting position and length of the absorbing region respectively c α and n c are empirical damping coefficients determined via numerical test the damping coefficient must be defined inside the sponge layer and it is zero outside the sponge layer lin and liu 2004 used the empirical coefficients n c 10 and c α 200 in their study which works very well in the rans based model in this study n c 10 and c α min 200 0 9 δ t are adopted where δ t is computational time step 2 5 numerical implementations in this study a staggered grid system is used for the spatial discretization a fractional method is applied to solve navier stokes equations by three calculation steps corresponding to determination of the advection term the non advection term i and the non advection term ii the first step is to solve the adevection term as eq 16 shows 16 u i t u j u i x j 0 a cip approach which is a third order finite difference scheme is employed to solve the above equations yabe et al 2001 the basic principle of cip method is an interpolation in a grid by a cubic polynomial with the value and differential on the grid node 17 u i x x i u i δ t where x is the unknown coefficient function x i is the cubic polynomial to approximate the spatial profile of u i in an upwind cell the superscript denotes the intermediate time level after the advection step the second step is to solve the diffusion term momentum source term and damping term by a central difference scheme 18 u i u i δ t 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i s i n a b u i where u i is the solution of this diffusion term in the end the pressure term is solved by the projection method 19 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p n 1 x i 20 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u x i where the superscript n 1 denotes the new time step the red black successive over relaxation approach sor is employed to solve the above poisson equation after the total flow field is updated the φ 11 φ 12 and φ 1 are solved by a volume of fluid vof type method thinc sw scheme the solid phase φ 3 is treated by an immersed boundary method ibm proposed by peskin 1972 more details about the flow solver can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 ye and zhao 2017 and li et al 2018 3 model validations in this section the ability of the present model to simulate the mass transfer and flow field under nonlinear wave propagating is validated using the experimental data of paprota et al 2016 numerical results are also compared with available theoretical solutions the experiment was conducted in the wave flume located in institute of hydro engineering polish academy of sciences paprota et al 2016 the flume was 64 m long and 0 6 m wide with a still water depth h of 0 25 m the wave gauge g1 was installed 4 m away from the wave maker to record the elevation of free surface the particle image velocimetry piv measurement technology was employed to calculate particle trajectory and mass transport velocity the wave characteristics of the test cases are given in table 1 the set up of the numerical domain corresponding to the experiment is shown in fig 2 two velocity meters marked as v1 and v2 located 0 1 m and 0 2 m below the still water level respectively are set to detect the velocity variation the water body in the horizontal range from x 5 6 m is marked as liquid 1 φ 11 in eq 6 and the rest of the water body is marked as liquid 2 φ 12 in eq 7 numerical experiments are initially carried out to show the convergence of the spatial discretization three non uniform grids are used in the simulation the grid details are listed in table 2 case 1 in table 2 is chosen to carry out the test fig 3 depicts the free surface time history at g1 for three different grids it can be seen that the computed results obtained using the fine and medium grid sizes are almost on top of each other however for the coarse grid there is a slight phase shift furthermore mass conservation in each phase is tested for different grid sizes the error of mass conservation is defined as 21 e r r o r i j φ i j n δ x δ y i j φ i j 0 δ x δ y φ i j 0 δ x δ y where i j φ i j 0 δ x δ y is the initial total volume of the domain the mass conservation error in each phase after a long term simulation is also shown in table 2 modeled results show that using finer grid size results in smaller error it is worth noticing that for all grid sizes mass conservation error is in the order of 10 5 which proves a good accuracy of the proposed method regarding mass conservation overall the mesh convergence is achieved using the medium grid similar tests for different time steps t 200 t 500 and t 1000 are performed but not included here in brief it indicates that using the time step δ t t 500 is sufficient fig 4 shows the elevation of free surface at gauge g1 for three cases from fig 4 the initial wave amplitude growth is smooth due to the ramp function during a relatively long propagating process the free surface at the g1 remains quasi steady according to the second order stokes theory le méhauté 1969 all the simulated waves are regarded as weakly nonlinear the amplitude of the second order harmonic wave component constitutes 5 7 5 and 8 5 of the primary waves for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively good agreements are obtained by comparing the simulated results with the second order stokes theoretical solution in fig 4 figs 5 7 show the modeled time series of horizontal and vertical velocities at v1 and v2 compared with the measurements by paprota et al 2016 the variation of velocity field at v1 and v2 remains quasi steady the nonlinear velocity oscillations can be seen in fig 7 which corresponds to the case with the longest wave period t 1 5s the time series of horizontal velocity at v1 and v2 are very close to each other while the time series of vertical velocity at v2 is significantly smaller than v1 overall the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements figs 8 10 show computed mass transport velocity profiles compared with the theoretical second order irrotational solution hudspeth and sulisz 1991 and experimental measurements by paprota et al 2016 for all simulated cases the mass transport velocity profiles shown in figs 8 10 are obtained by averaging over 10 wave periods the time averaged lagrangian mass transport velocity u l is calculated by the averaged horizontal displacement of the right interface between liquid 1 and liquid 2 the profiles of eulerian mean current velocity are obtained by averaging horizontal velocity components at fixed points using the principle of mass flux conservation the stokes mass transport velocity profile under propagating waves is obtained by subtracting the eulerian mean current from the lagrangian mass transport velocity hudspeth and sulisz 1991 monismith et al 2007 figs 8 a 9 a and 10 a show the time averaged lagrangian mass transport velocity profiles it can be seen that the displacement of water particles at the upper part of the water column is in the same direction of wave propagation the magnitude trends decreasing along water depth until to the point located approximately half of the water depth after that the direction of drift is changed the eulerian mean current velocity profiles are shown in figs 8 b 9 b and 10 b from these figures it can be seen that the computed results of eulerian mean current velocity are consistent with the theoretical solution except the little difference near the water surface the stokes drift velocity profiles for simulated waves are presented in figs 8 c 9 c and 10 c overall good agreements are observed between model prediction theoretical solution and measurements the depth averaged stokes drift velocity obtained by multiplying the second power of the ratio of the wave height to water depth is shown in fig 11 two numerical methods are employed to get the results one mass is obtained by the mass change of liquid 2 see blue triangles in fig 11 other averaged velocity is obtained by averaging the vertical stokes mass transport velocity shown in figs 8 c 9 c and 10 c see black squares in fig 11 results obtained by the two mentioned methods are very close to each other and are in good agreements with the theoretical solution and experiments which confirms the accuracy of the two liquid vof method in simulating the mass transfer and inside flow 4 results and discussion in this section the mass transport and internal mixing process under regular waves propagating over a submerged breakwater are studied by the two liquid vof method a physical model by liu et al 2019 used for studying the wave structure interaction is numerically represented the physical experiments were conducted in a glass wall wave flume at ocean college zhejiang university china liu et al 2019 the flume was 75 m long 1 8 m wide and 2 m high a trapezoid submerged breakwater 1 8 m wide 3 08 m long and 0 36 m high was installed 32 m away from the wave maker six wave gauges g1 g6 were placed along the central line to monitor the water wave profiles in this paper a constant water depth h 0 0 5 m is used in all numerical tests which is corresponding to the experiment four cases with different wave heights and periods are simulated for detailed analysis see table 3 to save some computational effort a short domain links length is used in the model the sketch of numerical computational domain corresponding to the experimental set up is shown in fig 12 to investigate the effect of submerged breakwater in the flow field two different set ups which are in the flat bottom flume and in the flume with a submerged breakwater are carried out respectively the initial layouts of the two models are shown in fig 13 a and b the horizontal solid line is the still water level the water body with blue color is marked as φ 11 and the rest of water body is marked as φ 12 in fig 13 a for the cases without a submerged breakwater the vertical distribution of φ 11 extends from surface to the flume bottom in fig 13 b for the cases with a submerged breakwater the initial distribution of φ 11 in vertical direction ranges from still water surface to the top of the submerged breakwater 4 1 mass transport under regular waves in the flat bottom flume prior to the simulation of waves propagating over a submerged breakwater the flat bottom flume subjected to weakly nonlinear propagating waves are tested and studied in this part fig 14 shows the variation of φ 11 marked in blue color after 10 wave periods and 20 periods for all mentioned cases from fig 14 it can be seen that there is no wave breaking for the cases in the flat bottom flume the displacement of water body φ 11 is in the right side direction the drift near the water surface is largest with a decreasing trend for deeper water until the point located approximately half of the water depth with reversing the direction below that point comparing the water body φ 11 corresponding to the instants after 10 and 20 wave periods it can be seen that the drift accumulates under the successive waves the reason may be due to the conservation of the water mass in the flume if the water particles in a certain vertical column are transported in one direction the water level on the two sides of this column will be unbalanced this unbalanced water level will cause the non hydrodynamic pressure which is opposite to the wave propagation direction the trajectory of water particle is determined by wave driving force and pressure gradient force in the vicinity of wave surface the wave driving force is greater than the pressure gradient force so the water body is transported in the direction of wave propagation the effect of wave driving force decreases from the free surface to the flume bottom when the wave driving force is equal to pressure gradient force there is no mass transfer in this depth after the position of equilibrium force the wave driving force is smaller than the pressure gradient force and the water body produces a reverse transfer regarding case 1 fig 14 a and b the effect of non linearity on the deformation of water body φ 11 is weak due to the small wave height during the wave propagation the amount of mass transport is insignificant as the wave height increases the effect of wave driving force becomes larger more significant mass transport and more severe deformation of the water body are observed for case 2 fig 14 c and d comparing different wave periods the internal interface for cases with longer wave periods shown in fig 14 e h is relatively uniform over depth from free surface to the flume bottom insignificant deformation of the water body is observed the reason may be due to that the regular wave with long period has long wavelength so the wave driving force on water particles is relatively uniform over depth while for the regular wave with small period the wave driving force decreases sharply as the depth increases for the weak effect of wave driving force the wave driving force has almost no effect and the motion of water particles is mainly dominated by the non hydrodynamic pressure force near the flume bottom as a result the internal interface is titled observably which can also be found the similar trends in figs 9 a and fig 10 a due to the unbroken internal interface the quantitative analysis in terms of mass transportation under different wave conditions are carried out fig 15 shows the displacement of water body φ 11 case 1 and case 2 correspond to same wave lengths but different wave heights it can be seen that for the case with larger wave height case 2 the amount of mass transport is more significant compared to the small wave height case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 correspond to same wave heights but different wave lengths compared to the cases with larger wave lengths case 3 and case 4 the amount of mass transport is slightly larger for the case with shorter wave length case 2 4 2 mass transport under regular waves in the flume with a submerged breakwater in this part the free surface and flow field under nonlinear waves propagating over a submerged breakwater are analyzed numerically fig 16 shows the time series of free surface elevation corresponding to case 2 see table 3 during waves propagating over the submerged breakwater it can be seen that when the incident waves propagate over the seaside slope of the breakwater the wave non linearity becomes more significant as the wave height and steepness increase slightly at g2 due to the effect of wave shoaling furthermore the degree of non linearity increases as the waves propagate over the submerged breakwater which can be observed at g3 and g4 at the lee side of the breakwater g5 and g6 the wave energy is redistributed high order harmonic wave gains energy from the incoming wave and develops significantly causing extremely asymmetric waveform in fig 16 the computed results are also compared with the previous experimental data liu et al 2019 it can be seen that a good agreement with the measurements is obtained by the present model simulation except for small deviation at the peak instants in g6 where the harmonic effect becomes stronger fig 17 shows the fluid phases after 10 periods and 20 periods for all the simulated wave cases in the flume with a submerged breakwater in case 1 which is the case with the lowest wave height and wave period fig 17 a and b the tracked water body φ 11 is transported in the direction of wave propagation due to wave non linearity in this case there is a cumulative trend of transport under the successive propagating waves as the water body is further transported after 20 wave periods furthermore both left and right interfaces are not smooth which is due to the presence of the submerged breakwater compared with the flat bottom flume fig 14 a and b fig 17 c and d show the phases corresponding to the case 2 with higher wave height and the same wave period compared with the case 1 similar to the case 1 there is a cumulative trend of mass transport under successive propagating waves furthermore the rate of mass transport for the case 2 is larger than that in case 1 it is also seen that the interface irregularities are more significant for the case 2 interestingly after 20 wave periods the displacement is more significant near the water surface forming a tail shape at the lee side of the breakwater which is accompanied by transport of the phase φ 12 from the sea side to the top of the breakwater in a similar shape fig 17 e and f correspond to case 3 with the same wave height and the higher wave period compared with the case 2 it can be seen that the internal mixing between φ 11 and φ 12 is developed in this case furthermore after 20 wave periods no clear internal interface can be observed fig 17 g and h show the visual results of case 4 which is the case with the highest wave period and the same wave height as case 2 and case 3 it can be seen that the internal mixing is more drastic for this case moreover there are significant number of cells with the volume fraction of φ 11 between 0 and 1 dark blue close to 1 and light blue close to 0 a part of water body φ 11 propagating to the right along the water surface is spread outside of the image more importantly there is some mass transport in the offshore direction after 20 wave periods which can be seen in fig 17 h 5 summary and conclusion in this paper an eulerian two phase vof method coupled with the cip based model is employed to numerically simulate the wave induced mass transport and the internal mixing processes the model validation is performed by representing the previous physical experiment the profiles of the eulerian mean current velocity and the lagrangian mass transport velocity are obtained by time averaging over 10 wave periods the stokes drift velocity profiles are determined using the principle of kinematic conservation of mass flux the computed eulerian mean current lagrangian mass transport velocity and the stokes mass transport velocity are compared with a theoretical solution and experimental data all the comparisons indicate that the employed model is capable of predicting the transport and mixing processes under propagating waves the effect of submerged breakwater on the mass transport and internal mixing under propagating waves are further investigated by comparing the results of the flat bottom flume the hydrodynamic characteristics of flow field are analyzed model results show that under regular waves propagating along the flat bottom flume there is no wave breaking tracking a water body under waves it is observed that the water mass occupying the upper part of the fluid moves in the direction of wave propagation the forward drift decreases for deeper layer until the point located approximately half of the water depth with reversing the direction below that point comparing different wave heights more significant mass transport and more intense deformation of water body are observed under higher wave height comparing different wave periods the deformation of water body becomes less significant with increasing the wave period for the flume with a submerged breakwater the instabilities are observed in the internal interface under wave propagation in the form of mixing of the internal water bodies for the energetic waves significant wave breaking is observed at the location of the breakwater which causes severe internal mixing furthermore as a results of wave breaking a portion of the water body moves in the negative direction of wave propagation near the water surface overall it is found that in the presence of the submerged breakwater no clear internal interface can be observed tracking a water body due to severe mixing of the internal water bodies and the flow field is very

type algorithm is applied to capture the free surface different from the original vof method a smoothed hyperbolic tangent heaviside function is used in the thinc scheme to ensure the density or viscosity vary smoothly in the thinc sw method the slope of the interface is adaptively scaled to a proper thickness according to the interface orientation which significantly improves the geometrical

the thickness of the jump in the interpolation function in the original thinc scheme a constant β 3 5 is usually used that may result in ruffling the interface which aligns nearly in the direction of

n x n y is the unit norm vector of the interface after calculating χ i the flux g i 1 2 at the cell boundary can be obtained then the cell integrated value can be calculated by eq 23 this cell integrated value is used to determine the free surface position therefore mass conservation is automatically satisfied for the liquid phase

interfacial flows for purpose of improving the mass conservation of ls method li et al 2012 a multiple marker clsvof method that each droplet has its own locally defined marker functions is adopted by kwakkel et al 2013 to prevent the problem of numerical coalescence in conventional clsvof method when two droplet interfaces are less than one grid cell apart from each other son et al son and hur 2002 developed a complete and efficient interface reconstruction algorithm on the basis of the explicit relationship between the interface configuration and the fluid volume function ih which a cubic interpolated propagation cip scheme is combined with the clsvof method in order to calculate the advection terms of the momentum equation accurately sussman et al sussman and elbridge 2000 recommended the use of a clsvof method in which the curvature obtained by determining the finite differences of the level set function which in turn derived from the ls and vof functions the clsvof method was also performed to numerically simulate interfacial flows in ship hydrodynamics in which a geometric algorithm used to re distance the ls function on the strength of the reconstructed interface in which the interface jump conditions were handled via ghost fluid methodology wang et al 2012 in this research the clsvof based numerical solver was developed and verified in detail through solving the rayleigh taylor instability rti dambreak and solitary wave propagation problems the main goal of the present research is to develop an accurate and reliable in house numerical solver to deal with strong nonlinear interface deformation the rest of this article is organized as follows in section 2 governing equations and numerical approaching are presented for the two fluids and clsvof method the rayleigh taylor instability problem is suitable to carry out mesh convergence analysis and mass conversation analysis since its interface is relatively simple in the initial state but will become very complex by time in section 3 numerical verification was carried out by using a single mode rti problem to prove the accuracy of the numerical solver meantime more numerical investigation were carried with effection under different surface tension viscosity ratios and density ratios in section 4 mass conversation analysis was carried out by using a complicated three mode rti problem to further prove the accuracy of clsvof method dambreak is a benchmark problem in ocean and coastal engineering hydrodynamics it is suitable for testing under the high density difference situation section 5 presents a dambreak case to show the ability of developed clsvof solver on handling the large density difference case of two phase flow the shape maintenance of wave profile propagation in a water channel during numerical simulation is commonly existed in ocean engineering application section 6 presents a solitary wave propagation case to test the ability of developed clsvof solver on dealing with wave profile evolution section 7 presents the conclusion 2 mathematical model among this research the heavy and light liquid phases are modeled by means of n s equations with variable physical properties and the influence of surface tension at the interface between two fluid phases is entered in consideration as well both phases are supposed immiscible and incompressible to govern this problem the governing equations that are the continuity equations are listed below 1 v 0 and momentum equation is 2 ρ α v t v v p ρ α g μ α v v t σ k δ α where v u v represents the velocity vector p represents the pressure g represents the gravitational acceleration and t represents the time the influence of surface tension σ is incorporated into the momentum equation δ the interface delta function is given by 3 δ 0 ϕ ε 1 2 ε 1 c o s π ϕ ε ϕ ε and in eq 2 α represents the smoothed void fraction field which is defined through a heaviside function h ε ϕ as chakraborty et al 2013 sussman and elbridge 2000 4 α h ε ϕ 1 ϕ ε 1 2 ϕ 2 ε 1 2 π s i n π ϕ ε ϕ ε 0 ϕ ε where ϕ in this equation symbolizes the ls function which is maintained as the signed distance function from the interface herein ϕ is zero at the interface and has positive values in the heavy fluid region and negative values in the light fluid region 2 ε represents the interface thickness right here which the fluid properties are interpolated the present simulations were performed by the use of ε 1 5 δ a where δ a is the size of the computational cell as shown in ref chakraborty et al 2013 detailedly from α the density ρ α and viscosity μ α can be expressed as 5 ρ α ρ l α ρ h 1 α 6 μ α μ l α μ h 1 α where the subscript l and h symbolize the light fluid and the heavy fluid respectively the local curvature k of the interface is computed as 7 k ϕ ϕ the clsvof method is used to handle interface deformation between two immiscible fluids by time within the clsvof method the advection for the liquid volume fraction α and the ls function ϕ are 8 α t v α 0 9 ϕ t v ϕ 0 respectively among the clsvof method in order to make ϕ and α advected the governing equations of the level set function ϕ and the volume fraction α are come to a solution from t n to t n 1 after that this research adopted interface reconstruction to confirm that the predicted interfaces from ϕ and α are close to each other through the use of 10 ζ 2 α n 1 1 therefore as it presented in the reconstruction procedure isoline ζ 0 of intermediate function ζ symbolizes that the position of the interface is in accordance with that indicated by α n 1 1 2 after that 11 ζ τ s ζ 0 1 ζ is solved until ζ reaches a steady state solution at the interface which is exactly the value of ζ at the interface and s is a smoothed out sign function next another intermediate ls function 12 ϕ n 1 ζ n 1 if φ n 1 ε ϕ n 1 otherwise is constructed to confirm that ϕ n 1 and α n 1 represent the same interface position in the end this research needs to solve 13 ϕ n 1 τ s ϕ 0 n 1 1 ϕ n 1 λ δ ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 where the discontinuity at ϕ n 1 ε would be eliminated until reaching to a steady state solution ϕ n 1 with regard to ls part the fifth order weighted essentially non oscillatory weno5 scheme is applied to solve the evolution equation and the re initialization equation jiang and shu 1996 and the third order total variation diminishing runge kutta tvd rk3 scheme is adopted for time advancement shu 1988 for purpose of handling the interface reconstruction the combined tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc xiao et al 2005 and the weighted linear interface calculation wlic scheme yokoi 2007 is adopted in vof part moreover the projection method is employed to handle n s equations gu et al 2018 the discretized equations are solved on a fixed staggered grid with scalars p ϕ and α located at the cell centers and velocity components v at the center of the cell faces the time step that satisfies courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition can be chosen to confirm the stability of the solution in order to handle the above tridiagonal and sparse pressure matrix a point based successive over relaxation psor method is introduced the convergence tolerance ε 10 4 is used for the solutions calculated from two consecutive iterations of pressure possion equation and the second order adams bashforth scheme is used for time advancement the second order upwinding scheme is applied to solve the convective terms in n s equation on the other hand a second order central difference scheme is employed to handle the diffusion terms in n s equation a second order accuracy in both space and time o δ x 2 δ t 2 can be guaranteed through the above methods which is of great importance in capturing free interfaces a more detailed description of the numerical method are provided in li et al 2019 3 numerical verification by one mode rayleigh taylor instability problem in this section a single mode rti problem is adopted to justify the accuracy of clsvof solver the rti problem occurs when the fluid with big density is above the fluid with small density which is a kind of interfacial instability caused by gravity rti principally rest with the density and gravitational acceleration of the two fluids the instability will be greater with the increase of the gravitational acceleration rti between the interface would not exist if there is no gravity rti is not merely of scientific significance it also has practical value and wide applications wang and zhao 2018 khater et al 2001 2003 2006 in consequence all this makes this problem become an important fundamental problem in the study of the stability of fluid fluid interface the properties of the rti such as the time varying complexity of interface deformation are also appropriate for numerical verification of various interface capture methods chen et al 2014 rahmat et al 2014 aniszewski et al 2014 lee and kim 2013 guo et al 2018 3 1 parameter setting in numerical simulations fig 1 is a schematic diagram of the adopted single mode rti problem in which the height of the numerical region is h 2 m and the width is l 1 m the initial shape of the interface between two fluids is y 1 0 15 sin 2 π x the densities of the upper fluid and the lower fluid are ρ h 1 8 and ρ l 1 0 and the gravitational acceleration is g 1 the dynamic viscosity coefficients of the two fluids are equal as μ h μ l 0 0025 atwood number defined as a t ρ h ρ l ρ h ρ l 2 7 is used to represent the density difference of two fluids all boundaries are set as rigid non slip wall conditions i e u v 0 initially the system is in a static state then under the action of gravity the heavy fluid in the upper layer begins to move downward while the light fluid in the lower layer moves upward the computational domain is subdivided into a mesh of fixed rectangular cells by using cartesian coordinates 3 2 mesh convergence study in order to verify the accuracy of developed high order clsvof method for rti problem a mesh convergence study is presented here in which the different mesh configurations including cell scale for δ x and δ y 0 02 0 01 0 005 0 0025 are calculated respectively for more detailed comparison numerical simulation of ls and vof with the same mesh configurations are also carried out and the results are shown in fig 2 to fig 4 in figs 2 4 the different colors represent numerical results with different mesh configurations in fig 2 it can be observed that coarse grid with δ x δ y 0 02 gives bad result by ls method as the mesh becomes finer although the flow profile appears almost the same but the details of interface become much better the interface is sharp and the local details are fine similar result can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 except the results of the roughest grid for vof and clsvof are obviously more better than that of the level set result fig 5 shows the interface comparison between different grid scale for three different methods within fig 5 for different grid scales the color of lines is the same as that of contour in figs 2 4 it can be observed in fig 5 that as the mesh becomes finer the numerical results becomes converge gradually for all three methods for the finest mesh all three methods give nearly the same results however it also can be observed that clsvof can achieve near convergence result with a minimum number of grids which also means the interface capturing ability of clsvof is better than level set and vof it also can be seen from fig 5 as the resolution increases the interface becomes smoother and finer and the detail of the fluid field is increases but this change is not obvious fig 6 shows the respective numerical results of referenced literatures it can be seen that various simulation results regarding the overall fluid structure of the interface are similar it is noted that although numerical results of this research are same as those of ls and sph but the simulated details are quite different the interface of particle method is obviously not sharp enough as it can be see from fig 6 the result of fig 6 c with sph method is significantly different from others fig 6 b also uses sph method but the result is very similar with those of fig 6 a and fig 6 d overall the result of fig 6 b should be more accurate than that of fig 6 c however there has an irregular jump at the interface due to numerical instability in fig 6 b which is not observed in fig 6 a and our results through carefully observing the numerical result of fig 6 d we can also notice the small irregular jump at the interface therefore when solving rti problems the eulerian based method is more accurate than the particle method to a certain degree our result is most similar with fig 6 a fig 7 shows the variation of the penetration depth of the two fluids with time obtained by ls vof and clsvof respectively with δ x δ y 0 0025 all three methods gave almost the same results from fig 7 it can be seen that the distance between the two fluids from the midpoint almost synchronously increases at the initial stage t i m e 1 s after time 1s the velocity of the downward motion of the heavy fluids is obviously faster than that of the upward motion of the light fluids the two fluids are very close to the top and bottom wall at time 6s according to lewis s experiment and layzer s theory the penetration depth caused by rayleigh taylor instability increases exponentially with time at the initial stage without considering the influence of the wall and then increases uniformly with time after stabilization in fig 7 when the penetration depth is less than 0 3 it is about the exponential increasing stage and when the penetration depth between 0 3 and 0 8 it is around the uniform increasing stage therefore the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results and theoretical results when the penetration depth is greater than 0 8 the deceleration stage begins due to the influence of the wall 3 3 vortex variation fig 8 shows the structure of vortices in the flow field as can be seen from fig 8 at the beginning the simple shape of the vortex gradually becomes complex and the vortex structure almost follows the shape of the interface which represents in yellow line as time goes on vortex changing becomes more and more complex and the number of small vortices increases due to the fluid motion which affect the fluid motion in turn in fig 8 a at the initial stage on the left half side the upper fluid moves downward while the lower fluid on the right half side moves upward that forming a large counter clockwise vortex in the meanwhile two small clockwise vortices are formed near the left and right boundaries in fig 8 b previous vortices continue to increase and new small scale vortices appeared on the left and right walls the whole vortex structure in the flow field was symmetrically formed in fig 8 c except previous vortices continue to increase the clockwise vortices on both sides of the region begin to merge the center of the three biggest vortices is almost in the same straight line in fig 8 d new vortices appear on the upper and lower walls from which we can see that the new vortices are not symmetrical due to the different penetration depths of heavy fluid and light fluid respectively in fig 8 e in the middle of two large clockwise vortices two small counterclockwise vortices appears but their structures are not symmetrical three counter clockwise vortices on the middle left boundary and the lower boundary begin to merge in fig 8 f the structure of the vortex is becoming more and more complex but the scale of the vortex is no longer larger than before in fig 8g and h under the shearing stress action fluid motion at the bottom results in kelvin helmholtz instability which forms some small scale counter clockwise vortices large vortex structures begin to decompose into many smaller vortices during the simulation it also can be seen that the largest vortex structures are contained in the mushroom structure of the interface 3 4 effect of surface tension viscosity coefficient ratio and density ratio in this section the effects of surface tension density ratio and viscosity ratio on rti problem are investigated using clsvof based numerical solver the adopted one mode case is still used in this section since its advantage of shape boundary and relatively not easy to break this makes it easier to separate the effects of surface tension viscosity ratio and density ratio as previous all boundaries are set as rigid non slip solid wall conditions i e u v 0 and the computational domain is discreted by the mesh configuration with δ x δ y 0 0025 fig 9 shows numerical results without surface tension effect and with different w e number conditions it can be clearly seen that w e number would affect flow field greatly especially when its value is relatively small since big w e number represents small surface tension w e number mainly affects the shape of the interface between heavy fluid and light fluid it can be seen that the formed mushroom shapes by heavy fluid penetrating into light fluid or light fluid penetrating into heavy fluid are very similar under the influence of each w e the increase in surface tension has an inhibitory effect on the mutual penetration between heavy and light fluids however the penetration depth was not affected too much for all w e number this is owing to the w e number represents the relationship between the inertial force and the surface tension the inertial force is predominant on account of the setting of this case therefore the change of the w e number does not have much impact on the penetration depth in a certain range fig 10 shows numerical results with different viscosity coefficient ratio it can be clearly seen that viscosity coefficient ratio has very small effect on the flow field during the simulation either penetration depth or interface shape is may due to the fact that at the current setting the viscosity ratio has less influence on the inertial force of the heavy and light fluids under the current acceleration and the calculation time is short it can be predicted that as the calculation time increases the large viscosity ratio will increase the velocity gradient between the interfaces thereby affecting the stability of the interface and then induce kelvin helmholtz instability numerical results with different density ratio have been shown in fig 11 we can see that the density ratio has a great influence on the flow field with the increase of the density ratio the irregularity and complexity of flow field increase faster and the penetration depth also increases this is due to as the density ratio increases the inertial force of the heavy fluid at the current gravitational acceleration increases as well and the relative difference of inertial force between the heavy fluid and the light fluid increases too hence the increase in the density ratio will not only enhance the interpenetration between light and heavy fluids but also has a significant impact on the shape of the interface 4 mass conservation analysis by three mode rti problem a three mode rti problem is used here to analyze the mass conservation with the goal of further ensuring numerical accuracy fig 12 is a schematic diagram of the adopted three mode rti problem in which the height of the numerical region is also h 2 m and the width is l 1 m as previous but the initial shape of the interface between two fluids is y 1 0 05 sin 6 π x the densities of the upper fluid and lower fluid are ρ ω 3 0 and ρ α 1 0 and the gravitational acceleration is g 1 so atwood number is replaced by a t ρ ω ρ α ρ ω ρ α 1 2 now the dynamic viscosity coefficients are equal as μ ω μ α 0 0025 and the boundary conditions and mesh configurations used in the simulation are the same as previous figs 13 16 shows numerical results at different time for ls vof and clsvof respectively the sub fig d in figs 13 16 indicates the interface comparison between three methods where the blue line belongs to ls the red line and the black line belong to vof and clsvof respectively as time goes on the two fluids gradually mix together and the shape of the interface become more and more irregular it can be seen that the formed mushroom shapes by heavy fluid penetrating into light fluid or light fluid penetrating into heavy fluid are very different under such setting at the initial stage three methods obtain almost identical result in fig 13 nevertheless in fig 14 a little difference becomes visible over time such difference mainly occurs in areas where heavy fluid penetrate into light fluid from fig 15 such difference becomes more and more obvious but the main difference just exists between ls and vof or ls and clsvof the difference between vof and clsvof is not obvious from fig 16 the difference between ls and vof or ls and clsvof is becoming very serious to quantity the ability of mass conservation of these method the mass error m e r r o r is defined as follows 14 m e r r o r m t m 0 m 0 100 where m t ω c t d ω is the mass during the computation and m 0 ω c 0 d ω is the mass at the beginning of the computation the mass errors of the three mode rti problem incurred by using the ls vof and clsvof methods during the simulation are presented in fig 17 from which it can be seen that the clsvof and vof methods give very good results in terms of mass conservation in contrast the ls method gives a relatively poor result in that it suddenly drops down around t i m e 2 50 s while it is also the moment when the interface differences appeared as shown in fig 15 the reason for the above results is that the clsvof method is executed using conservative equations that reduce mass conservation errors while retaining the accuracy of interface normal vector from the ls part even in very complicated phenomena in order to obtain a sharp interface a mass loss of 0 005 is obtained for both vof and clsvof method as shown in fig 18 it is also interesting to see that the similarity of flow fields between vof and clsvof leads to the similarity trends of mass loss however a mass loss of 9 is obtained in the ls method the mass loss increases with the increase of the complexity of the flow field because the current numerical scheme configuration of the level set method produces numerical dissipation and dispersion thus mass may be gained or lost even in this case in which a re initialization procedure is adopted to reduce mass loss due to the deviation of the zero level set location such a mass loss is also the main reason for the interface difference shown in figs 13 16 5 numerical simulation under large density difference situation by the dambreak problem dambreak problem is recognized as a significant benchmark problem in coastal and ocean engineering hydrodynamic simulations and is also usually related to complex phenomena e g high impact pressure surface breakup and water jets in particular if this problem is regarded as multiphase flow the density difference will be so huge that it will pose a great challenge to the numerical simulations untill now a number of researches have discussed on dambreak problems no matter the two phase flow simulation of free surface deformation schillaciet al 2016 li and yu 2019 or the interaction between waves induced by dambreak and structures demir et al 2019 kamra et al 2019 in this section a 2d two phase dambreak problem is considered as presented in fig 19 with a rectangular shape the initial water column has side length a 4 5 i n and the proportion f between rectangular height and length is 1 the same as that in the relevant literature schillaciet al 2016 the computational domain is a container 5 a long and 1 2 a high in addition the water phase has a reference density of 998 k g m 3 while the remaining space in the container is filled with air having a reference density of 1 205 k g m 3 the density ratio is approximately 828 the verified clsvof solver was used to carry out the numerical simulation all boundaries are set in the rigid non slip wall conditions as in the preceding sections using cartesian coordinates with δ x δ y 0 0025 the computational domain is subdivided into a mesh consisting of fixed rectangular cells fig 20 shows free surface contours obtained by the referenced ls method schillaciet al 2016 and present clsvof method separately the dimensionless time is defined as t z t g f a according to schillaciet al 2016 at the initial stage of the simulation the height of the water column decreases and propagates forward under the force of gravity at t z 1 10 it reaches the right wall and reflect to form a broken wave at t z 3 80 after that the reflected wave flows to upstream and gradually calms down due to the energy dissipation caused by viscosity and wave reflection the collision between the dambreak wave and right vertical wall or obstacle caused energy loss mainly due to intense turbulence mixing into flow it can be seen that both the ls and clsvof methods can simulate the free surface with strong nonlinear phenomena caused by the dambreak problem numerical results of clsvof method are basically consistent with those in the referenced literature at different time points but the authenticity and details of the free surface captured by clsvof are better than referenced ls method which is due to the adopted high order scheme for ls and vof respectively the numerical solver in our research can simulate the strong nonlinear physical phenomena such as surface break up water jet and splashing of the free surface with enough numerical accuracy in the meantime different from rti normally under small density difference situation even under the large density difference situation clsvof method is still able to simulate strongly nonlinear problems and capture interface accurately numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 21 up to the instant at which the wave front reaches the right hand side wall of the water channel in fig 20 the corresponding dimensionless parameters are defined as t h t g a and h h a f z z a according to schillaciet al 2016 it can also be seen that for both h and z the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results which verifies that the clsvof method can simulate dambreak problem accurately the mass error of the 2d dambreak problem during the simulation is presented in fig 22 we can see that a mass loss of 0 002 is obtained for both vof and clsvof method so the clsvof method gives a very good mass conservation result under the large density difference situation clsvof method can still guarantee excellent mass conservation characteristics in the whole process of numerical simulation 6 numerical simulation of solitary wave propagation as a shadow water wave solitary waves carry enormous energy during its propagation and have an impact on the safety of marine structures besides in consideration of its long wavelength solitary wave can be employed to approximate wave caused by tsunami therefore the research on solitary wave is significant on whether the theory new and pingree 2000 seadawy and alamri 2018 lu et al 2017 seadawy 2017 the numerical simulation farhadi et al 2016 yue et al 2003 thé et al 2007 or the model experiment huang et al 2019 on the basis of the above analysis the developed clsvof method can be used to simulate a benchmark case for the propagation of solitary wave in a water channel according to yue et al 2003 the length of the water channel is set as 20m and the water depth is 1 0m gravity acceleration in this case is 1 0 m s 2 and water density is set as 1 0 k g m 3 theoretical wave speed c w is equal to 1 0 m s and r e number is taken as 50000 in the initial stage as shown in fig 23 the wave profile is settled by the following equation 15 a x 0 a 0 c o s h 2 3 a 0 2 x numerical setting for this case is as the same as previous cases except δ x δ y 0 025 m and δ t 0 01 δ x to keep the numerical stability the initial wave amplitude a x 0 is taken as 0 4 m fig 24 shows comparison between numerical results of free surface evolution of solitary wave propagation on every second in fig 24 each curve from left to right represents the wave profile on each second after the simulation starts the wave profile moves to the right and its shape hardly changes after 2s until 10s we can see that present results and cited results have good agreement for the wave profile at each time however it also can be found in fig 24 d that wave profile of cited results has slight decay by time which is not observed in fig 24 b we further calculated wave speed and average amplitude decay rate according to yue et al 2003 thé et al 2007 the results are shown in table 1 it can be seen that the clsvof based solver gave excellent results compare with the theoretical value no matter for wave speed or average amplitude decay rate the numerical dissipation just has very weak effects on the wave amplitude 7 concluding remarks according to this research some typically problems for free surface deformation were simulated by the developed clsvof method in the first place rti problem was numerically investigated respectively by ls vof and clsvof numerical model the numerical results demonstrated that the clsvof model possesses a remarkable capacity to accurately handle the complicated interface deformation of two phase flow compared with the ls and vof models by means of detailed simulation and comparison furthermore the satisfied mesh convergence and mass conservation properties are demonstrated through the clsvof model during simulation obtained from the clsvof method the interface demonstrates the sharpness and sufficient accuracy on the other side the flow field would affected greatly by surface tension and density ratio such as interface between two fluids and penetration depth of the rti problem however during the simulation the viscosity coefficient ratio has tiny impact on interface or evolution of the flow field after reliable analysis enough potential and accuracy of clsvof are proved in multi phase flow numerical simulation even under the large density difference situation such as dambreak flow meanwhile high accuracy and reduction of numerical dissipation in wave profile evolution are kept by clsvof according to the result can be obtained that the method adopted in this paper has potential to be applied to ocean and coastal hydrodynamic engineering problems declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of

commonly exists in ocean surface wave ship and ocean engineering hydrological engineering and coastal engineering therefore the study of two phase flow is important for both research and engineering application in the study of two phase flow free surface simulation is crucial an excellent interface capturing method for free surface simulation not only needs sufficient numerical accuracy but also needs to ensure mass conservation in the simulation process and can accurately handle the high density ratio of water air two phase flow in the meantime within popular eulerian based interface capture

buoyancy driven motion of fluid particles in ref son and hur 2002 and the improved clsvof method is applicable to numerical simulation of bubbles and drops rising or falling in a quiescent fluid as well with regard to the engineering application clsvof method can be used in dam breaking flow interacting with a 3d stationary obstacle square structure circular cylinder zhao and chen 2017 yu et al

investigation of simulating sloshing flows in a rectangular tank by liu et al 2017b including the plunging wave breaking wave impact on the sidewall and the roof and the beating phenomenon lyu et al 2017 adopted the clsvof method to predict 2d liquid sloshing phenomena in a moving tank in the field of engineering design clsvof method can lie a solid theoretical foundation for designing and optimizing microfluidic devices li et al 2015 and can successfully depict the phenomena of race tracking air entrapment and weldline development which can be of great benefit to determine processing conditions and design mold cavities li 2016 in using clsvof method some improvements can be achieved and simultaneously other useful additional methods can be adopted all together in the light of different research objects dianat et al 2017 have implemented a clsvof method into a general purpose cfd code which can be used with unstructured and non orthogonal meshes in ref kumar singh and premachandran 2018 the volume fraction is advected by using a multi directional advection algorithm where the flux polygons are constructed with the use of vertex velocities a scaling factor based on cell face velocities is used to correct the advected volume fraction meantime the level set field is advected using a total variational diminishing tvd scheme and geometrically reinitialized at the end of each time step moreover zhao et al zhao and chen 2017 develop the methodology for an overset grid system of embedding overlapping and moving structured grids through the use of clsvof method haghshenas et al 2017 propose an algebraic coupled level set volume of fluid a clsvof method for the simulation of interfacial capillary flows besides the clsvof method that coupled with four

dimensional simulations clsvof ib method is also applied to the melt filling process in the complex mold cavity with insets with the aid of the shape function and a mass correction scheme based on the interface curvature is used to conserve the liquid mass in a correct manner li 2016 beyond these studies the clsvof method with mass correction is presented for the numerical simulations of interfacial flows for purpose of improving the mass conservation of ls method li et al 2012 a multiple marker clsvof method that each droplet has its own locally defined marker functions is adopted by kwakkel et al 2013 to prevent the problem of numerical coalescence in conventional clsvof method when two droplet interfaces are less than one grid cell apart from each other son et al son and hur 2002 developed a complete and efficient interface reconstruction algorithm on the basis of the explicit relationship between the interface configuration and the fluid volume function ih which a cubic interpolated propagation cip scheme is combined with the clsvof method in order to calculate the advection terms of the momentum equation accurately sussman et al sussman and elbridge 2000 recommended the use of a clsvof method in which the curvature obtained by determining the finite differences of the level set function which in turn derived from the ls and vof functions the clsvof method was also performed to numerically simulate interfacial flows in ship hydrodynamics in which a geometric algorithm used to re distance the ls function on the strength of the reconstructed interface in which the interface jump conditions were handled via ghost fluid methodology wang et al 2012 in this research the clsvof based numerical solver was developed and verified in detail through solving the rayleigh taylor instability rti dambreak and solitary wave propagation problems the main goal of the present research is to develop an accurate and reliable in house numerical solver to deal with strong nonlinear interface deformation the rest of this article is organized as follows in section 2 governing equations and numerical approaching are presented for the two fluids and clsvof method the rayleigh taylor instability problem is suitable to carry out mesh convergence analysis and mass conversation analysis since its interface is relatively simple in the initial state but will become very complex by time in section 3 numerical verification was carried out by using a single mode rti problem to prove the accuracy of the numerical solver meantime more numerical investigation were carried with effection under different surface tension viscosity ratios and density ratios in section 4 mass conversation analysis was carried out by using a complicated three mode rti problem to further prove the accuracy of clsvof method dambreak is a benchmark problem in ocean and coastal engineering hydrodynamics it is suitable for testing under the high density difference situation section 5 presents a dambreak case to show the ability of developed clsvof solver on handling the large density difference case of two phase flow the shape maintenance of wave profile propagation in a water channel during numerical simulation is commonly existed in ocean engineering application section 6 presents a solitary wave propagation case to test the ability of developed clsvof solver on dealing with wave profile evolution section 7 presents the conclusion 2 mathematical model among this research the heavy and light liquid phases are modeled by means of n s equations with variable physical properties and the influence of surface tension at the interface between two fluid phases is entered in consideration as well both phases are supposed immiscible and incompressible to govern this problem the governing equations that are the continuity equations are listed below 1 v 0 and momentum equation is 2 ρ α v t v v p ρ α g μ α v v t σ k δ α where v u v represents the velocity vector p represents the pressure g represents the gravitational acceleration and t represents the time the influence of surface tension σ is incorporated into the momentum equation δ the interface delta function is given by 3 δ 0 ϕ ε 1 2 ε 1 c o s π ϕ ε ϕ ε and in eq 2 α represents the smoothed void fraction field which is defined through a heaviside function h ε ϕ as chakraborty et al 2013 sussman and elbridge 2000 4 α h ε ϕ 1 ϕ ε 1 2 ϕ 2 ε 1 2 π s i n π ϕ ε ϕ ε 0 ϕ ε where ϕ in this equation symbolizes the ls function which is maintained as the signed distance function from the interface herein ϕ is zero at the interface and has positive values in the heavy fluid region and negative values in the light fluid region 2 ε represents the interface thickness right here which the fluid properties are interpolated the present simulations were performed by the use of ε 1 5 δ a where δ a is the size of the computational cell as shown in ref chakraborty et al 2013 detailedly from α the density ρ α and viscosity μ α can be expressed as 5 ρ α ρ l α ρ h 1 α 6 μ α μ l α μ h 1 α where the subscript l and h symbolize the light fluid and the heavy fluid respectively the local curvature k of the interface is computed as 7 k ϕ ϕ the clsvof method is used to handle interface deformation between two immiscible fluids by time within the clsvof method the advection for the liquid volume fraction α and the ls function ϕ are 8 α t v α 0 9 ϕ t v ϕ 0 respectively among the clsvof method in order to make ϕ and α advected the governing equations of the level set function ϕ and the volume fraction α are come to a solution from t n to t n 1 after that this research adopted interface reconstruction to confirm that the predicted interfaces from ϕ and α are close to each other through the use of 10 ζ 2 α n 1 1 therefore as it presented in the reconstruction procedure isoline ζ 0 of intermediate function ζ symbolizes that the position of the interface is in accordance with that indicated by α n 1 1 2 after that 11 ζ τ s ζ 0 1 ζ is solved until ζ reaches a steady state solution at the interface which is exactly the value of ζ at the interface and s is a smoothed out sign function next another intermediate ls function 12 ϕ n 1 ζ n 1 if φ n 1 ε ϕ n 1 otherwise is constructed to confirm that ϕ n 1 and α n 1 represent the same interface position in the end this research needs to solve 13 ϕ n 1 τ s ϕ 0 n 1 1 ϕ n 1 λ δ ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 where the discontinuity at ϕ n 1 ε would be eliminated until reaching to a steady state solution ϕ n 1 with regard to ls part the fifth order weighted essentially non oscillatory weno5 scheme is applied to solve the evolution equation and the re initialization equation jiang and shu 1996 and the third order total variation diminishing runge kutta tvd rk3 scheme is adopted for time advancement shu 1988 for purpose of handling the interface reconstruction the combined tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc xiao et al 2005 and the weighted linear interface calculation wlic scheme yokoi 2007 is adopted in vof part moreover the projection method is employed to handle n s equations gu et al 2018 the discretized equations are solved on a fixed staggered grid with scalars p ϕ and α located at the cell centers and velocity components v at the center of the cell faces the time step that satisfies courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition can be chosen to confirm the stability of the solution in order to handle the above tridiagonal and sparse pressure matrix a point based successive over relaxation psor method is introduced the convergence tolerance ε 10 4 is used for the solutions calculated from two consecutive iterations of pressure possion equation and the second order adams bashforth scheme is used for time advancement the second order upwinding scheme is applied to solve the convective terms in n s equation on the other hand a second order central difference scheme is employed to handle the diffusion terms in n s equation a second order accuracy in both space and time o δ x 2 δ t 2 can be guaranteed through the above methods which is of great importance in capturing free interfaces a more detailed description of the numerical method are provided in li et al 2019 3 numerical verification by one mode rayleigh taylor instability problem in this section a single mode rti problem is adopted to justify the accuracy of clsvof solver the rti problem occurs when the fluid with big density is above the fluid with small density which is a kind of interfacial instability caused by gravity rti principally rest with the density and gravitational acceleration of the two fluids the instability will be greater with the increase of the gravitational acceleration rti between the interface would not exist if there is no gravity rti is not merely of scientific significance it also has practical value and wide applications wang and zhao 2018 khater et al 2001 2003 2006 in consequence all this makes this problem become an important fundamental problem in the study of the stability of fluid fluid interface the properties of the rti such as the time varying complexity of interface deformation are also appropriate for numerical verification of various interface capture methods chen et al 2014 rahmat et al 2014 aniszewski et al 2014 lee and kim 2013 guo et al 2018 3 1 parameter setting in numerical simulations fig 1 is a schematic diagram of the adopted single mode rti problem in which the height of the numerical region is h 2 m and the width is l 1 m the initial shape of the interface between two fluids is y 1 0 15 sin 2 π x the densities of the upper fluid and the lower fluid are ρ h 1 8 and ρ l 1 0 and the gravitational acceleration is g 1 the dynamic viscosity coefficients of the two fluids are equal as μ h μ l 0 0025 atwood number defined as a t ρ h ρ l ρ h ρ l 2 7 is used to represent the density difference of two fluids all boundaries are set as rigid non slip wall conditions i e u v 0 initially the system is in a static state then under the action of gravity the heavy fluid in the upper layer begins to move downward while the light fluid in the lower layer moves upward the computational domain is subdivided into a mesh of fixed rectangular cells by using cartesian coordinates 3 2 mesh convergence study in order to verify the accuracy of developed high order clsvof method for rti problem a mesh convergence study is presented here in which the different mesh configurations including cell scale for δ x and δ y 0 02 0 01 0 005 0 0025 are calculated respectively for more detailed comparison numerical simulation of ls and vof with the same mesh configurations are also carried out and the results are shown in fig 2 to fig 4 in figs 2 4 the different colors represent numerical results with different mesh configurations in fig 2 it can be observed that coarse grid with δ x δ y 0 02 gives bad result by ls method as the mesh becomes finer although the flow profile appears almost the same but the details of interface become much better the interface is sharp and the local details are fine similar result can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 except the results of the roughest grid for vof and clsvof are obviously more better than that of the level set result fig 5 shows the interface comparison between different grid scale for three different methods within fig 5 for different grid scales the color of lines is the same as that of contour in figs 2 4 it can be observed in fig 5 that as the mesh becomes finer the numerical results becomes converge gradually for all three methods for the finest mesh all three methods give nearly the same results however it also can be observed that clsvof can achieve near convergence result with a minimum number of grids which also means the interface capturing ability of clsvof is better than level set and vof it also can be seen from fig 5 as the resolution increases the interface becomes smoother and finer and the detail of the fluid field is increases but this change is not obvious fig 6 shows the respective numerical results of referenced literatures it can be seen that various simulation results regarding the overall fluid structure of the interface are similar it is noted that although numerical results of this research are same as those of ls and sph but the simulated details are quite different the interface of particle method is obviously not sharp enough as it can be see from fig 6 the result of fig 6 c with sph method is significantly different from others fig 6 b also uses sph method but the result is very similar with those of fig 6 a and fig 6 d overall the result of fig 6 b should be more accurate than that of fig 6 c however there has an irregular jump at the interface due to numerical instability in fig 6 b which is not observed in fig 6 a and our results through carefully observing the numerical result of fig 6 d we can also notice the small irregular jump at the interface therefore when solving rti problems the eulerian based method is more accurate than the particle method to a certain degree our result is most similar with fig 6 a fig 7 shows the variation of the penetration depth of the two fluids with time obtained by ls vof and clsvof respectively with δ x δ y 0 0025 all three methods gave almost the same results from fig 7 it can be seen that the distance between the two fluids from the midpoint almost synchronously increases at the initial stage t i m e 1 s after time 1s the velocity of the downward motion of the heavy fluids is obviously faster than that of the upward motion of the light fluids the two fluids are very close to the top and bottom wall at time 6s according to lewis s experiment and layzer s theory the penetration depth caused by rayleigh taylor instability increases exponentially with time at the initial stage without considering the influence of the wall and then increases uniformly with time after stabilization in fig 7 when the penetration depth is less than 0 3 it is about the exponential increasing stage and when the penetration depth between 0 3 and 0 8 it is around the uniform increasing stage therefore the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results and theoretical results when the penetration depth is greater than 0 8 the deceleration stage begins due to the influence of the wall 3 3 vortex variation fig 8 shows the structure of vortices in the flow field as can be seen from fig 8 at the beginning the simple shape of the vortex gradually becomes complex and the vortex structure almost follows the shape of the interface which represents in yellow line as time goes on vortex changing becomes more and more complex and the number of small vortices increases due to the fluid motion which affect the fluid motion in turn in fig 8 a at the initial stage on the left half side the upper fluid moves downward while the lower fluid on the right half side moves upward that forming a large counter clockwise vortex in the meanwhile two small clockwise vortices are formed near the left and right boundaries in fig 8 b previous vortices continue to increase and new small scale vortices appeared on the left and right walls the whole vortex structure in the flow field was symmetrically formed in fig 8 c except previous vortices continue to increase the clockwise vortices on both sides of the region begin to merge the center of the three biggest vortices is almost in the same straight line in fig 8 d new vortices appear on the upper and lower walls from which we can see that the new vortices are not symmetrical due to the different penetration depths of heavy fluid and light fluid respectively in fig 8 e in the middle of two large clockwise vortices two small counterclockwise vortices appears but their structures are not symmetrical three counter clockwise vortices on the middle left boundary and the lower boundary begin to merge in fig 8 f the structure of the vortex is becoming more and more complex but the scale of the vortex is no longer larger than before in fig 8g and h under the shearing stress action fluid motion at the bottom results in kelvin helmholtz instability which forms some small scale counter clockwise vortices large vortex structures begin to decompose into many smaller vortices during the simulation it also can be seen that the largest vortex structures are contained in the mushroom structure of the interface 3 4 effect of surface tension viscosity coefficient ratio and density ratio in this section the effects of surface tension density ratio and viscosity ratio on rti problem are investigated using clsvof based numerical solver the adopted one mode case is still used in this section since its advantage of shape boundary and relatively not easy to break this makes it easier to separate the effects of surface tension viscosity ratio and density ratio as previous all boundaries are set as rigid non slip solid wall conditions i e u v 0 and the computational domain is discreted by the mesh configuration with δ x δ y 0 0025 fig 9 shows numerical results without surface tension effect and with different w e number conditions it can be clearly seen that w e number would affect flow field greatly especially when its value is relatively small since big w e number represents small surface tension w e number mainly affects the shape of the interface between heavy fluid and light fluid it can be seen that the formed mushroom shapes by heavy fluid penetrating into light fluid or light fluid penetrating into heavy fluid are very similar under the influence of each w e the increase in surface tension has an inhibitory effect on the mutual penetration between heavy and light fluids however the penetration depth was not affected too much for all w e number this is owing to the w e number represents the relationship between the inertial force and the surface tension the inertial force is predominant on account of the setting of this case therefore the change of the w e number does not have much impact on the penetration depth in a certain range fig 10 shows numerical results with different viscosity coefficient ratio it can be clearly seen that viscosity coefficient ratio has very small effect on the flow field during the simulation either penetration depth or interface shape is may due to the fact that at the current setting the viscosity ratio has less influence on the inertial force of the heavy and light fluids under the current acceleration and the calculation time is short it can be predicted that as the calculation time increases the large viscosity ratio will increase the velocity gradient between the interfaces thereby affecting the stability of the interface and then induce kelvin helmholtz instability numerical results with different density ratio have been shown in fig 11 we can see that the density ratio has a great influence on the flow field with the increase of the density ratio the irregularity and complexity of flow field increase faster and the penetration depth also increases this is due to as the density ratio increases the inertial force of the heavy fluid at the current gravitational acceleration increases as well and the relative difference of inertial force between the heavy fluid and the light fluid increases too hence the increase in the density ratio will not only enhance the interpenetration between light and heavy fluids but also has a significant impact on the shape of the interface 4 mass conservation analysis by three mode rti problem a three mode rti problem is used here to analyze the mass conservation with the goal of further ensuring numerical accuracy fig 12 is a schematic diagram of the adopted three mode rti problem in which the height of the numerical region is also h 2 m and the width is l 1 m as previous but the initial shape of the interface between two fluids is y 1 0 05 sin 6 π x the densities of the upper fluid and lower fluid are ρ ω 3 0 and ρ α 1 0 and the gravitational acceleration is g 1 so atwood number is replaced by a t ρ ω ρ α ρ ω ρ α 1 2 now the dynamic viscosity coefficients are equal as μ ω μ α 0 0025 and the boundary conditions and mesh configurations used in the simulation are the same as previous figs 13 16 shows numerical results at different time for ls vof and clsvof respectively the sub fig d in figs 13 16 indicates the interface comparison between three methods where the blue line belongs to ls the red line and the black line belong to vof and clsvof respectively as time goes on the two fluids gradually mix together and the shape of the interface become more and more irregular it can be seen that the formed mushroom shapes by heavy fluid penetrating into light fluid or light fluid penetrating into heavy fluid are very different under such setting at the initial stage three methods obtain almost identical result in fig 13 nevertheless in fig 14 a little difference becomes visible over time such difference mainly occurs in areas where heavy fluid penetrate into light fluid from fig 15 such difference becomes more and more obvious but the main difference just exists between ls and vof or ls and clsvof the difference between vof and clsvof is not obvious from fig 16 the difference between ls and vof or ls and clsvof is becoming very serious to quantity the ability of mass conservation of these method the mass error m e r r o r is defined as follows 14 m e r r o r m t m 0 m 0 100 where m t ω c t d ω is the mass during the computation and m 0 ω c 0 d ω is the mass at the beginning of the computation the mass errors of the three mode rti problem incurred by using the ls vof and clsvof methods during the simulation are presented in fig 17 from which it can be seen that the clsvof and vof methods give very good results in terms of mass conservation in contrast the ls method gives a relatively poor result in that it suddenly drops down around t i m e 2 50 s while it is also the moment when the interface differences appeared as shown in fig 15 the reason for the above results is that the clsvof method is executed using conservative equations that reduce mass conservation errors while retaining the accuracy of interface normal vector from the ls part even in very complicated phenomena in order to obtain a sharp interface a mass loss of 0 005 is obtained for both vof and clsvof method as shown in fig 18 it is also interesting to see that the similarity of flow fields between vof and clsvof leads to the similarity trends of mass loss however a mass loss of 9 is obtained in the ls method the mass loss increases with the increase of the complexity of the flow field because the current numerical scheme configuration of the level set method produces numerical dissipation and dispersion thus mass may be gained or lost even in this case in which a re initialization procedure is adopted to reduce mass loss due to the deviation of the zero level set location such a mass loss is also the main reason for the interface difference shown in figs 13 16 5 numerical simulation under large density difference situation by the dambreak problem dambreak problem is recognized as a significant benchmark problem in coastal and ocean engineering hydrodynamic simulations and is also usually related to complex phenomena e g high impact pressure surface breakup and water jets in particular if this problem is regarded as multiphase flow the density difference will be so huge that it will pose a great challenge to the numerical simulations untill now a number of researches have discussed on dambreak problems no matter the two phase flow simulation of free surface deformation schillaciet al 2016 li and yu 2019 or the interaction between waves induced by dambreak and structures demir et al 2019 kamra et al 2019 in this section a 2d two phase dambreak problem is considered as presented in fig 19 with a rectangular shape the initial water column has side length a 4 5 i n and the proportion f between rectangular height and length is 1 the same as that in the relevant literature schillaciet al 2016 the computational domain is a container 5 a long and 1 2 a high in addition the water phase has a reference density of 998 k g m 3 while the remaining space in the container is filled with air having a reference density of 1 205 k g m 3 the density ratio is approximately 828 the verified clsvof solver was used to carry out the numerical simulation all boundaries are set in the rigid non slip wall conditions as in the preceding sections using cartesian coordinates with δ x δ y 0 0025 the computational domain is subdivided into a mesh consisting of fixed rectangular cells fig 20 shows free surface contours obtained by the referenced ls method schillaciet al 2016 and present clsvof method separately the dimensionless time is defined as t z t g f a according to schillaciet al 2016 at the initial stage of the simulation the height of the water column decreases and propagates forward under the force of gravity at t z 1 10 it reaches the right wall and reflect to form a broken wave at t z 3 80 after that the reflected wave flows to upstream and gradually calms down due to the energy dissipation caused by viscosity and wave reflection the collision between the dambreak wave and right vertical wall or obstacle caused energy loss mainly due to intense turbulence mixing into flow it can be seen that both the ls and clsvof methods can simulate the free surface with strong nonlinear phenomena caused by the dambreak problem numerical results of clsvof method are basically consistent with those in the referenced literature at different time points but the authenticity and details of the free surface captured by clsvof are better than referenced ls method which is due to the adopted high order scheme for ls and vof respectively the numerical solver in our research can simulate the strong nonlinear physical phenomena such as surface break up water jet and splashing of the free surface with enough numerical accuracy in the meantime different from rti normally under small density difference situation even under the large density difference situation clsvof method is still able to simulate strongly nonlinear problems and capture interface accurately numerical and experimental results are compared in fig 21 up to the instant at which the wave front reaches the right hand side wall of the water channel in fig 20 the corresponding dimensionless parameters are defined as t h t g a and h h a f z z a according to schillaciet al 2016 it can also be seen that for both h and z the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results which verifies that the clsvof method can simulate dambreak problem accurately the mass error of the 2d dambreak problem during the simulation is presented in fig 22 we can see that a mass loss of 0 002 is obtained for both vof and clsvof method so the clsvof method gives a very good mass conservation result under the large density difference situation clsvof method can still guarantee excellent mass conservation characteristics in the whole process of numerical simulation 6 numerical simulation of solitary wave propagation as a shadow water wave solitary waves carry enormous energy during its propagation and have an impact on the safety of marine structures besides in consideration of its long wavelength solitary wave can be employed to approximate wave caused by tsunami therefore the research on solitary wave is significant on whether the theory new and pingree 2000 seadawy and alamri 2018 lu et al 2017 seadawy 2017 the numerical simulation farhadi et al 2016 yue et al 2003 thé et al 2007 or the model experiment huang et al 2019 on the basis of the above analysis the developed clsvof method can be used to simulate a benchmark case for the propagation of solitary wave in a water channel according to yue et al 2003 the length of the water channel is set as 20m and the water depth is 1 0m gravity acceleration in this case is 1 0 m s 2 and water density is set as 1 0 k g m 3 theoretical wave speed c w is equal to 1 0 m s and r e number is taken as 50000 in the initial stage as shown in fig 23 the wave profile is settled by the following equation 15 a x 0 a 0 c o s h 2 3 a 0 2 x numerical setting for this case is as the same as previous cases except δ x δ y 0 025 m and δ t 0 01 δ x to keep the numerical stability the initial wave amplitude a x 0 is taken as 0 4 m fig 24 shows comparison between numerical results of free surface evolution of solitary wave propagation on every second in fig 24 each curve from left to right represents the wave profile on each second after the simulation starts the wave profile moves to the right and its shape hardly changes after 2s until 10s we can see that present results and cited results have good agreement for the wave profile at each time however it also can be found in fig 24 d that wave profile of cited results has slight decay by time which is not observed in fig 24 b we further calculated wave speed and average amplitude decay rate according to yue et al 2003 thé et al 2007 the results are shown in table 1 it can be seen that the clsvof based solver gave excellent results compare with the theoretical value no matter for wave speed or average amplitude decay rate the numerical dissipation just has very weak effects on the wave amplitude 7 concluding remarks according to this research some typically problems for free surface deformation were simulated by the developed clsvof method in the first place rti problem was numerically investigated respectively by ls vof and clsvof numerical model the numerical results demonstrated that the clsvof model possesses a remarkable capacity to accurately handle the complicated interface deformation of two phase flow compared with the ls and vof models by means of detailed simulation and comparison furthermore the satisfied mesh convergence and mass conservation properties are demonstrated through the clsvof model during simulation obtained from the clsvof method the interface demonstrates the sharpness and sufficient accuracy on the other side the flow field would affected greatly by surface tension and density ratio such as interface between two fluids and penetration depth of the rti problem however during the simulation the viscosity coefficient ratio has tiny impact on interface or evolution of the flow field after reliable analysis enough potential and accuracy of clsvof are proved in multi phase flow numerical simulation even under the large density difference situation such as dambreak flow meanwhile high accuracy and reduction of numerical dissipation in wave profile evolution are kept by clsvof according to the result can be obtained that the

22319,the main aim of this study is to characterize the dynamic behavior of the naples systematic series nss in irregular head sea a further aim of the study is to provide data to detect the influence of hull form on the sea keeping performances in the planing and semi planing speed range the nss derives from a parent hull that has shown to behave well in rough seas characterized by high deadrise angles of the bottom at the bow to reduce acceleration all the models of nss were tested in three different sea states and in fr range from 0 515 to 1 197 the relatively high froude numbers associated

introduction to build an experimental campaign on a systematic series gives the opportunity to correlate single feature of the hull form to performance the systematic variation of the hull shape allows to keep a strong affinity between the models reducing the influences of other hidden form variations see figs 9 15 the naples systematic series nss published in de luca and pensa 2017 furnish characterization of hull forms highlighting the influences of the slenderness ratios lwl bwl and in terms of performance in calm water in this study the experiences are extended to the ship motions and accelerations in irregular head sea the high speed hard chine hulls undergo hydrodynamic pressures that grow up with speed to reach the full planing this dynamic implies mainly in rough water significant variation of trim sinkage and wetted surface due to the strong and quite impulsive variations of hydrodynamic pressure these circumstances make a strongly non linear sea keeping behavior of the planing and semiplaning hulls and consequently the classical performance representation made by the response amplitude operators based on the first order cannot be used as described in fridsma 1971 to overcome these difficulties in fridsma 1971 and in zarnick and turner 1981 the extended campaigns of tests carried out on prismatic hulls in head sea have been analysed applying cartwright lounguet higgins clh and exponential probability density function pdf to describe respectively heave pitch motion and vertical acceleration all these results show very high peak acceleration suitable represented by an exponential distribution differently due to the hull forms studied by this work the data measured shown not negligible negative maxima in the vertical acceleration trends to take into account these negative maxima values and to fit them effectively it was decided to adopt extreme value distributions also gamma distribution was fitted according to taunton et al 2011 nevertheless extreme value pdf returns the best fitting begovic et al 2016 referring to the typical seakeeping behavior of planing craft describe heave and pitch maxima and minima and three different pdf these data have been fitted with the statistical functions normal clh and extreme value differently for the acceleration maxima the functions exponential gamma and weibull have been applied

2012 the effects of the conventional and unconventional interceptors on the performances in regular waves have been presented the tests have been carried out on monohedral hulls in the speed range fr 1 1 3 3 2 models tested and experimental plan the models of the nss published in f de luca c pensa 2017 are hard chine hulls characterized by five affine stretched models build with warped bottom and at ax 1 the models where tested in the towing tank of the dii of the università degli studi di napoli federico ii whose main characteristics are length 136 0 m width 9 0 m and deep 4 5 m maximum speed of the carriage 10 0 m s the tests were performed in ranges fr 0 5 1 6 and fr 1 1 4 3 therefore the hulls are affected by a high dynamic lift the series is composed by 5 geometries and 7 models the two geometries with lower l b ratios c1 and c2 have been built in two scales of reduction the smaller models have been built to overcome instrumentation limits in seakeeping tests these smaller models are indicated in table 1 with c1s and c2s one displacement and mass configuration for each model were tested in waves tables 1 and 2 show the experimental plan as suggested by fridsma 1971 the dynamic behavior in rough water was detected by testing the models at a constant speed because little or no surge motion arises for this kind of planing craft the study of unsteady phenomena needs a great number of tests to make reliable the statistical approach necessary to analyse the data logged a large experimental campaign introduces the critical issue of the comparability of tests performed in different moments and on different models particular care was taken of data acquisition and analysis of models set up and wave generations 2 1 set up of models the first goal is to set the cg position the lcg position is chosen to have no trim in static condition vcg is set to make vcg bwl ratio constant for all the models to obtain the desired lcg and vcg the models were suspended on a pivot free to pitch and roll shown in fig 1 the models were positioned to have the pivot at the desired cg and the mobile mass was disposed to obtain the zero trim then a procedure like an inclining test was made to calculate vcg differently to the standard inclining test the model is constrained to rotate around a fixed point the pivot so large angles are allowed overcoming the limit of the metacentric method and the uncertainty due to the calculation of km the ittc 2011 procedures to perform sea keeping tests in towing tank suggest the evaluation of the real values of radii of gyration of ship if they are preliminary unknown a value of 0 25 loa for pitch or yaw and a value between 0 35b and 0 40b for transverse radius of gyration could be considered since the models tested in towing tank can be referred to hull with different loa lwl and boa bwl to compare the performances of the five models it was considered appropriate to refer to wl instead oa dimensions to obtain the desired radii of gyration the models were suspended at the same pivot shown in fig 1 and oscillated the frequencies and angles measured made possible to evaluate the achieved radii of gyration 2 2 gauges settings the acquisition of the accelerations has been carried out by two triaxial accelerometer cross bow cxl04gp3 r al the characteristics of which are input range g 4 sensitivity mv g 500 15 noise mg rms 10 and bandwidth hz dc 100 one accelerometer is positioned at the center of mass g the other at 0 5 lwl forward of g the towing system tc system used allows controlling the thrust direction through a laser tracking for the entire series the angle of shaft line was fixed to 8 deg and the vertical component of the thrust has been considered to take in to account the effects of this on lift and trim as shown in fig 2 the resistances of the models were measured by a hbm load cell pw115ah 20 kg accuracy class iii fixed on the forward end of the controlled shaft the aim of the control was the constancy of the thrust direction the measurement of body motion was made with qualisys motion capture system that is known as a high quality optical system for position tracking in engineering applications allowing sub millimeter accuracy to verify the waves profile achieved with the wave maker two different kind of sensors were used two capacitive probes acamina awp 24 2 wave height gauges and four ultrasonic probes baumer undk 30u6103 the capacitive probes more precise have been fixed to the towing tank the ultrasonic probes were fixed to the carriage and therefore were following the models during the tests 2 3 data analysis the data were sampled at a frequency of 500 hz to overcome the aliasing problems the oversampling techniques were applied subsequently the data were filtered with a butterworth bandpass filter of the fifth order 0 05 20 hz according to g method guidelines riley et al 2016 the mean value of accelerations heave and pitch have been removed from the measured data to reach a sufficient number of encounters about 200 several tests not less than 15 have been concatenated overlapping the extreme values of the acquisitions on the zero up crossing fig 3 shows an example of data with and without the application of the butterworth filter the positive maxima accelerations refer to the impact on the water see fig 4 to estimate online the wave spectrum and ensure the good fit to the target the welch method has been adopted welch 1967 that is a refinement of the bartlett method bartlett 1948 the welch method reduces the large fluctuations of the periodogram splitting up the available sample of n observations into equal subsamples of m observations each and then averages the periodograms obtained from the subsamples for each value of frequency the welch method enhances the bartlett method through two ways first the data segments in the welch method are allowed in windows partially overlapped second each data segment is windowed prior to computing the periodogram finally the power spectral density psd is determined by averaging the windowed periodograms in this work the data were split in windows of about 4000 samples and the overlapping was of 60 the reductions of the large fluctuations of the periodograms obtained by the overlapping suggested by the welch procedure ensure an effective smoothing between each window and a high control over the bias resolution properties of the estimated psd 2 4 wave generation all the models were tested in three different sea state ss irregular head sea the sss taken into account are shown in table 2 the sss have been chosen considering the main goal of the hull c 954 that is the geometry from which the nss was developed for the model c 954 was designed to sail in coastal route in waves well characterized by jonswap spectra moreover the sss were chosen considering the need to compare the behaviours of the five models this need has led to some considerations on the scale factors in particular due to the wide range of slenderness ratios of the models the ship dimension of reference of the models is significantly different in particular the c1 and c2 models whose are smaller refer to ships dramatically smaller than those of c5 and quite different respect to c4 for these reasons to compare the sea keeping behavior of all the models c1 and c2 geometries have been built also in smaller scale 0 6 in respect to c1 and c2 these new models have been named c1s and c2s with these new scale factors it is possible to compare the tests performed respectively in test 3 and 7 on models c3 c4 c5 with tests performed in tests 1 and 9 on models c1s and c2s to ensure meaningful comparisons it has been necessary to refer the behaviours of all the models strictly to the same wave spectra and therefore to the same nominal spectra in operational terms the problem ended up controlling the wave maker actions in detail the heights of the generated wave have been measured through capacitive probes arranged in three longitudinal positions of the tank and the following operations have been carried out 1 irregular sea generation and measurement with reference to capacitive probes 2 comparison between the theoretical spectrum and the realized spectrum 3 creation of an ad hoc transfer function 4 verification of the generated spectrum three acquisitions of at least 200 encounters this procedure has been carried out at the beginning of the experimentation of each model by each new wave calibration the transfer functions have been verified for every experimental session 3 results for all the models and all the sailing conditions heave pitch and vertical accelerations have been measured logging the instantaneous values whereas the resistances have been presented as mean values the data has been analysed both in time and frequency domain to improve the analysis quality of the results in time domain heave pitch and accelerations have been synchronized with the wave profile measured at the g due to the great amount of data only some examples of time traces have been shown in graphic form fig 5 shows the synchronized patterns of all the physical quantity measured the following fig 6 shows the response of the hull c1s in frequency domain for all test conditions the response spectra are expressed in terms of spectral density rms2 per hertz unit respect to the encounter frequency table 3 shows for each test performed the wave resistance ratio expressed as rtmw rtm to highlight the influence of the speed on the resistance in wave in the following fig 7 the same data given in table 3 are classified by fr to read correctly fig 7 referring to tables 1 and 2 it is important to remark that tests from 13 to 15 for model c2s refer to fr 1 197 differently for c5 model refer to fr 0 515 c1s and c2s are on a smaller scale and it is possible to compare the tests performed respectively in test 3 and 7 on models c3 c4 c5 with tests performed in 1 and 9 on models c1s and c2s anyway histogram is aligned to simplifying the comparisons it is possible to notice that fig 7 the higher the speed the lower the increasing of resistance for all the models in all the three sss tested the phenomenon is amplified for the higher slenderness ratio the resistance increases from model c2s to c5 together with the increase of and l b the trend changes for the c1s model all the statistics on results of the tests have been shown in tabular form in appendix ii nevertheless to facilitate the overview of the behaviours of the models the synopsis of motions heights and accelerations maxima has been shown by the following figs 8 to 11 only for the mean of 1 3 highest values the histograms are arranged using the same logic of fig 7 for a correct interpretation of the histograms above shown figs 7 to 11 it is well to remember that the four models derived from the parent hull c1 were developed by scaling depth and breadth by the same reduction factors maintaining homothetic forms of all the transversal sections these transformations increasing both l b and imply that the different models even if they are of the same length are characterized by different displacements for this reason for example the slenderest model c5 have to be considered a significantly smaller model respect to the c1s or c2s ones and consequently the worst performances in terms of motion and accelerations are mainly to relate with the different absolute dimension of the ships on this basis to avoid misunderstanding in the interpretations of the histograms it is suggested to compare the performances varying speed and sea state on the same models following this way it is possible to observe that for high slenderness ratio c4 and c5 with the increasing of the fr the pitch angles decrease for intermediate or low slenderness ratio the dependencies of the pitch angles on the fr is not monotonic the same tendencies are observable in the heave histograms regarding the accelerations for each sea states the speed is a significant influencing factor 4 data representation to provide an agile tool to represent the results the data has also been fitted with statistical distributions the magnitudes under consideration are maximum and minimum of pitch and heave and the maximums impacts of vertical accelerations at the centre of gravity and at the bow the pdf functions used are the following normal 1 pdf f x 1 σ 2 π e x μ 2 σ 2 were x is the continuous random variable normalized by the process rms μ the mean value and σ the standard deviation of the quantile extreme 2 pdf f x 1 β e x α β e e x α β where α is the location parameter and β is the scale parameter cartwright longuet higgins clh cartwright and longuet higgins 1956 3 pdf f x 1 2 π ε e x 2 2 ε 2 x 1 ε 2 e x 2 2 x 1 ε 2 ε e y 2 2 d y ε 2 1 1 2 r 2 where ε is the bandwidth parameter and r is the determined proportion of negative maxima to total maxima gamma 4 pdf f x x α β 1 e x α α γ β where α is the scale parameter of the random variable β is the shape parameter of the random variable γ β is the gamma function of β the clh extreme and normal was used to represent pitch and heave maxima and minima differently from what reported in begovic et al 2016 and in taunton et al 2011 the residues shown in appendix iii highlights that extreme pdf returns a better fitting than clh to represent maxima of accelerations gamma function were fitted following the literature knowledge but noticing the relevant presence of negative maxima extreme pdf was also adopted on acceleration returning the best fit for the test performed the levenberg marquardt method l m has been used to fit probability density function on experimental data it is fully described in nocedal jorge at al 2006 it consists in a non linear curve fitting method to calculate the best fit parameters that minimize the weighted mean square error between the observations y and the best nonlinear fit y 5 y i f x i a 0 a 1 a 2 where a 0 a 1 a 2 are the parameters the l m method is an evolution of gauss newton method the main difference consists in a positive definite diagonal matrix added to the hessian matrix to avoid the weakness of the singular hessian matrix to evaluate the goodness of fitting the residue has been shown they are defined as the mean square error between the best non linear fit and the observations for the normal pdf a direct estimation of the function is possible evaluating average and standard deviation on the data also cartwright longuet higgins can be estimated directly following the procedure proposed in taunton et al 2011 the direct estimates have been made and the values have been compared with the derived output of the fitting through l m method without finding substantial differences confirming the goodness of the use of the l m method the figs 8 to15 show some examples of fitting of accelerations heave and pitch 5 conclusions this paper shows the results of the experimentation performed on the models of the systematic series nss in irregular sea it completes the performance representation of the systematic series presented in the previous article de luca f pensa c 2017 where the data relating to calm water were provided overall the five models were tested in about forty conditions varying speed and sea state to guarantee an adequate number of wave encounters each condition was tested for no less than fifteen runs jonswap spectra γ 3 3 were chosen because they are suitable for characterizing the weather conditions for which the hulls have been designed model sizes and sea states take into account the different probable dimensions of the ships to which the individual models refer the slender the model the bigger the ship the tests show a strong dependence on the slenderness factor this dependence must be well interpreted remembering that the more elongated models refer to lighter ships in other words referring to the same wave heights the more elongated models have been tested at same values h1 3 lwl but at higher values of h1 3 1 3 appendix i example of application to facilitate the designer work the following example shows the procedure for the evaluation of the performances of a model of the nss in a known ss it is assumed that we want to predict the vertical accelerations on the bow to evaluate the level of comfort on board of a c2s shaped craft with lwls 21 6 m this length implies a scale factor lwls lwlm 15 from tables 1 and 2 we deduce the sailing conditions available on the c2s model considering the test 09 of model c2s we refer to the hardest context tested in towing tank in particular referring to the scale factor 15 we analyse the behavior of the craft at vs 20 4 kn fr 0 928 and waves characterized by hs 1 125 m tp 3 9 s and jonswap γ 3 3 douglas ss3 to compute the a1 n of interest the extreme value pdf 1 and his cumulative probability function f x 2 have been taken into account

22319,the main aim of this study is to characterize the dynamic behavior of the naples systematic series nss in irregular head sea a further aim of the study is to provide data to detect the influence of hull form on the sea keeping performances in the planing and semi planing speed range the nss derives from a parent hull that has shown to behave well in rough seas characterized by high deadrise angles of the bottom at the bow to reduce acceleration all the models of nss were tested in three different sea states and in fr range from 0 515 to 1 197 the relatively high froude numbers associated with the forms of the series make inappropriate the statistical analysis usually carried out to describe the behavior of the displacement ships to overcome these unsuitableness cartwright lounguet

introduction to build an experimental campaign on a systematic series gives the opportunity to correlate single feature of the hull form to performance the systematic variation of the hull shape allows to keep a strong affinity between the models reducing the influences of other hidden form variations see figs 9 15 the naples systematic series nss published in de luca and pensa 2017 furnish characterization of hull forms highlighting the influences of the slenderness ratios lwl bwl and in terms of performance in calm water in this study the experiences are extended to the ship motions and accelerations in irregular head sea the high speed hard chine hulls undergo hydrodynamic pressures that grow up with speed to reach the full planing this dynamic implies mainly in rough water significant variation of trim sinkage and wetted surface due to the strong and quite impulsive variations of hydrodynamic pressure these circumstances make a strongly non linear sea keeping behavior of the planing and semiplaning hulls and consequently the classical performance representation made by the response amplitude operators based on the first order cannot be used as described in fridsma 1971 to overcome these difficulties in fridsma 1971 and in zarnick and turner 1981 the extended campaigns of tests carried out on prismatic hulls in head sea have been analysed applying cartwright lounguet higgins clh and exponential probability density function pdf to describe respectively heave pitch motion and vertical acceleration all these results show very high peak acceleration suitable represented by an exponential distribution differently due to the hull forms studied by this work the data measured shown not negligible negative maxima in the vertical acceleration trends to take into account these negative maxima values and to fit them effectively it was decided to adopt extreme value distributions also gamma distribution was fitted according to taunton et al 2011 nevertheless extreme value pdf returns the best fitting begovic et al 2016 referring to the typical seakeeping behavior of planing craft describe heave and pitch maxima and minima and three different pdf these data have been fitted with the statistical functions normal clh and extreme value differently for the acceleration maxima the functions exponential gamma and weibull have been applied

2012 the effects of the conventional and unconventional interceptors on the performances in regular waves have been presented the tests have been carried out on monohedral hulls in the speed range fr 1 1 3 3 2 models tested and experimental plan the models of the nss published in f de luca c pensa 2017 are hard chine hulls characterized by five affine stretched models build with warped bottom and at ax 1 the models where tested in the towing tank of the dii of the università degli studi di napoli federico ii whose main characteristics are length 136 0 m width 9 0 m and deep 4 5 m maximum speed of the carriage 10 0 m s the tests were performed in ranges fr 0 5 1 6 and fr 1 1 4 3 therefore the hulls are affected by a high dynamic lift the series is composed by 5 geometries and 7 models the two geometries with lower l b ratios c1 and c2 have been built in two scales of reduction the smaller models have been built to overcome instrumentation limits in seakeeping tests these smaller models are indicated in table 1 with c1s and c2s one displacement and mass configuration for each model were tested in waves tables 1 and 2 show the experimental plan as suggested by fridsma 1971 the dynamic behavior in rough water was detected by testing the models at a constant speed because little or no surge motion arises for this kind of planing craft the study of unsteady phenomena needs a great number of tests to make reliable the statistical approach necessary to analyse the data logged a large experimental campaign introduces the critical issue of the comparability of tests performed in different moments and on different models particular care was taken of data acquisition and analysis of models set up and wave generations 2 1 set up of models the first goal is to set the cg position the lcg position is chosen to have no trim in static condition vcg is set to make vcg bwl ratio constant for all the models to obtain the desired lcg and vcg the models were suspended on a pivot free to pitch and roll shown in fig 1 the models were positioned to have the pivot at the desired cg and the mobile mass was disposed to obtain the zero trim then a procedure like an inclining test was made to calculate vcg differently to the standard inclining test the model is constrained to rotate around a fixed point the pivot so large angles are allowed overcoming the limit of the metacentric method and the uncertainty due to the calculation of km the ittc 2011 procedures to perform sea keeping tests in towing tank suggest the evaluation of the real values of radii of gyration of ship if they are preliminary unknown a value of 0 25 loa for pitch or yaw and a value between 0 35b and 0 40b for transverse radius of gyration could be considered since the models tested in towing tank can be referred to hull with different loa lwl and boa bwl to compare the performances of the five models it was considered appropriate to refer to wl instead oa dimensions to obtain the desired radii of gyration the models were suspended at the same pivot shown in fig 1 and oscillated the frequencies and angles measured made possible to evaluate the achieved radii of gyration 2 2 gauges settings the acquisition of the accelerations has been carried out by two triaxial accelerometer cross bow cxl04gp3 r al the characteristics of which are input range g 4 sensitivity mv g 500 15 noise mg rms 10 and bandwidth hz dc 100 one accelerometer is positioned at the center of mass g the other at 0 5 lwl forward of g the towing system tc system used allows controlling the thrust direction through a laser tracking for the entire series the angle of shaft line was fixed to 8 deg and the vertical component of the thrust has been considered to take in to account the effects of this on lift and trim as shown in fig 2 the resistances of the models were measured by a hbm load cell pw115ah 20 kg accuracy class iii fixed on the forward end of the controlled shaft the aim of the control was the constancy of the thrust direction the measurement of body motion was made with qualisys motion capture system that is known as a high quality optical system for position tracking in engineering applications allowing sub millimeter accuracy to verify the waves profile achieved with the wave maker two different kind of sensors were used two capacitive probes acamina awp 24 2 wave height gauges and four ultrasonic probes baumer undk 30u6103 the capacitive probes more precise have been fixed to the towing tank the ultrasonic probes were fixed to the carriage and therefore were following the models during the tests 2 3 data analysis the data were sampled at a frequency of 500 hz to overcome the aliasing problems the oversampling techniques were applied subsequently the data were filtered with a butterworth bandpass filter of the fifth order 0 05 20 hz according to g method guidelines riley et al 2016 the mean value of accelerations heave and pitch have been removed from the measured data to reach a sufficient number of encounters about 200 several tests not less than 15 have been concatenated overlapping the extreme values of the acquisitions on the zero up crossing fig 3 shows an example of data with and without the application of the butterworth filter the positive maxima accelerations refer to the impact on the water see fig 4 to estimate online the wave spectrum and ensure the good fit to the target the welch method has been adopted welch 1967 that is a refinement of the bartlett method bartlett 1948 the welch method reduces the large fluctuations of the periodogram splitting up the available sample of n observations into equal subsamples of m observations each and then averages the periodograms obtained from the subsamples for each value of frequency the welch method enhances the bartlett method through two ways first the data segments in the welch method are allowed in windows partially overlapped second each data segment is windowed prior to computing the periodogram finally the power spectral density psd is determined by averaging the windowed periodograms in this work the data were split in windows of about 4000 samples and the overlapping was of 60 the reductions of the large fluctuations of the periodograms obtained by the overlapping suggested by the welch procedure ensure an effective smoothing between each window and a high control over the bias resolution properties of the estimated psd 2 4 wave generation all the models were tested in three different sea state ss irregular head sea the sss taken into account are shown in table 2 the sss have been chosen considering the main goal of the hull c 954 that is the geometry from which the nss was developed for the model c 954 was designed to sail in coastal route in waves well characterized by jonswap spectra moreover the sss were chosen considering the need to compare the behaviours of the five models this need has led to some considerations on the scale factors in particular due to the wide range of slenderness ratios of the models the ship dimension of reference of the models is significantly different in particular the c1 and c2 models whose are smaller refer to ships dramatically smaller than those of c5 and quite different respect to c4 for these reasons to compare the sea keeping behavior of all the models c1 and c2 geometries have been built also in smaller scale 0 6 in respect to c1 and c2 these new models have been named c1s and c2s with these new scale factors it is possible to compare the tests performed respectively in test 3 and 7 on models c3 c4 c5 with tests performed in tests 1 and 9 on models c1s and c2s to ensure meaningful comparisons it has been necessary to refer the behaviours of all the models strictly to the same wave spectra and therefore to the same nominal spectra in operational terms the problem ended up controlling the wave maker actions in detail the heights of the generated wave have been measured through capacitive probes arranged in three longitudinal positions of the tank and the following operations have been carried out 1 irregular sea generation and measurement with reference to capacitive probes 2 comparison between the theoretical spectrum and the realized spectrum 3 creation of an ad hoc transfer function 4 verification of the generated spectrum three acquisitions of at least 200 encounters this procedure has been carried out at the beginning of the experimentation of each model by each new wave calibration the transfer functions have been verified for every experimental session 3 results for all the models and all the sailing conditions heave pitch and vertical accelerations have been measured logging the instantaneous values whereas the resistances have been presented as mean values the data has been analysed both in time and frequency domain to improve the analysis quality of the results in time domain heave pitch and accelerations have been synchronized with the wave profile measured at the g due to the great amount of data only some examples of time traces have been shown in graphic form fig 5 shows the synchronized patterns of all the physical quantity measured the following fig 6 shows the response of the hull c1s in frequency domain for all test conditions the response spectra are expressed in terms of spectral density rms2 per hertz unit respect to the encounter frequency table 3 shows for each test performed the wave resistance ratio expressed as rtmw rtm to highlight the influence of the speed on the resistance in wave in the following fig 7 the same data given in table 3 are classified by fr to read correctly fig 7 referring to tables 1 and 2 it is important to remark that tests from 13 to 15 for model c2s refer to fr 1 197 differently for c5 model refer to fr 0 515 c1s and c2s are on a smaller scale and it is possible to compare the tests performed respectively in test 3 and 7 on models c3 c4 c5 with tests performed in 1 and 9 on models c1s and c2s anyway histogram is aligned to simplifying the comparisons it is possible to notice that fig 7 the higher the speed the lower the increasing of resistance for all the models in all the three sss tested the phenomenon is amplified for the higher slenderness ratio the resistance increases from model c2s to c5 together with the increase of and l b the trend changes for the c1s model all the statistics on results of the tests have been shown in tabular form in appendix ii nevertheless to facilitate the overview of the behaviours of the models the synopsis of motions heights and accelerations maxima has been shown by the following figs 8 to 11 only for the mean of 1 3 highest values the histograms are arranged using the same logic of fig 7 for a correct interpretation of the histograms above shown figs 7 to 11 it is well to remember that the four models derived from the parent hull c1 were developed by scaling depth and breadth by the same reduction factors maintaining homothetic forms of all the transversal sections these transformations increasing both l b and imply that the different models even if they are of the same length are characterized by different displacements for this reason for example the slenderest model c5 have to be considered a significantly smaller model respect to the c1s or c2s ones and consequently the worst performances in terms of motion and accelerations are mainly to relate with the different absolute dimension of the ships on this basis to avoid misunderstanding in the interpretations of the histograms it is suggested to compare the performances varying speed and sea state on the same models following this way it is possible to observe that for high slenderness ratio c4 and c5 with the increasing of the fr the pitch angles decrease for intermediate or low slenderness ratio the dependencies of the pitch angles on the fr is not monotonic the same tendencies are observable in the heave histograms regarding the accelerations for each sea states the speed is a significant influencing factor 4 data representation to provide an agile tool to represent the results the data has also been fitted with statistical distributions the magnitudes under consideration are maximum and minimum of pitch and heave and the maximums impacts of vertical accelerations at the centre of gravity and at the bow the pdf functions used are the following normal 1 pdf f x 1 σ 2 π e x μ 2 σ 2 were x is the continuous random variable normalized by the process rms μ the mean value and σ the standard deviation of the quantile extreme 2 pdf f x 1 β e x α β e e x α β where α is the location parameter and β is the scale parameter cartwright longuet higgins clh cartwright and longuet higgins 1956 3 pdf f x 1 2 π ε e x 2 2 ε 2 x 1 ε 2 e x 2 2 x 1 ε 2 ε e y 2 2 d y ε 2 1 1 2 r 2 where ε is the bandwidth parameter and r is the determined proportion of negative maxima to total maxima gamma 4 pdf f x x α β 1 e x α α γ β where α is the scale parameter of the random variable β is the shape parameter of the random variable γ β is the gamma function of β the clh extreme and normal was used to represent pitch and heave maxima and minima differently from what reported in begovic et al 2016 and in taunton et al 2011 the residues shown in appendix iii highlights that extreme pdf returns a better fitting than clh to represent maxima of accelerations gamma function were fitted following the literature knowledge but noticing the relevant presence of negative maxima extreme pdf was also adopted on acceleration returning the best fit for the test performed the levenberg marquardt method l m has been used to fit probability density function on experimental data it is fully described in nocedal jorge at al 2006 it consists in a non linear curve fitting method to calculate the best fit parameters that minimize the weighted mean square error between the observations y and the best nonlinear fit y 5 y i f x i a 0 a 1 a 2 where a 0 a 1 a 2 are the parameters the l m method is an evolution of gauss newton method the main difference consists in a positive definite diagonal matrix added to the hessian matrix to avoid the weakness of the singular hessian matrix to evaluate the goodness of fitting the residue has been shown they are defined as the mean square error between the best non linear fit and the observations for the normal pdf a direct estimation of the function is possible evaluating average and standard deviation on the data also cartwright longuet higgins can be estimated directly following the procedure proposed in taunton et al 2011 the direct estimates have been made and the values have been compared with the derived output of the fitting through l m method without finding substantial differences confirming the goodness of the use of the l m method the figs 8 to15 show some examples of fitting of accelerations heave and pitch 5 conclusions this paper shows the results of the experimentation performed on the models of the systematic series nss in irregular sea it completes the performance representation of the systematic series presented in the previous article de luca f pensa c 2017 where the data relating to calm water were provided overall the five models were tested in about forty conditions varying speed and sea state to guarantee an adequate number of wave encounters each condition was tested for no less than fifteen runs jonswap spectra γ 3 3 were chosen because they are suitable for characterizing the weather conditions for which the hulls have been designed model sizes and sea states take into account the different probable dimensions of the ships to which the individual models refer the slender the model the bigger the ship the tests show a strong dependence on the slenderness factor this dependence must be well interpreted remembering that the more elongated models refer to lighter ships in other words referring to the same wave heights the more elongated models have been tested at same values h1 3 lwl but at higher values of h1 3 1 3 appendix i example of application to facilitate the designer work the following example shows the procedure for the evaluation of the performances of a model of the nss in a known ss it is assumed that we want to predict the vertical accelerations on the bow to evaluate the level of comfort on board of a c2s shaped craft with lwls 21 6 m this length implies a scale factor lwls lwlm 15 from tables 1 and 2 we deduce the sailing conditions available on the c2s model considering the test 09 of model c2s we refer to the hardest context tested in towing tank in particular referring to the scale factor 15 we analyse the behavior of the craft at vs 20 4 kn fr 0 928 and waves
