11290,the united arab emirates has a hyper arid climate irrigation is essential for dates phoenix dactylifera l an important crop economically and culturally groundwater is relied on yet it is a non renewable resource at the rate it is being used furthermore as the water table drops it is becoming more saline law no 5 has been passed in abu dhabi to regulate the use of groundwater and set allocation limits for agriculture for assessing the allocation of irrigation water to date farms under law 5 we carried out measurements of tree water use by the compensation heat pulse method complemented by measurements of the changing soil water dynamics using time domain reflectometry and bulk soil electrical conductivity over four years we measured the hourly pattern of lulu date palm water use et c at two levels of irrigation water salinity treatment s1 at 5 ds m 1 and s3 at 15 ds m 1 the mid summer et c for the s1 lulu trees is up to 190 l d 1 on average whereas for the s3 trees et c is lower at 130 l d 1 68 of s1 because of the salt measurements of canopy radiation interception using a light stick showed the s1 trees intercepted 26 of the incident radiation whereas the s3 trees only intercepted 20 ratio s3 s1 76 the date yield of the s1 trees was 68 kg tree 1 but was 46 kg tree 1 for the s3 trees ratio 68 current practice is to irrigate trees with 275 l d 1 irrespective of salinity our recommendation for law 5 is to tailor irrigation to the seasonal demand in the reference evapotranspiration of et o and allow for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction for s1 date palms this would mean an annual average of 210 l d 1 and for s3 just 137 l d 1 this represents savings of 25 50 from current practice keywords date production saline water irrigation hyper arid climate irrigation allocation tree water use 1 introduction the united arab emirates uae has a hyper arid climate with the reference evapotranspiration et o of allen et al 1998 exceeding 2000 mm whilst having an average annual precipitation of around just 50 mm y 1 there are very high summer temperatures often exceeding 40 c and there are virtually no surface water resources groundwater is relied upon for irrigation yet the water tables are falling rapidly primarily due to pumping for agriculture which greatly exceeds the natural recharge rates from the scant rainfall wada et al 2012 reported that in the uae groundwater abstraction is some 1 55 0 3 km3 y 1 and the groundwater resource is being depleted at a rate of 1 18 0 4 km3 y 1 they calculate that 64 of the gross irrigation water demand in the uae is supplied by non renewable groundwater extraction the uae state of the environment report in 2015 moew 2015 reported that groundwater levels had dropped at 10 m per decade until the mid nineties and by a further 70 m since then the agricultural forestry and landscape sectors account for nearly 60 of the annual water demand of 4 2 km3 across all of the uae this global demand is met by desalinated water 42 treated sewage effluent 11 or groundwater 44 dates phoenix dactylifera l are an important crop in the uae both economically and culturally the uae has the largest number of date palms for any single country in the world it has over 40 million date palm trees with a minimum of 200 cultivars 68 of which have commercial importance jaradat and zaid 2004 the uae is the world s 4th largest date producer accounting for 12 of the world s production jaradat and zaid 2004 irrigation of date palm currently accounts for about one third of all groundwater takes in the uae moew 2015 so there are serious challenges in terms of the quantity of groundwater left in the uae furthermore the moew 2015 report also pointed out emerging problems associated with the increasing salinity of the remaining groundwater stocks one of the key strategies for addressing abu dhabi s groundwater sustainability includes regulating for the responsible use of available groundwater in 2017 environment agency abu dhabi ead announced the new law no 5 2016 the groundwater organisation law for the abu dhabi emirate https www ead ae pages resources environmental laws aspx this law clearly states that groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi are owned by the abu dhabi government the main objective of this new law is to ensure proper management of groundwater resources in the emirate with the authorities and new responsibilities given to ead water users will no longer be able to use the groundwater on their property without an ead licence the licence will be granted under regulations contained in law no 5 and ead will specify which wells should have flow meters based on technical conditions that will be set furthermore groundwater extraction limits will be set according to the defined use for the water we have carried out 4 years of research on the water use of date palms that will enable the development of practical advice for improving the use of saline groundwater for irrigation on date farms this can also help with the institutional and regulatory aspects of irrigation water management we show here how our results are being used by ead in the groundwater take regulations that have been promulgated through law 5 in abu dhabi 1 1 background our research on water use by the lulu variety of date palm began with a pilot project in 2014 ead contract 30409 in that 9 month long pilot project we installed sapflow equipment in three lulu date palms in the low salinity irrigation treatment s1 with 5 ds m 1 water treatment s1 also time domain reflectometry tdr rods of varying length were inserted into the soil within the irrigation basins and around it to measure the changing soil water content preliminary results from this work up until august 2014 at the end of the pilot project were presented at the 2015 international horticultural congress al yamani et al 2017 here we just present a brief update of this antecedent research as it provides the context for the results from the current project the main results in this current paper are from the extension project ead contract 31983 which formally began in 2015 although the data from the pilot project continued to be logged over the remaining months of 2014 for completeness we present here the results for the full calendar year of 2014 for lulu s1 in 2015 the extension project then expanded this work to extend the measurements on lulu s1 over 3 more years as well as to measure the palm water use and soil water and salt dynamics of lulu under a high salinity irrigation treatment s3 with 15 ds m 1 water 1 2 objectives the outcome sought by this research carried out under contracts 30409 and 31983 was to provide quantitative values for the allocation of irrigation water to date farms under law 5 as a function of date variety and irrigation water salinity to achieve this we carried out direct measurements of date palm water use by the compensation heat pulse method complemented by measurements of the changing soil water dynamics using tdr our objectives were to measure over several years the daily pattern of lulu date palm water use et c under two levels of irrigation water salinity 5 and 15 ds m 1 these lulu trees were on an 8 8 m spacing to determine the crop factor k c for these date palms so that palm tree water use could be predicted from weather data using the reference evapotranspiration et o to predict the daily irrigation requirements for lulu date palms at these two levels of irrigation salinity for use in guiding the application of law 5 to develop a light stick device to enable proximal sensing of the percent light interception as a surrogate measure of the canopy leaf area of date palms so as to predict the k c for other date palm varieties different tree ages other groundwater salinities and other planting densities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site our field experiments were carried out at the international centre for biosaline agriculture icba 25 09 n 55 39 e 48 m a s l near dubai the date variety lulu was selected from a long term date experiment at icba involving 18 varieties that was started in 2001 and 2002 lulu is one of the more salt tolerant varieties of dates three levels of water salinity were applied s1 5 s2 10 and s3 15 ds m 1 over several years the hourly pattern of etc was measured in treatments s1 and s2 there were five lulu trees in the s1 treatment and five in the s3 treatment the centre three trees of each treatment were instrumented with the outer two acting as guard trees yield data were collected and we report here the results for 2017 the date palms flowered in march and the number of fruit bunches were thinned to between 4 and 9 per tree the harvest of the dates took place during the first two weeks of august 2017 the soil of the field site is a typic torriorthent sandy skeletal hyperthermic soil ad151 abdelfattah 2013 with a sand content of over 90 and a bulk density in the range of 1500 1600 kg m 3 a weather station located at icba measured solar radiation licor 1200 licor inc lincoln nebraska 68504 5000 usa air temperature and relative humidity at 2 m vaisala hmp 45c f1 00421 helsinki finland wind speed at 2 m rm young and rainfall te525 mm l texas electronics dallas texas 75237 using a campbell data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah 84321 1784 usa the weather data are used to estimate hourly and daily values of the reference evapotranspiration eto using the standard crop factor approach fao 56 allen et al 1998 the transpiration of the date palms is related to eto mm day 1 through the dimensionless crop factor k c eq 1 1 e t c k c e t o where et c is the crop water use mm day 1 and k c is determined from the ratio of the measured daily sapflow to the corresponding daily evaporative demand changes in volumetric soil water content θ m3 m 3 were measured using tdr the three waveguide rods were of 5 mm diameter and set 50 mm apart the central rod from each set of waveguides was insulated using glue lined heat shrink tubing to minimise the effects of signal attenuation down the core rod by the saline water there were nine waveguides around each of the three instrumented trees of both treatments inside the irrigation basin were installed four sets of waveguides of 1 m length and two of length 2 m two 1 m long waveguides were installed on the distal side of the berm of the irrigation basin as well one 1 m long set of waveguides was installed midway between two of the irrigation basins to act as reference for the un irrigated soil each waveguide was connected via an rg58u coaxial cable to a multiplexer model sdmx 50 campbell scientific usa a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific usa was used to communicate with the tdr instrument model tdr 100 campbell scientific instruments usa because of the shielded central rod we carried out a laboratory calibration to determine the impact of the insulation on the measured dielectric permittivity ferré et al 1996 so that we could infer θ using the tdr algorithm of baker and allmaras 1990 the shielding also meant that these tdr signals could not be used to infer the soil s bulk electrical conductivity ecb so in addition six campbell scientific cs655 probes were installed at the depth of 150 270 mm in the irrigation basin which surrounds each of the instrumented trees in the lulu s1 and s3 plots prior to installation the probes were calibrated in the laboratory using soil from the site in the laboratory the 120 mm twin rods of the cs655 probes were inserted into sand that had been pre mixed with water at electrical conductivities ec of 0 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 the sand was mixed to either a water content of 10 v v 1 20 v v 1 or 30 v v 1 these data were then used to enable us to infer the soil solution ec from the bulk soil ecb measured by the cs655 probes 2 2 irrigation design and operation irrigation to each tree is supplied via two bubblers with a design flow rate of 10 l min 1 discharging water into a 2 m diameter basin irrigation was applied automatically via a scada system supervisory control and data acquisition schneider electric in two aliquots daily at the times of 0800 and 1500 the salinity of the irrigation water was maintained at 5 ds m 1 for the s1 trees and 15 ds m 1 for the s3 treatment via a mixing system controlled also by the scada the irrigation volumes delivered to the trees were measured with an in line flow meter sensus 620 raleigh north carolina usa in conjunction with our complementary work on the irrigation of amenity forests with saline groundwater in the western desert of abu dhabi al yamani et al 2018 we considered that a sustainable schedule for irrigation of these date palms would be 1 5 et c this would we hypothesised be sufficient by including a 25 factor of safety to account for reticulation inefficiencies and the natural variation in tree size plus another 25 leaching fraction to fulfil the need to leach excess salts from the rootzone after the root uptake of fresh water following the previous irrigation so within both the s1 and s3 treatments we set up in 2016 and 2017 individual treatments on trees were used to assess salt dynamics and leaching in the rootzone in both treatments there were three instrumented trees plus two guard trees the guard trees s 1 and 5 were irrigated at the existing rate of 275 l day 1 right throughout the year the first tree in the treatments 2 was irrigated at proposed sustainable rate of 1 3 et c tree 3 at 1 5 et c and tree 4 at 2 0 et c these values were the weekly average numbers and take into account that there is no irrigation on fridays because of religious considerations we maintained a constant surveillance of our sapflow measurements as they were being collected just in case even the rate of 1 5 et c was too low and might be affecting transpiration et c 2 3 sapflow measurement being a monocotyledon date palm does not have a cambium layer rather the trunk is composed of tough fibrous vascular bundles cemented together in a matrix of cellular tissue which is mostly lignified near the outer part of the trunk the outer 3 4 cm of trunk is not involved in water transport and sap flow tends to be fastest near the centre of the trunk zaid and arias jimenez 2002 long probes were used to measure the flow across the inner parts of the trunk sperling et al 2012 used the heat dissipation method to monitor sapflow in date palms and they found that they had to correct the granier equation to account for the radially different pattern of sapflow in a monocotyledon madurapperuma et al 2009 successfully used both the compensation heat pulse cphm and heat ratio hrm methods to measure the transpiration of the small fronds 20 60 mm diameter of potted ornamental palm trees our 16 year old production palm trees have trunks 10 times that size and the higher sap flux densities mm s 1 would require use of the cphm rather than the hrm so we used the chpm with extra long probes so that we could indeed determine the radial pattern of flows and account for this our calculation of tree water use al muaini et al 2018 a total of twelve sets of sapflow probes model hp4tc tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north new zealand were used in this experiment to measure transpiration losses from the date palms four sets of probes were placed in three neighbouring trees of both treatments s1 and s3 that had trunk diameters of 0 4 0 55 m specially designed sensors made from 15 g stainless hypo tube with thermocouples at depths of 5 7 5 10 and 12 5 cm were constructed for these experiments the probes were installed in the trunk at a height of approximately 1 0 m the trunk was then wrapped in aluminium foil for thermal insulation the chpm green et al 2003 was used with a standard spacing of 5 mm upstream and 10 mm downstream from the heater probe a campbell data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah usa was used to measure the time taken to achieve thermal equilibrium between sensors located above and below the heater t z s following the application of a 4 0 s heat pulse data were collected at 30 min intervals sapflow l h 1 was calculated from measurements of t z using the approach outlined by green et al 2003 2008 these calculations included a correction for the effect of wounding here we used a wound diameter of 2 8 mm for the 2 0 mm diameter drill holes sap flux density mm s 1 was then deduced from the wound corrected heat pulse velocity and measured volumetric fractions of wood and water within the sapwood the fractions of wood fm and water fl in the sapwood were determined gravimetrically from core samples fm 0 35 and fl 0 60 transpiration etc was determined by multiplying the sap flux density by the conducting wood area using the simple annulus approach suggested by hatton et al 1990 working with electronic equipment in a hyper arid environment with temperatures up to 50 c along with the occasional sandstorm can present many technical issues we encountered some intermittent issues associated with batteries and loggers on our lulu experiments and so some of our data records have gaps nonetheless we have been able to assemble high quality datasets of biophysical results on tree water use soil water and salt dynamics and the interactions between trees and their environment this information is valuable for refining irrigation practices to conserve water 2 4 canopy radiation interception canopy radiation interception can be estimated from static or mobile arrays of quantum sensors using beer s law we have developed a hand held light stick that can be used in an understory transit to record the percentage of visible light being transmitted through the canopy the percentage of light intercepted as calculated from our light stick measurements provides a surrogate measure of the canopy size and leaf density the light stick tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north nz is 1 m long with 20 equi spaced quantum sensors that are sensitive to photosynthetically active radiation par a reference value for the incoming par was first measured outside the date palm plot then the corresponding value of transmitted par light was measured on the ground while traversing a fixed transect the transmitted light value was obtained from the average of multiple scans of the sensors at 2 hz whilst walking along a well defined transit comprising multiple shadows from the trees along a row each transit lasted 30 s and took in the shadow areas of 3 4 trees multiple transits of 4 5 sweeps depending on sun angle were used to cover the full shadow areas of the row of the 3 4 trees in each treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 palm tree water use s1 the measured pattern of tree water use et c l h 1 in one of the lulu s1 trees during a week in late summer of 2014 just after the end of the pilot project is shown in fig 1 also shown is the pattern in the reference evapotranspiration et o mm d 1 as calculated from the weather station nearby allen et al 1998 the respective ordinates have been scaled so as to achieve the closest overlap to reveal how the weather is driving tree water use fig 1 the daily values in the et c l d 1 for all three trees and et o mm d 1 data for the whole of the calendar year of 2014 were regressed against each other with the reference et o as the independent variable fig 2 the slope of the line of the regression when divided by the area covered by each tree 64 m2 is the crop coefficient eq 1 which here means that for these lulu s1 trees k c 0 29 the food and agriculture organisation s guidelines of fao 56 allen et al 1998 report that in general for dates it is considered that k c should be 0 95 this difference is not surprising because data cultivation around the world involves different varieties different tree spacings and can be irrigated with waters of differing salinities such a variation provides a salutary warning about using literature values universally for a given crop without taking into consideration variation in canopy characteristics and irrigation salinities we discuss solutions to this challenge later in the paper we show in fig 3 the full year s progression throughout 2014 in the et c l d 1 predicted using the fao 56 reference et o with a k c of 0 29 with the 8 8 m spacing the sapflow measured water use of the lulu s1 trees is also shown the impact of 3 separate days of rain a rarity in the uae can be seen in february and march furthermore some irregularities in the management of the irrigation system can also be seen in early august and early september we will discuss the impact of the irrigation management system on tree water use later on as we encountered a similar problem in 2016 and there we obtained insight into how dependent these trees are on receiving the correct amount of water from the seasonal traces in fig 3 we can see that these then 13 year old date palm trees were using up to a peak over 150 l d 1 in mid summer and with minima of about 50 60 l d 1 during winter throughout the year all of these trees were in general receiving 275 l d 1 of irrigation notwithstanding a few technical problems with the pre scada irrigation controllers in august and september from the middle of 2015 a new scada controlled irrigation system was installed this system did not become fully operational until the middle of 2016 so we will not present the 2015 data here we present in fig 4 the measured daily tree water use values averaged for trees 2 and 3 for the latter part of 2016 and early 2017 we had problems with the heater probes and their circuitry for trees 1 and 4 so these data were not included in the daily water use values of fig 4 also shown in fig 4 for comparison is the envelope curve of the maximum 1 25 et c for the lulu s1 trees from fig 3 the inter year comparison is good the measured weekly water use of the lulu palms in 2016 lies within the safety factor we have allowed in our irrigation calculations notwithstanding the additional 25 leaching fraction we have allowed for salts fig 4 shows an obvious drop off and a subsequent recovery in the tree water use during early september we will explore this feature in greater detail by looking at how the water use of tree 3 relates to the changing pattern of soil water content around the irrigation basin as measured using tdr our exploration will reveal how date palms in this hyper arid environment are critically dependent on good water management in fig 5 we plot the diurnal pattern of tree 3 s water use et c l hr 1 in relation to the daily trends in global radiation q w m 2 there are two standard irrigations morning and afternoon on sunday 11th september however the irrigation system failed to work on monday 12th the twice daily irrigations were not fully restored until sunday 18th although there were single irrigations on the 15th and 17th and there was no irrigation on the 16th because it was a friday the tree water uses on the first two days of failure the 12th and 13th were little affected by the lack of irrigation as the tree would have been drawing water from the already wet soil of the basin and the wetted soil around the periphery of the berm however sometime in mid morning of the third day the 14th the tree water use of the tree dropped precipitously and this trend continued over the next few days although it was somewhat stabilised by the half irrigations on the 15th and 17th however even when full irrigation schedule was restored on the 18th a rapid recovery in sapflow did not occur rather a full recovery back to pre failure levels of tree water use did not occur until around the 18th october which is more than one month after the original mishap occurred fig 4 our tdr observations of the spatial pattern of soil water dynamics in the top 1 m around the irrigation basin can explain this month long lag in recovery despite full irrigation being restored after just 6 days this accidental exploration also reveals insights into the rootzone dynamics that underpin regulated deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 and partial rootzone drying dry and loveys 1998 both of which rely upon root signalling davies and zhang 1991 prior to the failure of the irrigation system on monday 12th on friday 9th the soil water content in the top meter within the basin and on the outer side of the berm dropped fig 6 this is normal on fridays as there is never any irrigation for religious reasons however the irrigations on the following saturday and sunday lifted both soil water contents at both locations back to the previous thursday s levels following the irrigation failure on monday 12th both soil water contents dropped the half irrigations on the 15th and 17th only served to stabilise the basin water content whereas the distal berm water content continued to drop presumably as the tree roots were drawing water from the periphery the return to full irrigation on the 18th quickly returned the basin water content to its antecedent value of around 0 3 l l 1 however the water content on the outside of the berm remained low and so the roots there and beyond would have still been in quite dry soil it took until the 16th october for the berm soil water content to get back to 0 3 l l 1 so the tree roots here and beyond would have spent a long time in dry soil conditions the soil water content measured by the reference tdrs located at the midpoint between the trees remained at around 5 6 throughout the whole year indicating an absence of roots and water uptake long after the tree s central core of roots was restored to well watered conditions there would have been tree roots resident in dry soil for several weeks during which time the soil solution ec would have become elevated it would seem that signalling from these drier and saltier roots resulted in the tree delaying its recovery back to the rates of water use that had prevailed prior to the irrigation failure figs 4 and 5 this unforeseen episode reveals that date palms in hyper arid environments are crucially dependent on well managed irrigation this result also reveals how soil water salt dynamics and root signalling can lead to alterations in soil plant atmosphere water relations good management of water and salt are imperatives for best irrigation practice more especially so in hyper arid and saline environments 3 2 palm tree water use s3 during parts of both 2015 and 2017 we managed to obtain good measurements of the tree water on trees 2 and 3 of the lulu s3 treatment with 15 ds m 1 irrigation water there were problems with irrigation management in early 2015 and issues with water damage to the electronics of the sap flow and data logging equipment in 2017 a composite graph of the reliable water use data for the average of trees 2 and 3 in the s3 treatment is presented in fig 7 whereas the peak tree water use in the s1 treatment was in mid summer about 190 l d 1 fig 4 for the s3 treatment the peak water use was just 130 l d 1 fig 7 or some 68 of s1 thus the crop coefficient for these s3 trees is k c 0 20 this difference highlights the impact that the higher salinity irrigation water has had on tree height and canopy size as we detail later the result quantifies how salinity affects the value of the appropriate crop coefficient for use in the fao 56 calculation of crop irrigation requirements we discuss later as to how this salinity effect may be more easily inferred without the need for detailed measurements of sapflow 3 3 salt dynamics to determine whether our proposed salt leaching fraction of 0 25 et c would be sufficient we monitored the salt dynamics in both the s1 and s3 treatments using cs655 probes we applied irrigation at a daily rate of 1 5 etc to one of the trees in each treatment the cs655 probes were calibrated in the laboratory and the results for the four soil solution ecs and the three levels of soil water content are shown in fig 8 for simplicity so as to assess whether or not there was a build up of salt under the irrigation regime of 1 5 et c we considered a simple linear relation between solution ec and the cs655 measured bulk ecb combined with a parabolic relationship to account for changes in water content θ eq 2 2 e c e c b 0 829 2 964 θ 6 953 θ 2 0 087 temperature effects were not taken into account to enable easier comparison between the s1 and s3 treatments the half hourly ec measurements were normalised to the maximum ec recorded just prior to the first irrigation on saturday 20th this is the time when the pore water ec was at its peak since there were no irrigations on the friday the results for a 3 week window in late may are shown in fig 9 as expected for both treatments the drop in ec with the first morning irrigation is rapid and then it rises again throughout the morning until the afternoon irrigation drops the ec to its lowest level the weekly maximum value is always on the morning of saturday there appears to be no trend in salt build up in either treatment during this early summer period when the rates of crop water use are close to maximum these observations confirm that our proposed use of irrigation at 1 5 et c as being a sustainable rate of irrigation with regard to effective leaching salts following daily root water uptake by the date palms prior to next irrigation this corroborates our finding with the drip irrigation of amenity forests in abu dhabi at the rate of 1 5 et c with saline groundwater of ec about 10 ds m 1 al yamani et al 2018 3 4 tree canopy characteristics the visual differences between the s1 and s3 trees were patent the characteristics of the 5 trees from both treatments are given in table 1 and for completeness we also present there the results for the trees in treatment s2 where the irrigation water had an ec of 10 ds m 1 the dimensions of the trees and the yield of dates were measured during the first half of august 2017 across all 3 treatments s1 s2 and s3 the s1 trees were harvested on 3rd august s2 on the 10th august and s3 on the 20th august the circumferences of the trees were not affected by the different salinities however the tree heights and the leaf areas were both strongly affected with the s1 trees at 3 5 m tall and 62 1 m2 of leaf the s2 at 3 0 m and 56 2 m2 and the s3 trees at 2 6 m and 41 7 m2 the ratio of the tree heights between s3 and s1 is 73 and the corresponding ratio of leaf areas is 67 which would be indicative of the trees biomasses since the circumferences were similar this is the similar to the ratio of the tree water uses presented above viz 68 the lulu s1 trees yielded 67 5 kg of dates per tree whereas the s3 trees produced just 45 9 kg each the date yield ratio s1 s3 of 68 is also essentially the same as the ratio of the tree leaf areas and the tree water uses as expected hanks 1983 the annual amount of irrigation applied to each of the s1 trees was 86 kl whereas the water use by the s1 trees was just 51 1 kl for the s3 trees the irrigation schedule applied 65 of the s1 treatment or some 56 kl and the measured water use was only 36 8 kl so the date productivity in relation to water applied for the s1 trees was 0 78 kg kl 1 and 0 82 kg kl 1 for the s3 trees in other words we observed similar productivity in relation to the amount of water transpired the productivity in terms of water applied would be much lower in s3 when the standard irrigation amount was applied therefore for best management of the groundwater resource irrigation practices need to be improved to match irrigation better the size of the date palms 3 5 light stick and canopy light interception the results from the intensive use of the light stick on the 19th september 2015 are shown in fig 10 the diurnal trace of the incident par is shown red dots as is par measured by the light stick from multiple passes underneath both the s1 trees top and s3 trees bottom from the average of these traces we calculate that the for the s1 trees some 74 of the incident light is transmitted through to the ground surface the light interception li is therefore 26 for the smaller s3 trees li 20 the ratio of the li between s3 and s1 is 76 which is of the same order as the ratio of the leaf areas 67 table 1 as well as the tree water use ratio 68 and the difference in date yield 68 thus the easy measurement of li by the light stick provides us with a good measure of the palm trees canopy characteristics and tree performance furthermore we can use li to infer the crop coefficient k c using the effective area of shade eas approach of goodwin et al 2006 their eas is our li the use of this technique for dates are shown in table 2 for the s1 and s3 treatments from the light stick measured li and the sapflow measured k c values we calculate the ratio of k c li to be 1 12 for the s1 dates and 1 00 for the s3 treatment these ratios fit within the reported range in the values for k c li of 1 1 2 for apples o connell et al 2008 peaches goodwin et al 2006 and pears goodwin et al 2015 so in the future we will use our light stick measurements of li to infer the k c values for different date varieties different tree ages and different planting densities 3 6 law 5 and irrigation allocations in 2017 in order to protect groundwater ead announced the government s new law no 5 2016 the groundwater organisation law for the abu dhabi emirate groundwater extraction limits and usage allowances will be set under law 5 we now describe the initial assessments of the usage allowances that we have suggested to ead to be considered in the regulations for the irrigation of lulu date palms with water of different salinities for groundwater irrigation we consider this should involve seasonally adjusted replacement of the trees daily water use et c rather than just a single daily rate applied throughout the year as happens now furthermore we have suggested that there be an add on of 25 as a factor of safety to account for inefficiencies in the irrigation reticulation system and also the natural variation in tree sizes as well we have suggested another 25 add on to ensure salt leaching which we have verified here as being sufficient to avoid a build up of salts even with irrigation water at 15 ds m 1 for simplicity we suggest that the 1 5 et c values be aggregated into monthly averages with the monthly maximum et c to be used as the reference value for that month the et c values are easily estimated using the fao 56 et o and the knowledge of the crop factor kc that we have presented here for the s1 and s3 treatments the suggested monthly allocations based on 1 5 et c are shown in table 3 in annual sum the average daily water use of the s1 trees is 140 l day 1 using the seasonally adjusted 1 5 et c allocation would provide on annual average a daily application of 210 l day 1 some 25 less than the current application of 275 l day 1 and a saving of 25 for the smaller s3 trees the annually averaged daily water allocation need only be 137 l day 1 a saving of 50 by taking into account their smaller tree sizes we have provided practical information for the implementation of law 5 however this only relates to one variety lulu at one tree spacing 8 8 m at two salinities 5 and 15 ds m 1 the challenge that we are now working on is to extend these findings to other varieties of different ages and spacings and at different groundwater salinities the key tool for a practical assessment of leaf canopy size and hence the crop factor will be our light stick which can through proximal sensing provide us with information on the light interception characteristics of the various canopy structures and tree sizes across commercial date farms in abu dhabi these data will enable us to infer the crop coefficient k c which we can then use in fao 56 to suggest irrigation allocations at 1 5 et c 4 conclusions currently saline groundwater is used in the uae to irrigate date palms the common practice is to irrigate each tree with 275 l day 1 throughout the year except on fridays for religious reasons we have shown through experiments with lulu date palms using sapflow measurements of daily tree water use et c that for 5 ds m 1 water date palm water use et c is up to 190 l day 1 in summer and down to 80 l day 1 in winter with 15 ds m 1 irrigation water tree water use is just 68 of that rate we had proposed that sustainable irrigation would be 1 5 et c by taking into account a 25 factor of safety and 25 salt leaching fraction our in situ measurements confirm that with this rate there is no noticeable build up of salt within the irrigation basin part of the rootzone even at the higher salinity we did however measure high salinities outside the basins along the periphery of the wetted zone where the salt had been shunted laterally we have shown that our device that we have called the light stick can be used for proximal sensing of the trees shadow areas to estimate the canopy intercepted radiation these interception data can be used to infer the crop coefficient k c in the fao 56 model for predicting tree water use from the reference evapotranspiration et o these results are being used in formulation of irrigation allocation allowances in law 5 2016 the groundwater organisation law recently passed by the government of abu dhabi we are extending these findings to other date varieties tree sizes and spacings and for groundwaters of different salinities in the form of a decision support tool for ead to be applied across the abu dhabi emirate to support law 5 for

11290,the united arab emirates has a hyper arid climate irrigation is essential for dates phoenix dactylifera l an important crop economically and culturally groundwater is relied on yet it is a non renewable resource at the rate it is being used furthermore as the water table drops it is becoming more saline law no 5 has been passed in abu dhabi to regulate the use of groundwater and set allocation limits for agriculture for assessing the allocation of irrigation water to date farms under law 5 we carried out measurements of tree water use by the compensation heat pulse method complemented by measurements of the changing soil water dynamics using time domain reflectometry and bulk soil electrical conductivity over four years we measured the hourly pattern of lulu date palm water use et c at two levels of irrigation water salinity treatment s1 at 5 ds m 1 and s3 at 15 ds m 1 the mid summer et c for the s1 lulu trees is up to 190 l d 1 on average whereas for the s3 trees et c is lower at 130 l d 1 68 of s1 because of the salt measurements of canopy radiation interception using a light stick showed the s1 trees intercepted 26 of the incident radiation whereas the s3 trees only intercepted 20 ratio s3 s1 76 the date yield of the s1 trees was 68 kg tree 1 but was 46 kg tree 1 for the s3 trees ratio 68 current practice is to irrigate trees with 275 l d 1 irrespective of salinity our recommendation for law 5 is to tailor irrigation to the seasonal demand in the reference evapotranspiration of et o and allow for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction for s1 date palms this would mean an annual average of 210 l d 1 and for s3 just 137 l d 1 this represents savings of 25 50 from current practice keywords date production saline water irrigation hyper arid climate irrigation allocation tree water use 1 introduction the united arab emirates uae has a hyper arid climate with the reference evapotranspiration et o of allen et al 1998 exceeding 2000 mm whilst having an average annual precipitation of around just 50 mm y 1 there are very high summer temperatures often exceeding 40 c and there are virtually no surface water resources groundwater is relied upon for irrigation yet the water tables are falling rapidly primarily due to pumping for agriculture which greatly exceeds the natural recharge rates from the scant rainfall wada et al 2012 reported that in the uae groundwater abstraction is some 1 55 0 3 km3 y 1 and the groundwater resource is being depleted at a rate of 1 18 0 4 km3 y 1 they calculate that 64 of the gross irrigation water demand in the uae is supplied by non renewable groundwater extraction the uae state of the environment report in 2015 moew 2015 reported that groundwater levels had dropped at 10 m per decade until the mid nineties and by a further 70 m since then the agricultural forestry and landscape sectors account for nearly 60 of the annual water demand of 4 2 km3 across all of the uae this global demand is met by desalinated water 42 treated sewage effluent 11 or groundwater 44 dates phoenix dactylifera l are an important crop in the uae both economically and culturally the uae has the largest number of date palms for any single country in the world it has over 40 million date palm trees with a minimum of 200 cultivars 68 of which have commercial importance jaradat and zaid 2004 the uae is the world s 4th largest date producer accounting for 12 of the world s production jaradat and zaid 2004 irrigation of date palm currently accounts for about one third of all groundwater takes in the uae moew 2015 so there are serious challenges in terms of the quantity of groundwater left in the uae furthermore the moew 2015 report also pointed out emerging problems associated with the increasing salinity of the remaining groundwater stocks one of the key strategies for addressing abu dhabi s groundwater sustainability includes regulating for the responsible use of available groundwater in 2017 environment agency abu dhabi ead announced the new law no 5 2016 the groundwater organisation law for the abu dhabi emirate https www ead ae pages resources environmental laws aspx this law clearly states that groundwater resources in the emirate of abu dhabi are owned by the abu dhabi government the main objective of this new law is to ensure proper management of groundwater resources in the emirate with the authorities and new responsibilities given to ead water users will no longer be able to use the groundwater on their property without an ead licence the licence will be granted under regulations contained in law no 5 and ead will specify which wells should have flow meters based on technical conditions that will be set furthermore groundwater extraction limits will be set according to the defined use for the water we have carried out 4 years of research on the water use of date palms that will enable the development of practical advice for improving the use of saline groundwater for irrigation on date farms this can also help with the institutional and regulatory aspects of irrigation water management we show here how our results are being used by ead in the groundwater take regulations that have been promulgated through law 5 in abu dhabi 1 1 background our research on water use by the lulu variety of date palm began with a pilot project in 2014 ead contract 30409 in that 9 month long pilot project we installed sapflow equipment in three lulu date palms in the low salinity irrigation treatment s1 with 5 ds m 1 water treatment s1 also time domain reflectometry tdr rods of varying length were inserted into the soil within the irrigation basins and around it to measure the changing soil water content preliminary results from this work up until august 2014 at the end of the pilot project were presented at the 2015 international horticultural congress al yamani et al 2017 here we just present a brief update of this antecedent research as it provides the context for the results from the current project the main results in this current paper are from the extension project ead contract 31983 which formally began in 2015 although the data from the pilot project continued to be logged over the remaining months of 2014 for completeness we present here the results for the full calendar year of 2014 for lulu s1 in 2015 the extension project then expanded this work to extend the measurements on lulu s1 over 3 more years as well as to measure the palm water use and soil water and salt dynamics of lulu under a high salinity irrigation treatment s3 with 15 ds m 1 water 1 2 objectives the outcome sought by this research carried out under contracts 30409 and 31983 was to provide quantitative values for the allocation of irrigation water to date farms under law 5 as a function of date variety and irrigation water salinity to achieve this we carried out direct measurements of date palm water use by the compensation heat pulse method complemented by measurements of the changing soil water dynamics using tdr our objectives were to measure over several years the daily pattern of lulu date palm water use et c under two levels of irrigation water salinity 5 and 15 ds m 1 these lulu trees were on an 8 8 m spacing to determine the crop factor k c for these date palms so that palm tree water use could be predicted from weather data using the reference evapotranspiration et o to predict the daily irrigation requirements for lulu date palms at these two levels of irrigation salinity for use in guiding the application of law 5 to develop a light stick device to enable proximal sensing of the percent light interception as a surrogate measure of the canopy leaf area of date palms so as to predict the k c for other date palm varieties different tree ages other groundwater salinities and other planting densities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site our field experiments were carried out at the international centre for biosaline agriculture icba 25 09 n 55 39 e 48 m a s l near dubai the date variety lulu was selected from a long term date experiment at icba involving 18 varieties that was started in 2001 and 2002 lulu is one of the more salt tolerant varieties of dates three levels of water salinity were applied s1 5 s2 10 and s3 15 ds m 1 over several years the hourly pattern of etc was measured in treatments s1 and s2 there were five lulu trees in the s1 treatment and five in the s3 treatment the centre three trees of each treatment were instrumented with the outer two acting as guard trees yield data were collected and we report here the results for 2017 the date palms flowered in march and the number of fruit bunches were thinned to between 4 and 9 per tree the harvest of the dates took place during the first two weeks of august 2017 the soil of the field site is a typic torriorthent sandy skeletal hyperthermic soil ad151 abdelfattah 2013 with a sand content of over 90 and a bulk density in the range of 1500 1600 kg m 3 a weather station located at icba measured solar radiation licor 1200 licor inc lincoln nebraska 68504 5000 usa air

cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah 84321 1784 usa the weather data are used to estimate hourly and daily values of the reference evapotranspiration eto using the standard crop factor approach fao 56 allen et al 1998 the transpiration of the date palms is related to eto mm day 1 through the dimensionless crop factor k c eq 1 1 e t c k c e t o where et c is the crop water use mm day 1 and k c is determined from the ratio of the measured daily sapflow to the corresponding daily evaporative demand changes in volumetric soil water content θ m3 m 3 were measured using tdr the three waveguide rods were of 5 mm diameter and set 50 mm apart the central rod from each set of waveguides was insulated using glue lined heat shrink tubing to minimise the effects of signal attenuation down the core rod by the saline water there were nine waveguides around each of the three instrumented trees of both treatments inside the irrigation basin were installed four sets of waveguides of 1 m length and two of length 2 m two 1 m long waveguides were installed on the distal side of the berm of the irrigation basin as well one 1 m long set of waveguides was installed midway between two of the irrigation basins to act as reference for the un irrigated soil each waveguide was connected via an rg58u coaxial cable to a multiplexer model sdmx 50 campbell scientific usa a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific usa was used to communicate with the tdr instrument model tdr 100 campbell scientific instruments usa because of the shielded central rod we carried out a laboratory calibration to determine the impact of the insulation on the measured dielectric permittivity ferré et al 1996 so that we could infer θ using the tdr algorithm of baker and allmaras 1990 the shielding also meant that these tdr signals could not be used to infer the soil s bulk electrical conductivity ecb so in addition six campbell scientific cs655 probes were installed at the depth of 150 270 mm in the irrigation basin which surrounds each of the instrumented trees in the lulu s1 and s3 plots prior to installation the probes were calibrated in the laboratory using soil from the site in the laboratory the 120 mm twin rods of the cs655 probes were inserted into sand that had been pre mixed with water at electrical conductivities ec of 0 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 the sand was mixed to either a water content of 10 v v 1 20 v v 1 or 30 v v 1 these data were then used to enable us to infer the soil solution ec from the bulk soil ecb measured by the cs655 probes 2 2 irrigation design and operation irrigation to each tree is supplied via two bubblers with a design flow rate of 10 l min 1 discharging water into a 2 m diameter basin irrigation was applied automatically via a scada system supervisory control and data acquisition schneider electric in two aliquots daily at the times of 0800 and 1500 the salinity of the irrigation water was maintained at 5 ds m 1 for the s1 trees and 15 ds m 1 for the s3 treatment via a mixing system controlled also by the scada the irrigation volumes delivered to the trees were measured with an in line flow meter sensus 620 raleigh north carolina usa in conjunction with our complementary work on the irrigation of amenity forests with saline groundwater in the western desert of abu dhabi al yamani et al 2018 we considered that a sustainable schedule for irrigation of these date palms would be 1 5 et c this would we hypothesised be sufficient by including a 25 factor of safety to account for reticulation inefficiencies and the natural variation in tree size plus another 25 leaching fraction to fulfil the need to leach excess salts from the rootzone after the root uptake of fresh water following the previous irrigation so within both the s1 and s3 treatments we set up in 2016 and 2017 individual treatments on trees were used to assess salt dynamics and leaching in the rootzone in both treatments there were three instrumented trees plus two guard trees the guard trees s 1 and 5 were irrigated at the existing rate of 275 l day 1 right throughout the year the first tree in the treatments 2 was irrigated at proposed sustainable rate of 1 3 et c tree 3 at 1 5 et c and tree 4 at 2 0 et c these values were the weekly average numbers and take into account that there is no irrigation on fridays because of religious considerations we maintained a constant surveillance of our sapflow measurements as they were being collected just in case even the rate of 1 5 et c was too low and might be affecting transpiration et c 2 3 sapflow measurement being a monocotyledon date palm does not have a cambium layer rather the trunk is composed of tough fibrous vascular bundles cemented together in a matrix of cellular tissue which is mostly lignified near the outer part of the trunk the outer 3 4 cm of trunk is not involved in water transport and sap flow tends to be fastest near the centre of the trunk zaid and arias jimenez 2002 long probes were used to measure the flow across the inner parts of the trunk sperling et al 2012 used the heat dissipation method to monitor sapflow in date palms and they found that they had to correct the granier equation to account for the radially different pattern of sapflow in a monocotyledon madurapperuma et al 2009 successfully used both the compensation heat pulse cphm and heat ratio hrm methods to measure the transpiration of the small fronds 20 60 mm diameter of potted ornamental palm trees our 16 year old production palm trees have trunks 10 times that size and the higher sap flux densities mm s 1 would require use of the cphm rather than the hrm so we used the chpm with extra long probes so that we could indeed determine the radial pattern of flows and account for this our calculation of tree water use al muaini et al 2018 a total of twelve sets of sapflow probes model hp4tc tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north new zealand were used in this experiment to measure transpiration losses from the date palms four sets of probes were placed in three neighbouring trees of both treatments s1 and s3 that had trunk diameters of 0 4 0 55 m specially designed sensors made from 15 g stainless hypo tube with thermocouples at depths of 5 7 5 10 and 12 5 cm were constructed for these experiments the probes were installed in the trunk at a height of approximately 1 0 m the trunk was then wrapped in aluminium foil for thermal insulation the chpm green et al 2003 was used with a standard spacing of 5 mm upstream and 10 mm downstream from the heater probe a campbell data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah usa was used to measure the time taken to achieve thermal equilibrium between sensors located above and below the heater t z s following the application of a 4 0 s heat pulse data were collected at 30 min intervals sapflow l h 1 was calculated from measurements of t z using the approach outlined by green et al 2003 2008 these calculations included a correction for the effect of wounding here we used a wound diameter of 2 8 mm for the 2 0 mm diameter drill holes sap flux density mm s 1 was then deduced from the wound corrected heat pulse velocity and measured volumetric fractions of wood and water within the sapwood the fractions of wood fm and water fl in the sapwood were determined gravimetrically from core samples fm 0 35 and fl 0 60 transpiration etc was determined by multiplying the sap flux density by the conducting wood area using the simple annulus approach suggested by hatton et al 1990 working with electronic equipment in a hyper arid environment with temperatures up to 50 c along with the occasional sandstorm can present many technical issues we encountered some intermittent issues associated with batteries and loggers on our lulu experiments and so some of our data records have gaps nonetheless we have been able to assemble high quality datasets of biophysical results on tree water use soil water and salt dynamics and the interactions between trees and their environment this information is valuable for refining irrigation practices to conserve water 2 4 canopy radiation interception canopy radiation interception can be estimated from static or mobile arrays of quantum sensors using beer s law we have developed a hand held light stick that can be used in an understory transit to record the percentage of visible light being transmitted through the canopy the percentage of light intercepted as calculated from our light stick measurements provides a surrogate measure of the canopy size and leaf density the light stick tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north nz is 1 m long with 20 equi spaced quantum sensors that are sensitive to photosynthetically active radiation par a reference value for the incoming par was first measured outside the date palm plot then the corresponding value of transmitted par light was measured on the ground while traversing a fixed transect the transmitted light value was obtained from the average of multiple scans of the sensors at 2 hz whilst walking along a well defined transit comprising multiple shadows from the trees along a row each transit lasted 30 s and took in the shadow areas of 3 4 trees multiple transits of 4 5 sweeps depending on sun angle were used to cover the full shadow areas of the row of the 3 4 trees in each treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 palm tree water use s1 the measured pattern of tree water use et c l h 1 in one of the lulu s1 trees during a week in late summer of 2014 just after the end of the pilot project is shown in fig 1 also shown is the pattern in the reference evapotranspiration et o mm d 1 as calculated from the weather station nearby allen et al 1998 the respective ordinates have been scaled so as to achieve the closest overlap to reveal how the weather is driving tree water use fig 1 the daily values in the et c l d 1 for all three trees and et o mm d 1 data for the whole of the calendar year of 2014 were regressed against each other with the reference et o as the independent variable fig 2 the slope of the line of the regression when divided by the area covered by each tree 64 m2 is the crop coefficient eq 1 which here means that for these lulu s1 trees k c 0 29 the food and agriculture organisation s guidelines of fao 56 allen et al 1998 report that in general for dates it is considered that k c should be 0 95 this difference is not surprising because data cultivation around the world involves different varieties different tree spacings and can be irrigated with waters of differing salinities such a variation provides a salutary warning about using literature values universally for a given crop without taking into consideration variation in canopy characteristics and irrigation salinities we discuss solutions to this challenge later in the paper we show in fig 3 the full year s progression throughout 2014 in the et c l d 1 predicted using the fao 56 reference et o with a k c of 0 29 with the 8 8 m spacing the sapflow measured water use of the lulu s1 trees is also shown the impact of 3 separate days of rain a rarity in the uae can be seen in february and march furthermore some irregularities in the management of the irrigation system can also be seen in early august and early september we will discuss the impact of the irrigation management system on tree water use later on as we encountered a similar problem in 2016 and there we obtained insight into how dependent these trees are on receiving the correct amount of water from the seasonal traces in fig 3 we can see that these then 13 year old date palm trees were using up to a peak over 150 l d 1 in mid summer and with minima of about 50 60 l d 1 during winter throughout the year all of these trees were in general receiving 275 l d 1 of irrigation notwithstanding a few technical problems with the pre scada irrigation controllers in august and september from the middle of 2015 a new scada controlled irrigation system was installed this system did not become fully operational until the middle of 2016 so we will not present the 2015 data here we present in fig 4 the measured daily tree water use values averaged for trees 2 and 3 for the latter part of 2016 and early 2017 we had problems with the heater probes and their circuitry for trees 1 and 4 so these data were not included in the daily water use values of fig 4 also shown in fig 4 for comparison is the envelope curve of the maximum 1 25 et c for the lulu s1 trees from fig 3 the inter year comparison is good the measured weekly water use of the lulu palms in 2016 lies within the safety factor we have allowed in our irrigation calculations notwithstanding the additional 25 leaching fraction we have allowed for salts fig 4 shows an obvious drop off and a subsequent recovery in the tree water use during early september we will explore this feature in greater detail by looking at how the water use of tree 3 relates to the changing pattern of soil water content around the irrigation basin as measured using tdr our exploration will reveal how date palms in this hyper arid environment are critically dependent on good water management in fig 5 we plot the diurnal pattern of tree 3 s water use et c l hr 1 in relation to the daily trends in global radiation q w m 2 there are two standard irrigations morning and afternoon on sunday 11th september however the irrigation system failed to work on monday 12th the twice daily irrigations were not fully restored until sunday 18th although there were single irrigations on the 15th and 17th and there was no irrigation on the 16th because it was a friday the tree water uses on the first two days of failure the 12th and 13th were little affected by the lack of irrigation as the tree would have been drawing water from the already wet soil of the basin and the wetted soil around the periphery of the berm however sometime in mid morning of the third day the 14th the tree water use of the tree dropped precipitously and this trend continued over the next few days although it was somewhat stabilised by the half irrigations on the 15th and 17th however even when full irrigation schedule was restored on the 18th a rapid recovery in sapflow did not occur rather a full recovery back to pre failure levels of tree water use did not occur until around the 18th october which is more than one month after the original mishap occurred fig 4 our tdr observations of the spatial pattern of soil water dynamics in the top 1 m around the irrigation basin can explain this month long lag in recovery despite full irrigation being restored after just 6 days this accidental exploration also reveals insights into the rootzone dynamics that underpin regulated deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 and partial rootzone drying dry and loveys 1998 both of which rely upon root signalling davies and zhang 1991 prior to the failure of the irrigation system on monday 12th on friday 9th the soil water content in the top meter within the basin and on the outer side of the berm dropped fig 6 this is normal on fridays as there is never any irrigation for religious reasons however the irrigations on the following saturday and sunday lifted both soil water contents at both locations back to the previous thursday s levels following the irrigation failure on monday 12th both soil water contents dropped the half irrigations on the 15th and 17th only served to stabilise the basin water content whereas the distal berm water content continued to drop presumably as the tree roots were drawing water from the periphery the return to full irrigation on the 18th quickly returned the basin water content to its antecedent value of around 0 3 l l 1 however the water content on the outside of the berm remained low and so the roots there and beyond would have still been in quite dry soil it took until the 16th october for the berm soil water content to get back to 0 3 l l 1 so the tree roots here and beyond would have spent a long time in dry soil conditions the soil water content measured by the reference tdrs located at the midpoint between the trees remained at around 5 6 throughout the whole year indicating an absence of roots and water uptake long after the tree s central core of roots was restored to well watered conditions there would have been tree roots resident in dry soil for several weeks during which time the soil solution ec would have become elevated it would seem that signalling from these drier and saltier roots resulted in the tree delaying its recovery back to the rates of water use that had prevailed prior to the irrigation failure figs 4 and 5 this unforeseen episode reveals that date palms in hyper arid environments are crucially dependent on well managed irrigation this result also reveals how soil water salt dynamics and root signalling can lead to alterations in soil plant atmosphere water relations good management of water and salt are imperatives for best irrigation practice more especially so in hyper arid and saline environments 3 2 palm tree water use s3 during parts of both 2015 and 2017 we managed to obtain good measurements of the tree water on trees 2 and 3 of the lulu s3 treatment with 15 ds m 1 irrigation water there were problems with irrigation management in early 2015 and issues with water damage to the electronics of the sap flow and data logging equipment in 2017 a composite graph of the reliable water use data for the average of trees 2 and 3 in the s3 treatment is presented in fig 7 whereas the peak tree water use in the s1 treatment was in mid summer about 190 l d 1 fig 4 for the s3 treatment the peak water use was just 130 l d 1 fig 7 or some 68 of s1 thus the crop coefficient for these s3 trees is k c 0 20 this difference highlights the impact that the higher salinity irrigation water has had on tree height and canopy size as we detail later the result quantifies how salinity affects the value of the appropriate crop coefficient for use in the fao 56 calculation of crop irrigation requirements we discuss later as to how this salinity effect may be more easily inferred without the need for detailed measurements of sapflow 3 3 salt dynamics to determine whether our proposed salt leaching fraction of 0 25 et c would be sufficient we monitored the salt dynamics in both the s1 and s3 treatments using cs655 probes we applied irrigation at a daily rate of 1 5 etc to one of the trees in each treatment the cs655 probes were calibrated in the laboratory and the results for the four soil solution ecs and the three levels of soil water content are shown in fig 8 for simplicity so as to assess whether or not there was a build up of salt under the irrigation regime of 1 5 et c we considered a simple linear relation between solution ec and the cs655 measured bulk ecb combined with a parabolic relationship to account for changes in water content θ eq 2 2 e c e c b 0 829 2 964 θ 6 953 θ 2 0 087 temperature effects were not taken into account to enable easier comparison between the s1 and s3 treatments the half hourly ec measurements were normalised to the maximum ec recorded just prior to the first irrigation on saturday 20th this is the time when the pore water ec was at its peak since there were no irrigations on the friday the results for a 3 week window in late may are shown in fig 9 as expected for both treatments the drop in ec with the first morning irrigation is rapid and then it rises again throughout the morning until the afternoon irrigation drops the ec to its lowest level the weekly maximum value is always on the morning of saturday there appears to be no trend in salt build up in either treatment during this early summer period when the rates of crop water use are close to maximum these observations confirm that our proposed use of irrigation at 1 5 et c as being a sustainable rate of irrigation with regard to effective leaching salts following daily root water uptake by the date palms prior to next irrigation this corroborates our finding with the drip irrigation of amenity forests in abu dhabi at the rate of 1 5 et c with saline groundwater of ec about 10 ds m 1 al yamani et al 2018 3 4 tree canopy characteristics the visual differences between the s1 and s3 trees were patent the characteristics of the 5 trees from both treatments are given in table 1 and for completeness we also present there the results for the trees in treatment s2 where the irrigation water had an ec of 10 ds m 1 the dimensions of the trees and the yield of dates were measured during the first half of august 2017 across all 3 treatments s1 s2 and s3 the s1 trees were harvested on 3rd august s2 on the 10th august and s3 on the 20th august the circumferences of the trees were not affected by the different salinities however the tree heights and the leaf areas were both strongly affected with the s1 trees at 3 5 m tall and 62 1 m2 of leaf the s2 at 3 0 m and 56 2 m2 and the s3 trees at 2 6 m and 41 7 m2 the ratio of the tree heights between s3 and s1 is 73 and the corresponding ratio of leaf areas is 67 which would be indicative of the trees biomasses since the circumferences were similar this is the similar to the ratio of the tree water uses presented above viz 68 the lulu s1 trees yielded 67 5 kg of dates per tree whereas the s3 trees produced just 45 9 kg each the date yield ratio s1 s3 of 68 is also essentially the same as the ratio of the tree leaf areas and the tree water uses as expected hanks 1983 the annual amount of irrigation applied to each of the s1 trees was 86 kl whereas the water use by the s1 trees was just 51 1 kl for the s3 trees the irrigation schedule applied 65 of the s1 treatment or some 56 kl and the measured water use was only 36 8 kl so the date productivity in relation to water applied for the s1 trees was 0 78 kg kl 1 and 0 82 kg kl 1 for the s3 trees in other words we observed similar productivity in relation to the amount of water transpired the productivity in terms of water applied would be much lower in s3 when the standard irrigation amount was applied therefore for best management of the groundwater resource irrigation practices need to be improved to match irrigation better the size of the date

red dots as is par measured by the light stick from multiple passes underneath both the s1 trees top and s3 trees bottom from the average of these traces we calculate that the for the s1 trees some 74 of the incident light is transmitted through to the ground surface the light interception li is therefore 26 for the smaller s3 trees li 20 the ratio of the li between s3 and s1 is 76 which is of the same order as the ratio of the leaf areas 67 table 1 as well as the tree water use ratio 68 and the difference in date yield 68 thus the easy measurement of li by the light stick provides us with a good measure of the palm trees canopy characteristics and tree performance furthermore we can use li to infer the crop coefficient k c using the effective area of shade eas approach of goodwin et al 2006 their eas is our li the use of this technique for dates are shown in table 2 for the s1 and s3 treatments from the light stick measured li and the sapflow measured k c values we calculate the ratio of k c li to be 1 12 for the s1 dates and 1 00 for the s3 treatment these ratios fit within the reported range in the values for k c li of 1 1 2 for apples o connell et al 2008 peaches goodwin et al 2006 and pears goodwin et al 2015 so in the future we will use our light stick measurements of li to infer the k c values for different date varieties different tree ages and different planting densities 3 6 law 5 and irrigation allocations in 2017 in order to protect groundwater ead announced the government s new law no 5 2016 the groundwater organisation law for the abu dhabi emirate groundwater extraction limits and usage allowances will be set under law 5 we now describe the initial assessments of the usage allowances that we have suggested to ead to be considered in the regulations for the irrigation of lulu date palms with water of different salinities for groundwater irrigation we consider this should involve seasonally adjusted replacement of the trees daily water use et c rather than just a single daily rate applied throughout the year as happens now furthermore we have suggested that there be an add on of 25 as a factor of safety to account for inefficiencies in the irrigation reticulation system and also the natural variation in tree sizes as well we have suggested another 25 add on to ensure salt leaching which we have verified here as being sufficient to avoid a build up of salts even with irrigation water at 15 ds m 1 for simplicity we suggest that the 1 5 et c values be aggregated into monthly averages with the monthly maximum et c to be used as the reference value for that month the et c values are easily estimated using the fao 56 et o and the knowledge of the crop factor kc that we have presented here for the s1 and s3 treatments the suggested monthly allocations based on 1 5 et c are shown in table 3 in annual sum the average daily water use of the s1 trees is 140 l day 1 using the seasonally adjusted 1 5 et c allocation would provide on annual average a daily application of 210 l day 1 some 25 less than the current application of 275 l day 1 and a saving of 25 for the smaller s3 trees the annually averaged daily water allocation need only be 137 l day 1 a saving of 50 by taking into account their smaller tree sizes we have provided practical information for the implementation of law 5 however this only relates to one variety lulu at one tree spacing 8 8 m at two salinities 5 and 15 ds m 1 the challenge that we are now working on is to extend these findings to other varieties of different ages and spacings and at different groundwater salinities the key tool for a practical assessment of leaf canopy size and hence the crop factor will be our light stick which can through proximal sensing provide us with information on the light interception characteristics of the various canopy structures and tree sizes across commercial date farms in abu dhabi these data will enable us to infer the crop coefficient k c which we can then use in fao 56 to suggest irrigation allocations at 1 5 et c 4 conclusions currently saline groundwater is used in the uae to irrigate date palms the common practice is to irrigate each tree with 275 l day 1 throughout the year except on fridays for religious reasons we have shown through experiments with lulu date palms using sapflow measurements of daily tree water use et c that for 5 ds m 1 water date palm water use et c is up to 190 l day 1 in summer and down to 80 l day 1 in winter with 15 ds m 1 irrigation water tree water use is just 68 of that rate we had proposed that sustainable irrigation would be 1 5 et c by taking into account a 25 factor of safety and 25 salt leaching fraction our in situ measurements confirm that with this rate there is no noticeable build up of salt within the irrigation basin part of the rootzone even at the higher salinity we did however measure high salinities outside the basins along the periphery of the wetted zone where the salt had been shunted laterally we have shown that our device that we have called the light stick can be used for proximal sensing of the trees shadow areas to estimate the canopy intercepted radiation these interception data can be used to infer the crop coefficient k c in the fao 56 model for predicting tree water use from the reference evapotranspiration et o these results are being used in formulation of irrigation allocation allowances in law 5 2016 the groundwater organisation law recently passed by the government of abu dhabi we are extending these findings to other date varieties tree sizes and spacings and for groundwaters of different salinities in the form of a decision support tool for ead to be applied across the abu dhabi emirate to support law 5 for

11291,residue return in combination with synthetic nitrogen n fertilizer is increasingly being considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield in most studies however attention has mainly been paid to the way that significant changes in the soil n mineralization process affect the soil n cycle while the effect of different residue return amounts on ammonia nh3 volatilization and nitrous oxide n2o emissions potentially the most important components of n losses and environmental effects has to a certain extent been neglected notably in north eastern china therefore a trial was set up in an alfisol arable soil during 2015 2016 to monitor annual nh3 volatilization and n2o emission dynamics from a fertilized maize field with residue return at different rates treatments included n fertilizer alone and n fertilizer in combination with either half or the full yield of the maize residue 5 8 103 or 11 6 103 kg ha 1 respectively returned to the soil surface after harvest over a growing season of maize the nh3 volatilization loss rate from the full residue return treatment was 4 6 which was significantly lower than that in the n fertilizer application only and half residue return plots 6 1 meanwhile residue return rates showed a significant effect on annual n2o emissions from the maize system half residue return increased n2o emission 921 1 g n ha 1 while full residue return marginally decreased n2o emissions 862 6 g n ha 1 during the maize growing season compared to the fertilizer only treatment 881 2 g n ha 1 p 0 05 in spite of the fact that n2o emissions in the non growing season increased with the quantity of maize residue applied the return of the full yield of maize residue to the soil could reduce both annual nh3 and annual n2o losses and increase soil total n and c storage after long term use it is suggested that residue application rate is a key factor when assessing residue benefits but the influence is in a nonlinear pattern the combined application of full maize residue and synthetic n fertilizer is a promising n management strategy for mitigating gaseous n emissions keywords nitrous oxide ammonia volatilization crop residue arable soil 1 introduction ammonia nh3 and nitrous oxide n2o in the atmosphere significantly influence the environment at both regional and global scale ammonia the most abundant alkaline constituent in the atmosphere regulates atmospheric acidity brasseur et al 1999 and soil acidification roclofs et al 1987 n2o is an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and the depletion of stratospheric ozone ipcc 2007 ravishankara et al 2009 agricultural fields have become one of the major anthropogenic sources for atmospheric nh3 and n2o mainly from fertilization and related management therefore there is a need to ensure that fertilizers are managed in ways that minimize environmental effects khalil et al 2006 li and wang 2008 simultaneous measurement of the two gaseous n compounds can provide valuable information about their formation processes and contributions to air and environmental pollution vinten et al 2002 tahovská et al 2013 emissions of these two gases are significantly influenced by agricultural management such as crop residue return which is increasingly being considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield as one of the practical ways of returning crop residue large amounts may be left on the soil surface in the cropping system and this may affect soil temperature and moisture soil n content dissolved organic carbon doc content and microbial activity and therefore affect the soil n2o emissions in a complex manner yao et al 2009 liu et al 2011 some studies have reported that covering soil with crop residues may stimulate n2o production as crop residue decomposition provides substrates for nitrifiers denitrifiers and promotes anaerobic conditions for denitrification huang et al 2013 nevertheless in other studies the residue cover has been shown to reduce or have no significant effect on n2o emissions since microorganisms degrading residues with a high c n ratio compete with nitrifiers denitrifiers for available n malhi et al 2006 ma et al 2007 the above complexity means that crop residues have no consistent effect on n2o emissions under field conditions which are affected not only by site specific conditions e g soil physical and chemical properties climate and management practices but also by quality e g c n ratios and quantity of crop residue even at the same site shan and yan 2013 chen et al 2013 the c n ratio may affect n2o emissions by altering the microbial nitrogen use efficiency mooshammer et al 2014 liang et al 2015 the addition of residue will intensify the competition for nh4 between nitrification and microbial immobilisation which will determine the n2o losses the effect of the combined application of crop residues with inorganic fertilizer on n2o emissions is therefore worth investigating further previous studies have indicated that when soil ph soil carbonate content or fertilizer n application rates are high the nh4 concentration in the soil and its volatilization as nh3 increase friedel and gabel 2001 therefore factors such as residue quantity and quality incorporation timing fertilizer application soil properties and climate conditions must be considered when evaluating the impacts of crop residue on nh3 emissions liu et al 2011 huang et al 2013 however few studies regarding the effect of residue mulching on soil nh3 volatilization have been reported velthof et al 2002 pul et al 2008 and the effects of application of residue on the emissions of both nh3 and n2o are not clear an experiment was established at a typical maize field in northeastern china to assess the effects of residue return on n transformations and gaseous n losses the objectives of this study were 1 to monitor the changes in soil physicochemical characteristics and n dynamics after residue and fertilizer amendment 2 to assess the effects of different application rates of residue return on nh3 volatilization and n2o emission from the experimental plots over one year 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description the field experiment was conducted in shenyang experimental station of ecology of the chinese academy of sciences 41 32n latitude 123 23 e longitude in liaoning province northeastern china the weather at the site is typical of a temperate and humid continental monsoon climate the mean annual temperature is 7 0 8 0 c with 147 164 frost free days and the mean annual precipitation is approximately 700 mm the soil at the experimental site is classified as alfisol soil taxonomy or luvisol world reference base the main soil type for agricultural production in the region soil texture at 0 20 cm depth is silt loam sand 289 1 g kg 1 silt 501 1 g kg 1 clay 203 8 g kg 1 the top 20 cm of the soil had the following properties ph of 5 5

and field management the experiment was arranged in a randomized design with three replicates micro plots 1 6 m 1 3 m were randomly placed in the field at distances of approximately 3 m apart the micro plots were surrounded by poly vinyl chloride pvc boards that had an above ground height of 10 cm and were pressed into the soil to a depth of 50 cm maize was sown at a density of 12 plants plot 1 three treatments were included in this study treatment 1 t1 ammonium sulphate nh4 2so4 applied at a rate of 200 kg n ha 1 yr 1 treatment 2 t2 nh4 2so4 200 kg n ha 1 combined with 50 of the maize residue after harvesting returned to the soil 5 8 103 kg ha 1 treatment 3 t3 nh4 2so4 200 kg n ha 1 combined with 100 of the maize residue after harvesting returned to the soil 11 6 103 kg ha 1 the fertilizer application rate of 200 kg n ha 1 was chosen because this was the rate commonly used by local farmers in order to increase the use efficiency of the applied n fertilizer the nh4 2so4 was applied in three applications 50 kg n ha 1 as the basal fertilizer before seeding 100 kg n ha 1 as the first topdressing at the jointing stage of the maize growth and 50 kg n ha 1 as the second topdressing at the silking stage in addition p and k fertilizers as kh2po4 and k2so4 in the form of pellets were applied at 30 kg p ha 1 and 58 kg k ha 1 at the sowing stage for all treatments lü et al 2013 seedbeds for each plot were prepared manually with minimal disturbance to the soil and the basal fertilizers were incorporated into the topsoil 0 10 cm prior to maize sowing after seed sowing maize residue was applied onto the surface of the plots after being cut into 10 cm pieces the maize residue annual average yield was 11 6 mg ha 1 with c of 5014 kg c ha 1 and n of 96 6 kg n ha 1 the plots were manually weeded and the weeds were left on the surface of the plot hu et al 2015 2 3 soil sampling and measurement soil samples were collected on four occasions sowing jointing and silking stages of maize growth and after maize harvest from each plot at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm three individual samples at each soil layer were taken with a 3 cm diameter soil auger and then thoroughly mixed by hand to obtain individual bulked plot soil samples the mineral n content nh4 n and no3 n was measured by sieving some of the fresh soil 2 mm and extracting with 2 m kcl the extracts were analysed using the mgo devarda s alloy distillation method the remainder of the sample was air dried all visible roots and un decomposed residue were removed and then the samples were milled in a rolling drum sieve to 0 15 mm a 20 g sample was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine soil water content and to calculate the water filled pore space wfps the total n and organic c of the soil samples were determined by combustion with an elemental analyzer model cn vario macro elemental analyser system gmbh germany 2 4 ammonia sampling and measurement ammonia volatilization was measured using a modified vented chamber method similar to that used by wang et al 2004 the vented chamber was made of gray round pvc tube 15 cm internal diameter and 12 cm high two pieces of round sponge 16 cm in diameter and 2 cm in thickness were put into each chamber after being moistened with 15 ml of phosphate glycerol solution 50 ml analytical phosphate and 40 ml glycerol diluted to 1000 ml with pure water since the volume of the solution only accounted for 3 7 of the volume of the sponge the sponge was still ventilative after being moistened one sponge was fitted inside the chamber 5 cm away from the soil surface and used to absorb nh3 volatilized from the soil the second sponge was fitted inside the top of the chamber for absorbing any nh3 from ambient air that entered the chamber through the vent glycerol in the sponges was to absorb moisture from the air to prevent the sponges from drying out in the field four sets of the vented chamber devices were evenly placed at different locations in each plot in the way described above this gave a total of 12 replicate chambers for each treatment during the maize growing season nh3 emission was continuously measured after each n fertilization event the two pieces of sponge in the chamber were replaced and sampled every day during the first week at 2 to 3 day intervals during the second and third week and thereafter every 7 days until nh3 became undetectable ammonia in the phosphate solution in each sponge from inside the vented chamber was extracted using 300 ml of 1 m kcl with 60 min of oscillation ammonium quantities in the kcl extract solution were determined using a continuous flow analyser traccs 2000 ammonia volatilized from the soil was estimated using the following formula 1 nh3 n kg n ha 1 d 1 m a d 10 2 where m nh3 mg n captured during each sampling a cross sectional area m2 of the round chamber d duration d of each sampling 10 2 10 000 m2 ha 1 10 6 kg mg 1 the nh3 n fluxes were integrated over time for each enclosure to calculate the total nh3 volatilization rates from the treatments over the measurement period nitrogen loss rates from each treatment were then calculated by using the following equation 2 ammonia n loss rate cumulative nh3 n emission n applied 100 where ammonia n loss rate is the amount of nh3 n emitted as a percentage of residue and fertilizer n applied cumulative nh3 n emission is the cumulative nh3 emission due to residue and fertilizer application kg n ha 1 n applied is the rate of n applied in the residue and fertilizer kg n ha 1 2 5 nitrous oxide sampling and measurement in situ fluxes of n2o were measured simultaneously using a static vented chamber based method in the centre of each plot a stainless steel frame 50 cm 20 cm 30 cm length width height was inserted in the soil to a depth of 15 cm at the beginning of the experiment and kept in place throughout the experimental period except for when removal was required to accommodate the necessary farming practices the top edge of each frame had a groove 4 cm width filled with water which allowed a vented chamber to be fitted onto each stainless steel frame during gas sampling before each sampling the chambers were lined with aluminium foil and 5 cm thick insulating foam to maximize air temperature consistency inside the chambers while sampling during the maize growing season from may to september 2015 gas sampling occurred 2 3 times per week for the first two weeks and was then reduced to once per week until maturity during the non growing season from october in 2015 to april 2016 gas sampling was conducted once every two weeks the sampling date and frequency were adjusted based on rainfall on each sampling day gas measurements were performed between 09 00 am and 11 00 am three samples for n2o analysis were taken from the headspace of each chamber using 50 ml syringes at 0 20 and 40 min after chamber closure and transferred into a pre evacuated vial 20 ml and tin foil gas collecting bags 300 ml the gas samples were analysed for n2o concentration using a hp 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 63ni electron capture detector oven valve and detector temperatures operated at 65 100 and 280 c respectively with oxygen free nitrogen as a carrier gas soil temperatures were continuously measured with a temperature probe 10 cm soil depth air temperature and precipitation data were obtained from a weather station at the experiment site the hourly n2o fluxes were calculated from the increase in head space n2o concentration over the sampling time 3 f ρ h c t 273 273 t 60 where f is the hourly n2o flux mg n m 2 h 1 ρ is the density of n2o gas under standard conditions 1 25 kg m 3 c t is the change in headspace n2o n concentration per unit time 10 9 v v 1 min 1 t is the temperature in the chamber enclosure h is the height of the chamber cm cumulative n2o emission from each treatment was calculated using a linear interpolation based on sampling date nitrogen loss rates from each treatment were then calculated by using the following equation 4 nitrous oxide loss rate cumulative n2o emission n applied 100 where nitrous oxide loss rate is the amount of n2o n emitted as a of residue and fertilizer n applied cumulative n2o emission is the cumulative n2o emission due to residue and fertilizer application kg n ha 1 n applied is the rate of n applied in the residue and fertilizer kg n ha 1 2 6 statistical analysis repeated measure analysis of variance anova was use to examine the differences in nh3 n2o soil nh4 n no3 n ph and wfps with time between treatments cumulative n2o and nh3 emissions from each plot were integrated based on sampling date it was assumed that the emissions followed a constant flux rate the average rate between two sampling dates during the periods when no samples were taken multiply step wise linear regression correlation was used to analyse the relationship between the n2o emissions and the other variables all statistical analysis was performed using the software package spss 13 0 spss inc chicago il usa when significant p 0 05 effects of treatment were observed these were further explored using the honestly significant difference hsd value to make specific comparison among the different treatments 3 results 3 1 climatic variables and associated soil properties there were substantial differences in climate conditions during the four seasons at the study site winter was relatively dry with cold temperatures daily average temperature was 17 c whereas summer was wet and warm daily average temperature was 29 c fig 1 the average daily soil temperature at 10 cm depth varied from 5 c to 26 c during the experimental period fig 1 these were typical soil temperatures for the study site rainfall at the study site was considerably higher in summer than in the other seasons the rainfall during the early summer and early autumn was consistently low and soil was relatively dry fig 1 the mean soil wfps ranged from 17 to 67 which was less than field capacity 60 on most sampling days during the maize growing season higher soil wfps 30 occurred following heavy rainfall events the addition of different amounts of maize residue resulted in different soil temperature and moisture fig 2 the soil temperature was lower in the nh4 2so4 plus 100 maize residue treatment t3 than in the nh4 2so4 t1 and nh4 2so4 plus 50 maize residue t2 treatments the soil wfps decreased in the order t3 t2 and t1 no significant difference in maize yield was observed between the treatments 15 87 t ha 1 from t1 15 63 t ha 1 from t2 and 16 29 t ha 1 from t3 respectively p 0 05 soil ph decreased following fertilizer application from 5 5 before sowing to 5 2 after maize harvesting after application of residue 5 8 103 or 11 6 103 kg ha 1 and fertilizer 200 kg n ha 1 soil nh4 and no3 concentrations increased and then subsequently decreased figs 5 and 6 at the sowing stage the mineral n concentrations in the topsoil were higher than those in the deeper soil figs 5 and 6 higher mineral n concentrations were observed in the 0 10 cm layer of the t1 and t2 treatments compared to the t3 treatment during the sowing stage there was no significant difference between the treatments in the subsoil 10 20 cm in the deeper soil there was no consistent pattern among the treatments in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers in the entire soil depth 0 60 cm there was no significant difference in the total extractable mineral n contents between the treatments at the jointing stage p 0 05 at the silking stage the trend was similar to that at the sowing stage with the mineral n decreasing down the soil profile in the topsoil 0 10 cm nh4 and no3 concentrations in the t3 treatment were significantly lower than those in the other two treatments p 0 05 at the jointing stage however the treatment effect on soil mineral n diminished in the deeper layers 20 60 cm figs 5 and 6 the total n and total c in the different layers for all the treatments after maize harvest increased compared with the initial value sowing stage but the difference was not significant p 0 05 table 3 3 2 dynamics of nh3 volatilization during maize growing season the addition of fertilizer resulted in peak nh3 fluxes within 7 days of their application fig 3 three distinct flux peaks were evident following the three fertilizer applications at the sowing jointing and silking stages in all the treatments after peaking nh3 volatilization fluxes dropped rapidly during the first 2 7 days and then declined progressively with time at the sowing stage the addition of fertilizer and maize residue resulted in peak nh3 fluxes 7 days after fertilizer application and the nh3 volatilization from the nh4 2so4 in combination with 50 maize residue t2 183 1 g ha 1 d 1 was larger than from the other two treatments fig 3 at the jointing stage in contrast the daily nh3 fluxes from all treatments increased rapidly after fertilizer application and peaked on day 3 which was earlier than for the sowing stage fig 3 the peak nh3 fluxes in t1 were larger than those in the other treatments p 0 05 the fluxes decreased rapidly after the peaks to 11 16 g n ha 1d 1 on day 28 and there was no difference between the t2 and t3 treatments the application of fertilizer at the silking stage resulted in large amounts of nh3 emissions the highest nh3 peaks from all the treatments occurred soon after the application on day 2 the peak nh3 fluxes from nh4 2so4 in combination with 50 maize residue t2 were larger than those from the other treatments p 0 05 fig 3 there were substantial differences in cumulative nh3 volatilization between the treatments during the measurement periods table 1 over the three 28 day periods after the sowing jointing and silking stages nh3 emissions induced by application of nh4 2so4 and 50 maize residue t2 were significantly higher than the other two treatments p 0 05 the total nh3 losses from the nh4 2so4 combined with 100 maize residue t3 were significantly lower compared to the nh4 2so4 only treatment t1 at the sowing and silking stages the n loss rates of the nh4 2so4 treatment t1 and the nh4 2so4 plus 50 maize residue treatment t2 were both 6 1 which was slightly higher than the t3 treatment table 1 3 3 dynamics of n2o emissions during the maize growing season and non growing season the n2o fluxes from the three treatments during the whole study period crop growing season and non growing season in 2015 2016 are presented in fig 4 obvious temporal variations in n2o emissions were observed from all of the treatments fluxes increased one day after each application of fertilizer and declined progressively with time the highest flux 88 5 μg n m 2 h 1 was from the fertilizer and 50 residue application t2 five distinct flux peaks were observed during the sowing stage three were observed during the jointing stage and four were observed during the silking stage fig 4 n2o fluxes ranging from 5 6 to 78 1 μg n m 2 h 1 were observed across all treatments during the different stages and higher n2o emission peaks were found after continuous heavy rainfall events the n2o emissions responded to the change in soil temperature by decreasing rapidly after crop harvest time and there were two small peaks immediately after snow events fig 1 at this time the upper centimetres of the soil were frozen the peak fluxes never exceeded 30 μg n m 2 h 1 and were much lower than those in other seasons during the period in which the soil was frozen the n2o emission peaks from the t1 treatment were consistently lower than those from the residue treatments in the subsequent period the soil thawing resulted in short peak emissions from all treatments lasting for 1 3 days the n2o fluxes from the fertilization only treatment always remained at a lower level than the from the residue treatments a comparison of n2o emissions across all the treatments over all the different measurement periods of the experiment revealed that the total emissions during the jointing stage were lower than the other stages table 2 compared with the fertilizer only treatment residue addition increased n2o emissions but the size of the increase depended on the application rate and season among the treatments cumulative n2o losses for the t2 treatment during the sowing stage were higher than for the other treatments the t1 treatment resulted in lower n2o emissions than the other treatments during the jointing stage and at the silking stage the t1 and t2 treatments emitted much more n2o than the t3 treatment in total half residue return increased n2o emission by 7 8 while full residue return decreased n2o emissions by 2 2 compared to the fertilizer only treatment during the non growing season the total emissions from the t3 treatment were much greater compared with those from the t1 and t2 treatments however the total n2o n loss rate for the fertilizer only treatment was 0 72 which was significantly higher than those for the residue addition treatments over the whole experimental period p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting nh3 volatilization in this study the results showed that there was appreciable potential for nh3 volatilization when crop residue and fertilizer were applied ammonium in the applied fertilizer or mineralized from the organic n forms in the residue were the likely sources of the initial rapid nh3 volatilization fig 3 rujter et al 2010 found that volatilization of nh3 resulted from nh4 n release during decomposition of plant material starting from a week or more after application this indicated that very little of the ammonia volatilization was from plant material that was placed on top of the soil in the first few days and the initial rapid nh3 volatilization could mainly have been from the applied fertilizer in this study table 1 combining data from all stages no significant relationships were found between total potential nh3 losses and fertilizer application rates table 1 fig 1 although the top dressing at the jointing stage was 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which was double the application rate of basal fertilizer at the sowing stage and the second top dressing at the silking stage no significant difference in ammonia volatilization was found at the jointing stage compared to the other two periods this may be due to the higher crop n requirement at the silking stage compared to the other periods the available n would have been quickly taken up by the plants reducing the amount of nh3 produced and available for volatilization in the present experiment the nh3 fluxes were the greatest during the first 7 days 3 days and 2 days after n fertilizer application at the sowing jointing and silking stages respectively as the effect of different application rates of residue returning on temperature is less than that of air temperature the difference in the nh3 flux pattern could be due to the different seasonal temperatures during the experiment fig 1 and the soil moisture at the time of fertilizer application the temperature was 10 c when basal fertilizer was applied before the sowing stage and 20 25 c at the other two times of fertilizer application fig 1 coincident with those reported the peak emissions of nh3 occurred earlier with increasing temperature meisinger and jokela 2000 stelt et al 2007 because the higher temperature accelerates the soil air gas exchange by decreasing the solubility of nh3 gas in the soil solution also as the rainfall mainly occurred 14 days after the fertilizer application the soil was dry when the first and second fertilizer applications occurred in summer fig 1 causing relatively high nh4 concentrations in the soil solution under these conditions the dissolved nh3 arising from nh4 in solution could easily diffuse to the soil surface where it is subject to gaseous exchange with the atmosphere meisinger and jokela 2000 the increase in nh3 emissions following return of residue to the soil in our study was consistent with previous findings reported by others e g larsson et al 1998 ruijter et al 2010 as was the case in this study where n loss ranged between 4 6 and 6 1 of applied n these authors found a large range 5 39 of applied n of nh3 losses from surface applied residue depending on the site specific conditions and the composition of the residue especially represented by c n as the release of nh4 by micro organisms depends on the amount of n that is needed for their own growth and on the amount of n that is available in the plant material an effect of n content on ammonia volatilization was also found in a field experiment conducted by whitehead and lockyer 1987 where cut grass with a low n content 0 9 showed 5 ammonia volatilization whereas grass with a high n content 3 emitted 10 of its n as ammonia over a period of 28 days the n content of the maize residue in our study was only 0 83 and the c n ratio was 51 9 which probably led to the relatively low n losses the increase in nh3 emissions was affected by the quantity of maize residue full residue return reduced nh3 volatilization losses from soil while half residue return had no significant effect on nh3 emissions compare to the fertilizer treatment in this study table 1 this was likely to have been due partly to the large amount of residue forming a crust on the soil surface which acted as a physical barrier that reduced nh3 losses conversely half residues return providing more opportunity for nh3 to escape into atmosphere through some parts of uncovered soil surface moreover soil nh4 n concentrations in the top 0 20 cm soil depth of the treated plots were in the order of 50 maize residue nh4 2so4 nh4 2so4 100 maize residue nh4 2so4 it implied that 100 maize residue return could provide enough c to enhance microbial immobilization of inorganic n by the stimulated microbial growth which led to the decreased nh4 n in the soil and hence low nh3 losses it is also possible that the full maize residue left on the soil surface increased soil moisture and decreased temperature in our study fig 2 decreasing ammonia volatilization janzen and mcginn 1991 some researchers have ascribed increased nh4 n in t2 to the addition of half maize residue return which promotes potential of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra shan et al 2018 half residues return increased temperature nh4 n but no influence on soil moisture therefore there were no significant effect on nh3 losses compare to fertilizer only treatment in contrast ruijter et al 2010 found that crop residues make a significant contribution to the national ammonia volatilization inventory and should be considered in the national assessment of ammonia volatilization however residue return had no significant effect on nh3 emissions in studies carried out by stelt et al 2007 as discussed the above complexity could be due to the interactions between the differences in the residue application amount and the residue characteristics as well as plant uptake soil water content and temperature at the time of residue application fig 1 4 2 factors affecting n2o emissions for all the treatments there were several obvious peaks in the n2o emissions during the different growing stages most of them occurring directly after heavy precipitation events figs 1 and 3 these emissions then dropped within 2 3 days when the soil moisture content declined fig 3 based on the relationship between the range of soil wfps and the main n2o production processes proposed in previous studies dong et al 2014 wang et al 2015 it can be concluded that n2o emissions in this study mainly resulted from denitrification when wfps was 60 which is considered a condition conducive to n2o production by denitrifiers bateman and baggs 2005 in line with previous studies our results show that the mechanisms by which residue return affects n2o emissions are complex n2o emissions are influenced not only by the c n ratio the residue characteristics and environmental factors soil moisture and soil temperature but also by application rates of residues chen et al 2013 shan and yan 2013 as found in the nh3 loss pattern in our experiment multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that the effect of crop residue return on n2o emissions was significantly related to the amount of crop residue addition by regulating the soil nutrient availability and environmental conditions through changing soil mineral n soil temperature and moisture n2o emissions 0 54 soil nh4 n content 0 48 soil no3 n content 0 85 soil wfps 0 71 soil temperature r2 0 86 p 0 05 the effects of plant residue rate on n2o emissions were seen throughout the whole growing season and stage dependant figs 2 and 3 at the sowing stage two obvious peaks in the n2o emissions were observed after heavy precipitation events and large variations in n2o fluxes were found in the t2 treatment compared with the other treatments figs 1 and 3 table 2 because the decomposition of crop residue is time dependent the crop residue applied on the soil surface generally initially undergoes slow decomposition the lower n2o from the t3 treatment could be attributed to the cooler wetter soil associated with the presence of a large amount of surface residue at the higher residue rate in this study fig 2 crop residues reduced the evaporation of water from the soil by shading causing a lower surface soil temperature and reducing wind effects klocke et al 2009 while the relatively higher soil temperature in the t2 treatment led to higher n2o emissions as indicated above n2o emissions were positively correlated with temperature as soil temperature can directly affect microbial nitrifying and denitrifying activities breuer et al 2002 during the jointing stage the emissions never exceeded 40 μg n m 2 h 1 the relatively low rates of gaseous n losses recorded during this period could be partly related to the crop n requirement being higher than at other growth stages with most of the available n being taken up by crops during this stage reducing the amount of n2o produced compared with the fertilizer only treatment t1 the application of residue t2 and t3 treatments enhanced n2o emissions table 2 and fig 2 this could be because microbial respiration during the degradation of crop residues during this period increased o2 consumption neeteson and vanveen 1987 thus increasing anaerobic microsite formation resulting in enhanced rates of denitrification and n2o emissions rice et al 1988 qian et al 1997 huang et al 2013 during the silking stage n2o emissions from the t3 treatment were lower than from the other treatments this effect could be due to the full maize residues remaining on the soil surface affecting the decomposition rate and in turn influencing n2o emissions the half residue decomposed faster and provided more substrate nh4 n and no3 n for nitrifiers or denitrifiers than the 100 residue treatment figs 5 and 6 as with our findings hallam and bartholomew 1953 reported that the rate of plant residue addition had significant impacts on residue decomposition and the decomposition of residues was considerably more rapid at low addition rates than high addition rates moreover the lower supply of c from the half residue treatment could have led to lower mineral n immobilization thereby resulting in higher n2o emissions table 3 snyde et al 2009 burney et al 2010 in the present study the total n2o emissions during the non growing season accounted for half of the annual n2o emissions table 2 previous studies have also indicated that a large amount of n2o can be produced and emitted from soils at low temperatures even below 0 c holtan hartwig et al 2002 öquist et al 2004 koponen et al 2004 this could be due to several factors 1 the snow cover could reduce evaporation and create higher soil moisture conditions fig 2 thereby favouring denitrification which is probably the main mechanism for n2o production in soils close to 0 c 2 reduced gas diffusion creating anaerobic conditions 3 reduced competition for nitrate from vegetation 4 increased substrate availability from rupturing of microbes through freezing and 5 the high sensitivity of the n2o reductase enzyme to low temperatures thereby favouring n2o emissions over complete denitrification to n2 mørkved et al 2006 öquist et al 2007 two n2o emission flux peaks were observed during the period of continuous soil freezing from november in 2015 to february 2016 fig 3 the higher n2o emissions during the frozen period could be due to microorganisms that are still active in some isolated microsites of unfrozen soil water teepe et al 2000 the n2o flux observed during thawing could be a result of the physical release of trapped n2o and or denitrification during thawing teepe et al 2000 it has been suggested that soil freezing and thawing disrupts soil aggregates oztas and fayetorbay 2003 six et al 2004 plant material mellick and seppelt 1992 harris and safford 1996 microbial cells and protein decomposition skogland et al 1988 larsen et al 2002 yanai et al 2004 the increase in denitrification after thawing may be attributable to the diffusion of organic substrates newly available to denitrifiers from disrupted soil aggregates leading to an increase in microbial activity burton and beauchamp 1994 the n2o emissions in the non growing season were also affected by the quantity of the maize residues in the order of t3 t2 t1 table 2 as discussed a higher amount of residue cover could increase the denitrification rate by creating anaerobic conditions and increase the substrate for n2o production sehy et al 2003 have also reported that the emissions of n2o were significantly increased following the addition of c corresponding to elevated n2o emissions in frozen soils and the amount of n2o emitted was related to the quantity of available c this indicated that substrate availability e g c and n is a major factor affecting n2o emissions in frozen soils the process of soil freezing and thawing has been identified as an important cause of n2o emissions from soils schürmann et al 2002 groffman et al 2006 maljanen et al 2007 over the study period over one year the application of residue t2 and t3 treatments reduced n2o emission factors 0 62 and 0 67 respectively compared to the fertilizer only treatment 0 72 table 2 these findings are in agreement with the meta analysis of shan and yan 2013 summarizing crop residue effects on n2o emissions in agricultural soils 20 studies in which crop residue application reduced n2o emissions in contrast a number of studies reported the stimulatory effects of combined application of crop residues and synthetic n fertilizers on soil n2o emissions sarkodie addo et al 2003 huang et al 2004 as discussed these contradictory results are probably due to differences in residue characteristics climate soil texture and soil ph chen et al 2013 the reductions in n2o emissions from maize residue return in the present study are most likely to be due to the temporary strong soil n immobilization induced by the addition of maize residue with a high c n ratio c n was 51 9 and a relatively high application rate 5 conclusion this study showed that incorporation of the full maize residue into the soil reduced nh3 losses this could be due to the incorporation of crop residue affecting microbial activity soil temperature and moisture and therefore regulating the soil nh4 content the effects of residue return on n2o emissions are complex return of half the residue increased n2o emission while full residue return decreased n2o emissions during the maize growing season this indicated that the effect of crop residue on n2o emissions was significantly related to the amount of crop residue addition i e quantity the application of maize residues resulted in net soil n immobilization therefore this measure could be effective in mitigating n losses therefore the quantity of maize residues returned to the field is an important consideration for reducing environmental effects after maize harvest the total n2o emissions during the non growing season accounted for half of the annual n2o emissions these findings suggest that the process of soil freezing and thawing should be identified as an important cause of n2o emissions from treated soils accordingly full residue return in combination with synthetic n fertilizers could be a favourable strategy for reducing n losses through nh3 and n2o funding this study was financially supported by the national key research and development program of china nos 2017yfd0200100 2017yfd0200708 2016yfd0200307

11291,residue return in combination with synthetic nitrogen n fertilizer is increasingly being considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield in most studies however attention has mainly been paid to the way that significant changes in the soil n mineralization process affect the soil n cycle while the effect of different residue return amounts on ammonia nh3 volatilization and nitrous oxide n2o emissions potentially the most important components of n losses and environmental effects has to a certain extent been neglected notably in north eastern china therefore a trial was set up in an alfisol arable soil during 2015 2016 to monitor annual nh3 volatilization and n2o emission dynamics from a fertilized maize field with residue return at different rates treatments included n fertilizer alone and n fertilizer in combination with either half or the full yield of the maize residue 5 8 103 or 11 6 103 kg ha 1 respectively returned to the soil surface after harvest over a growing season of maize the nh3 volatilization loss rate from the full residue return treatment was 4 6 which was significantly lower than that in the n fertilizer application only and half residue return plots 6 1 meanwhile residue return rates showed a significant effect on annual n2o emissions from the maize system half residue return increased n2o emission 921 1 g n ha 1 while full residue return marginally decreased n2o emissions 862 6 g n ha 1 during the maize growing season compared to the fertilizer only treatment 881 2 g n ha 1 p 0 05 in spite of the fact that n2o emissions in the non growing season increased with the quantity of maize residue applied the return of the full yield of maize residue to the soil could reduce both annual nh3 and annual n2o losses and increase soil total n and c storage after long term use it is suggested that residue application rate is a key factor when assessing residue benefits but the influence is in a nonlinear pattern the combined application of full maize residue and synthetic n fertilizer is a promising n management strategy for mitigating gaseous n emissions keywords nitrous oxide ammonia volatilization crop residue arable soil 1 introduction ammonia nh3 and nitrous oxide n2o in the atmosphere significantly influence the environment at both regional and global scale ammonia the most abundant alkaline constituent in the atmosphere regulates atmospheric acidity brasseur et al 1999 and soil acidification roclofs et al 1987 n2o is an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and the depletion of stratospheric ozone ipcc 2007 ravishankara et al 2009 agricultural fields have become one of the major anthropogenic sources for atmospheric nh3 and n2o mainly from fertilization and related management therefore there is a need to ensure that fertilizers are managed in ways that minimize environmental effects khalil et al 2006 li and wang 2008 simultaneous measurement of the two gaseous n compounds can provide valuable information about their formation processes and contributions to air and environmental pollution vinten et al 2002 tahovská et al 2013 emissions of these two gases are significantly influenced by agricultural management such as crop residue return which is increasingly being considered to be beneficial to soil fertility and crop yield as one of the practical ways of returning crop residue large amounts may be left on the soil surface in the cropping system and this may affect soil temperature and moisture soil n content dissolved organic carbon doc content and microbial activity and therefore affect the soil n2o emissions in a complex manner yao et al 2009 liu et al 2011 some studies have reported that covering soil with crop residues may stimulate n2o production as crop residue decomposition provides substrates for nitrifiers denitrifiers and promotes anaerobic conditions for denitrification huang et al 2013 nevertheless in other studies the residue cover has been shown to reduce or have no significant effect on n2o emissions since microorganisms degrading residues with a high c n ratio compete with nitrifiers denitrifiers for available n malhi et al 2006 ma et al 2007 the above complexity means that crop residues have no consistent effect on n2o emissions under field conditions which are affected not only by site specific conditions e g soil physical and chemical properties climate and management practices but also by quality e g c n ratios and quantity of crop residue even at the same site shan and yan 2013 chen et al 2013 the c n ratio may affect n2o emissions by altering the microbial nitrogen use efficiency mooshammer et al 2014 liang et al 2015 the addition of residue will intensify the competition for nh4 between nitrification and microbial immobilisation which will determine the n2o losses the effect of the combined application of crop residues with inorganic fertilizer on n2o emissions is therefore worth investigating further previous studies have indicated that when soil ph soil carbonate content or fertilizer n application rates are high the nh4 concentration in the soil and its volatilization as nh3 increase friedel and gabel 2001 therefore factors such as residue quantity and quality incorporation timing fertilizer application soil properties and climate conditions must be considered when evaluating the impacts of crop residue on nh3 emissions liu et al 2011 huang et al 2013 however few studies regarding the effect of residue mulching on soil nh3 volatilization have been reported velthof et al 2002 pul et al 2008 and the effects of application of residue on the emissions of both nh3 and n2o are not clear an experiment was established at a typical maize field in northeastern china to assess the effects of residue return on n transformations and gaseous n losses the objectives of this study were 1 to monitor the changes in soil physicochemical characteristics and n dynamics after residue and fertilizer amendment 2 to assess the effects of different application rates of residue return on nh3 volatilization and n2o emission from the experimental plots over one year 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description the field experiment was conducted in shenyang experimental station of ecology of the chinese academy of sciences 41 32n latitude 123 23 e longitude in liaoning province northeastern china the weather at the site is typical of a temperate and humid continental monsoon climate the mean annual temperature is 7 0 8 0 c with 147 164 frost free days and the mean annual precipitation is approximately 700 mm the soil at the experimental site is classified as alfisol soil taxonomy or luvisol world reference base the main soil type for agricultural production in the region soil texture at 0 20 cm depth is silt loam sand 289 1 g kg 1 silt 501 1 g kg 1 clay 203 8 g kg 1 the top 20 cm of the soil had the following properties ph of 5 5

and field management the experiment was arranged in a randomized design with three replicates micro plots 1 6 m 1 3 m were randomly placed in the field at distances of approximately 3 m apart the micro plots were surrounded by poly vinyl chloride pvc boards that had an above ground height of 10 cm and were pressed into the soil to a depth of 50 cm maize was sown at a density of 12 plants plot 1 three treatments were included in this study treatment 1 t1 ammonium sulphate nh4 2so4 applied at a rate of 200 kg n ha 1 yr 1 treatment 2 t2 nh4 2so4 200 kg n ha 1 combined with 50 of the maize residue after harvesting returned to the soil 5 8 103 kg ha 1 treatment 3 t3 nh4 2so4 200 kg n ha 1 combined with 100 of the maize residue after harvesting returned to the soil 11 6 103 kg ha 1 the fertilizer application rate of 200 kg n ha 1 was chosen because this was the rate commonly used by local farmers in order to increase the use efficiency of the applied n fertilizer the nh4 2so4 was applied in three applications 50 kg n ha 1 as the basal fertilizer before seeding 100 kg n ha 1 as the first topdressing at the jointing stage of the maize growth and 50 kg n ha 1 as the second topdressing at the silking stage in addition p and k fertilizers as kh2po4 and k2so4 in the form of pellets were applied at 30 kg p ha 1 and 58 kg k ha 1 at the sowing stage for all treatments lü et al 2013 seedbeds for each plot were prepared manually with minimal disturbance to the soil and the basal fertilizers were incorporated into the topsoil 0 10 cm prior to maize sowing after seed sowing maize residue was applied onto the surface of the plots after being cut into 10 cm pieces the maize residue annual average yield was 11 6 mg ha 1 with c of 5014 kg c ha 1 and n of 96 6 kg n ha 1 the plots were manually weeded and the weeds were left on the surface of the plot hu et al 2015 2 3 soil sampling and measurement soil samples were collected on four occasions sowing jointing and silking stages of maize growth and after maize harvest from each plot at depths of 0 10 10 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm three individual samples at each soil layer were taken with a 3 cm diameter soil auger and then thoroughly mixed by hand to obtain individual bulked plot soil samples the mineral n content nh4 n and no3 n was measured by sieving some of the fresh soil 2 mm and extracting with 2 m kcl the extracts were analysed using the mgo devarda s alloy distillation method the remainder of the sample was air dried all visible roots and un decomposed residue were removed and then the samples were milled in a rolling drum sieve to 0 15 mm a 20 g sample was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine soil water content and to calculate the water filled pore space wfps the total n and organic c of the soil samples were determined by combustion with an elemental analyzer model cn vario macro elemental analyser system gmbh germany 2 4 ammonia sampling and measurement ammonia volatilization was measured using a modified vented chamber method similar to that used by wang et al 2004 the vented chamber was made of gray round pvc tube 15 cm internal diameter and 12 cm high two pieces of round sponge 16 cm in diameter and 2 cm in thickness were put into each chamber after being moistened with 15 ml of phosphate glycerol solution 50 ml analytical phosphate and 40 ml glycerol diluted to 1000 ml with pure water since the volume of the solution only accounted for 3 7 of the volume of the sponge the sponge was still ventilative after being moistened one sponge was fitted inside the chamber 5 cm away from the soil surface and used to absorb nh3 volatilized from the soil the second sponge was fitted inside the top of the chamber for absorbing any nh3 from ambient air that entered the chamber through the vent glycerol in the sponges was to absorb moisture from the air to prevent the sponges from drying out in the field four sets of the vented chamber devices were evenly placed at different locations in each plot in the way described above this gave a total of 12 replicate chambers for each treatment during the maize growing season nh3 emission was continuously measured after each n fertilization event the two pieces of sponge in the chamber were replaced and sampled every day during the first week at 2 to 3 day intervals during the second and third week and thereafter every 7 days until nh3 became undetectable ammonia in the phosphate solution in each sponge from inside the vented chamber was extracted using 300 ml of 1 m kcl with 60 min of oscillation ammonium quantities in the kcl extract solution were determined using a continuous flow analyser traccs 2000 ammonia volatilized from the soil was estimated using the following formula 1 nh3 n kg n ha 1 d 1 m a d 10 2 where m nh3 mg n captured during each sampling a cross sectional area m2 of the round chamber d duration d of each sampling 10 2 10 000 m2 ha 1 10 6 kg mg 1 the nh3 n fluxes were integrated over time for each enclosure to calculate the total nh3 volatilization rates from the treatments over the measurement period nitrogen loss rates from each treatment were then calculated by using the following equation 2 ammonia n loss rate cumulative nh3 n emission n applied 100 where ammonia n loss rate is the amount of nh3 n emitted as a percentage of residue and fertilizer n applied cumulative nh3 n emission is the cumulative nh3 emission due to residue and fertilizer application kg n ha 1 n applied is the rate of n applied in the residue and fertilizer kg n ha 1 2 5 nitrous oxide sampling and measurement in situ fluxes of n2o were measured simultaneously using a static vented chamber based method in the centre of each plot a stainless steel frame 50 cm 20 cm 30 cm length width height was inserted in the soil to a depth of 15 cm at the beginning of the experiment and kept in place throughout the experimental period except for when removal was required to accommodate the necessary farming practices the top edge of each frame had a groove 4 cm width filled with water which allowed a vented chamber to be fitted onto each stainless steel frame during gas sampling before each sampling the chambers were lined with aluminium foil and 5 cm thick insulating foam to maximize air temperature consistency inside the chambers while sampling during the maize growing season from may to september 2015 gas sampling occurred 2 3 times per week for the first two weeks and was then reduced to once per week until maturity during the non growing season from october in 2015 to april 2016 gas sampling was conducted once every two weeks the sampling date and frequency were adjusted based on rainfall on each sampling day gas measurements were performed between 09 00 am and 11 00 am three samples for n2o analysis were taken from the headspace of each chamber using 50 ml syringes at 0 20 and 40 min after chamber closure and transferred into a pre evacuated vial 20 ml and tin foil gas collecting bags 300 ml the gas samples were analysed for n2o concentration using a hp 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 63ni electron capture detector oven valve and detector temperatures operated at 65 100 and 280 c respectively with oxygen free nitrogen as a carrier gas soil temperatures were continuously measured with a temperature probe 10 cm soil depth air temperature and precipitation data were obtained from a weather station at the experiment site the hourly n2o fluxes were calculated from the increase in head space n2o concentration over the sampling time 3 f ρ h c t 273 273 t 60 where f is the hourly n2o flux mg n m 2 h 1 ρ is the density of n2o gas under standard conditions 1 25 kg m 3 c t is the change in headspace n2o n concentration per unit time 10 9 v v 1 min 1 t is the temperature in the chamber enclosure h is the height of the chamber cm cumulative n2o emission from each treatment was calculated using a linear interpolation based on sampling date nitrogen loss rates from each treatment were then calculated by using the following equation 4 nitrous oxide loss rate cumulative n2o emission n applied 100 where nitrous oxide loss rate is the amount of n2o n emitted as a of residue and fertilizer n applied cumulative n2o emission is the cumulative n2o emission due to residue and fertilizer application kg n ha 1 n applied is the rate of n applied in the residue and fertilizer kg n ha 1 2 6 statistical analysis repeated measure analysis of variance anova was use to examine the differences in nh3 n2o soil nh4 n no3 n ph and wfps with time between treatments cumulative n2o and nh3 emissions from each plot were integrated based on sampling date it was assumed that the emissions followed a constant flux rate the average rate between two sampling dates during the periods when no samples were taken multiply step wise linear regression correlation was used to analyse the relationship between the n2o emissions and the other variables all statistical analysis was performed using the software package spss 13 0 spss inc chicago il usa when significant p 0 05 effects of treatment were observed these were further explored using the honestly significant difference hsd value to make specific comparison among the different treatments 3 results 3 1 climatic variables and associated soil properties there were substantial differences in climate conditions during the four seasons at the study site winter was relatively dry with cold temperatures daily average temperature was 17 c whereas summer was wet and warm daily average temperature was 29 c fig 1 the average daily soil temperature at 10 cm depth varied from 5 c to 26 c during the experimental period fig 1 these were typical soil temperatures for the study site rainfall at the study site was considerably higher in summer than in the other seasons the rainfall during the early summer and early autumn was consistently low and soil was relatively dry fig 1 the mean soil wfps ranged from 17 to 67 which was less than field capacity 60 on most sampling days during the maize growing season higher soil wfps 30 occurred following heavy rainfall events the addition of different amounts of maize residue resulted in different soil temperature and moisture fig 2 the soil temperature was lower in the nh4 2so4 plus 100 maize residue treatment t3 than in the nh4 2so4 t1 and nh4 2so4 plus 50 maize residue t2 treatments the soil wfps decreased in the order t3 t2 and t1 no significant difference in maize yield was observed between the treatments 15 87 t ha 1 from t1 15 63 t ha 1 from t2 and 16 29 t ha 1 from t3 respectively p 0 05 soil ph decreased following fertilizer application from 5 5 before sowing to 5 2 after maize harvesting after application of residue 5 8 103 or 11 6 103 kg ha 1 and fertilizer 200 kg n ha 1 soil nh4 and no3 concentrations increased and then subsequently decreased figs 5 and 6 at the sowing stage the mineral n concentrations in the topsoil were higher than those in the deeper soil figs 5 and 6 higher mineral n concentrations were observed in the 0 10 cm layer of the t1 and t2 treatments compared to the t3 treatment during the sowing stage there was no significant difference between the treatments in the subsoil 10 20 cm in the deeper soil there was no consistent pattern among the treatments in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers in the entire soil depth 0 60 cm there was no significant difference in the total extractable mineral n contents between the treatments at the jointing stage p 0 05 at the silking stage the trend was similar to that at the sowing stage with the mineral n decreasing down the soil profile in the topsoil 0 10 cm nh4 and no3 concentrations in the t3 treatment were significantly lower than those in the other two treatments p 0 05 at the jointing stage however the treatment effect on soil mineral n diminished in the deeper layers 20 60 cm figs 5 and 6 the total n and total c in the different layers for all the treatments after maize harvest increased compared with the initial value sowing stage but the difference was not significant p 0 05 table 3 3 2 dynamics of nh3 volatilization during maize growing season the addition of fertilizer resulted in peak nh3 fluxes within 7 days of their application fig 3 three distinct flux peaks were evident following the three fertilizer applications at the sowing jointing and silking stages in all the treatments after peaking nh3 volatilization fluxes dropped rapidly during the first 2 7 days and then declined progressively with time at the sowing stage the addition of fertilizer and maize residue resulted in peak nh3 fluxes 7 days after fertilizer application and the nh3 volatilization from the nh4 2so4 in combination with 50 maize residue t2 183 1 g ha 1 d 1 was larger than from the other two treatments fig 3 at the jointing stage in contrast the daily nh3 fluxes from all treatments increased rapidly after fertilizer application and peaked on day 3 which was earlier than for the sowing stage fig 3 the peak nh3 fluxes in t1 were larger than those in the other treatments p 0 05 the fluxes decreased rapidly after the peaks to 11 16 g n ha 1d 1 on day 28 and there was no difference between the t2 and t3 treatments the application of fertilizer at the silking stage resulted in large amounts of nh3 emissions the highest nh3 peaks from all the treatments occurred soon after the application on day 2 the peak nh3 fluxes from nh4 2so4 in combination with 50 maize residue t2 were larger than those from the other treatments p 0 05 fig 3 there were substantial differences in cumulative nh3 volatilization between the treatments during the measurement periods table 1 over the three 28 day periods after the sowing jointing and silking stages nh3 emissions induced by application of nh4 2so4 and 50 maize residue t2 were significantly higher than the other two treatments p 0 05 the total nh3 losses from the nh4 2so4 combined with 100 maize residue t3 were significantly lower compared to the nh4 2so4 only treatment t1 at the sowing and silking stages the n loss rates of the nh4 2so4 treatment t1 and the nh4 2so4 plus 50 maize residue treatment t2 were both 6 1 which was slightly higher than the t3 treatment table 1 3 3 dynamics of n2o emissions during the maize growing season and non growing season the n2o fluxes from the three treatments during the whole study period crop growing season and non growing season in 2015 2016 are presented in fig 4 obvious temporal variations in n2o emissions were observed from all of the treatments fluxes increased one day after each application of fertilizer and declined progressively with time the highest flux 88 5 μg n m 2 h 1 was from the fertilizer and 50 residue application t2 five distinct flux peaks were observed during the sowing stage three were observed during the jointing stage and four were observed during the silking stage fig 4 n2o fluxes ranging from 5 6 to 78 1 μg n m 2 h 1 were observed across all treatments during the different stages and higher n2o emission peaks were found after continuous heavy rainfall events the n2o emissions responded to the change in soil temperature by decreasing rapidly after crop harvest time and there were two small peaks immediately after snow events fig 1 at this time the upper centimetres of the soil were frozen the peak fluxes never exceeded 30 μg n m 2 h 1 and were much lower than those in other seasons during the period in which the soil was frozen the n2o emission peaks from the t1 treatment were consistently lower than those from the residue treatments in the subsequent period the soil thawing resulted in short peak emissions from all treatments lasting for 1 3 days the n2o fluxes from the fertilization only treatment always remained at a lower level than the from the residue treatments a comparison of n2o emissions across all the treatments over all the different measurement periods of the experiment revealed that the total emissions during the jointing stage were lower than the other stages table 2 compared with the fertilizer only treatment residue addition increased n2o emissions but the size of the increase depended on the application rate and season among the treatments cumulative n2o losses for the t2 treatment during the sowing stage were higher than for the other treatments the t1 treatment resulted in lower n2o emissions than the other treatments during the jointing stage and at the silking stage the t1 and t2 treatments emitted much more n2o than the t3 treatment in total half residue return increased n2o emission by 7 8 while full residue return decreased n2o emissions by 2 2 compared to the fertilizer only treatment during the non growing season the total emissions from the t3 treatment were much greater compared with those from the t1 and t2 treatments however the total n2o n loss rate for the fertilizer only treatment was 0 72 which was significantly higher than those for the residue addition treatments over the whole experimental period p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting nh3 volatilization in this study the results showed that there was appreciable potential for nh3 volatilization when crop residue and fertilizer were applied ammonium in the applied fertilizer or mineralized from the organic n forms in the residue were the likely sources of the initial rapid nh3 volatilization fig 3 rujter et al 2010 found that volatilization of nh3 resulted from nh4 n release during decomposition of plant material starting from a week or more after application this indicated that very little of the ammonia volatilization was from plant material that was placed on top of the soil in the first few days and the initial rapid nh3 volatilization could mainly have been from the applied fertilizer in this study table 1 combining data from all stages no significant relationships were found between total potential nh3 losses and fertilizer application rates table 1 fig 1 although the top dressing at the jointing stage was 100 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which was double the application rate of basal fertilizer at the sowing stage and the second top dressing at the silking stage no significant difference in ammonia volatilization was found at the jointing stage compared to the other two periods this may be due to the higher crop n requirement at the silking stage compared to the other periods the available n would have been quickly taken up by the plants reducing the amount of nh3 produced and available for volatilization in the present experiment the nh3 fluxes were the greatest during the first 7 days 3 days and 2 days after n fertilizer application at the sowing jointing and silking stages respectively as the effect of different application rates of residue returning on temperature is less than that of air temperature the difference in the nh3 flux pattern could be due to the different seasonal temperatures during the experiment fig 1 and the soil moisture at the time of fertilizer application the temperature was 10 c when basal fertilizer was applied before the sowing stage and 20 25 c at the other two times of fertilizer application fig 1 coincident with those reported the peak emissions of nh3 occurred earlier with increasing temperature meisinger and jokela 2000 stelt et al 2007 because the higher temperature accelerates the soil air gas exchange by decreasing the solubility of nh3 gas in the soil solution also as the rainfall mainly occurred 14 days after the fertilizer application the soil was dry when the first and second fertilizer applications occurred in summer fig 1 causing relatively high nh4 concentrations in the soil solution under these conditions the dissolved nh3 arising from nh4 in solution could easily diffuse to the soil surface where it is subject to gaseous exchange with the atmosphere meisinger and jokela 2000 the increase in nh3 emissions following return of residue to the soil in our study was consistent with previous findings reported by others e g larsson et al 1998 ruijter et al 2010 as was the case in this study where n loss ranged between 4 6 and 6 1 of applied n these authors found a large range 5 39 of applied n of nh3 losses from surface applied residue depending on the site specific conditions and the composition of the residue especially represented by c n as the release of nh4 by micro organisms depends on the amount of n that is needed for their own growth and on the amount of n that is available in the plant material an effect of n content on ammonia volatilization was also found in a field experiment conducted by whitehead and lockyer 1987 where cut grass with a low n content 0 9 showed 5 ammonia volatilization whereas grass with a high n content 3 emitted 10 of its n as ammonia over a period of 28 days the n content of the maize residue in our study was only 0 83 and the c n ratio was 51 9 which probably led to the relatively low n losses the increase in nh3 emissions was affected by the quantity of maize residue full residue return reduced nh3 volatilization losses from soil while half residue return had no significant effect on nh3 emissions compare to the fertilizer treatment in this study table 1 this was likely to have been due partly to the large amount of residue forming a crust on the soil surface which acted as a physical barrier that reduced nh3 losses conversely half residues return providing more opportunity for nh3 to escape into atmosphere through some parts of uncovered soil surface moreover soil nh4 n concentrations in the top 0 20 cm soil depth of the treated plots were in the order of 50 maize residue nh4 2so4 nh4 2so4 100 maize residue nh4 2so4 it implied that 100 maize residue return could provide enough c to enhance microbial immobilization of inorganic n by the stimulated microbial growth which led to the decreased nh4 n in the soil and hence low nh3 losses it is also possible that the full maize residue left on the soil surface increased soil moisture and decreased temperature in our study fig 2 decreasing ammonia volatilization janzen and mcginn 1991 some researchers have ascribed increased nh4 n in t2 to the addition of half maize residue return which promotes potential of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra shan et al 2018 half residues return increased temperature nh4 n but no influence on soil moisture therefore there were no significant effect on nh3 losses compare to fertilizer only treatment in contrast ruijter et al 2010 found that crop residues make a significant contribution to the national ammonia volatilization inventory and should be considered in the national assessment of ammonia volatilization however residue return had no significant effect on nh3 emissions in studies carried out by stelt et al 2007 as discussed the above complexity could be due to the interactions between the differences in the residue application amount and the residue characteristics as well as plant uptake soil water content and temperature at the time of residue application fig 1 4 2 factors affecting n2o emissions for all the treatments there were several obvious peaks in the n2o emissions during the different growing stages most of them occurring directly after heavy precipitation events figs 1 and 3 these emissions then dropped within 2 3 days when the soil moisture content declined fig 3 based on the relationship between the range of soil wfps and the main n2o production processes proposed in previous studies dong et al 2014 wang et al 2015 it can be concluded that n2o emissions in this study mainly resulted from denitrification when wfps was 60 which is considered a condition conducive to n2o production by denitrifiers bateman and baggs 2005 in line with previous studies our results show that the mechanisms by which residue return affects n2o emissions are complex n2o emissions are influenced not only by the c n ratio the residue characteristics and environmental factors soil moisture and soil temperature but also by application rates of residues chen et al 2013 shan and yan 2013 as found in the nh3 loss pattern in our experiment multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that the effect of crop residue return on n2o emissions was significantly related to the amount of crop residue addition by regulating the soil nutrient availability and environmental conditions through changing soil mineral n soil temperature and moisture n2o emissions 0 54 soil nh4 n content 0 48 soil no3 n content 0 85 soil wfps 0 71 soil temperature r2 0 86 p 0 05 the effects of plant residue rate on n2o emissions were seen throughout the whole growing season and stage dependant figs 2 and 3 at the sowing stage two obvious peaks in the n2o emissions were observed after heavy precipitation events and large variations in n2o fluxes were found in the t2 treatment compared with the other treatments figs 1 and 3 table 2 because the decomposition of crop residue is time dependent the crop residue applied on the soil surface generally initially undergoes slow decomposition the lower n2o from the t3 treatment could be attributed to the cooler wetter soil associated with the presence of a large amount of surface residue at the higher residue rate in this study fig 2 crop residues reduced the evaporation of water from the soil by shading causing a lower surface soil temperature and reducing wind effects klocke et al 2009 while the relatively higher soil temperature in the t2 treatment led to higher n2o emissions as indicated above n2o emissions were positively correlated with temperature as soil temperature can directly affect microbial nitrifying and denitrifying activities breuer et al 2002 during the jointing stage the emissions never exceeded 40 μg n m 2 h 1 the relatively low rates of gaseous n losses recorded during this period could be partly related to the crop n requirement being higher than at other growth stages with most of the available n being taken up by crops during this stage reducing the amount of n2o produced compared with the fertilizer only treatment t1 the application of residue t2 and t3 treatments enhanced n2o emissions table 2 and fig 2 this could be because microbial respiration during the degradation of crop residues during this period increased o2 consumption neeteson and vanveen 1987 thus increasing anaerobic microsite formation resulting in enhanced rates of denitrification and n2o emissions rice et al 1988 qian et al 1997 huang et al 2013 during the silking stage n2o emissions from the t3 treatment were lower than from the other treatments this effect could be due to the full maize residues remaining on the soil surface affecting the decomposition rate and in turn influencing n2o emissions the half residue decomposed faster and provided more substrate nh4 n and no3 n for nitrifiers or denitrifiers than the 100 residue treatment figs 5 and 6 as with our findings hallam and bartholomew 1953 reported that the rate of plant residue addition had significant impacts on residue decomposition and the decomposition of residues was considerably more rapid at low addition rates than high addition rates moreover the lower supply of c from the half residue treatment could have led to lower mineral n immobilization thereby resulting in higher n2o emissions table 3 snyde et al 2009 burney et al 2010 in the present study the total n2o emissions during the non growing season accounted for half of the annual n2o emissions table 2 previous studies have also indicated that a large amount of n2o can be produced and emitted from soils at low temperatures even below 0 c holtan hartwig et al 2002 öquist et al 2004 koponen et al 2004 this could be due to several factors 1 the snow cover could reduce evaporation and create higher soil moisture conditions fig 2 thereby favouring denitrification which is probably the main mechanism for n2o production in soils close to 0 c 2 reduced gas diffusion creating anaerobic conditions 3 reduced competition for nitrate from vegetation 4 increased substrate availability from rupturing of microbes through freezing and 5 the high sensitivity of the n2o reductase enzyme to low temperatures thereby favouring n2o emissions over complete denitrification to n2 mørkved et al 2006 öquist et al 2007 two n2o emission flux peaks were observed during the period of continuous soil freezing from november in 2015 to february 2016 fig 3 the higher n2o emissions during the frozen period could be due to microorganisms that are still active in some isolated microsites of unfrozen soil water teepe et al 2000 the n2o flux observed during thawing could be a result of the physical release of trapped n2o and or denitrification during thawing teepe et al 2000 it has been suggested that soil freezing and thawing disrupts soil aggregates oztas and fayetorbay 2003 six et al 2004 plant material mellick and seppelt 1992 harris and safford 1996 microbial cells and protein decomposition skogland et al 1988 larsen et al 2002 yanai et al 2004 the increase in denitrification after thawing may be attributable to the diffusion of organic substrates newly available to denitrifiers from disrupted soil aggregates leading to an increase in microbial activity burton and beauchamp 1994 the n2o emissions in the non growing season were also affected by the quantity of the maize residues in the order of t3 t2 t1 table 2 as discussed a higher amount of residue cover could increase the denitrification rate by creating anaerobic conditions and increase the substrate for n2o production sehy et al 2003 have also reported that the emissions of n2o were significantly increased following the addition of c corresponding to elevated n2o emissions in frozen soils and the amount of n2o emitted was related to the quantity of available c this indicated that substrate availability e g c and n is a major factor affecting n2o emissions in frozen soils the process of soil freezing and thawing has been identified as an important cause of n2o emissions from soils schürmann et al 2002 groffman et al 2006 maljanen et al 2007 over the study period over one year the application of residue t2 and t3 treatments reduced n2o emission factors 0 62 and 0 67 respectively compared to the fertilizer only treatment 0 72 table 2 these findings are in agreement with the meta analysis of shan and yan 2013 summarizing crop residue effects on n2o emissions in agricultural soils 20 studies in which crop residue application reduced n2o emissions in contrast a number of studies reported the stimulatory effects of combined application of crop residues and synthetic n fertilizers on soil n2o emissions sarkodie addo et al 2003 huang et al 2004 as discussed these contradictory results are probably due to differences in residue characteristics climate soil texture and soil ph chen et al 2013 the reductions in n2o emissions from maize residue return in the present study are most likely to be due to the temporary strong soil n immobilization induced by the addition of maize residue with a high c n ratio c n was 51 9 and a relatively high application rate 5 conclusion this study showed that incorporation of the full maize residue into the soil reduced nh3 losses this could be due to the incorporation of crop residue affecting microbial activity soil temperature and moisture and therefore regulating the soil nh4 content the effects of residue return on n2o emissions are complex return of half the residue increased n2o emission while full residue return decreased n2o emissions during the maize growing season this indicated that the effect of crop residue on n2o emissions was significantly related to the amount of crop residue addition i e quantity the application of maize residues resulted in net soil n immobilization therefore this measure could be effective in mitigating n losses therefore the quantity of maize residues returned to the field is an important consideration for reducing environmental effects after maize harvest the total n2o emissions during the non growing season accounted for half of the annual n2o emissions these findings suggest that the process of soil freezing and thawing should be identified as an important cause of n2o emissions from treated soils accordingly full residue return in combination with synthetic n fertilizers could be a favourable strategy for reducing n losses through nh3 and n2o funding this study was financially supported by the national key research and development program of china nos 2017yfd0200100 2017yfd0200708 2016yfd0200307

11292,potato solanum tuberosum l production in semiarid regions is always constrained by water availability this study was to evaluate the effects of straw strips mulch to potato growth yield and economic benefits the field experiment was conducted in northwest china in 2016 and 2017 including four treatments 1 alternating narrow and wide ridges both mulched by black polyethylene film pm 2

increase were 36 9 61 2 in 2016 and 38 7 45 5 in 2017 respectively compared with ck pm and rs treatments produced the highest tuber yield and enhanced water use efficiency by up to 74 8 compared with ck soil water storage 0 2 m depth was 21 5 39 9 mm in 2016 and 16 7 41 2 mm in 2017 respectively greater in the mulched treatments which significantly p 0 05 reduced evapotranspiration from sowing to seedling stages compared with ck greater water availability was associated with greater biomass accumulation in above and below ground components and plant height gain during the growing season pm significantly p 0 05 increased soil temperature 5 25 cm depth which advanced the duration whole growth period by 6 days on average rs and pm treatments experienced lower soil temperature 5 25 cm depth which prolonged the duration whole growth period by 10 days on average and increased the mass and percentage of grade 1 tubers and the commodity rate p 0 05 as straw strips mulch application has lower input and labor costs than plastic film mulch it produced the greatest economic benefits during this study and it should be considered as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic film mulch for potato production in semiarid areas keywords ridge furrow film mulch maize straw strips mulch water use efficiency dryland potato 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is one of the main food crops traditionally planted in the semiarid region of northwest china where accounting for 36 of china s total potato acreage li et al 2018b however potato yields are frequently limited by water scarcity and suboptimal field management strategies in this region gan et al 2013 to alleviate these issues many management strategies had been made and tested to improve rainwater use efficiency in semiarid regions over last 30 years in these efforts a high and stable yielding in situ rainwater harvesting technique namely ridge furrow mulch system rfms has been developed and widely applied to crop yields in semiarid regions especially smallholders farmers occupied the dominate position mo et al 2017 liu et al 2009 the rfms consists of film mulch and alternating ridge furrow units it is generally built along with the contours on sloping lands where the film mulch mainly used to prevent soil evaporation and the ridge furrow units are usually used to rainwater harvesting zhou et al 2009 hu et al 2014 gan et al 2013 the rfms has been proved to be beneficial both directly and indirectly to crop growth such as optimizing soil hydrothermal environment liang et al 2018 li et al 2013 jay et al 1993 zhao et al 2014 increasing water use efficiency qin et al 2014 hu et al 2014 li et al 2018b promoting full release and efficient use of soil rapidly available nutrients jeffrey and kong 2012 and the smallholder farmer obtaining relatively high economic benefits zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2017 however straw mulching is a convenient mulching method and more environmentally friendly than plastic film mulching in regions where straw resources are locally available tang et al 2015 because the long term plastic film mulch has a huge negative impact such as leading to excessive soil water and nutrients consumption of crops wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 hou et al 2010 causing deterioration of soil structure entanglement of crop roots inhibition of nutrients and water absorption thus affecting root development reducing crop yields and restraining the sustainable development of agriculture liu et al 2014 gu et al 2017 in addition for potato if the high temperature humidity stress coexist which induced severe late blight under the ridge furrow plastic mulch system gansu economic daily 2013 straw mulch have been widespread in potato production in semiarid region of china straw mulch can conserve soil moisture by decreasing soil temperature yan et al 2018 increasing infiltration during heavy rains rahma et al 2017 reducing soil evaporation restraining runoff improving the environment of crop growth kashif et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 jiménez et al 2017 however traditional full straw mulch practice often lead to a significant decrease in soil temperature and hence making the wheat bonfil et al 1999 li et al 1999 asefa et al 2004 maize lu et al 2015 and other thermophilic crops seriously reduce production due to the shortage of accumulated temperature some studies have shown that the soil moisture of full straw mulch increase gradually with the increase of straw dosage but the soil temperature is opposite and it also make tillage difficult chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 especially in potato production there are serious mechanical obstacles caused by straw at sowing and harvesting stages therefore it is urgently necessary to develop some new straw mulch measures to coordinate the solution of the contradiction between water conservation and cooling under full straw mulch and at the same time it is suitable for mechanized tillage in this area therefore over the last few years our team designed a new straw mulch with system with reference to typical ridge furrow plastic mulch system gan et al 2013 namely straw strips mulch system ssms is to use crop straw or by products for local soil surface mulch the ssms consists of two critical components straw strips mulch and alternating crop planting strips non mulch fig 1 b c previous research by our team had shown that the ssms significantly improved winter wheat yields compared with traditional flat planting without mulch and plastic film mulch wang et al 2017 in addition the acceptance extent by small farmer is another key factor because any agricultural system is expected to be cost effective and it should be easy to operate in the present study two year field experiments were performed in 2016 and 2017 on the semiarid rain fed agriculture region of northwest china the objectives were to 1 assess the effects of straw strips mulching and plastic film mulching practices on potato growth water use efficiency and tuber yield 2 to evaluate the influences of different mulching cultivation patterns on soil temperature and soil water storage and 3 to determine an appropriate mulching cultivation patterns for the maximum yield and economic benefits of rain fed potato in the semiarid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experiment site the field experiment was

harvested fields air dried and the whole maize straws were uniformly applied at the rates of 9 0 t ha 1 equivalent to the local maize straw production per unit area by hand on mulching units in each experimental year potatoes were seeded at a population density of 5 55 104 plants ha 1 1863 plants plot 1 the main agronomic management practices are shown in table 1 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil temperature and moisture determinations a series of different hy 1 right angle mercury in glass thermometer were fixed at 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 m depth in the middle between two plants in the rows to measure soil temperature at various soil layers throughout each growing season soil temperature were recorded at 7 00 14 00 and 19 00 h daily of the typical sunny days the average value of three readings was calculated as the daily average value of soil temperature across each growing season soil gravimetric water content using the oven method at 105 gwc was determined at a 2 m with 0 0

between two plants in the rows if there occurred a rainfall in a sampling day soil samplings were done 2 3 days later the mean 0 2 m soil water content i e gwc was calculated as the weighted average wa of the eight soil layers 1 w a 1 i g w c i s d i 1 i s d i where sd is soil depth cm of each layer i is order of soil layer the soil water storage sws mm was determined by the following formula 2 2

during the growing season as each plot was surrounded by big ridges the occurrence of surface runoff can be prevented across growing season the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insigniﬁcant therefore evapotranspiration et mm was determined using the equation for soil water balance 3 q u o t e e t p δ w where p mm is total precipitation amount during each growing season and δsw mm is the change in soil water storage i e water storage at harvesting minus water storage at sowing in the 2 m soil depth water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following formula 4 w u e y e t

recorded when 75 plants were showing the characteristics in their appearance in each plot the final height of plant was measured by the randomly selection of five plants from each plot at maturity stage the dry matters of above ground including stems and leaves and below ground including roots and tubers parts of five plants per plot were measured for fresh mass and then oven dried at 105 for 30 min and then 85 for 48 h for dry mass at every growth stage in each plot tuber yield tuber number and tuber grade date were collected manually after harvesting in each plot fifteen plants were randomly sampled for indoor test and were divided into three grades based on fresh weight grade 1 more than150 g grade 2 75 150 g and grade 3 less than 75 g 75 g of tuber was evaluated as a commercial tuber about 2 0 yuan kg 1 rmb and 75 g of tuber was sold at a price about 0 7 yuan kg 1 rmb in both of years the total tubers were weighed for tuber yields and its components assessment analyses on the economic benefits of potato under different cultivation practices were on input price and yield tuber yield kg ha 1 data were calculated and reported on an area basis for all treatments the commodity rate of potato tuber was calculated using the following formula commodity rate 100 75 g of tuber weight the total output of tuber 2 4 statistical analyses the soil moisture soil temperature plant height and its dry matter and duration of growth stage tuber yield and wue were processed with soft ibm spss statistics 20 0 all the date were analyzed for using one way analysis of variance anova the differences of average values between treatments were compared by least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 microsoft excel 2013 was used to process the date and figures 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions the total precipitation from sowing to harvest was 150 9 and 208 2 mm for the planting years of 2016 and 2017 respectively more importantly the effective days of precipitation accounted for 29 4 2016 and 39 4 2017 during the growth seasons and there were many large precipitation events over 15 mm in 2017 the mean daily maximum air temperature was 28 6 and 24 4 for the planting years of 2016 and 2017 respectively and the mean daily minimum air temperature 11 3 and 9 for the planting years of 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with long term average of last 40 years from 1975 to 2015 213 0 mm precipitation during the potato growing season of 2016 150 9 mm and 2017 208 2 mm was a dry and normal year respectively fig 2 3 2 soil temperature as shown in fig 4 during the whole experimental seasons of 2016 and 2017 pm treatment significantly elevated the mean daily soil temperature at 0 05 0 25 m soil depth time at 7 00 14 00 and 19 00 h by 1 0 and 1 5 respectively while rs and ps treatments significantly p 0 05 reduced it by 0 5 1 6 and 2 2 1 1 respectively compared with ck also pm treatment consistently obtained the highest mean daily soil temperature as compared with ck whereas ps treatment mostly obtained the lowest mean daily soil temperature in 2016 but rs treatment in 2017 across two years the mean daily soil temperature in pm was 0 9 2 2 higher than in ck during the whole growing season except at tuber initiation stage was lower than in the ck while rs and ps treatments decreased it by 0 5 1 8 and 0 5 2 8 respectively however the differences amongst different mulching cultivation practices and ck were the biggest at seedling and sowing stages respectively and the smallest soil temperature differences amongst different mulching cultivation practices at budding and tuber initiation stages respectively there were no relations between the tuber yield and the mean daily soil temperature r 0 138 0 400 p 0 05 n 24 during the growing season the effects of mulching with plastic film and crop straw on soil temperature have been widely documented plastic film mulching and crop straw mulching generally have opposite effects on soil temperature during the whole growth period but plastic film mulching has a slight cooling effects in the middle growth stage li et al 2018a b in our study we found that the pm treatment increased the soil temperature fig 4 resulting in the highest soil temperatures observed in both years this was because that polyethylene film mulch increased soil temperature by suppressing soil evaporation and latent heat loss zhang et al 2017 rs and ps treatments reduced soil temperature mainly because straw mulch on the soil surface had a greater albedo and blocked the solar energy reaching the soil sarkar et al 2007 and bristow 1998 had reported that the soil thermal state under straw mulch was different from that of bare soil and the soil temperature was usually lower under mulched surfaces than bare soils our field experiment indicated that soil temperatures were decreased under straw strips mulch this was because the heat exchange between the straw mulch parts and bare soil parts of rs and ps treatments thereby reduced the magnitude of soil temperature increases regardless in warm 2016 or cool 2017 year 3 3 soil moisture 3 3 1 soil water storage normal changes in the soil evaporation temperature precipitation and crop water consumption resulted in significant difference in soil water storage sws 0 2 m soil depth with the different mulch cultivation practices and the control ck at various potato growth stages fig 3 in the dry year of 2016 rs treatment had the greatest sws at seedling stage and budding stage which was 41 5 and 50 6 mm higher p 0 05 than ck respectively from tuber initiation to starch accumulation stages in 2016 the sws decreased gradually with all the cultivation practices rs ps and pm treatments had the greatest sws at tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages compared with ck the averaged sws over the two growth stages was significantly p 0 05 increased with rs ps and pm by 65 3 52 6 and 47 4 mm respectively in 2016 ps had the greatest sws at starch accumulation and maturity stages which was 29 0 and 21 0 mm higher p 0 05 than ck respectively in 2016 in normal year of 2017 the difference in sws among treatments was caused by winter fallow at sowing stage the sws in rs was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in pm 17 5 mm at the sowing stage from seedling to tuber initiation stages and at maturity stage in 2017 three mulch treatments always significantly p 0 05 increased sws compared with ck the average sws over the four growth stages was significantly p 0 05 increased with rs ps and pm by 48 9 35 7 and 30 9 mm respectively in 2017 the sws in rs and ps was 37 4 and 24 8 mm higher p 0 05 than in ck at tuber bulking stage respectively while the sws in pm had slightly lower p 0 05 than in ck in 2017 the sws in rs treatment was 54 8 mm higher than in ck at starch accumulation stage and there was no significant p 0 05 differences observed between ps pm treatments and ck in 2017 on average rs treatment had the greatest sws during the whole growth period in both years compared with ck rs treatment significantly p 0 05 increased sws by 34 2 mm in 2016 and 41 2 mm in 2017 respectively the ps and pm treatments had slightly p 0 05 higher sws compared with ck during the whole growth period in 2016 but in 2017 the ps and pm treatments significantly p 0 05 increased sws by 23 5 and 16 7 mm during the whole growth period respectively mulching treatments can enhance the available soil moisture condition by collecting micro efficient or ineffective precipitation reducing soil evaporation restraining runoff and promoting precipitation infiltration during heavy rains zhang et al 2013 jiménez et al 2017 rahma et al 2017 kashif et al 2006 compared with ck we found that the mulch treatments can effectively inhibit soil evaporation from planting units where potato was planted and the soil water storage was enhanced by 4 8 58 5 mm from sowing to seedling stages the soil water storage in rs was always higher than that in the ps and pm treatments this were probably owing to following reasons firstly pm produced a higher soil temperature so plant grew quickly and consumed more water secondly the soil water storage effects of ridge furrow with straw mulch was better than the flat straw mulch thirdly although plastic film mulch on ridges completely prevented soil water evaporation its infiltration effect on precipitation may not be as good as straw strips mulch only on furrows for example at the sowing date of 2017 rs had the highest soil water storage and it was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in pm by 17 5 mm 3 3 2 evapotranspiration et tuber yield and water use efficiency wue there were significant p 0 05 differences in et with different cultivation practices during the potato growing season table 2 during the early growth stages i e sowing to seedling potato plants were not exposed or smaller and the consumption of water was dominated via soil evaporation mulch cultivation practices decreased the soil evaporation and the et with all mulch treatments was lower compared with ck during the early growth period averaged across two years rs ps and pm treatments significantly p 0 05 decreased the et by 54 5 14 7 and 32 5 mm from sowing to seedling stages respectively compared with ck potato growth was vigorous during the vegetative growth period i e seedling to tuber initiation the higher consumption of water resulted in higher transpiration fig 6 rs ps and pm treatments still significantly p 0 05 decreased the et by 45 0 62 4 and 46 8 mm during the vegetative growth period in dry year of 2016 respectively compared with ck however the rs and pm treatments increased the et but ps reduced it during the vegetative growth period in normal year of 2017 and the rs had the greatest et which was increased by 44 5 mm from seedling to tuber initiation stages in the tuber growth period i e tuber initiation to maturity the growth center of potato plants was gradually transferred from the above ground parts to below ground parts fig 6 there were no significant p 0 05 differences in et among the mulching treatments at the tuber growth stages in 2016 and the mean et with three mulching cultivation treatments was significantly p 0 05 increased by 66 7 mm compared with ck however there were no significant p 0 05 differences in et between the ps pm treatments and ck and the et with rs treatment was significantly p 0 05 decreased by 24 8 mm in tuber growth period in 2017 during the whole growing season there was no significant p 0 05 the total et differences observed between mulch cultivation practices and ck in dry year of 2016 however in the normal year of 2017 rs ps and pm was significantly p 0 05 increased by 47 8 32 9 and 31 0 mm respectively compared with ck and non significantly p 0 05 among the three mulching treatments compared with ck mulch cultivation practices significantly p 0 05 improved tuber yields and wue table 2 averaged across two years tuber yield of potato for each of the treatments were ranked as follows pm rs ps ck compared with ck the mean tuber yield with rs ps and pm was significantly p 0 05 increased by 7950 8 kg ha 1 52 4 5740 4 kg ha 1 37 8 and 8062 1 kg ha 1 53 1 respectively averaged across two years the wue were ranked as follows rs pm ps ck compared with ck the mean wue with rs ps and pm was significantly p 0 05 increased by 40 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 67 4 32 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 53 6 and 33 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 55 4 respectively there existed extremely positive relations between the tuber yield and mean sws r 0 693 p 0 001 n 24 and wue r 0 894 p 0 001 n 24 during the growing season mulch cultivation practices also significantly influenced wue by changing crop consumption patterns including reducing early evaporation and increasing later transpiration and soil evaporation et is the sum of plant transpiration and soil evaporation and the isotope measurements indicate that the plant transpiration is the largest component of et jasechko et al 2013 li et al 2013 reported that crop water consumption rate at different growth stages could be changed by mulching the soil surface with different materials both plastic film mulch and straw mulch could reduce soil evaporation and the total et which was consistent with results of this study the mulch treatments had different effects on et during the potato growing season in our study table 2 in both dry and normal years mulch treatments greatly reduced the et than ck before the seedling emergence in dry year of 2016 the total et difference between the mulch treatments and ck was not obvious but decreased significantly in the normal year of 2017 which was in accordance with the study of qin et al 2014 this is mainly due to the large and uniform precipitation in 2017 therefore in our study mulch cultivation practices enhanced water use efficiency by 50 1 74 8 and the rs had the highest wue in both years consequently rs provided more available water for potato growth one of the best straw strips mulch cultivation practice in improving wue in semiarid regions li et al 2018b 3 4 crop development and biomass accumulation 3 4 1 final plant height and dry matter the final plant height of mulch treatments were significantly p 0 05 greater than that in the non mulch plots fig 5 among all the treatments the pm treatment produced the greatest final plant height in both years with 44 8 cm in 2016 and 48 2 cm in 2017 respectively interestingly the difference of final plant height between rs and ps treatment was not significant in 2017 but significant in 2016 below ground parts of the dry matter of per plant increased gradually among all the cultivation practices while the dry matter of above ground parts of per plant in pm consistently higher than the in ck however the dry matter of above ground parts of per plant in rs and ps treatments were less than in the ck before tuber bulking stages in 2016 but during the vegetative growth period i e budding to tuber initiation stages in 2017 rs produced the fastest accumulation rate of below ground dry matter as compared to other s in both years fig 6 across years and treatments there existed extremely positive relations between the tuber yield and mean weight of dry matter per plant from the tuber initiation to maturity stages r 0 803 0 974 p 0 001 n 12 and plant height from the budding to maturity stages r 0 844 0 966 p 0 001 n 12 table 3 3 4 2 the dynamics of emergence and the duration of growth stages the growth and developmental progress of potato was earlier with the pm treatment compared with ck while rs and ps treatments delayed it in both years table 4 averaged across years and cultivation practices with pm 75 emergence budding yield formation and whole growth duration were advanced p 0 05 by to 2 7 2 1 2 and 5 8 days respectively compared with ck whereas rs and ps treatments delayed p 0 05 75 emergence budding yield formation and whole growth duration on average by 2 4 3 9 4 8 and 11 1 days respectively compared to ck across years and cultivation practices the tuber yield was more closely related to yield formation duration r 0 980 p 0 001 n 12 than to whole growth duration r 0 954 p 0 001 n 12 but the tuber yields was not related to 75 emergence r 0 145 p 0 652 n 12 and budding duration r 0 287 p 0 325 n 12 3 4 3 tuber grade on 24 august 2016 and 16 august 2017 when plant leaves and stems of all treatments were completely senescent fifteen plants were harvested for tuber grade tuber weights and commodity rate were significantly p 0 05 affected by the mulching treatments table 5 tuber weights was significantly higher p 0 05 in rs and pm than ps which was also significantly higher than in the ck compared to ck the rs ps and pm treatments significantly p 0 05 increased tuber weights by 62 1 36 0 and 66 1 in 2016 and 43 6 35 1 and 44 7 in 2017 respectively in comparison ck treatment had the highest percentage of grade 3 and the lowest grade 1 and grade 2 tubers and the overall lowest weights and commodity rate in both years rs produced the highest grade 1and lowest grade 3 tubers and they had also significant differences with pm there existed extremely positive relations between the tuber yields and the tuber weights r 0 965 p 0 001 n 24 and commodity rate r 0 965 p 0 001 n 24 and the tuber yields was more closely positive correlated with the grade 1 tubers r 0 817 p 0 001 n 24 than grade 2 tubers r 0 623 p 0 001 n 24 but a negative grade 3 tubers r 0 895 p 0 001 n 24 in both of seasons in addition over two years the correlation between grade 1 and 2 tubers and mean soil temperature reached significant level r 0 456 0 418 p 0 05 n 24 the mean sws had very significant positive correlation with the commodity rate r 0 760 p 0 001 n 24 and grade 1 tubers r 0 843 p 0 001 n 24 and negative correlation with grade 3 tubers r 0 722 p 0 001 n 24 and was not related to grade 2 tubers previous studies have shown that both plastic film mulch and straw strips mulch can increase soil water content han et al 2016 fig 3 however plastic film mulch can increase soil temperature and promoting crop growth and development while straw strips mulch decrease soil temperature and delayed crop growth and development similar results with plastic film mulch ridges and straw mulch were reported by hu et al 2014 and li et al 2013 respectively our study also found that pm obviously increased soil temperature and the 75 emergence duration and whole growth duration were up to 2 3 and 5 8 days respectively compared with ck the rs and ps clearly reduced soil temperature and the 75 emergence duration and whole growth duration were delayed by 2 3 and 10 14 days respectively compared with ck also several investigators reported that potato haulm growth is fastest in the air temperature range of 20 25 while the optimal range for tuber initiation and tuber growth is 15 20 and tuber growth tends to stop when temperature higher than 25 krystyna 2015 zhang et al 2010 cool night temperatures are essential for the accumulation of carbohydrates and dry matter in the tubers qin et al 2014 bélanger et al 2000 hiremath et al 2014 in our experiment the soil temperature in plastic film mulch ridges and straw strips mulch was in the range of 23 3 29 1 and 20 5 26 2 respectively during the tuber growth period fig 4 hence straw strips mulch treatments had the faster dry matter accumulation rate during the tuber growth period fig 6 similarly the weights and percentages of grade 1 tubers in straw strips mulch higher than plastic film mulch on ridges and ck the rs had the greatest commodity rate and weights and percentages of grade 1 tubers in both years table 5 3 5 economic benefits under different cultivation patterns mulch cultivation practices had higher economic benefits and output input than ck table 6 rs had the highest economic benefits and output input compared with other treatments in both of years compared with pm eb and output input in rs were 15 9 and 17 7 higher in 2016 and 14 9 and 16 9 higher in 2017 respectively and compared to ck 1 9 times and 61 0 in 2016 and 1 3 times and 44 4 in 2017 respectively in semiarid region of northwest china where are abundant straw resources straw as a kind of low cost and renewable resource and the annual growth rate of 4 1 burned or abandoned more than 50 0 led to serious waste of straw resources and environment pollution bao et al 2014 traditional full straw mulch usually inhibit seedling emergence and reduced crop yields and make tillage difficult hu et al 2016 meanwhile traditional full straw mulch is clear not suitable for mechanized farming to increase labor intensity which is difficult for local smallholder farmer to accept in our study as straw strips mulch application has lower input and labor costs than plastic film mulch smallholder farmer can obtain the highest economic benefits and should be considered as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic film mulch for potato production in semiarid regions 4 conclusion under the conditions of scarce precipitation and heat stress in summer maize straw strips mulch only on furrows was a promising technique for increasing dryland potato yield and wue the maize straw strips mulch only on furrows kept the soil wetter and cooler decreased et during the early growing stage thus delayed plant senescence and ensured longer tuber growth duration the maize straw strips mulch only on furrows meet the low cost high efficient and easy operated standards facing the reality smallholder farmers compared with plastic film mulch moreover with the application of this innovation technology it is inevitable to reduce plastic film application and it is also an environmentally friendly technology also economic profitability is obviously improved through this kind of simple and low cost agricultural system this may be a determination for local smallholder farmers to accept and apply this new technology for straw strips mulch therefore the maize straw strips mulch only on furrows is recommended as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic film mulch for potato production in semiarid regions acknowledgements we thank editors and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions on the

11292,potato solanum tuberosum l production in semiarid regions is always constrained by water availability this study was to evaluate the effects of straw strips mulch to potato growth yield and economic benefits the field experiment was conducted in northwest china in 2016 and 2017 including four treatments 1 alternating narrow and wide ridges both mulched by black polyethylene film pm 2 alternating large ridges and small furrows with maize straw strips mulched only on the furrows rs 3 alternating the strips mulched with maize straw and bare plots with no ridges ps 4 traditional flat planting without mulching ck results indicated that mulched treatments significantly p 0 05 increased tuber yield and wue of potato compared with ck the magnitude of yield in mulched treatments increase were 36 9 61 2 in 2016 and 38 7 45 5 in 2017 respectively compared with ck pm and rs treatments produced the highest tuber yield and enhanced water use efficiency by up to 74 8 compared with ck soil water storage 0 2 m depth was 21 5 39 9 mm in 2016 and 16 7 41 2 mm in 2017 respectively greater in the mulched treatments which significantly p 0 05 reduced evapotranspiration from sowing to seedling stages compared with ck greater water availability was associated with greater biomass accumulation in above and below ground components and plant height gain during the growing season pm significantly p 0 05 increased soil temperature 5 25 cm depth which advanced the duration whole growth period by 6 days on average rs and pm treatments experienced lower soil temperature 5 25 cm depth which prolonged the duration whole growth period by 10 days on average and increased the mass and percentage of grade 1 tubers and the commodity rate p 0 05 as straw strips mulch application has lower input and labor costs than plastic film mulch it produced the greatest economic benefits during this study and it should be considered as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic film mulch for potato production in semiarid areas keywords ridge furrow film mulch maize straw strips mulch water use efficiency dryland potato 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is one of the main food crops traditionally planted in the semiarid region of northwest china where accounting for 36 of china s total potato acreage li et al 2018b however potato yields are frequently limited by water scarcity and suboptimal field management strategies in this region gan et al 2013 to alleviate these issues many management strategies had been made and tested to improve rainwater use efficiency in semiarid regions over last 30 years in these efforts a high and stable yielding in situ rainwater harvesting technique namely ridge furrow mulch system rfms has been developed and widely applied to crop yields in semiarid regions especially smallholders farmers occupied the dominate position mo et al 2017 liu et al 2009 the rfms consists of film mulch and alternating ridge furrow units it is generally built along with the contours on sloping lands where the film mulch mainly used to prevent soil evaporation and the ridge furrow units are usually used to rainwater harvesting zhou et al 2009 hu et al 2014 gan et al 2013 the rfms has been proved to be beneficial both directly and indirectly to crop growth such as optimizing soil hydrothermal environment liang et al 2018 li et al 2013 jay et al 1993 zhao et al 2014 increasing water use efficiency qin et al 2014 hu et al 2014 li et al 2018b promoting full release and efficient use of soil rapidly available nutrients jeffrey and kong 2012 and the smallholder farmer obtaining relatively high economic benefits zhao et al 2014 mo et al 2017 however straw mulching is a convenient mulching method and more environmentally friendly than plastic film mulching in regions where straw resources are locally available tang et al 2015 because the long term plastic film mulch has a huge negative impact such as leading to excessive soil water and nutrients consumption of crops wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 hou et al 2010 causing deterioration of soil structure entanglement of crop roots inhibition of nutrients and water absorption thus affecting root development reducing crop yields and restraining the sustainable development of agriculture liu et al 2014 gu et al 2017 in addition for potato if the high temperature humidity stress coexist which induced severe late blight under the ridge furrow plastic mulch system gansu economic daily 2013 straw mulch have been widespread in potato production in semiarid region of china straw mulch can conserve soil moisture by decreasing soil temperature yan et al 2018 increasing infiltration during heavy rains rahma et al 2017 reducing soil evaporation restraining runoff improving the environment of crop growth kashif et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 jiménez et al 2017 however traditional full straw mulch practice often lead to a significant decrease in soil temperature and hence making the wheat bonfil et al 1999 li et al 1999 asefa et al 2004 maize lu et al 2015 and other thermophilic crops seriously reduce production due to the shortage of accumulated temperature some studies have shown that the soil moisture of full straw mulch increase gradually with the increase of straw dosage but the soil temperature is opposite and it also make tillage difficult chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 especially in potato production there are serious mechanical obstacles caused by straw at sowing and harvesting stages therefore it is urgently necessary to develop some new straw mulch measures to coordinate the solution of the contradiction between water conservation and cooling under full straw mulch and at the same time it is suitable for mechanized tillage in this area therefore over the last few years our team designed a new straw mulch with system with reference to typical ridge furrow plastic mulch system gan et al 2013 namely straw strips mulch system ssms is to use crop straw or by products for local soil surface mulch the ssms consists of two critical components straw strips mulch and alternating crop planting strips non mulch fig 1 b c previous research by our team had shown that the ssms significantly improved winter wheat yields compared with traditional flat planting without mulch and plastic film mulch wang et al 2017 in addition the acceptance extent by small farmer is another key factor because any agricultural system is expected to be cost effective and it should be easy to operate in the present study two year field experiments were performed in 2016 and 2017 on the semiarid rain fed agriculture region of northwest china the objectives were to 1 assess the effects of straw strips mulching and plastic film mulching practices on potato growth water use efficiency and tuber yield 2 to evaluate the influences of different mulching cultivation patterns on soil temperature and soil water storage and 3 to determine an appropriate mulching cultivation patterns for the maximum yield and economic benefits of rain fed potato in the semiarid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experiment site the field experiment was established in 2016 and 2017 at tongwei modern dryland circular farming experiment station dingxi city gansu province china 35 11 n 105 19 e altitude 1740 m the study site is characterized as typical

potassium 117 3 mg kg 1 and ph 8 5 2 5 1 2 2 experimental design and field management four cultivation treatments were established in april 18 2016 first growing season and september 26 2016 second growing season respectively arranged in a randomized complete block design in 8 4 m wide and 40 m long plots with three replicates per treatment in 2016 and 2017 1 pm alternating narrow 0 4 m width 0 1 m high and wide ridges 0 8 m width 0 1 m high both mulched by black polyethylene film completely mulched narrow ridges and there was 0 1 m water seepage zones non mulched at the top of wide ridges the plastic film was joined at the top of 0 1 m water seepage zones and sealed with soil and small holes spaced at 0 4 m were made on the plastic film in the furrows with a sharp object for rainfall infiltration two rows of potato were planted in the wide ridges with dibblers with 0 6 m spacing between rows fig 1a 2 rs alternating large ridges 0 7 m width 0 1 m high and small furrows 0 5 m width with maize straw strips mulched only on furrows two rows of potato were planted in the ridges with 0 4 m spacing between rows fig 1b 3 ps alternating the strips mulched 0 5 m width with maize straw with the strip of bare soil 0 7 m width with no ridges two rows of potato were planted in the non mulched strips with 0 4 m spacing between rows fig 1c 4 ck traditional flat planting without mulching the row distances were all 0 6 m fig 1d the plastic film was black polyethylene with 1 2 m wide and 0 01 mm in thickness for the straw strips mulching treatments maize straw was collected from harvested fields air dried and the whole maize straws were uniformly applied at the rates of 9 0 t ha 1 equivalent to the local maize straw production per unit area by hand on mulching units in each experimental year potatoes were seeded at a population density of 5 55 104 plants ha 1 1863 plants plot 1 the main agronomic management practices are shown in table 1 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil temperature and moisture determinations a series of different hy 1 right angle mercury in glass thermometer were fixed at 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 m depth in the middle between two plants in the rows to measure soil temperature at various soil layers throughout each growing season soil temperature were recorded at 7 00 14 00 and 19 00 h daily of the typical sunny days the average value of three readings was calculated as the daily average value of soil temperature across each growing season soil gravimetric water content using the oven method at 105 gwc was determined at a 2 m with 0 0

between two plants in the rows if there occurred a rainfall in a sampling day soil samplings were done 2 3 days later the mean 0 2 m soil water content i e gwc was calculated as the weighted average wa of the eight soil layers 1 w a 1 i g w c i s d i 1 i s d i where sd is soil depth cm of each layer i is order of soil layer the soil water storage sws mm was determined by the following formula 2 2 s w s m m g w c ρ b g c m 3 s d m m where ρb is soil bulk density sd is soil depth 2 3 2 water use efficiency field experiments were conducted under rain fed condition and no irrigation was applied during the growing season as each plot was surrounded by big ridges the occurrence of surface runoff can be prevented across growing season the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insigniﬁcant therefore evapotranspiration et mm was determined using the equation for soil water balance 3 q u o t e e t p δ w where p mm is total precipitation amount during each growing season and δsw mm is the change in soil water storage i e water storage at harvesting minus water storage at sowing in the 2 m soil depth water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following formula 4 w u e y e t where y is tuber yield kg ha 1 et is total evapotranspiration mm of whole growth period 2 3 3 plant sampling the main growth stages of potato including emergence budding and yield formation were recorded when 75 plants were showing the characteristics in their appearance in each plot the final height of plant was measured by the randomly selection of five plants from each plot at maturity stage the dry matters of above ground including stems and leaves and below ground including roots and tubers parts of five plants per plot were measured for fresh mass and then oven dried at 105 for 30 min and then 85 for 48 h for dry mass at every growth stage in each plot tuber yield tuber number and tuber grade date were collected manually after harvesting in each plot fifteen plants were randomly sampled for indoor test and were divided into three grades based on fresh weight grade 1 more than150 g grade 2 75 150 g and grade 3 less than 75 g 75 g of tuber was evaluated as a commercial tuber about 2 0 yuan kg 1 rmb and 75 g of tuber was sold at a price about 0 7 yuan kg 1 rmb in both of years the total tubers were weighed for tuber yields and its components assessment analyses on the economic benefits of potato under different cultivation practices were on input price and yield tuber yield kg ha 1 data were calculated and reported on an area basis for all treatments the commodity rate of potato tuber was calculated using the following formula commodity rate 100 75 g of tuber weight the total output of tuber 2 4 statistical analyses the soil moisture soil temperature plant height and its dry matter and duration of growth stage tuber yield and wue were processed with soft ibm spss statistics 20 0 all the date were analyzed for using one way analysis of variance anova the differences of average values between treatments were compared by least significant differences lsd at p 0 05 microsoft excel 2013 was used to process the date and figures 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions the total precipitation from sowing to harvest was 150 9 and 208 2 mm for the planting years of 2016 and 2017 respectively more importantly the effective days of precipitation accounted for 29 4 2016 and 39 4 2017 during the growth seasons and there were many large precipitation events over 15 mm in 2017 the mean daily maximum air temperature was 28 6 and 24 4 for the planting years of 2016 and 2017 respectively and the mean daily minimum air temperature 11 3 and 9 for the planting years of 2016 and 2017 respectively compared with long term average of last 40 years from 1975 to 2015 213 0 mm precipitation during the potato growing season of 2016 150 9 mm and 2017 208 2 mm was a dry and normal year respectively fig 2 3 2 soil temperature as shown in fig 4 during the whole experimental seasons of 2016 and 2017 pm treatment significantly elevated the mean daily soil temperature at 0 05 0 25 m soil depth time at 7 00 14 00 and 19 00 h by 1 0 and 1 5 respectively while rs and ps treatments significantly p 0 05 reduced it by 0 5 1 6 and 2 2 1 1 respectively compared with ck also pm treatment consistently obtained the highest mean daily soil temperature as compared with ck whereas ps treatment mostly obtained the lowest mean daily soil temperature in 2016 but rs treatment in 2017 across two years the mean daily soil temperature in pm was 0 9 2 2 higher than in ck during the whole growing season except at tuber initiation stage was lower than in the ck while rs and ps treatments decreased it by 0 5 1 8 and 0 5 2 8 respectively however the differences amongst different mulching cultivation practices and ck were the biggest at seedling and sowing stages respectively and the smallest soil temperature differences amongst different mulching cultivation practices at budding and tuber initiation stages respectively there were no relations between the tuber yield and the mean daily soil temperature r 0 138 0 400 p 0 05 n 24 during the growing season the effects of mulching with plastic film and crop straw on soil temperature have been widely documented plastic film mulching and crop straw mulching generally have opposite effects on soil temperature during the whole growth period but plastic film mulching has a slight cooling effects in the middle growth stage li et al 2018a b in our study we found that the pm treatment increased the soil temperature fig 4 resulting in the highest soil temperatures observed in both years this was because that polyethylene film mulch increased soil temperature by suppressing soil evaporation and latent heat loss zhang et al 2017 rs and ps treatments reduced soil temperature mainly because straw mulch on the soil surface had a greater albedo and blocked the solar energy reaching the soil sarkar et al 2007 and bristow 1998 had reported that the soil thermal state under straw mulch was different from that of bare soil and the soil temperature was usually lower under mulched surfaces than bare soils our field experiment indicated that soil temperatures were decreased under straw strips mulch this was because the heat exchange between the straw mulch parts and bare soil parts of rs and ps treatments thereby reduced the magnitude of soil temperature increases regardless in warm 2016 or cool 2017 year 3 3 soil moisture 3 3 1 soil water storage normal changes in the soil evaporation temperature precipitation and crop water consumption resulted in significant difference in soil water storage sws 0 2 m soil depth with the different mulch cultivation practices and the control ck at various potato growth stages fig 3 in the dry year of 2016 rs treatment had the greatest sws at seedling stage and budding stage which was 41 5 and 50 6 mm higher p 0 05 than ck respectively from tuber initiation to starch accumulation stages in 2016 the sws decreased gradually with all the cultivation practices rs ps and pm treatments had the greatest sws at tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages compared with ck the averaged sws over the two growth stages was significantly p 0 05 increased with rs ps and pm by 65 3 52 6 and 47 4 mm respectively in 2016 ps had the greatest sws at starch accumulation and maturity stages which was 29 0 and 21 0 mm higher p 0 05 than ck respectively in 2016 in normal year of 2017 the difference in sws among treatments was caused by winter fallow at sowing stage the sws in rs was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in pm 17 5 mm at the sowing stage from seedling to tuber initiation stages and at maturity stage in 2017 three mulch treatments always significantly p 0 05 increased sws compared with ck the average sws over the four growth stages was significantly p 0 05 increased with rs ps and pm by 48 9 35 7 and 30 9 mm respectively in 2017 the sws in rs and ps was 37 4 and 24 8 mm higher p 0 05 than in ck at tuber bulking stage respectively while the sws in pm had slightly lower p 0 05 than in ck in 2017 the sws in rs treatment was 54 8 mm higher than in ck at starch accumulation stage and there was no significant p 0 05 differences observed between ps pm treatments and ck in 2017 on average rs treatment had the greatest sws during the whole growth period in both years compared with ck rs treatment significantly p 0 05 increased sws by 34 2 mm in 2016 and 41 2 mm in 2017 respectively the ps and pm treatments had slightly p 0 05 higher sws compared with ck during the whole growth period in 2016 but in 2017 the ps and pm treatments significantly p 0 05 increased sws by 23 5 and 16 7 mm during the whole growth period respectively mulching treatments can enhance the available soil moisture condition by collecting micro efficient or ineffective precipitation reducing soil evaporation restraining runoff and promoting precipitation infiltration during heavy rains zhang et al 2013 jiménez et al 2017 rahma et al 2017 kashif et al 2006 compared with ck we found that the mulch treatments can effectively inhibit soil evaporation from planting units where potato was planted and the soil water storage was enhanced by 4 8 58 5 mm from sowing to seedling stages the soil water storage in rs was always higher than that in the ps and pm treatments this were probably owing to following reasons firstly pm produced a higher soil temperature so plant grew quickly and consumed more water secondly the soil water storage effects of ridge furrow with straw mulch was better than the flat straw mulch thirdly although plastic film mulch on ridges completely prevented soil water evaporation its infiltration effect on precipitation may not be as good as straw strips mulch only on furrows for example at the sowing date of 2017 rs had the highest soil water storage and it was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in pm by 17 5 mm 3 3 2 evapotranspiration et tuber yield and water use efficiency wue there were significant p 0 05 differences in et with different cultivation practices during the potato growing season table 2 during the early growth stages i e sowing to seedling potato plants were not exposed or smaller and the consumption of water was dominated via soil evaporation mulch cultivation practices decreased the soil evaporation and the et with all mulch treatments was lower compared with ck during the early growth period averaged across two years rs ps and pm treatments significantly p 0 05 decreased the et by 54 5 14 7 and 32 5 mm from sowing to seedling stages respectively compared with ck potato growth was vigorous during the vegetative growth period i e seedling to tuber initiation the higher consumption of water resulted in higher transpiration fig 6 rs ps and pm treatments still significantly p 0 05 decreased the et by 45 0 62 4 and 46 8 mm during the vegetative growth period in dry year of 2016 respectively compared with ck however the rs and pm treatments increased the et but ps reduced it during the vegetative growth period in normal year of 2017 and the rs had the greatest et which was increased by 44 5 mm from seedling to tuber initiation stages in the tuber growth period i e tuber initiation to maturity the growth center of potato plants was gradually transferred from the above ground parts to below ground parts fig 6 there were no significant p 0 05 differences in et among the mulching treatments at the tuber growth stages in 2016 and the mean et with three mulching cultivation treatments was significantly p 0 05 increased by 66 7 mm compared with ck however there were no significant p 0 05 differences in et between the ps pm treatments and ck and the et with rs treatment was significantly p 0 05 decreased by 24 8 mm in tuber growth period in 2017 during the whole growing season there was no significant p 0 05 the total et differences observed between mulch cultivation practices and ck in dry year of 2016 however in the normal year of 2017 rs ps and pm was significantly p 0 05 increased by 47 8 32 9 and 31 0 mm respectively compared with ck and non significantly p 0 05 among the three mulching treatments compared with ck mulch cultivation practices significantly p 0 05 improved tuber yields and wue table 2 averaged across two years tuber yield of potato for each of the treatments were ranked as follows pm rs ps ck compared with ck the mean tuber yield with rs ps and pm was significantly p 0 05 increased by 7950 8 kg ha 1 52 4 5740 4 kg ha 1 37 8 and 8062 1 kg ha 1 53 1 respectively averaged across two years the wue were ranked as follows rs pm ps ck compared with ck the mean wue with rs ps and pm was significantly p 0 05 increased by 40 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 67 4 32 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 53 6 and 33 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 55 4 respectively there existed extremely positive relations between the tuber yield and mean sws r 0 693 p 0 001 n 24 and wue r 0 894 p 0 001 n 24 during the growing season mulch cultivation practices also significantly influenced wue by changing crop consumption patterns including reducing early evaporation and increasing later transpiration and soil evaporation et is the sum of plant transpiration and soil evaporation and the isotope measurements indicate that the plant transpiration is the largest component of et jasechko et al 2013 li et al 2013 reported that crop water consumption rate at different growth stages could be changed by mulching the soil surface with different materials both plastic film mulch and straw mulch could reduce soil evaporation and the total et which was consistent with results of this study the mulch treatments had different effects on et during the potato growing season in our study table 2 in both dry and normal years mulch treatments greatly reduced the et than ck before the seedling emergence in dry year of 2016 the total et difference between the mulch treatments and ck was not obvious but decreased significantly in the normal year of 2017 which was in accordance with the study of qin et al 2014 this is mainly due to the large and uniform precipitation in 2017 therefore in our study mulch cultivation practices enhanced water use efficiency by 50 1 74 8 and the rs had the highest wue in both years consequently rs provided more available water for potato growth one of the best straw strips mulch cultivation practice in improving wue in semiarid regions li et al 2018b 3 4 crop development and biomass accumulation 3 4 1 final plant height and dry matter the final plant height of mulch treatments were significantly p 0 05 greater than that in the non mulch plots fig 5 among all the treatments the pm treatment produced the greatest final plant height in both years with 44 8 cm in 2016 and 48 2 cm in 2017 respectively interestingly the difference of final plant height between rs and ps treatment was not significant in 2017 but significant in 2016 below ground parts of the dry matter of per plant increased gradually among all the cultivation practices while the dry matter of above ground parts of per plant in pm consistently higher than the in ck however the dry matter of above ground parts of per plant in rs and ps treatments were less than in the ck before tuber bulking stages in 2016 but during the vegetative growth period i e budding to tuber initiation stages in 2017 rs produced the fastest accumulation rate of below ground dry matter as compared to other s in both years fig 6 across years and treatments there existed extremely positive relations between the tuber yield and mean weight of dry matter per plant from the tuber initiation to maturity stages r 0 803 0 974 p 0 001 n 12 and plant height from the budding to maturity stages r 0 844 0 966 p 0 001 n 12 table 3 3 4 2 the dynamics of emergence and the duration of growth stages the growth and developmental progress of potato was earlier with the pm treatment compared with ck while rs and ps treatments delayed it in both years table 4 averaged across years and cultivation practices with pm 75 emergence budding yield formation and whole growth duration were advanced p 0 05 by to 2 7 2 1 2 and 5 8 days respectively compared with ck whereas rs and ps treatments delayed p 0 05 75 emergence budding yield formation and whole growth duration on average by 2 4 3 9 4 8 and 11 1 days respectively compared to ck across years and cultivation practices the tuber yield was more closely related to yield formation duration r 0 980 p 0 001 n 12 than to whole growth duration r 0 954 p 0 001 n 12 but the tuber yields was not related to 75 emergence r 0 145 p 0 652 n 12 and budding duration r 0 287 p 0 325 n 12 3 4 3 tuber grade on 24 august 2016 and 16 august 2017 when plant leaves and stems of all treatments were completely senescent fifteen plants were harvested for tuber grade tuber weights and commodity rate were significantly p 0 05 affected by the mulching treatments table 5 tuber weights was significantly higher p 0 05 in rs and pm than ps which was also significantly higher than in the ck compared to ck the rs ps and pm treatments significantly p 0 05 increased tuber weights by 62 1 36 0 and 66 1 in 2016 and 43 6 35 1 and 44 7 in 2017 respectively in comparison ck treatment had the highest percentage of grade 3 and the lowest grade 1 and grade 2 tubers and the overall lowest weights and commodity rate in both years rs produced the highest grade 1and lowest grade 3 tubers and they had also significant differences with pm there existed extremely positive relations between the tuber yields and the tuber weights r 0 965 p 0 001 n 24 and commodity rate r 0 965 p 0 001 n 24 and the tuber yields was more closely positive correlated with the grade 1 tubers r 0 817 p 0 001 n 24 than grade 2 tubers r 0 623 p 0 001 n 24 but a negative grade 3 tubers r 0 895 p 0 001 n 24 in both of seasons in addition over two years the correlation between grade 1 and 2 tubers and mean soil temperature reached significant level r 0 456 0 418 p 0 05 n 24 the mean sws had very significant positive correlation with the commodity rate r 0 760 p 0 001 n 24 and grade 1 tubers r 0 843 p 0 001 n 24 and negative correlation with grade 3 tubers r 0 722 p 0 001 n 24 and was not related to grade 2 tubers previous studies have shown that both plastic film mulch and straw strips mulch can increase soil water content han et al 2016 fig 3 however plastic film mulch can increase soil temperature and promoting crop growth and development while straw strips mulch decrease soil temperature and delayed crop growth and development similar results with plastic film mulch ridges and straw mulch were reported by hu et al 2014 and li et al 2013 respectively our study also found that pm obviously increased soil temperature and the 75 emergence duration and whole growth duration were up to 2 3 and 5 8 days respectively compared with ck the rs and ps clearly reduced soil temperature and the 75 emergence duration and whole growth duration were delayed by 2 3 and 10 14 days respectively compared with ck also several investigators reported that potato haulm growth is fastest in the air temperature range of 20 25 while the optimal range for tuber initiation and tuber growth is 15 20 and tuber growth tends to stop when temperature higher than 25 krystyna 2015 zhang et al 2010 cool night temperatures are essential for the accumulation of carbohydrates and dry matter in the tubers qin et al 2014 bélanger et al 2000 hiremath et al 2014 in our experiment the soil temperature in plastic film mulch ridges and straw strips mulch was in the range of 23 3 29 1 and 20 5 26 2 respectively during the tuber growth period fig 4 hence straw strips mulch treatments had the faster dry matter accumulation rate during the tuber growth period fig 6 similarly the weights and percentages of grade 1 tubers in straw strips mulch higher than plastic film mulch on ridges and ck the rs had the greatest commodity rate and weights and percentages of grade 1 tubers in both years table 5 3 5 economic benefits under different cultivation patterns mulch cultivation practices had higher economic benefits and output input than ck table 6 rs had the highest economic benefits and output input compared with other treatments in both of years compared with pm eb and output input in rs were 15 9 and 17 7 higher in 2016 and 14 9 and 16 9 higher in 2017 respectively and compared to ck 1 9 times and 61 0 in 2016 and 1 3 times and 44 4 in 2017 respectively in semiarid region of northwest china where are abundant straw resources straw as a kind of low cost and renewable resource and the annual growth rate of 4 1 burned or abandoned more than 50 0 led to serious waste of straw resources and environment pollution bao et al 2014 traditional full straw mulch usually inhibit seedling emergence and reduced crop yields and make tillage difficult hu et al 2016 meanwhile traditional full straw mulch is clear not suitable for mechanized farming to increase labor intensity which is difficult for local smallholder farmer to accept in our study as straw strips mulch application has lower input and labor costs than plastic film mulch smallholder farmer can obtain the highest economic benefits and should be considered as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic film mulch for potato production in semiarid regions 4 conclusion under the conditions of scarce precipitation and heat stress in summer maize straw strips mulch only on furrows was a promising technique for increasing dryland potato yield and wue the maize straw strips mulch only on furrows kept the soil wetter and cooler decreased et during the early growing stage thus delayed plant senescence and ensured longer tuber growth duration the maize straw strips mulch only on furrows meet the low cost high efficient and easy operated standards facing the reality smallholder farmers compared with plastic film mulch moreover with the application of this innovation technology it is inevitable to reduce plastic film application and it is also an environmentally friendly technology also economic profitability is obviously improved through this kind of simple and low cost agricultural system this may be a determination for local smallholder farmers to accept and apply this new technology for straw strips mulch therefore the maize straw strips mulch only on furrows is recommended as an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic film mulch for potato production in semiarid regions acknowledgements we thank editors and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions on the

11293,water use conflicts between agriculture and ecosystem have become a more severe and acute problem in the heihe river basin hrb excessive irrigation water use in the middle oasis of the hrb has caused gradual deterioration of water quality and eco environment both in middle and lower hrb the urgent issue is to make a quantitative analysis and an improvement of irrigation water use in middle oasis in this paper distributed agro hydrological modeling was conducted to access the irrigation water use and potential water saving in the major irrigation system of middle hrb mois using the gis based swap epic model the modeling work was based on the abundant data from field experiments remote sensing surveys and statistics and previous eco hydrological studies the reliability of the distributed simulation was evaluated using the remote sensing data of actual evapotranspiration eta then spatial distribution of irrigation water depth eta deep percolation and crop yield and the related impact factors were systematically analyzed in mois results indicated that only 53 of total applied water was efficiently used through eta whereas deep percolation loss and canal conveyance loss accounted for 22 and 25 of the total applied water respectively the beneficial water use fraction was still low in mois averaging only 0 70 on field scale and 0 52 on district scale water saving analysis predicted that 15 of irrigation amount could be saved efficiently with especial emphasis on the rational water allocation and distribution in addition our results related to agro hydrological processes could provide very valuable information for improving the existing watershed hydrological modeling in the hrb keywords deep percolation evapotranspiration crop yield distributed modeling beneficial water use 1 introduction water scarcity and water use conflicts are extremely serious in many inland river basins with heavily irrigated agriculture and fragile ecosystems ji et al 2006 white et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 efficient use of agricultural water is a priority for local social economic development and ecological security thevs et al 2015 the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china is such a typical region located in the arid northwest china the main river i e heihe river originates in qilian mountain and enters the middle artificial oasis through yingluo gorge and finally discharges into the downstream area of gobi desert after zhengyi gorge fig 1 both the agricultural irrigation in middle oasis and the fragile ecosystems in downstream basin strongly depend on the heihe river water however the irrigation water diversion of the middle oasis accounts for more than 80 of the river runoff at yingluo gorge zhao et al 2010 the river runoff is thus usually inadequate to maintain the health of ecosystems in downstream hrb continuous deterioration of the water and eco environment quality have occurred since 1950s cheng et al 2014 typically due to groundwater level decline natural vegetation degradation soil desertification and terminal lake shrinkage qi and luo 2005 guo et al 2009 cheng et al 2014 since 2002 the ecological water diversion project ewdp has been applied aiming to restore the ecosystems in downstream hrb ma et al 2015 according to the ewdp the river water allocated to middle oasis is to be significantly reduced for increasing runoff discharge the downstream ecosystems are being gradually restored after 12 years of water reallocation cheng et al 2014 meanwhile for adapting the reduction of river water allocation various water saving practices have been implemented in middle oasis yet the total water use is actually not reduced in middle oasis shi et al 2010 due to inappropriate land and water use and management jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 more groundwater is exploited to supplement irrigation this has resulted in a declining trend in groundwater levels wen et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 and the shrinkage of wetland and grassland areas hu et al 2015 in middle oasis therefore how to optimize the water allocation ratio to middle oasis and increase the agricultural water use efficiency becomes the challenge to the hrb cheng et al 2014 comprehensive research concerning hydrology ecology and economy is accordingly conducted for revealing and coordinating the complex relationship of water ecosystem economy in the hrb the ecological and hydrological studies are most extensively conducted in the hrb for the middle oasis where surface water and groundwater interacts frequently the quantitative research on evapotranspiration river runoff and groundwater dynamics are the core topics large improvements have been achieved during the last decade with both the implementation of more observation networks and the adoption of advanced new techniques and innovative models traditional hydrological or hydrogeological models e g modflow feflow and swat and some integrated surface water groundwater models e g gsflow are both applied for simulating and analyzing surface runoff soil water balance and groundwater dynamics hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 tian et al 2015 li et al 2017 zang et al 2012 on the other hand the systematic experiments and data production at different scales are carried out for better understanding the eco hydrological processes and improving the modeling accuracy li et al 2013a these studies include 1 various remote sensing techniques are applied for detecting the ground geographic features e g land use crop pattern leaf area index etc zhong et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 chen et al 2015 fan et al 2015 2 evapotranspiration data and products in different scales are obtained with eddy covariance large aperture scintillometer and satellite image liu et al 2011 hu and jia 2015 xiong et al 2015 lian and huang 2015 3 isotope tracing is used to quantify the sources and composition of river runoff zhang et al 2009 4 sampling analysis related to soils plants and waters are widely carried out as well overall the integrated eco hydrological studies related to the interaction of water soil vegetation and atmosphere have become a hot spot at present li et al 2013b yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 ma et al 2015 however with further research it is increasingly recognized that the agricultural water use in middle oasis is still not well understood although it is so significant for water cycle and water management both in middle oasis and the hrb some previous research referring to agricultural water issues su et al 2007 jiang et al 2015 2016 ge et al 2013 is mostly implemented on a farmland or a local regional scale while rarely on an oasis scale this may be primarily due to the difficulties in availability of large datasets for considering the spatial variance of soil irrigation crop pattern etc also the previous hydrological modeling generally adopts a simplified manner to conceptualize the irrigation effects in middle oasis e g tian et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 zang et al 2012 however massive important spatial distributed data and observed data of middle hrb have become available due to the supports of above mentioned extensive research in recent years this makes it practicable to simulate the complicated agro hydrological processes on an oasis scale in addition the efficiency analysis related to multiple scales and users is the prerequisite to realize reasonable water use van halsema and vincent 2012 nair et al 2013 for irrigation systems it is commonly applied to each irrigation sub system of storage conveyance off and on farm distribution and on farm application bos and nugteren 1990 different terms have been proposed and used since 1950s such as the classical irrigation efficiency ie israelson 1950 three efficiency terms i e conveyance efficiency distribution efficiency and field application efficiency formulated by the icid ilri bos and nugteren 1990 and some adapted ie e g effective irrigation efficiency and irrigation sagacity keller and keller 1995 solomon and burt 1999 moreover the improvement of local efficiencies generally cannot represent a reduction of water losses and an increase of efficiency within a larger system or in river basins since the waste or non consumed water could be reused somewhere molden et al 2007 van halsema and vincent 2012 recently some irrigation scientists point out that the term efficiency often leads to misconceptions and misuse owing to its various and confused definitions perry 2007 jensen 2007 pereira et al 2012 hence the present trend is to apply some new indicators that use a ratio or fraction to replace the traditional efficiency terminology which make definitions more directly refer to different water use component e g consumptive and non consumptive use beneficial and non beneficial use foster and perry 2010 pereira et al 2012 an expected advantage of these indicators is that irrigation managers and farmers could understand them better than efficiency terms therefore the purpose of this study was to conduct a distributed agro hydrological modeling and to assess the irrigation water use and water saving for the major irrigation systems in the middle oasis abbreviated as mois of the heihe river basin the gis based swap epic model was adopted for the distributed modeling of agro hydrological processes remote sensing evapotranspiration et data was used to evaluate the reasonability of simulation then spatial variations of water balance components and crop yields were systematically analyzed and irrigation water use was further investigated using three evaluation indicators finally a water saving analysis was conducted through scenario simulation related to the improvement of irrigation water allocation and field water application results of this paper would provide a comprehensive and accurate understanding of agro hydrological processes in middle oasis and valuable information to existing watershed hydrological modeling water saving analysis aims to give potential supports for improving the irrigation water allocation and management in the hrb and the analogous inland river basins in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mois 38 5 39 8 n and 98 9 100 8 e is located between the qilian mountain in the south and the longshou heli mountains in the north where a river valley fine soil plain is formed fig 1 it consists of irrigation systems in three counties of ganzhou linze and gaotai that are respectively located in the upper middle and lower stream of mois its irrigated area covers about 66 of total irrigated areas in the middle oasis agricultural irrigation in mois consumes more than 80 of upstream runoff of the heihe river that enters the middle oasis and contributes approximately 90 of agricultural production value of the hrb excessive river water diversion into mois is the main reason for the water conflicts and ecological degradation in the hrb the farmlands in mois occupy 27 of the total area mainly distributed along the main stream of heihe river fig 1 the edge of mois is a large area of wasteland and gobi desert accounting for 53 of the total area some woodlands grasslands and wetlands are scatteredly distributed the mois has a temperate continental arid climate the average annual precipitation is only 133 mm with over 60 occurring during june to september 1994 2013 the average fao reference evapotranspiration eto reaches to 1130 mm a 1 and is much larger than precipitation fig 2 the minimum and maximum monthly temperature averages at 10 and 22 in january and july respectively there are about 150 170 frost free days per year the growing season is generally from march to september the agriculture is fully dependent on irrigation due to the arid climate the altitude of mois varies from 2200 m in upper southeast to 1290 m in lower northwest fig 1 silt loam and loam is widely distributed in cultivated farmlands coarse textured soils are also typical in northeast area of downstream mois fig 3 a groundwater depth is very deep 30 200 m in upper southwest parts of piedmont alluvial fan plain and become shallow in lower fine soil plain area the groundwater plays a critical role in maintaining natural vegetation growth especially in the downstream mois since 1990s due to expanded farmlands and increasing groundwater exploitation groundwater levels show a noticeable decreasing trend with range of 4 9 to 11 5 m decline during the last 30 years mi et al 2016 in recent years groundwater depths often range from not less than 3 m to over 30 m in irrigated areas the mois consists of 24 irrigation districts with thousands of canals and over 6000 pumping wells for irrigation fig 3b a large part of canals are lined and the hydraulic construction is re updated after 2002 especially in upstream mois however the canal regulation and operation management are still at a low level in many districts as reported by some studies jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 the main crop is corn with two varieties i e grain corn for seed production and forage corn for forage production accounting for 65 of the total irrigated area grain corn is more widely planted due to its higher profits the remaining irrigated areas include other croplands planted with wheat barley cotton cabbage tomato and pepper and some scattered grasslands and woodlands fig 3c flood basin irrigation is the common method there are usually 3 4 irrigation events during crop season and a winter irrigation event during november for maintaining soil moisture in the next spring 2 2 model description regional irrigation water use was related to both field water application and canal water conveyance of these agro hydrological processes in fields were the more complicated and critical part the gis based swap epic model was adopted to simulate the field hydrological processes in a distributed manner meanwhile the calculation for water conveyance of canal systems was focused on its loss terms using coefficient methods swap epic was a one dimensional 1 d physical based agro hydrological model that could simulate soil water flow solute and heat transport as well as crop growth on a field scale and daily time step it was proposed by xu et al 2013 through coupling the swap soil water atmosphere plant model kroes and van dam 2003 and the epic crop growth module williams et al 1989 the soil water flow was described based on the 1 d richards equation for vertical flow soil hydraulic properties were described using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 functions the solute transport and heat transfer were described with the form of convection dispersion equation and the conduction equation respectively the finite difference solution scheme was applied for both solving the partial differential equations of soil water flow solute transport and heat conductance the modules of soil water flow and crop growth were adopted for the current study a brief description is provided in this paper while more detailed theory can be found in kroes and van dam 2003 and xu et al 2013 the top boundary condition can be determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation and precipitation fluxes potential evapotranspiration etp estimated by the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 using daily meteorological data radiation wind speed vapor pressure and temperature was partitioned into potential soil evaporation and potential crop transpiration based upon the leaf area index xu et al 2013 actual evaporation and transpiration rates were respectively obtained as a function of the available soil water in the surface soil and the root zone crop growth and yield were calculated using the modified epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 this module described the crop growth based on accumulated temperature it can simulate the leaf area development light interception and the conversion of intercepted light into biomass and yield together with effects of temperature water and salt stress the gis based swap epic was developed through a close coupling of swap epic and arcinfo gis using vba programs in gis environment by jiang et al 2015 thus the swap epic was extended to be used in a distributed manner for regional modeling the distributed modeling was conducted by identifying a heterogeneous area as an assemblage of individual simulation units with homogenous soil water plant weather representation independent runs of swap epic model can simulate soil water balance and crop growth and yield in each simulated unit the detailed description about gis based swap epic model was given by jiang et al 2015 for canal water loss estimation the canal water conveyance loss cl and canal seepage cs were two important terms for efficiency evaluation the cl was estimated by multiplying the water supply with the term 1 e where e is the canal conveyance ratio i e the canal outflow to inflow ratio the e values were available through the canal flow measurements reported in the annual reports of irrigation water management of zhangye city annual report iwmzc for river water conveyance the ratio e ranged at 0 55 0 76 in different irrigation districts involving the conveyance processes from the highest to lowest levels of canals when including the groundwater conveyance the canal loss ratio 1 e was reduced to 0 15 0 43 the canal seepage cs was the main part of cl and difficult to be determined in this study it was estimated as 60 80 of cl referring to previous relevant research e g yao et al 2012 kinzli et al 2010 xu et al 2010 2 3 data processing spatial aggregation and distributed model setup the distributed modeling of agro hydrological processes in mois was based on the aggregation of homogenous simulation units with respect to soil and hydrological properties the homogenous simulation units would be obtained by overlaying thematic map of relevant spatial variables i e weather soil crop and irrigation in arcinfo gis groundwater depth varied in the range of over 3 m to even 200 m in mois and thus was not considered in the spatial aggregation process hence spatial information of weather soil crop irrigation was collected and aggregated for model setup in 2011 and 2012 the modeling domain was farmlands while did not cover the other land use types fig 1 the datasets and their processing are described in detail below soil the spatial distribution of soil was based on the map of soil textural classes usda texture classification in 0 30 cm depth with 1 km resolution lu et al 2011 on this map six soil types were identified while three types i e silt loam loam and sandy loam were the majors fig 3a based on this soil map a soil survey was carried out at 148 soil sample points for obtaining the physical properties particle size percentages and bulk density these points were evenly distributed in a 5 km distance in farmlands fig 3a with soil depth of 80 120 cm in the simulations a soil profile with 200 cm depth was specified and was further divided as 4 horizons 0 40 cm 40 80 cm 80 120 cm and 120 200 cm the physical properties for each horizon were derived at 90 m resolution through the interpolation of 148 points the soil hydraulic parameters were derived from the mean soil physical properties using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 each soil domain was further discretized into 150 compartments with 1 cm thickness for 0 100 cm depth and 2 cm thickness for the 100 200 cm depth weather daily weather data of precipitation temperature sunshine hours relative humidity and wind speed was collected at three meteorological stations named zhangye linze and gaotai fig 1 the three stations could respectively represent the weather conditions of upper middle and lower parts of mois then three weather zones were defined using the thiessen polygon method applied at these three stations fig 4 crop a land cover use map 2012 in 30 m spatial resolution was used which was produced using the time series hj 1 ccd data of chinese environmental satellite zhong et al 2014 it had the basic category of land use type and relatively detailed crop patterns in farmlands fig 3c furthermore on the basis of our field surveys the corn was distinguished as grain corn and forage corn and the cash crops were classified into tomato cabbage pepper and cotton through selecting a major species as a representative crop in each irrigation district land use map was resampled from 30 m to 90 m resolution for avoiding a high level disorderly distribution of crops in spatial aggregation thus five land use types and eight crop species were determined figs 3c and 4 the crop calendar for the same crop varied slightly from village to village and thus the uniform sowing date was applied for a crop in the simulation table 1 the parameters for major crops i e field corn grain corn spring wheat and cabbage were referred to the values that calibrated by jiang et al 2015 while those for cotton tomato and pepper were determined based on other field experimental studies and default values in epic model williams et al 2006 liu et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 irrigation according to the differences of river water diversion the irrigation districts were classified into four categories 1 those controlled by the east primary canal z1 z3 and z4 or by the west primary canal z2 z6 l1 and g6 2 three ones diverting surface water from liyuan river that was a large tributary of the heihe river ly6 ly7 and ly8 3 four ones near mountains diverting surface water from other small tributaries out from the mountains n1 n2 n3 and n4 4 other ones along the riverbank in the mid and down stream of mois directly diverting river water from the heihe river through their main canals fig 3b irrigation water amount and ratio of surface water to groundwater were both various in and among different irrigation districts due to the different water diversion conditions and crop patterns hence an irrigation district was further divided into at least two or three canal command areas i e irrigation zones based on the control area of sub main canals totally 64 irrigation zones were built in this study fig 4 water supply data for canals was available from the heihe plan science data center hpsdc the groundwater pumping amount for each irrigation district was available from annual report iwmzc the mean field irrigation depth was estimated by equaling to the net irrigation amount divided by its actual irrigated area in each time it was applied to each irrigation zone without distinguishing crops in an irrigation event for simplification irrigation scheduling was supposed to be same for a crop and was determined in accordance with the growth stages and local irrigation calendar the winter irrigation was generally started in early november the detailed irrigation information is listed in table 1 finally based on spatial aggregation of above soil weather crop irrigation zones the modeling domain i e farmland areas of mois was divided into 519 individual simulation units with approximately homogenous agro hydrological environment in each unit fig 4 in each unit the top boundary condition can be determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation and precipitation fluxes the free drainage boundary was defined as bottom boundary condition as the groundwater table was relatively deep initial soil water content was defined according to the soil sampling in april and the simulation units without measured values would refer to its nearby unit distributed simulation of swap epic model was then conducted in mois for obtaining spatial distribution of irrigation water balance components and crop yields during 2011 and 2012 the simulation period was from march 20th to november 30th covering the whole crop growing season and winter irrigation period 2 4 modeling evaluation model calibration was often not easy for such regional ago hydrological modeling due to the deficit of enough observed data in fields yet the actual evapotranspiration eta closely related to all of soil moisture conditions crop growth and yields was relatively readily available on a regional scale due to widely application of remote sense thus eta was often used for performing the model reliability in many regional modeling studies ines and honda 2005 singh et al 2006 sun and ren 2013 in this study two kinds of remote sensing eta data were available on oasis scale during the simulation period and thus were both used to evaluate the reasonability of distributed modeling the eta data were as follows 1 the one et rsj was 8 days et data for the crop growth period of 2012 with 250 m resolution produced by jia et al 2014 and hu and jia 2015 2 the other one et rsw was monthly et data during 2011 2012 with 30 m resolution produced by wu et al 2012 2013 for a feasible comparison the model simulated and remote sensing eta was assembled into the monthly accumulative eta data in each irrigation district the fitness indicators used to evaluate the model performance included mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse determine coefficient r2 and regression coefficient b 2 5 irrigation water use analysis and water saving scenarios after evaluating the reliability the distributed results would be applied to quantitatively understanding the spatial characteristics of different water balance components eta deep percolation and canal water conveyance loss c l and crop yields in mois three kinds of indicators listed in table 2 were mainly adopted for assisting the evaluations on irrigation water use efficiency and water saving i e beneficial water use fraction bwuf non consumptive water fraction ncf and dp ratio bwuf was a measure of irrigation effectiveness and was here defined on field and district scales referred as bwuffield and bwufregion respectively table 2 in the calculations the et a during crop season et a cs was considered as the beneficial water use in addition it was necessary to consider salt leaching fraction at least 10 and inevitable percolation loss of irrigation water thus the appropriate bwuffield should be in a range of 0 8 0 9 for border or basin irrigation as referred to fao 61 paper tanji and kielen 2002 ncf was an indicator to quantify the water losses in an irrigation system or sub system in this study the cl and field deep percolation dp was considered as non consumptive water and the ncf represented the non consumptive fraction of the total water use in irrigation system table 2 the dp ratio was defined as ratio of dp to total field water input the sum of irrigation and rainfall expressing the water losses fraction of water applied in fields in general dp were inevitable for traditional surface irrigation when considering irrigation non uniformity and necessary requirement for salt leaching a reasonable dp ratio was thus suggested in the range of 10 20 for basin or border irrigation by the fao 61 paper tanji and kielen 2002 water saving scenarios were defined with considering the improvement of irrigation water allocation based on differences of crop soil and climatic conditions this would contribute to uniform and reasonable irrigation water distribution and appropriate field irrigation amount in scenario setting six major crops table 1 and three main soil types silt loam loam and sandy loam were combined as 18 crop soil combination units in mois ten levels of irrigation depth were defined and applied to the simulations in each crop soil unit for three climate zones simulated results were evaluated using two constraints 1 the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration ta tp were not lower than 0 9 for maintaining yields sarwar and bastiaanssen 2001 2 bwuffield were not lower than 0 8 in silt loam and loam and not lower than 0 75 in sandy loam tanji and kielen 2002 for ensuring efficiency thus an appropriate range of irrigation depths could be obtained for each crop soil unit when satisfying both of the two referred constraints and then the minimum satisfactory irrigation depth were employed for distributed simulation in entire mois in scenarios the irrigation method was mainly related to the improved or modernized basin irrigation with considering the limitations of local economic conditions over the next many years the advanced water saving irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation required higher investment costs and high quality management and were also not suitable for the local smallholder farmlands thus they were not involved in the scenario analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons of et between distributed modeling and remote sensing results showed that the simulated eta was in a good agreement with the two kinds of remote sensing eta over the whole mois fig 5 mre was lower than 4 0 and rmse was less than 44 mm in both of 2011 and 2012 as compared to et rsw fig 5a and b with regard to et rsj mre and rmse were about 10 and 60 mm respectively fig 5c the nse were both larger than 0 8 and the r2 were over 0 85 the average simulated eta during may to september was respectively 533 mm and 556 mm in 2011 and 2012 for the whole mois it was only 1 and 4 higher than et rsw in 2011 and 2012 respectively and 7 higher than et rsj in 2012 meanwhile the spatial differences of eta among different districts were effectively described for each month fig 5 analyses indicated that the deviations of et were relatively small in most plain areas while there were also some noticeable deviations in some irrigation districts e g the irrigation districts of g5 and n1 n4 this was mainly resulted from the simplifications in model conceptualization besides the systematic uncertainty e g the resample of crop distribution map and the compromise in discretization of meteorological zones and irrigation zones the main deviations of et were occurred in the near mountain regions n1 n4 where the weather data of zhangye or gaotai meteorological station was used as substitute due to data deficit these simplifications and discrepancy might affect the accuracy of simulated results in the whole area overall results indicated that the simulated results of distributed agro hydrological modeling for mois were acceptable and could be used for analyzing regional irrigation water balance and water use performance 3 2 agro hydrological processes and irrigation performance 3 2 1 spatial distribution of eta and crop yield the spatial distribution of simulated eta and relative crop yield rcy for the simulation period is presented in fig 6 the rcy for each crop was defined as the ratio of actual crop yield to the acceptable yield the average value across the whole region for each crop surveyed from local farmers results showed that eta varied from 300 mm to around 700 mm with an average of about 580 mm in 2011 and 2012 eta and rcy showed obviously spatial differences in and among different irrigation districts due to the combined effects of various factors regional distribution of eta was affected mainly by crop pattern and irrigation and partly by climatic conditions and soil properties meanwhile the regional rcy was more influenced by irrigation and climatic conditions crop pattern partly affected by the river water diversion conditions was the major factor determining the spatial variance of eta results showed that eta was mostly above 550 mm for corn while less than 520 mm for wheat and most cash crops except cotton in entire mois specifically the larger eta 600 mm was widely distributed in upstream areas where the river water supply was more convenient for irrigation fig 6 this was because the grain corn that had higher economic benefit but large water demand was extensively planted in upstream areas particularly in areas close to water intake of main canals e g in z1 z2 and z3 its planted area occupied about 75 of the total planted area in upstream irrigation districts z1 z6 fig 3c in the midstream mois eta was generally less than 500 mm due to the larger proportion of wheat with less water demand e g in l4 and l2 figs 3c and 6 this was similar for the irrigation districts near the mountains n1 n4 with large planted area of wheat the downstream regions i e g1 g6 had a larger planting proportion of cash crops fig 3c in order to adapt to the less available river water resources hence lower eta 520 mm was widely distributed in downstream irrigation districts fig 6 in addition the areas around the urban districts also had relatively lower eta 520 mm e g in z3 and ly7 due to their larger planting proportion of vegetables with the convenient transportation and higher profits for the same crop the eta and rcy was influenced by irrigation amount during crop season i g cs to a certain degree under the same climatic conditions taking upstream region i e z1 z6 as an example the eta was larger than 650 mm and the rcy was 1 07 1 10 for grain corn when i g cs was above 650 mm e g in z1 z2 and z5 while in other areas where the i g cs ranged at 540 560 mm the eta was a little lower 610 625 mm and the rcy was just around 1 0 for grain corn e g in z3 z4 and z6 figs 6 and 7 for wheat and the same cash crop the differences in eta were much smaller 30 mm because of their relatively small water requirement fig 7 but for forage corn the differences in eta 570 670 mm and rcy 0 8 1 07 were both larger than those for grain corn this was mainly caused by their scattered distribution and quite different irrigation amount due to their lower economic profits and extensive management the eta and rcy also showed a similar relationship with i g cs in the midstream and downstream regions figs 6 and 7 results also showed that the overall variation of eta and rcy was just slightly influenced by changes of climatic conditions the climatic variations resulted in relatively low potential et and high crop yields in downstream areas such as in 2012 the eta of grain corn was more than 650 mm with rcy of about 1 06 in ganzhou i e z1 z6 under relatively sufficient irrigation i g cs 650 mm while the maximum eta was reduced to 620 mm but with rcy of 1 09 in gaotai i e g1 g6 for spring wheat and cash crops the eta and rcy showed similar differences within three weather zones particularly for the rcy fig 7b in addition the lower eta and rcy was also observed in some irrigation districts where coarse textured soils were extensively distributed especially in the mid and down stream mois for example in 2012 the eta and rcy were both small for corn in l4 593 mm and 0 96 fig 7b even with large i g cs of 655 mm because more than half of irrigated area was distributed with sandy loam soils in l4 fig 3a similar results were also reported by li and shao 2014 3 2 2 deep percolation and beneficial water use fraction simulated results indicated that dp had a very strong spatial variation in mois ranging from 30 mm to about 450 mm during 2011 and 2012 fig 6 in 2012 the mean dp in each irrigation district ranged from 70 mm to 400 mm and the range of dp ratio was 14 40 which was similar in 2011 fig 8 the dp reached to 240 mm averaged in mois while the dp ratio approached to 29 the bwuffield just ranged from 0 57 to 0 84 among different irrigation districts and the average value was 0 70 in both two years fig 9 overall the dp ratio was obviously higher than 20 in many irrigation districts of mois while the corresponding bwuffield was noticeably higher than its appropriate range i e 0 8 0 9 the relatively high dp may result in significant irrigation water waste and fertilizer leaching the spatial distribution of dp and bwuffield was closely related to the ig which was mainly influenced by water diversion conditions production benefit canal and field water management as well as farmers water use habits specifically dp was usually larger than 250 mm in irrigation districts where ig was over 800 mm these irrigation districts were generally along the river e g z5 and l2 l5 or close to water intakes of main canals e g z1 nd z2 fig 6 due to their favorable water diversion conditions meanwhile the bwuffield was only 0 57 0 68 in these above irrigation districts due to the larger dp fig 9 whereas the dp of less than 200 mm often took place in areas far away from rivers or water intakes of main canals e g z3 z4 z6 l1 and ly8 where ig was less than 650 mm fig 6 this also led to higher bwuffield 0 75 in these areas and the average bwuffield reached up to 0 75 0 84 in these edge or downstream irrigation districts fig 9 however in downstream districts of g1 and g6 with limited river water supply the dp ratio was still larger than 30 and bwuffield was even lower than 0 68 due to the excessive groundwater exploitation fig 8 in addition it should be also noted that due to the larger percentage of coarse textured soils in districts of northeastern mois e g l2 l4 and g1 g5 dp was relatively larger and bwuffield was relatively lower as compared to other districts figs 6 and 8 overall the extensive distribution of excessive dp and lower bwuffield was caused by non uniform and unreasonable irrigation water distribution which would be closely related to the canal system operation and water fee system firstly farmers were used to applying excessive irrigation to guarantee yields if water was sufficiently available because water price was very low and water charges were generally collected based on the registered irrigated area but not actual water use amount secondly the poor management and regulation of water conveyance and distribution further led to both excessive and insufficient water diversion around mois even in some downstream and edge districts with limited river water diversion the absence of supervision of groundwater pumping also led to large exploitation and excessive irrigation consequently about 70 of irrigated areas had bwuffield lower than the appropriate value 0 8 suggested by fao 61 fig 9 whereas the higher bwuffield was mainly caused by the insufficient irrigation corresponding to the districts with lower rcy 3 2 3 regional irrigation water use with considering water conveyance losses canal water conveyance loss cl from canal intakes to farmlands further reduced the bwuf by 13 40 on irrigation district scale i e bwufregion as compared with bwuffield fig 9 due to the different canal conveyance ratio e in each irrigation district for example the bwufregion averaged 0 50 0 59 in upstream irrigation districts of z1 z4 with less 21 reduction than bwuffield fig 9 whereas the bwufregion only averaged 0 40 0 53 in many downstream districts of linze and gaotai e g l2 l4 and g3 g5 approaching 29 40 lower than bwuffield because of lower e 0 67 overall the mean bwufregion was 0 52 in entire mois during 2011 and 2012 nearly 50 of irrigation districts had bwufregion values lower than the national average value of 0 5 and far lower than that of 0 7 0 8 in developed countries du et al 2015 thus more attention should be paid to improving the management of field irrigation and canal system operation the non consumptive water fraction ncf was 0 32 0 58 with an average of 0 47 in 2011 and 2012 on the irrigation district scale fig 9 it indicated that about 32 58 of the regional total water use was not consumed while lost through canal seepage and deep percolation from a perspective of watershed hydrological cycle this non consumptive water was not wasted because it would enter into groundwater as return flow and could be reused somewhere else however for irrigation engineering this fraction of water was unnecessary expense and an extra burden for irrigation system in addition the return flow may not timely recharge groundwater for reuse especially with deep groundwater depth the efficacy of water reuse also required a detailed water budget accounting that was difficult to be implemented at least the continuous groundwater level decline in low stream mois indicated that the non consumptive water in upstream areas did not supplement the groundwater timely in our view decreasing the ncf through improving the uniformity and timeliness of irrigation water allocation should be very helpful to reduce the groundwater exploitation and thus to recover the ecosystem regional irrigation water budget indicated that the total irrigation water use i e the sum of river water diversion and groundwater pumping tiwu was about 18 108 m3 in mois during 2011 and 2012 table 3 the value has changed slightly as compared with that in the last ten years as reported by shi et al 2011 whereas the groundwater use reached up to 4 0 108 m3 in 2011 and 2012 which was almost two times as much as that in 2000 table 3 more groundwater was exploited to supplement irrigation due to the cut of river water diversion since ewdp implementation during simulation period of 2011 and 2012 eta averaged 10 2 108 m3 and the cl and dp was estimated at 4 8 108 m3 and 4 0 108 m3 respectively table 3 the results indicated that only 53 of tiwu including rainfall trwi was consumed through crop evapotranspiration while the cl and dp accounted for 25 and 22 of trwi respectively table 3 the canal seepage cs was assumed to be 60 80 of cl and thus ranged from 3 0 108 to 4 0 108 m3 table 3 the sum of cs and dp was considered as potential recharge to groundwater in irrigation systems gwrnpot and was estimated at about 6 9 8 3 108 m3 in average of 2011 and 2012 meanwhile the net potential groundwater recharge gwrnpot denoted as gwrpot minus groundwater pumping for supplementing irrigation was calculated as shown in fig 10 a gwrnpot varied strongly among different irrigation districts and showed positive value in most districts but note that gwrnpot was negative or even far less than zero in some irrigation districts located in edge or downstream oasis e g z4 and g6 fig 10a due to less river water and resulting large groundwater exploitation negative gwrnpot became the primary reason to the groundwater level declines in addition many previous studies of hydrological modeling often empirically or simply estimated the actual groundwater recharge from irrigation water denoted as the part of infiltrated irrigation water that has actually entered into groundwater gwract their estimated values varied from 63 mm 1 55 108 m3 to 780 mm 18 1 108 m3 in mois showing large differences wen et al 2007 hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 tian et al 2015 the differences of modeling domain model conceptualization and simulation periods may cause differences of gwract in above previous literature by contrast our paper gave an estimation of gwrpot with about 230 mm 4 0 108 m3 from field irrigation and 165 234 mm 2 9 4 2 108 m3 from canal seepage table 3 the estimated gwrpot from field irrigation i e dp should probably be more reasonable with much less uncertainties due to precise description of agro hydrological processes in this study also the spatial variation of gwrpot was better presented with well consideration of the spatial variance of irrigation soil and crop water consumption this would provide very useful references or information in irrigated areas for improving the previous large scale hydrological modeling 3 3 water saving analysis above analyses indicated that the inappropriate and extensive management of irrigation water allocation and distribution from districts to fields was the major reason for large dp and lower bwuf the inefficient use of irrigation water usually led to intensified competition and over groundwater exploitation in the peak period of crop water demand this may further result in crop yields losses and income reduction as well as groundwater level declines therefore there was huge scope and necessity to improve irrigation water use performance and to save water through searching for appropriate field water application and well coordination of canal conveyance and field water demand the water saving analysis was carried out in mois based on the defined scenario with satisfactory minimum irrigation depth in section 2 5 on the basis of the normal hydrological year 2012 water budget of water saving scenario was compared with that of present situation as shown in fig 10b in the scenario the tiwu in mois was 14 7 108 m3 decreased by 15 as compared to the present of 2012 total eta was almost not changed with only 1 reduction this implied that there was almost no negative impact on crop water consumption when reducing irrigation water through improving water allocation and distribution given present conditions of planted area crop pattern and crop varieties while the dp was decreased from 4 0 108 m3 to 2 5 108 m3 with a significant reduction of 37 fig 10b scenario results showed that bwuffield could be increased to above 0 8 for most irrigation districts and also greater than 0 75 in those irrigation districts with widespread coarse textured soils e g l2 and l4 the mean bwuffield for entire mois could increase from 0 7 to 0 8 in water saving scenario meanwhile the crop yields in scenario y s were almost not reduced as compared to present crop yields y a the relative values y s y a were around 1 0 in most areas and crop yields for some districts were even increased by 10 20 due to the increase of irrigation water allocation in addition although the improvement of canal conveyance was not considered in the scenario it should be noted that about 10 more irrigation water could be further saved if the low canal conveyance ratio in some irrigation districts could be increased to 0 7 moreover if maintaining the present mean ratio of groundwater use i e 20 the groundwater exploitation could be reduced by 19 as compared to the present it will be of benefit to the recovery of local groundwater levels especially for the downstream and edge areas in mois in summary our analysis implied that the relevant water saving measures for the middle hrb should more focus on two aspects 1 the improvement of management in the process of water conveyance and allocation 2 the increase of efficiency in the process of field water application the specific advice and measures emphatically include 1 improving canal water operation for accurate and timely water allocation e g equipping advanced water measuring devices prompting the reform of canal management agency 2 improving traditional irrigation methods and concepts of field water use e g using the modernized basin or furrow irrigation adopting precise land leveling and prompting the water saving education for farmers 3 implementing water saving irrigation technologies and equipment e g drip irrigation with mulch in some areas with higher income or powerful financial support in addition proper planted area reduction or crop pattern adjustment that were not considered in this study could also further promote the water saving therefore more detailed water saving scenarios were deserved to be conducted in follow up investigation from an ecological perspective the water saving may largely reduce the groundwater recharge from the field deep percolation and canal seepage but this mainly corresponded to the irrigated areas with excessive river water allocation and without the declined trend of groundwater levels whereas this reduced water could be distributed to the other areas with excessive groundwater pumping which could also prompt the recovery of eco environment in those areas overall the strategies of water saving and their effects on eco environments in mois should further be associated with the groundwater studies in future 4 conclusions the performance of irrigation water use for the major irrigation systems of the middle oasis mois of the heihe river basin was systematically evaluated by using the distributed swap epic model modeling considered the detailed spatial information of soil crop irrigation and weather condition the reasonability of simulations was verified by the good agreement between simulated actual evapotranspiration eta and remote sensing eta the eta was in a range of 300 700 mm with an average of 580 mm in mois spatial variation was primarily related to the crop pattern that was partly affected by water diversion conditions and secondary to irrigation amount ig and then slightly to climate and soil conditions the regional relative crop yield rcy was more affected by irrigation and climate conditions with relatively higher values 1 05 in areas with more sufficient ig the deep percolation dp accounted to 14 40 of total field water input and the beneficial water use fraction bwuf was respectively 0 57 0 84 on field scale and 0 40 0 67 on irrigation district scale their distribution was mainly influenced by water diversion conditions canal and field water management and farmer s water use habits large dp ratio and lower bwuf was often distributed in areas close to the river or water intakes of main canals with excessive ig about 70 of irrigated areas had dp ratio greater than 20 and bwuf smaller than the appropriate value 0 8 on field scale while half of irrigation districts had bwuf lower than the national average value 0 5 and far lower than 0 7 0 8 in developed countries in the whole mois only 53 of total irrigation water including rainfall was used for eta while about 22 and 25 was lost through the deep percolation and canal conveyance losses respectively the existing large water losses indicated that there was still large space and necessity to improve the present situation of irrigation water use in mois meanwhile the potential groundwater recharge from irrigation water was estimated at about 37 43 of irrigation water its detailed regional distribution implied a strong variation of potential groundwater recharge in irrigated areas this could provide useful information for overcoming the subjectivity and uncertainties in estimation of groundwater recharge in existing hydrological modeling furthermore water saving analysis indicated that about 15 of irrigation water could be saved if adopting improved strategies of irrigation water allocation and distribution relevant water saving measures were suggested in detail being focused on the improvement of management in the process of water conveyance and allocation and the increase of efficiency in the process of field water application further studies should involve more detailed water saving analysis with considering the crop pattern adjustment and the application of advanced irrigation technologies groundwater studies should be also integrated in the follow up research for more comprehensive analysis of agricultural water saving and corresponding

11293,water use conflicts between agriculture and ecosystem have become a more severe and acute problem in the heihe river basin hrb excessive irrigation water use in the middle oasis of the hrb has caused gradual deterioration of water quality and eco environment both in middle and lower hrb the urgent issue is to make a quantitative analysis and an improvement of irrigation water use in middle oasis in this paper distributed agro hydrological modeling was conducted to access the irrigation water use and potential water saving in the major irrigation system of middle hrb mois using the gis based swap epic model the modeling work was based on the abundant data from field experiments remote sensing surveys and statistics and previous eco hydrological studies the reliability of the distributed simulation was evaluated using the remote sensing data of actual evapotranspiration eta then spatial distribution of irrigation water depth eta deep percolation and crop yield and the related impact factors were systematically analyzed in mois results indicated that only 53 of total applied water was efficiently used through eta whereas deep percolation loss and canal conveyance loss accounted for 22 and 25 of the total applied water respectively the beneficial water use fraction was still low in mois averaging only 0 70 on field scale and 0 52 on district scale water saving analysis predicted that 15 of irrigation amount could be saved efficiently with especial emphasis on the rational water allocation and distribution in addition our results related to agro hydrological processes could provide very valuable information for improving the existing watershed hydrological modeling in the hrb keywords deep percolation evapotranspiration crop yield distributed modeling beneficial water use 1 introduction water scarcity and water use conflicts are extremely serious in many inland river basins with heavily irrigated agriculture and fragile ecosystems ji et al 2006 white et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 efficient use of agricultural water is a priority for local social economic development and ecological security thevs et al 2015 the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china is such a typical region located in the arid northwest china the main river i e heihe river originates in qilian mountain and enters the middle artificial oasis through yingluo gorge and finally discharges into the downstream area of gobi desert after zhengyi gorge fig 1 both the agricultural irrigation in middle oasis and the fragile ecosystems in downstream basin strongly depend on the heihe river water however the irrigation water diversion of the middle oasis accounts for more than 80 of the river runoff at yingluo gorge zhao et al 2010 the river runoff is thus usually inadequate to maintain the health of ecosystems in downstream hrb continuous deterioration of the water and eco environment quality have occurred since 1950s cheng et al 2014 typically due to groundwater level decline natural vegetation degradation soil desertification and terminal lake shrinkage qi and luo 2005 guo et al 2009 cheng et al 2014 since 2002 the ecological water diversion project ewdp has been applied aiming to restore the ecosystems in downstream hrb ma et al 2015 according to the ewdp the river water allocated to middle oasis is to be significantly reduced for increasing runoff discharge the downstream ecosystems are being gradually restored after 12 years of water reallocation cheng et al 2014 meanwhile for adapting the reduction of river water allocation various water saving practices have been implemented in middle oasis yet the total water use is actually not reduced in middle oasis shi et al 2010 due to inappropriate land and water use and management jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 more groundwater is exploited to supplement irrigation this has resulted in a declining trend in groundwater levels wen et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 and the shrinkage of wetland and grassland areas hu et al 2015 in middle oasis therefore how to optimize the water allocation ratio to middle oasis and increase the agricultural water use efficiency becomes the challenge to the hrb cheng et al 2014 comprehensive research concerning hydrology ecology and economy is accordingly conducted for revealing and coordinating the complex relationship of water ecosystem economy in the hrb the ecological and hydrological studies are most extensively conducted in the hrb for the middle oasis where surface water and groundwater interacts frequently the quantitative research on evapotranspiration river runoff and groundwater dynamics are the core topics large improvements have been achieved during the last decade with both the implementation of more observation networks and the adoption of advanced new techniques and innovative models traditional hydrological or hydrogeological models e g modflow feflow and swat and some integrated surface water groundwater models e g gsflow are both applied for simulating and analyzing surface runoff soil water balance and groundwater dynamics hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 tian et al 2015 li et al 2017 zang et al 2012 on the other hand the systematic experiments and data production at different scales are carried out for better understanding the eco hydrological processes and improving the modeling accuracy li et al 2013a these studies include 1 various remote sensing techniques are applied for detecting the ground geographic features e g land use crop pattern leaf area index etc zhong et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 chen et al 2015 fan et al 2015 2 evapotranspiration data and products in different scales are obtained with eddy covariance large aperture scintillometer and satellite image liu et al 2011 hu and jia 2015 xiong et al 2015 lian and huang 2015 3 isotope tracing is used to quantify the sources and composition of river runoff zhang et al 2009 4 sampling analysis related to soils plants and waters are widely carried out as well overall the integrated eco hydrological studies related to the interaction of water soil vegetation and atmosphere have become a hot spot at present li et al 2013b yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 ma et al 2015 however with further research it is increasingly recognized that the agricultural water use in middle oasis is still not well understood although it is so significant for water cycle and water management both in middle oasis and the hrb some previous research referring to agricultural water issues su et al 2007 jiang et al 2015 2016 ge et al 2013 is mostly implemented on a farmland or a local regional scale while rarely on an oasis scale this may be primarily due to the difficulties in availability of large datasets for considering the spatial variance of soil irrigation crop pattern etc also the previous hydrological modeling generally adopts a simplified manner to conceptualize the irrigation effects in middle oasis e g tian et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 zang et al 2012 however massive important spatial distributed data and observed data of middle hrb have become available due to the supports of above mentioned extensive research in recent years this makes it practicable to simulate the complicated agro hydrological processes on an oasis scale in addition the efficiency analysis related to multiple scales and users is the prerequisite to realize reasonable water use van halsema and vincent 2012 nair et al 2013 for irrigation systems it is commonly applied to each irrigation sub system of storage conveyance off and on farm distribution and on farm application bos and nugteren 1990 different terms have been proposed and used since 1950s such as the classical irrigation efficiency ie israelson 1950 three efficiency terms i e conveyance efficiency distribution efficiency and field application efficiency formulated by the icid ilri bos and nugteren 1990 and some adapted ie e g effective irrigation efficiency and irrigation sagacity keller and keller 1995 solomon and burt 1999 moreover the improvement of local efficiencies generally cannot represent a reduction of water losses and an increase of efficiency within a larger system or in river basins since the waste or non consumed water could be reused somewhere molden et al 2007 van halsema and vincent 2012 recently some irrigation scientists point out that the term efficiency often leads to misconceptions and misuse owing to its various and confused definitions perry 2007 jensen 2007 pereira et al 2012 hence the present trend is to apply some new indicators that use a ratio or fraction to replace the traditional efficiency terminology which make definitions more directly refer to different water use component e g consumptive and non consumptive use beneficial and non beneficial use foster and perry 2010 pereira et al 2012 an expected advantage of these indicators is that irrigation managers and farmers could understand them better than efficiency terms therefore the purpose of this study was to conduct a distributed agro hydrological modeling and to assess the irrigation water use and water saving for the major irrigation systems in the middle oasis abbreviated as mois of the heihe river basin the gis based swap epic model was adopted for the distributed modeling of agro hydrological processes remote sensing evapotranspiration et data was used to evaluate the reasonability of simulation then spatial variations of water balance components and crop yields were systematically analyzed and irrigation water use was further investigated using three evaluation indicators finally a water saving analysis was conducted through scenario simulation related to the improvement of irrigation water allocation and field water application results of this paper would provide a comprehensive and accurate understanding of agro hydrological processes in middle oasis and valuable information to existing watershed hydrological modeling water saving analysis aims to give potential supports for improving the irrigation water allocation and management in the hrb and the analogous inland river basins in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mois 38 5 39 8 n and 98 9 100 8 e is located between the qilian mountain in the south and the longshou heli mountains in the north where a river valley fine soil plain is formed fig 1 it consists of irrigation systems in three counties of ganzhou linze and gaotai that are respectively located in the upper middle and lower stream of mois its irrigated area covers about 66 of total irrigated areas in the middle oasis agricultural irrigation in mois consumes more than 80 of upstream runoff of the heihe river that enters the middle oasis and contributes approximately 90 of agricultural production value of the hrb excessive river water diversion into mois is the main reason for the water conflicts and ecological degradation in the hrb the farmlands in mois occupy 27 of the total area mainly distributed along the main stream of heihe river fig 1 the edge of mois is a large area of wasteland and gobi desert accounting for 53 of the total area some woodlands grasslands and wetlands are scatteredly distributed the mois has a temperate continental arid climate the average annual precipitation is only 133 mm with over 60 occurring during june to september 1994 2013 the average fao reference evapotranspiration eto reaches to 1130 mm a 1 and is much larger than precipitation fig 2 the minimum and maximum monthly temperature averages at 10 and 22 in january and july respectively there are about 150 170 frost free days per year the growing season is generally from march to september the agriculture is fully dependent on irrigation due to the arid climate the altitude of mois varies from 2200 m in upper southeast to 1290 m in lower northwest fig 1 silt loam and loam is widely distributed in cultivated farmlands coarse textured soils are also typical in northeast area of downstream mois fig 3 a groundwater depth is very deep 30 200 m in upper southwest parts of piedmont alluvial fan plain and become shallow in lower fine soil plain area the groundwater plays a critical role in maintaining natural vegetation growth especially in the downstream mois since 1990s due to expanded farmlands and increasing groundwater exploitation groundwater levels show a noticeable decreasing trend with range of 4 9 to 11 5 m decline during the last 30 years mi et al 2016 in recent years groundwater depths often range from not less than 3 m to over 30 m in irrigated areas the mois consists of 24 irrigation districts with thousands of canals and over 6000 pumping wells for irrigation fig 3b a large part of canals are lined and the hydraulic construction is re updated after 2002 especially in upstream mois however the canal regulation and operation management are still at a low level in many districts as reported by some studies jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 the main crop is corn with two varieties i e grain corn for seed production and forage corn for forage production accounting for 65 of the total irrigated area grain corn is more widely planted due to its higher profits the remaining irrigated areas include other croplands planted with wheat barley cotton cabbage tomato and pepper and some scattered grasslands and woodlands fig 3c flood basin irrigation is the common method there are usually 3 4 irrigation events during crop season and a winter irrigation event during november for maintaining soil moisture in the next spring 2 2 model description regional irrigation water use was related to both field water application and canal water conveyance of these agro hydrological processes in fields were the more complicated and critical part the gis based swap epic model was adopted to simulate the field hydrological processes in a distributed manner meanwhile the calculation for water conveyance of canal systems was focused on its loss terms using coefficient methods swap epic was a one dimensional 1 d physical based agro hydrological model that could simulate soil water flow solute and heat transport as well as crop growth on a field scale and daily time step it was proposed by xu et al 2013 through coupling the swap soil water atmosphere plant model kroes and van dam 2003 and the epic crop growth module williams et al 1989 the soil water flow was described based on the 1 d richards equation for vertical flow soil hydraulic properties were described using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 functions the solute transport and heat transfer were described with the form of convection dispersion equation and the conduction equation respectively the finite difference solution scheme was applied for both solving the partial differential equations of soil water flow solute transport and heat conductance the modules of soil water flow and crop growth were adopted for the current study a brief description is provided in this paper while more detailed theory can be found in kroes and van dam 2003 and xu et al 2013 the top boundary condition can be determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation and precipitation fluxes potential evapotranspiration etp estimated by the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 using daily meteorological data radiation wind speed vapor pressure and temperature was partitioned into potential soil evaporation and potential crop transpiration based upon the leaf area index xu et al 2013 actual evaporation and transpiration rates were respectively obtained as a function of the available soil water in the surface soil and the root zone crop growth and yield were calculated using the modified epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 this module described the crop growth based on accumulated temperature it can simulate the leaf area development light interception and the conversion of intercepted light into biomass and yield together with effects of temperature water and salt stress the gis based swap epic was developed through a close coupling of swap epic and arcinfo gis using vba programs in gis environment by jiang et al 2015 thus the swap epic was extended to be used in a distributed manner for regional modeling the distributed modeling was conducted by identifying a heterogeneous area as an assemblage of individual simulation units with homogenous soil water plant weather representation independent runs of swap epic model can simulate soil water balance and crop growth and yield in each simulated unit the detailed description about gis based swap epic model was given by jiang et al 2015 for canal water loss estimation the canal water conveyance loss cl and canal seepage cs were two important terms for efficiency evaluation the cl was estimated by multiplying the water supply with the term 1 e where e is the canal conveyance ratio i e the canal outflow to inflow ratio the e values were available through the canal flow measurements reported in the annual reports of irrigation water management of zhangye city annual report iwmzc for river water conveyance the ratio e ranged at 0 55 0 76 in different irrigation districts involving the conveyance processes from the highest to lowest levels of canals when including the groundwater conveyance the canal loss ratio 1 e was reduced to 0 15 0 43 the canal seepage cs was the main part of cl and difficult to be determined in this study it was estimated as 60 80 of cl referring to previous relevant research e g yao et al 2012 kinzli et al 2010 xu et al 2010 2 3 data processing spatial aggregation and distributed model setup the distributed modeling of agro hydrological processes in mois was based on the aggregation of homogenous simulation units with respect to soil and hydrological properties the homogenous simulation units would be obtained by overlaying thematic map of relevant spatial variables i e weather soil crop and irrigation in arcinfo gis groundwater depth varied in the range of over 3 m to even 200 m in mois and thus was not considered in the spatial aggregation process hence spatial information of weather soil crop irrigation was collected and aggregated for model setup in 2011 and 2012 the modeling domain was farmlands while did not cover the other land use types fig 1 the datasets and their processing are described in detail below soil the spatial distribution of soil was based on the map of soil textural classes usda texture classification in 0 30 cm depth with 1 km resolution lu et al 2011 on this map six soil types were identified while three types i e silt loam loam and sandy loam were the majors fig 3a based on this soil map a soil survey was carried out at 148 soil sample points for obtaining the physical properties particle size percentages and bulk density these points were evenly distributed in a 5 km distance in farmlands fig 3a with soil depth of 80 120 cm in the simulations a soil profile with 200 cm depth was specified and was further divided as 4 horizons 0 40 cm 40 80 cm 80 120 cm and 120 200 cm the physical properties for each horizon were derived at 90 m resolution through the interpolation of 148 points the soil hydraulic parameters were derived from the mean soil physical properties using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 each soil domain was further discretized into 150 compartments with 1 cm thickness for 0 100 cm depth and 2 cm thickness for the 100 200 cm depth weather daily weather data of precipitation temperature sunshine hours relative humidity and wind speed was collected at three meteorological stations named zhangye linze and gaotai fig 1 the three stations could respectively represent the weather conditions of upper middle and lower parts of mois then three weather zones were defined using the thiessen polygon method applied at these three stations fig 4 crop a land cover use map 2012 in 30 m spatial resolution was used which was produced using the time series hj 1 ccd data of chinese environmental satellite zhong et al 2014 it had the basic category of land use type and relatively detailed crop patterns in farmlands fig 3c furthermore on the basis of our field surveys the corn was distinguished as grain corn and forage corn and the cash crops were classified into tomato cabbage pepper and cotton through selecting a major species as a representative crop in each irrigation district land use map was resampled from 30 m to 90 m resolution for avoiding a high level disorderly distribution of crops in spatial aggregation thus five land use types and eight crop species were determined figs 3c and 4 the crop calendar for the same crop varied slightly from village to village and thus the uniform sowing date was applied for a crop in the simulation table 1 the parameters for major crops i e field corn grain corn spring wheat and cabbage were referred to the values that calibrated by jiang et al 2015 while those for cotton tomato and pepper were determined based on other field experimental studies and default values in epic model williams et al 2006 liu et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 irrigation according to the differences of river water diversion the irrigation districts were classified into four categories 1 those controlled by the east primary canal z1 z3 and z4 or by the west primary canal z2 z6 l1 and g6 2 three ones diverting surface water from liyuan river that was a large tributary of the heihe river ly6 ly7 and ly8 3 four ones near mountains diverting surface water from other small tributaries out from the mountains n1 n2 n3 and n4 4 other ones along the riverbank in the mid and down stream of mois directly diverting river water from the heihe river through their main canals fig 3b irrigation water amount and ratio of surface water to groundwater were both various in and among different irrigation districts due to the different water diversion conditions and crop patterns hence an irrigation district was further divided into at least two or three canal command areas i e irrigation zones based on the control area of sub main canals totally 64 irrigation zones were built in this study fig 4 water supply data for canals was available from the heihe plan science data center hpsdc the groundwater pumping amount for each irrigation district was available from annual report iwmzc the mean field irrigation depth was estimated by equaling to the net irrigation amount divided by its actual irrigated area in each time it was applied to each irrigation zone without distinguishing crops in an irrigation event for simplification irrigation scheduling was supposed to be same for a crop and was determined in accordance with the growth stages and local irrigation calendar the winter irrigation was generally started in early november the detailed irrigation information is listed in table 1 finally based on spatial aggregation of above soil weather crop irrigation zones the modeling domain i e farmland areas of mois was divided into 519 individual simulation units with approximately homogenous agro hydrological environment in each unit fig 4 in each unit the top boundary condition can be determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation and precipitation fluxes the free drainage boundary was defined as bottom boundary condition as the groundwater table was relatively deep initial soil water content was defined according to the soil sampling in april and the simulation units without measured values would refer to its nearby unit distributed simulation of swap epic model was then conducted in mois for obtaining spatial distribution of irrigation water balance components and crop yields during 2011 and 2012 the simulation period was from march 20th to november 30th covering the whole crop growing season and winter irrigation period 2 4 modeling evaluation model calibration was often not easy for such regional ago hydrological modeling due to the deficit of enough observed data in fields yet the actual evapotranspiration eta closely related to all of soil moisture conditions crop growth and yields was relatively readily available on a regional scale due to widely application of remote sense thus eta was often used for performing the model reliability in many regional modeling studies ines and honda 2005 singh et al 2006 sun and ren 2013 in this study two kinds of remote sensing eta data were available on oasis scale during the simulation period and thus were both used to evaluate the reasonability of distributed modeling the eta data were as follows 1 the one et rsj was 8 days et data for the crop growth period of 2012 with 250 m resolution produced by jia et al 2014 and hu and jia 2015 2 the other one et rsw was monthly et data during 2011 2012 with 30 m resolution produced by wu et al 2012 2013 for a feasible comparison the model simulated and remote sensing eta was assembled into the monthly accumulative eta data in each irrigation district the fitness indicators used to evaluate the model performance included mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse determine coefficient r2 and regression coefficient b 2 5 irrigation water use analysis and water saving scenarios after evaluating the reliability the distributed results would be applied to quantitatively understanding the spatial characteristics of different water balance components eta deep percolation and canal water conveyance loss c l and crop yields in mois three kinds of indicators listed in table 2 were mainly adopted for assisting the evaluations on irrigation water use efficiency and water saving i e beneficial water use fraction bwuf non consumptive water fraction ncf and dp ratio bwuf was a measure of irrigation effectiveness and was here defined on field and district scales referred as bwuffield and bwufregion respectively table 2 in the calculations the et a during crop season et a cs was considered as the beneficial water use in addition it was necessary to consider salt leaching fraction at least 10 and inevitable percolation loss of irrigation water thus the appropriate bwuffield should be in a range of 0 8 0 9 for border or basin irrigation as referred to fao 61 paper tanji and kielen 2002 ncf was an indicator to quantify the water losses in an irrigation system or sub system in this study the cl and field deep percolation dp was considered as non consumptive water and the ncf represented the non consumptive fraction of the total water use in irrigation system table 2 the dp ratio was defined as ratio of dp to total field water input the sum of irrigation and rainfall expressing the water losses fraction of water applied in fields in general dp were inevitable for traditional surface irrigation when considering irrigation non uniformity and necessary requirement for salt leaching a reasonable dp ratio was thus suggested in the range of 10 20 for basin or border irrigation by the fao 61 paper tanji and kielen 2002 water saving scenarios were defined with considering the improvement of irrigation water allocation based on differences of crop soil and climatic conditions this would contribute to uniform and reasonable irrigation water distribution and appropriate field irrigation amount in scenario setting six major crops table 1 and three main soil types silt loam loam and sandy loam were combined as 18 crop soil combination units in mois ten levels of irrigation depth were defined and applied to the simulations in each crop soil unit for three climate zones simulated results were evaluated using two constraints 1 the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration ta tp were not lower than 0 9 for maintaining yields sarwar and bastiaanssen 2001 2 bwuffield were not lower than 0 8 in silt loam and loam and not lower than 0 75 in sandy loam tanji and kielen 2002 for ensuring efficiency thus an appropriate range of irrigation depths could be obtained for each crop soil unit when satisfying both of the two referred constraints and then the minimum satisfactory irrigation depth were employed for distributed simulation in entire mois in scenarios the irrigation method was mainly related to the improved or modernized basin irrigation with considering the limitations of local economic conditions over the next many years the advanced water saving irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation required higher investment costs and high quality management and were also not suitable for the local smallholder farmlands thus they were not involved in the scenario analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons of et between distributed modeling and remote sensing results showed that the simulated eta was in a good agreement with the two kinds of remote sensing eta over the whole mois fig 5 mre was lower than 4 0 and rmse was less than 44 mm in both of 2011 and 2012 as compared to et rsw fig 5a and b with regard to et rsj mre and rmse were about 10 and 60 mm respectively fig 5c the nse were both larger than 0 8 and the r2 were over 0 85 the average simulated eta during may to september was respectively 533 mm and 556 mm in 2011 and 2012 for the whole mois it was only 1 and 4 higher than et rsw in 2011 and 2012 respectively and 7 higher than et rsj in 2012 meanwhile the spatial differences of eta among different districts were effectively described for each month fig 5 analyses indicated that the deviations of et were relatively small in most plain areas while there were also some noticeable deviations in some irrigation districts e g the irrigation districts of g5 and n1 n4 this was mainly resulted from the simplifications in model conceptualization besides the systematic uncertainty e g the resample of crop distribution map and the compromise in discretization of meteorological zones and irrigation zones the main deviations of et were occurred in the near mountain regions n1 n4 where the weather data of zhangye or gaotai meteorological station was used as substitute due to data deficit these simplifications and discrepancy might affect the accuracy of simulated results in the whole area overall results indicated that the simulated results of distributed agro hydrological modeling for mois were acceptable and could be used for analyzing regional irrigation water balance and water use performance 3 2 agro hydrological processes and irrigation performance 3 2 1 spatial distribution of eta and crop yield the spatial distribution of simulated eta and relative crop yield rcy for the simulation period is presented in fig 6 the rcy for each crop was defined as the ratio of actual crop yield to the acceptable yield the average value across the whole region for each crop surveyed from local farmers results showed that eta varied from 300 mm to around 700 mm with an average of about 580 mm in 2011 and 2012 eta and rcy showed obviously spatial differences in and among different irrigation districts due to the combined effects of various factors regional distribution of eta was affected mainly by crop pattern and irrigation and partly by climatic conditions and soil properties meanwhile the regional rcy was more influenced by irrigation and climatic conditions crop pattern partly affected by the river water diversion conditions was the major factor determining the spatial variance of eta results showed that eta was mostly above 550 mm for corn while less than 520 mm for wheat and most cash crops except cotton in entire mois specifically the larger eta 600 mm was widely distributed in upstream areas where the river water supply was more convenient for irrigation fig 6 this was because the grain corn that had higher economic benefit but large water demand was extensively planted in upstream areas particularly in areas close to water intake of main canals e g in z1 z2 and z3 its planted area occupied about 75 of the total planted area in upstream irrigation districts z1 z6 fig 3c in the midstream mois eta was generally less than 500 mm due to the larger proportion of wheat with less water demand e g in l4 and l2 figs 3c and 6 this was similar for the irrigation districts near the mountains n1 n4 with large planted area of wheat the downstream regions i e g1 g6 had a larger planting proportion of cash crops fig 3c in order to adapt to the less available river water resources hence lower eta 520 mm was widely distributed in downstream irrigation districts fig 6 in addition the areas around the urban districts also had relatively lower eta 520 mm e g in z3 and ly7 due to their larger planting proportion of vegetables with the convenient transportation and higher profits for the same crop the eta and rcy was influenced by irrigation amount during crop season i g cs to a certain degree under the same climatic conditions taking upstream region i e z1 z6 as an example the eta was larger than 650 mm and the rcy was 1 07 1 10 for grain corn when i g cs was above 650 mm e g in z1 z2 and z5 while in other areas where the i g cs ranged at 540 560 mm the eta was a little lower 610 625 mm and the rcy was just around 1 0 for grain corn e g in z3 z4 and z6 figs 6 and 7 for wheat and the same cash crop the differences in eta were much smaller 30 mm because of their relatively small water requirement fig 7 but for forage corn the differences in eta 570 670 mm and rcy 0 8 1 07 were both larger than those for grain corn this was mainly caused by their scattered distribution and quite different irrigation amount due to their lower economic profits and extensive management the eta and rcy also showed a similar relationship with i g cs in the midstream and downstream regions figs 6 and 7 results also showed that the overall variation of eta and rcy was just slightly influenced by changes of climatic conditions the climatic variations resulted in relatively low potential et and high crop yields in downstream areas such as in 2012 the eta of grain corn was more than 650 mm with rcy of about 1 06 in ganzhou i e z1 z6 under relatively sufficient irrigation i g cs 650 mm while the maximum eta was reduced to 620 mm but with rcy of 1 09 in gaotai i e g1 g6 for spring wheat and cash crops the eta and rcy showed similar differences within three weather zones particularly for the rcy fig 7b in addition the lower eta and rcy was also observed in some irrigation districts where coarse textured soils were extensively distributed especially in the mid and down stream mois for example in 2012 the eta and rcy were both small for corn in l4 593 mm and 0 96 fig 7b even with large i g cs of 655 mm because more than half of irrigated area was distributed with sandy loam soils in l4 fig 3a similar results were also reported by li and shao 2014 3 2 2 deep percolation and beneficial water use fraction simulated results indicated that dp had a very strong spatial variation in mois ranging from 30 mm to about 450 mm during 2011 and 2012 fig 6 in 2012 the mean dp in each irrigation district ranged from 70 mm to 400 mm and the range of dp ratio was 14 40 which was similar in 2011 fig 8 the dp reached to 240 mm averaged in mois while the dp ratio approached to 29 the bwuffield just ranged from 0 57 to 0 84 among different irrigation districts and the average value was 0 70 in both two years fig 9 overall the dp ratio was obviously higher than 20 in many irrigation districts of mois while the corresponding bwuffield was noticeably higher than its appropriate range i e 0 8 0 9 the relatively high dp may result in significant irrigation water waste and fertilizer leaching the spatial distribution of dp and bwuffield was closely related to the ig which was mainly influenced by water diversion conditions production benefit canal and field water management as well as farmers water use habits specifically dp was usually larger than 250 mm in irrigation districts where ig was over 800 mm these irrigation districts were generally along the river e g z5 and l2 l5 or close to water intakes of main canals e g z1 nd z2 fig 6 due to their favorable water diversion conditions meanwhile the bwuffield was only 0 57 0 68 in these above irrigation districts due to the larger dp fig 9 whereas the dp of less than 200 mm often took place in areas far away from rivers or water intakes of main canals e g z3 z4 z6 l1 and ly8 where ig was less than 650 mm fig 6 this also led to higher bwuffield 0 75 in these areas and the average bwuffield reached up to 0 75 0 84 in these edge or downstream irrigation districts fig 9 however in downstream districts of g1 and g6 with limited river water supply the dp ratio was still larger than 30 and bwuffield was even lower than 0 68 due to the excessive groundwater exploitation fig 8 in addition it should be also noted that due to the larger percentage of coarse textured soils in districts of northeastern mois e g l2 l4 and g1 g5 dp was relatively larger and bwuffield was relatively lower as compared to other districts figs 6 and 8 overall the extensive distribution of excessive dp and lower bwuffield was caused by non uniform and unreasonable irrigation water distribution which would be closely related to the canal system operation and water fee system firstly farmers were used to applying excessive irrigation to guarantee yields if water was sufficiently available because water price was very low and water charges were generally collected based on the registered irrigated area but not actual water use amount secondly the poor management and regulation of water conveyance and distribution further led to both excessive and insufficient water diversion around mois even in some downstream and edge districts with limited river water diversion the absence of supervision of groundwater pumping also led to large exploitation and excessive irrigation consequently about 70 of irrigated areas had bwuffield lower than the appropriate value 0 8 suggested by fao 61 fig 9 whereas the higher bwuffield was mainly caused by the insufficient irrigation corresponding to the districts with lower rcy 3 2 3 regional irrigation water use with considering water conveyance losses canal water conveyance loss cl from canal intakes to farmlands further reduced the bwuf by 13 40 on irrigation district scale i e bwufregion as compared with bwuffield fig 9 due to the different canal conveyance ratio e in each irrigation district for example the bwufregion averaged 0 50 0 59 in upstream irrigation districts of z1 z4 with less 21 reduction than bwuffield fig 9 whereas the bwufregion only averaged 0 40 0 53 in many downstream districts of linze and gaotai e g l2 l4 and g3 g5 approaching 29 40 lower than bwuffield because of lower e 0 67 overall the mean bwufregion was 0 52 in entire mois during 2011 and 2012 nearly 50 of irrigation districts had bwufregion values lower than the national average value of 0 5 and far lower than that of 0 7 0 8 in developed countries du et al 2015 thus more attention should be paid to improving the management of field irrigation and canal system operation the non consumptive water fraction ncf was 0 32 0 58 with an average of 0 47 in 2011 and 2012 on the irrigation district scale fig 9 it indicated that about 32 58 of the regional total water use was not consumed while lost through canal seepage and deep percolation from a perspective of watershed hydrological cycle this non consumptive water was not wasted because it would enter into groundwater as return flow and could be reused somewhere else however for irrigation engineering this fraction of water was unnecessary expense and an extra burden for irrigation system in addition the return flow may not timely recharge groundwater for reuse especially with deep groundwater depth the efficacy of water reuse also required a detailed water budget accounting that was difficult to be implemented at least the continuous groundwater level decline in low stream mois indicated that the non consumptive water in upstream areas did not supplement the groundwater timely in our view decreasing the ncf through improving the uniformity and timeliness of irrigation water allocation should be very helpful to reduce the groundwater exploitation and thus to recover the ecosystem regional irrigation water budget indicated that the total irrigation water use i e the sum of river water diversion and groundwater pumping tiwu was about 18 108 m3 in mois during 2011 and 2012 table 3 the value has changed slightly as compared with that in the last ten years as reported by shi et al 2011 whereas the groundwater use reached up to 4 0 108 m3 in 2011 and 2012 which was almost two times as much as that in 2000 table 3 more groundwater was exploited to supplement irrigation due to the cut of river water diversion since ewdp implementation during simulation period of 2011 and 2012 eta averaged 10 2 108 m3 and the cl and dp was estimated at 4 8 108 m3 and 4 0 108 m3 respectively table 3 the results indicated that only 53 of tiwu including rainfall trwi was consumed through crop evapotranspiration while the cl and dp accounted for 25 and 22 of trwi respectively table 3 the canal seepage cs was assumed to be 60 80 of cl and thus ranged from 3 0 108 to 4 0 108 m3 table 3 the sum of cs and dp was considered as potential recharge to groundwater in irrigation systems gwrnpot and was estimated at about 6 9 8 3 108 m3 in average of 2011 and 2012 meanwhile the net potential groundwater recharge gwrnpot denoted as gwrpot minus groundwater pumping for supplementing irrigation was calculated as shown in fig 10 a gwrnpot varied strongly among different irrigation districts and showed positive value in most districts but note that gwrnpot was negative or even far less than zero in some irrigation districts located in edge or downstream oasis e g z4 and g6 fig 10a due to less river water and resulting large groundwater exploitation negative gwrnpot became the primary reason to the groundwater level declines in addition many previous studies of hydrological modeling often empirically or simply estimated the actual groundwater recharge from irrigation water denoted as the part of infiltrated irrigation water that has actually entered into groundwater gwract their estimated values varied from 63 mm 1 55 108 m3 to 780 mm 18 1 108 m3 in mois showing large differences wen et al 2007 hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 tian et al 2015 the differences of modeling domain model conceptualization and simulation periods may cause differences of gwract in above previous literature by contrast our paper gave an estimation of gwrpot with about 230 mm 4 0 108 m3 from field irrigation and 165 234 mm 2 9 4 2 108 m3 from canal seepage table 3 the estimated gwrpot from field irrigation i e dp should probably be more reasonable with much less uncertainties due to precise description of agro hydrological processes in this study also the spatial variation of gwrpot was better presented with well consideration of the spatial variance of irrigation soil and crop water consumption this would provide very useful references or information in irrigated areas for improving the previous large scale hydrological modeling 3 3 water saving analysis above analyses indicated that the inappropriate and extensive management of irrigation water allocation and distribution from districts to fields was the major reason for large dp and lower bwuf the inefficient use of irrigation water usually led to intensified competition and over groundwater exploitation in the peak period of crop water demand this may further result in crop yields losses and income reduction as well as groundwater level declines therefore there was huge scope and necessity to improve irrigation water use performance and to save water through searching for appropriate field water application and well coordination of canal conveyance and field water demand the water saving analysis was carried out in mois based on the defined scenario with satisfactory minimum irrigation depth in section 2 5 on the basis of the normal hydrological year 2012 water budget of water saving scenario was compared with that of present situation as shown in fig 10b in the scenario the tiwu in mois was 14 7 108 m3 decreased by 15 as compared to the present of 2012 total eta was almost not changed with only 1 reduction this implied that there was almost no negative impact on crop water consumption when reducing irrigation water through improving water allocation and distribution given present conditions of planted area crop pattern and crop varieties while the dp was decreased from 4 0 108 m3 to 2 5 108 m3 with a significant reduction of 37 fig 10b scenario results showed that bwuffield could be increased to above 0 8 for most irrigation districts and also greater than 0 75 in those irrigation districts with widespread coarse textured soils e g l2 and l4 the mean bwuffield for entire mois could increase from 0 7 to 0 8 in water saving scenario meanwhile the crop yields in scenario y s were almost not reduced as compared to present crop yields y a the relative values y s y a were around 1 0 in most areas and crop yields for some districts were even increased by 10 20 due to the increase of irrigation water allocation in addition although the improvement of canal conveyance was not considered in the scenario it should be noted that about 10 more irrigation water could be further saved if the low canal conveyance ratio in some irrigation districts could be increased to 0 7 moreover if maintaining the present mean ratio of groundwater use i e 20 the groundwater exploitation could be reduced by 19 as compared to the present it will be of benefit to the recovery of local groundwater levels especially for the downstream and edge areas in mois in summary our analysis implied that the relevant water saving measures for the middle hrb should more focus on two aspects 1 the improvement of management in the process of water conveyance and allocation 2 the increase of efficiency in the process of field water application the specific advice and measures emphatically include 1 improving canal water operation for accurate and timely water allocation e g equipping advanced water measuring devices prompting the reform of canal management agency 2 improving traditional irrigation methods and concepts of field water use e g using the modernized basin or furrow irrigation adopting precise land leveling and prompting the water saving education for farmers 3 implementing water saving irrigation technologies and equipment e g drip irrigation with mulch in some areas with higher income or powerful financial support in addition proper planted area reduction or crop pattern adjustment that were not considered in this study could also further promote the water saving therefore more detailed water saving scenarios were deserved to be conducted in follow up investigation from an ecological perspective the water saving may largely reduce the groundwater recharge from the field deep percolation and canal seepage but this mainly corresponded to the irrigated areas with excessive river water allocation and without the declined trend of groundwater levels whereas this reduced water could be distributed to the other areas with excessive groundwater pumping which could also prompt the recovery of eco environment in those areas overall the strategies of water saving and their effects on eco environments in mois should further be associated with the groundwater studies in future 4 conclusions the performance of irrigation water use for the major irrigation systems of the middle oasis mois of the heihe river basin was systematically evaluated by using the distributed swap epic model modeling considered the detailed spatial information of soil crop irrigation and weather condition the reasonability of simulations was verified by the good agreement between simulated actual evapotranspiration eta and remote sensing eta the eta was in a range of 300 700 mm with an average of 580 mm in mois spatial variation was primarily related to the crop pattern that was partly affected by water diversion conditions and secondary to irrigation amount ig and then slightly to climate and soil conditions the regional relative crop yield rcy was more affected by irrigation and climate conditions with relatively higher values 1 05 in areas with more sufficient ig the deep percolation dp accounted to 14 40 of total field water input and the beneficial water use fraction bwuf was respectively 0 57 0 84 on field scale and 0 40 0 67 on irrigation district scale their distribution was mainly influenced by water diversion conditions canal and field water management and farmer s water use habits large dp ratio and lower bwuf was often distributed in areas close to the river or water intakes of main canals with excessive ig about 70 of irrigated areas had dp ratio greater than 20 and bwuf smaller than the appropriate value 0 8 on field scale while half of irrigation districts had bwuf lower than the national average value 0 5 and far lower than 0 7 0 8 in developed countries in the whole mois only 53 of total irrigation water including rainfall was used for eta while about 22 and 25 was lost through the deep percolation and canal conveyance losses respectively the existing large water losses indicated that there was still large space and necessity to improve the present situation of irrigation water use in mois meanwhile the potential groundwater recharge from irrigation water was estimated at about 37 43 of irrigation water its detailed regional distribution implied a strong variation of potential groundwater recharge in irrigated areas this could provide useful information for overcoming the subjectivity and uncertainties in estimation of groundwater recharge in existing hydrological modeling furthermore water saving analysis indicated that about 15 of irrigation water could be saved if adopting improved strategies of irrigation water allocation and distribution relevant water saving measures were suggested in detail being focused on the improvement of management in the process of water conveyance and allocation and the increase of efficiency in the process of field water application further studies should involve more detailed water saving analysis with considering the crop pattern adjustment and the application of advanced irrigation technologies groundwater studies should be also integrated in the follow up research for more comprehensive analysis of agricultural water saving and corresponding

11294,studying the effects of precipitation and irrigation on soil water leaching are critical for maintaining agricultural environment in northern china where uneven irrigation has been applied coupled with a broad spectrum of climatic conditions we conducted consecutive a 4 year field experiment from 2008 to 2011 with lysimeters buried 90 cm deep to determine soil water leaching results indicated that amounts of soil water leaching in greenhouse croplands were significantly higher than that in open field croplands rainy season is the key period for soil water leaching in semi humid areas in open fields accounting for 88 6 of the annual amount of leachate while excess irrigation was a significant factor for soil water leaching in semi arid areas irrigation pattern affects soil water leaching by determining irrigation volume there was significant leaching with border irrigation particularly in the winter spring seasons from jan to jun while drip irrigation led to a 62 74 reduction of irrigation water with no leaching happened with water saving irrigation the effects of fertilization on nitrogen leaching were not significant keywords soil water leaching cropland rainfall irrigation northern china 1 introduction the population boom during the 20th century motivated the implementation of intensive agriculture with all types of crops e g fruit trees vegetables and cereals unfortunately agricultural activities probably are the most common sources of diverse forms of pollution candela et al 2008 among which groundwater nitrate pollution is one of the most significant muhammetoğlu et al 2002 ju et al 2006 nitrate loss through leaching has been recognized as one of the most common sources of groundwater contamination scientific and public concern have been mounting with respect to the necessity to prevent it long and sun 2012 gholamhoseini et al 2013 studies have indicated that soil nitrate concentration and the amounts of subsurface drainage water leaching generates are two important factors that control groundwater nitrate contamination asadi et al 2002 tamini and mermoud 2002 gholamhoseini et al 2013 jia et al 2014 nitrate is not retained by soil particles and it would mobile readily with water flow gächter et al 2004 and higher drainage is associated with greater nitrate leaching williams et al 2015 heavy irrigation leads to rapid movement of nitrate below the root zone because the percolating water transports it through the profile endelman et al 1974 the mass of nitrate leached in a sandy loam has been found to be related to drainage volume ritter et al 1991 allaire leung et al 2001 therefore the study of agricultural nitrogen pollution necessitates an accurate knowledge of soil water leaching leaching is a process that transports water from the earth s surface underground numerous studies have shown that excessive irrigation can cause leaching jalali 2005 wallis et al 2011 leading to a strong increase in water percolation into deeper soil horizons diez et al 1997 factors that affect water percolation in soil including soil crop type irrigation and nitrogen application influence the probability of groundwater degradation zotarelli et al 2009 vaughan and letey 2013 effects of the frequency of ryegrass irrigation on no3 n leaching loss overall differ between the summer and late autumn sumanasena et al 2004 in addition reports have demonstrated that nitrate leaching is most likely to occur following a heavy precipitation event while only slight deep percolation has been observed following an irrigation event wang et al 2014 however these effects on leaching in different climates such as arid or humid and different croplands such as open field or greenhouse croplands have not been studied in addition the load of leaching in scientific reports has been determined by many methods such as direct soil sample analysis leachate collection from drainage lysimeters or mathematical simulation models meisinger and gelgado 2002 jiang et al 2010 min et al 2012 which have prevented comparisons of the results northern china is one of the most important agricultural production regions in the country with many intensive open field and greenhouse croplands however the uneven distribution of rainfall and water shortages cause the agricultural environment to differ greatly from west to east within the past decade many scientific reports showed that nitrate pollution in groundwater was severe in northern china zhang et al 1996 liu et al 2005 zhao et al 2007 where excessive n fertilizers and irrigation have been applied in pursuit of high yields ye et al 2010 sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 some research has been conducted for soil water leaching in this region only with short term studies zhu et al 2005 fang et al 2010 wang et al 2013 they failed to identify the variations and characteristics of leaching under a broad spectrum of climatic conditions and cropping systems in this area particularly those that have not used the same methods to measure leaching load further there is a general lack of quantitative studies on deep drainage in farmland and little research has been conducted to quantify its influencing factors therefore from 2008 to 2011 we conducted consecutive a 4 year field experiment to determine soil water leaching losses from grain open field vegetable and greenhouse vegetable croplands in northern china using drainable lysimeters installed at a depth of 90 cm and observed the changes in rainfall and irrigation simultaneously the specific objectives of this study were to 1 determine the current situation of the leached water flux in northern china and rainfall and irrigation s effects on it in open field cropland and greenhouse fields respectively and 2 identify possible inadequate management practices and propose appropriate measures for water management that will provide local farmers with theoretical guidance on irrigation management to mitigate percolation and nitrate leaching in cropland 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and treatments to study soil water leaching in cropland and effects of precipitation and irrigation three studies involving 9 field sites in northern china were conducted from 2008 to 2011 fig 1 table 1 shows the patterns of planting and irrigation soil and texture and mean annual precipitation and temperature on field sites the studies were as follows 2 1 1 study of rainfall and irrigation s effects on soil water leaching in open field croplands these experiments were conducted at six open cropland fields bjl01 bjl02 gsl hel snl and jll fig 1 and the amounts of rainfall irrigation and leachate at every site were monitored to study the effects of rainfall and irrigation on soil water leaching in these croplands 2 1 2 study on the effects of irrigation pattern on soil water leaching experiments were conducted at greenhouse vegetable field sdl fig 1 where two irrigation treatments border irrigation m1 and drip irrigation m2 were carried out to compare their effects on soil water leaching irrigation amounts are shown in table 2 crop species in the experiment were greenhouse cucumber cultivated two times a year ws winter spring season from jan to jun and aw autumn winter season from oct to dec soil water leachate irrigation amount each time and annual irrigation amount were monitored to study irrigation methods effects on soil water leaching in addition the study also was carried out in bjl03 which is under drip irrigation 2 1 3 study on the effects of water saving irrigation on soil water leaching these studies were conducted in bjl04 which is an organic vegetable production base in beijing two irrigation treatments with the border method w1 water saving irrigation and w2 conventional irrigation were designed to study water saving irrigation s effects on soil water leaching the amount of irrigation during every crop season is shown in table 3 three nitrogen levels were applied for each irrigation treatment n0 no n fertilizer n1 optimized n fertilizer and n2 conventional n fertilizer all fertilizers were applied once with organic n fertilizer and no dressing 2 1 4 sampling and laboratory analysis rainfall data were obtained from a meteorological station located approximately 200 m from the field site in every experimental plot leached water was collected in leaching trays 0 5 m 0 4 m buried 90 cm deep with pvc tube referred to as technical specification for leaching monitoring wu et al 2014 leachates were collected within 48 to 96 h after irrigation or rainfall and their volume was recorded nitrate concentration in leachate was detected with continuous flow analysis flastar5000 after filtration 2 2 statistical analyses soil water leaching and water loss rate formula 1 data were subjected to analysis of variance one way anova to determine the significance of the difference between treatments the tukey multiple comparison test to determine the differences among individual treatments and correlation analysis to test the effects of the influencing factors all analyses were conducted in the software r with the psych revelle 2016 and agricolae mendiburu 2013 packages at alpha 0 05 water loss rates water loss amount irrigation amount 100 formula 1 3 analysis and results 3 1 rainfall season is the key period for soil water leaching in open field cropland the amounts of rainfall and leachate differed among six sites the range of rainfall from 2008 to 2011 in bjl01 bjl02 gsl hel snl and jll were 0 2 49 1 0 76 127 56 1 1 29 7 4 1 76 9 1 31 213 62 and 1 2 79 2 mm respectively the total amount of rainfall in 4 years was 1211 6 1346 06 490 7 1791 8 2379 87 and 1198 mm respectively monthly rainfall in the six open field sites is shown in fig 2 indicating that rainfall concentrated largely from jun to sept and accounting for 72 7 of the annual amounts of rainfall correspondingly leaching also occurred from jun to sept and the amounts of leachate in bjl01 bjl02 gsl hel snl and jll were 38 9 59 5 40 2 11 1 7 5 and 14 5 mm respectively accounting for 73 0 90 1 81 4 100 87 1 and 100 of the annual amounts of leachate respectively this indicated that the rainy season was the key period for soil water leaching in open field cropland amounts of leachate were correlated with rainfall p 0 05 indicating that soil water leaching was highly consistent with rainfall in open field cropland in northern china 3 2 irrigation has significant effects on soil water leaching in open field cropland in the six open field sites soil water leaching was correlated highly with rainfall however two sites gsl and jll differed from the others the amounts of leachate were significantly higher at the gsl site than at hel snl and jll although with relatively lower rainfall amounts than the latter three in addition the rainfall at jll was 594 8 mm similar to the other sites bjl01 bjl02 hel and snl while the amounts of leachate were lower than those at the latter four sites fig 2 this phenomenon may be caused by irrigation the mean amounts of irrigation in gsl hel snl jll and bjl02 from 2008 to 2011 were 233 38 156 0 and 270 mm respectively field gsl is located in an arid area with less rainfall and the soil type is irrigated desert soil table 1 which requires heavy irrigation for open field cropland and increases the amounts of soil water leaching inevitably however in jll where agriculture is rainfed with no irrigation the amounts of soil water leaching were lower than those at the other sites in a semi humid region with irrigated cropland 3 3 soil water leaching is related to irrigation pattern in sdl the annual amounts of border irrigation from 2008 to 2011 were 1469 2035 1807 and 1143 mm while amounts of drip irrigation were 648 741 652 and 723 mm respectively the mean irrigation volumes with border and drip irrigation were 74 7 and 33 0 mm respectively table 2 the latter reduced the amount of water 62 74 compared to the former most notably there was no leaching with the drip irrigation treatment however the amounts of leachate with border irrigation ranged from 241 68 to 568 35 mm in one year table 4 during the study period there were 75 incidents of leaching with border irrigation and the mean irrigation amount each time was 79 3 mm while the water loss rate was 19 18 in the ws season from jan to jun in particular leaching frequency mean irrigation amounts at a single time and water loss rate were all higher than those in the aw season from oct to dec monthly amounts of irrigation and leachate at sdl are shown in fig 3 which also shows that the mean amount of irrigation in the ws season was higher than that in the aw season correspondingly the leachate amount in the ws season also was higher than in the aw season correlation analysis demonstrated that there was a significant relation between irrigation and leaching in which r2 was 0 44 which is highly significant further the study at bjl03 showed that no leaching occurred in drip irrigation thus we can conclude that the irrigation pattern has significant effects on soil water leaching and the occurrence of leaching may depend on the irrigation volume 3 4 water saving irrigation reduces soil water leaching in bjl04 w1 treatment water saving irrigation decreased the amount of irrigation by approximately 29 3 compared to w2 conventional irrigation thereby saving about 1407 1 mm of water per crop season correspondingly the cumulative amount of leachate in the w2 and w1 treatments in the four years was 450 4 and 243 6 mm respectively and the w1 treatment water saving irrigation reduced the amounts of leachate by 45 9 fig 4 correlation analysis showed that the amount of leachate was correlated significantly with the amount of irrigation the effects of water saving irrigation on nitrogen leaching also were significant fig 5 shows that the total nitrogen loss with the w1 treatment was only 89 2kg hm 2 about 55 7 reduction compared to the w2 treatment correlation analysis also indicated that nitrogen loss was correlated with the amount of irrigation remarkably the tukey multiple comparison test demonstrated that the fertilizer treatments that accompanied w2 irrigation differed significantly p 0 05 while no differences were found with w1 irrigation further the effects of fertilization on nitrogen leaching were not significant with the water saving irrigation treatment indicating that the effects of irrigation on leaching are greater than those of fertilization 4 discussion open field and greenhouse croplands are the primary types of intensive croplands in northern china however the amount of soil water leaching in these croplands is different in study the highest annual average amounts of leachate were found in greenhouse vegetables about 517 05 mm followed by open field vegetables 53 36 mm and grain croplands 29 92 mm soil water leaching in greenhouse cropland is more serious than in open field croplands as some scientific reports showed there were higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater under greenhouse cultivation than in other croplands zhao et al 2007 high nitrogen fertilization and heavy irrigation are common practices in managing greenhouse vegetables to ensure high yields agostini et al 2010 in study the annual amount of irrigation in greenhouse cropland ranged from 1143 to 12 383 mm while from 38 to 230 mm in open field cropland precipitation might be a significant factor that affects nitrate leaching in open field in northern china where approximately 72 7 of annual rainfall is concentrated from june to september and the amount of leachate was 88 6 of the annual amounts during this period many reports have demonstrated that nitrate leaching is most likely to occur following a heavy precipitation event wang et al 2014 the contribution of this precipitation to the aquifer recharge is greater and thus soil water leaching is more likely to occur poch massegú et al 2014 xia et al 2018 also showed high rainfall during summer fallow increased no3 n leaching in the loess plateau dryland therefore the rainy season is the key period for control of non point pollution in open field cropland rainfall s effects on the amount of leachate also were related to climate many scientific results have shown that nitrate leaching in wet years was significantly greater than that in a dry or normal year wang et al 2014 in humid or semi humid regions the rainy season is the key period that controls soil water leaching however in the semi arid lands water deficit arises from many factors such as low rainfall and uneven distribution and is the major factor limiting crop production where precipitation might not be the key factor for soil water leaching remarkably under the same amount of precipitation the amount of soil water leachate is higher in irrigated cropland than in rain fed cropland additionally even with the low rainfall in semi arid areas the amount of soil water leachate is higher than that in semi humid areas for the former is irrigated cropland such as gsl in study therefore irrigation also has significant effects on soil water leaching in open field cropland especially in semi arid areas irrigation increases the amount of subsurface drainage which is the dynamic factor in nitrogen leaching there are three types of irrigation patterns in study such as flood irrigation border irrigation and drip irrigation results showed leaching happened in the first two irrigation patterns while no leaching in the last currently drip irrigation is an irrigation fertilization method accepted widely to improve the efficiency of water and n use and minimize nitrate leaching that are possible because of its advantages in precise amounts of application and location throughout the field bar yosef et al 2001 antony and singandhupe 2004 however some scientific reports have shown that leaching also occurred with drip irrigation chen et al 2018 in study the amount of irrigation was less than 30 mm on average with the drip irrigation nevertheless with flood and border patterns irrigation amounts were in excess of 70 mm tarkalson et al 2006 concluded that the use of adequate irrigation scheduling techniques can decrease deep percolation and the frequency and scheduling of irrigation affects nitrate n leaching klocke et al 1996 barton and colmer 2006 also showed that irrigation efficiency affects nue nitrogen use efficiency strongly the amount of irrigation is the key factor that affects soil water leaching in farmland and then it is effective to adopt the water saving irrigation pattern to control nitrate leaching in study water saving irrigation reduced 45 9 of the amount of leachate compared to conventional irrigation furthermore water saving irrigation was the most effective way to reduce effects of fertilization on nitrate leaching in soil that is consistent with pang and letey 1998 who found that the factors affecting the risk of nitrate leaching were in the order of irrigation schedule nitrogen application rate besides precipitation and irrigation there are some factors for soil water leaching the amount of leachate in bjl04 was higher than that in sdl with the same amount of irrigation under border irrigation pattern which is related to soil texture the sandy soil in bjl04 has a lower water holding capacity and a higher water conductivity which requires heavy irrigation and leads to rapid water drainage and soil water leaching paramasivam et al 2000 cameira et al 2007 hu et al 2008 additionally climate or seasonal variability are also important factors for soil water leaching amounts of irrigation and soil water leaching in ws season were higher than that in aw season the uniformity of the drip system had a more significant effect on nitrate leaching during dry seasons than during normal and wet seasons wang et al 2014 5 conclusions four year field experiments were conducted at 9 sites to study the effects of rainfall and irrigation on soil water leaching at a depth of 90 cm in intensive croplands in northern china where uneven irrigation has been applied coupled with a broad spectrum of climatic conditions the results indicated that the annual amounts of soil water leachate ranged from 8 6 to 981 mm in these croplands there were significant differences in the amount of leachate between open fields and greenhouse vegetables which were 517 05 mm in greenhouse vegetables 53 36 mm in open field vegetables and 29 92 mm in grain croplands averagely precipitation and irrigation dominate soil water leaching in this region which is related to climate conditions tillage and water management in the fields in open field croplands the rainy season is the key period for soil water leaching especially in humid or semi humid areas however in arid or semi arid regions irrigation play important role in soil water leaching in greenhouse vegetable croplands the irrigation pattern is a significant factor on soil water leaching no leaching occurred with drip irrigation while there was significant leaching with border irrigation especially in the winter spring season the reason for this is the difference in irrigation volumes for the amount of drip irrigation was 62 74 less than that one of border irrigation water saving irrigation reduced soil water leaching significantly and fertilization s effects on nitrogen leaching were not significant under water saving irrigation control the study showed that it was necessary to strengthen the control of non point pollution in rainy seasons adopt effective irrigation pattern and reduce irrigation volume to reduce soil water leaching acknowledgements this work

three studies involving 9 field sites in northern china were conducted from 2008 to 2011 fig 1 table 1 shows the patterns of planting and irrigation soil and texture and mean annual precipitation and temperature on field sites the studies were as follows 2 1 1 study of rainfall and irrigation s effects on soil water leaching in open field croplands these experiments were conducted at six open cropland fields bjl01 bjl02 gsl hel snl and jll fig 1 and the amounts of rainfall irrigation and leachate at every site were monitored to study the effects of rainfall and irrigation on soil water leaching in these croplands 2 1 2 study on the effects of irrigation pattern on soil water leaching experiments were conducted at greenhouse vegetable field sdl fig 1 where two irrigation treatments border irrigation m1 and drip irrigation m2 were carried out to compare their effects on soil water leaching irrigation amounts are shown in table 2 crop species in the experiment were greenhouse cucumber cultivated two times a year ws winter spring season from jan to jun and aw autumn winter season from oct to dec soil water leachate irrigation amount each time and annual irrigation amount were monitored to study irrigation methods effects on soil water leaching in addition the study also was carried out in bjl03 which is under drip irrigation 2 1 3 study on the effects of water saving irrigation on soil water leaching these studies were conducted in bjl04 which is an organic vegetable production base in beijing two irrigation treatments with the border method w1 water saving irrigation and w2 conventional irrigation were designed to study water saving irrigation s effects on soil water leaching the amount of irrigation during every crop season is shown in table 3 three nitrogen levels were applied for each irrigation treatment n0 no n fertilizer n1 optimized n fertilizer and n2 conventional n fertilizer all fertilizers were applied once with organic n fertilizer and no dressing 2 1 4 sampling and laboratory analysis rainfall data were obtained from a meteorological station located approximately 200 m from the field site in every experimental plot leached water was collected in leaching trays 0 5 m 0 4 m buried 90 cm deep with pvc tube referred to as technical specification for leaching monitoring wu et al 2014 leachates were collected within 48 to 96 h after irrigation or rainfall and their volume was recorded nitrate concentration in leachate was detected with continuous flow analysis flastar5000 after filtration 2 2 statistical analyses soil water leaching and water loss rate formula 1 data were subjected to analysis of variance one way anova to determine the significance of the difference between treatments the tukey multiple comparison test to determine the differences among individual treatments and correlation analysis to test the effects of the influencing factors all analyses were conducted in the software r with the psych revelle 2016 and agricolae mendiburu 2013 packages at alpha 0 05 water loss rates water loss amount irrigation amount 100 formula 1 3 analysis and results 3 1 rainfall season is the key period for soil water leaching in open field cropland the amounts of rainfall and leachate differed among six sites the range of rainfall from 2008 to 2011 in bjl01 bjl02 gsl hel snl and jll were 0 2 49 1 0 76 127 56 1 1 29 7 4 1 76 9 1 31 213 62 and 1 2 79 2 mm respectively the total amount of rainfall in 4 years was 1211 6 1346 06 490 7 1791 8 2379 87 and 1198 mm respectively monthly rainfall in the six open field sites is shown in fig 2 indicating that rainfall concentrated largely from jun to sept and accounting for 72 7 of the annual amounts of rainfall correspondingly leaching also occurred from jun to sept and the amounts of leachate in bjl01 bjl02 gsl hel snl and jll were 38 9 59 5 40 2 11 1 7 5 and 14 5 mm respectively accounting for 73 0 90 1 81 4 100 87 1 and 100 of the annual amounts of leachate respectively this indicated that the rainy season was the key period for soil water leaching in open field cropland amounts of leachate were correlated with rainfall p 0 05 indicating that soil water leaching was highly consistent with rainfall in open field cropland in northern china 3 2 irrigation has significant effects on soil water leaching in open field cropland in the six open field sites soil water leaching was correlated highly with rainfall however two sites gsl and jll differed from the others the amounts of leachate were significantly higher at the gsl site than at hel snl and jll although with relatively lower rainfall amounts than the latter three in addition the rainfall at jll was 594 8 mm similar to the other sites bjl01 bjl02 hel and snl while the amounts of leachate were lower than those at the latter four sites fig 2 this phenomenon may be caused by irrigation the mean amounts of irrigation in gsl hel snl jll and bjl02 from 2008 to 2011 were 233 38 156 0 and 270 mm respectively field gsl is located in an arid area with less rainfall and the soil type is irrigated desert soil table 1 which requires heavy irrigation for open field cropland and increases the amounts of soil water leaching inevitably however in jll where agriculture is rainfed with no irrigation the amounts of soil water leaching were lower than those at the other sites in a semi humid region with irrigated cropland 3 3 soil water leaching is related to irrigation pattern in sdl the annual amounts of border irrigation from 2008 to 2011 were 1469 2035 1807 and 1143 mm while amounts of drip irrigation were 648 741 652 and 723 mm respectively the mean irrigation volumes with border and drip irrigation were 74 7 and 33 0 mm respectively table 2 the latter reduced the amount of water 62 74 compared to the former most notably there was no leaching with the drip irrigation treatment however the amounts of leachate with border irrigation ranged from 241 68 to 568 35 mm in one year table 4 during the study period there were 75 incidents of leaching with border irrigation and the mean irrigation amount each time was 79 3 mm while the water loss rate was 19 18 in the ws season from jan to jun in particular leaching frequency mean irrigation amounts at a single time and water loss rate were all higher than those in the aw season from oct to dec monthly amounts of irrigation and leachate at sdl are shown in fig 3 which also shows that the mean amount of irrigation in the ws season was higher than that in the aw season correspondingly the leachate amount in the ws season also was higher than in the aw season correlation analysis demonstrated that there was a significant relation between irrigation and leaching in which r2 was 0 44 which is highly significant further the study at bjl03 showed that no leaching occurred in drip irrigation thus we can conclude that the irrigation pattern has significant effects on soil water leaching and the occurrence of leaching may depend on the irrigation volume 3 4 water saving irrigation reduces soil water leaching in bjl04 w1 treatment water saving irrigation decreased the amount of irrigation by approximately 29 3 compared to w2 conventional irrigation thereby saving about 1407 1 mm of water per crop season correspondingly the cumulative amount of leachate in the w2 and w1 treatments in the four years was 450 4 and 243 6 mm respectively and the w1 treatment water saving irrigation reduced the amounts of leachate by 45 9 fig 4 correlation analysis showed that the amount of leachate was correlated significantly with the amount of irrigation the effects of water saving irrigation on nitrogen leaching also were significant fig 5 shows that the total nitrogen loss with the w1 treatment was only 89 2kg hm 2 about 55 7 reduction compared to the w2 treatment correlation analysis also indicated that nitrogen loss was correlated with the amount of irrigation remarkably the tukey multiple comparison test demonstrated that the fertilizer treatments that accompanied w2 irrigation differed significantly p 0 05 while no differences were found with w1 irrigation further the effects of fertilization on nitrogen leaching were not significant with the water saving irrigation treatment indicating that the effects of irrigation on leaching are greater than those of fertilization 4 discussion open field and greenhouse croplands are the primary types of intensive croplands in northern china however the amount of soil water leaching in these croplands is different in study the highest annual average amounts of leachate were found in greenhouse vegetables about 517 05 mm followed by open field vegetables 53 36 mm and grain croplands 29 92 mm soil water leaching in greenhouse cropland is more serious than in open field croplands as some scientific reports showed there were higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater under greenhouse cultivation than in other croplands zhao et al 2007 high nitrogen fertilization and heavy irrigation are common practices in managing greenhouse vegetables to ensure high yields agostini et al 2010 in study the annual amount of irrigation in greenhouse cropland ranged from 1143 to 12 383 mm while from 38 to 230 mm in open field cropland precipitation might be a significant factor that affects nitrate leaching in open field in northern china where approximately 72 7 of annual rainfall is concentrated from june to september and the amount of leachate was 88 6 of the annual amounts during this period many reports have demonstrated that nitrate leaching is most likely to occur following a heavy precipitation event wang et al 2014 the contribution of this precipitation to the aquifer recharge is greater and thus soil water leaching is more likely to occur poch massegú et al 2014 xia et al 2018 also showed high rainfall during summer fallow increased no3 n leaching in the loess plateau dryland therefore the rainy season is the key period for control of non point pollution in open field cropland rainfall s effects on the amount of leachate also were related to climate many scientific results have shown that nitrate leaching in wet years was significantly greater than that in a dry or normal year wang et al 2014 in humid or semi humid regions the rainy season is the key period that controls soil water leaching however in the semi arid lands water deficit arises from many factors such as low rainfall and uneven distribution and is the major factor limiting crop production where precipitation might not be the key factor for soil water leaching remarkably under the same amount of precipitation the amount of soil water leachate is higher in irrigated cropland than in rain fed cropland additionally even with the low rainfall in semi arid areas the amount of soil water leachate is higher than that in semi humid areas for the former is irrigated cropland such as gsl in study therefore irrigation also has significant effects on soil water leaching in open field cropland especially in semi arid areas irrigation increases the amount of subsurface drainage which is the dynamic factor in nitrogen leaching there are three types of irrigation patterns in study such as flood irrigation border irrigation and drip irrigation results showed leaching happened in the first two irrigation patterns while no leaching in the last currently drip irrigation is an irrigation fertilization method accepted widely to improve the efficiency of water and n use and minimize nitrate leaching that are possible because of its advantages in precise amounts of application and location throughout the field bar yosef et al 2001 antony and singandhupe 2004 however some scientific reports have shown that leaching also occurred with drip irrigation chen et al 2018 in study the amount of irrigation was less than 30 mm on average with the drip irrigation nevertheless with flood and border patterns irrigation amounts were in excess of 70 mm tarkalson et al 2006 concluded that the use of adequate irrigation scheduling techniques can decrease deep percolation and the frequency and scheduling of irrigation affects nitrate n leaching klocke et al 1996 barton and colmer 2006 also showed that irrigation efficiency affects nue nitrogen use efficiency strongly the amount of irrigation is the key factor that affects soil water leaching in farmland and then it is effective to adopt the water saving irrigation pattern to control nitrate leaching in study water saving irrigation reduced 45 9 of the amount of leachate compared to conventional irrigation furthermore water saving irrigation was the most effective way to reduce effects of fertilization on nitrate leaching in soil that is consistent with pang and letey 1998 who found that the factors affecting the risk of nitrate leaching were in the order of irrigation schedule nitrogen application rate besides precipitation and irrigation there are some factors for soil water leaching the amount of leachate in bjl04 was higher than that in sdl with the same amount of irrigation under border irrigation pattern which is related to soil texture the sandy soil in bjl04 has a lower water holding capacity and a higher water conductivity which requires heavy irrigation and leads to rapid water drainage and soil water leaching paramasivam et al 2000 cameira et al 2007 hu et al 2008 additionally climate or seasonal variability are also important factors for soil water leaching amounts of irrigation and soil water leaching in ws season were higher than that in aw season the uniformity of the drip system had a more significant effect on nitrate leaching during dry seasons than during normal and wet seasons wang et al 2014 5 conclusions four year field experiments were conducted at 9 sites to study the effects of rainfall and irrigation on soil water leaching at a depth of 90 cm in intensive croplands in northern china where uneven irrigation has been applied coupled with a broad spectrum of climatic conditions the results indicated that the annual amounts of soil water leachate ranged from 8 6 to 981 mm in these croplands there were significant differences in the amount of leachate between open fields and greenhouse vegetables which were 517 05 mm in greenhouse vegetables 53 36 mm in open field vegetables and 29 92 mm in grain croplands averagely precipitation and irrigation dominate soil water leaching in this region which is related to climate conditions tillage and water management in the fields in open field croplands the rainy season is the key period for soil water leaching especially in humid or semi humid areas however in arid or semi arid regions irrigation play important role in soil water leaching in greenhouse vegetable croplands the irrigation pattern is a significant factor on soil water leaching no leaching occurred with drip irrigation while there was significant leaching with border irrigation especially in the winter spring season the reason for this is the difference in irrigation volumes for the amount of drip irrigation was 62 74 less than that one of border irrigation water saving irrigation reduced soil water leaching significantly and fertilization s effects on nitrogen leaching were not significant under water saving irrigation control the study showed that it was necessary to strengthen the control of non point pollution in rainy seasons adopt effective irrigation pattern and reduce irrigation volume to reduce soil water leaching acknowledgements this work
