2175,this paper proposed a model for solute transport in a large strain aquitard coupling effects of diffusion adsorption and consolidation processes the analytical solutions describing the drawdown and solute transport in the aquitard were derived under the condition of variable drawdowns in adjacent confined aquifer the breakthrough time bts of solute transport in the large strain aquitard ld model was analyzed and compared with that of the rigid porous medium nd model before consolidation and the equivalent rigid porous medium nd f model at end of the consolidation respectively results reveal that greater darcy flow velocity stronger solute diffusivity and weaker adsorption of soil particles result in shorter bts of solute transport in the large strain aquitard and the impacts of specific storage and void ratio on the bts are influenced by the adsorption of soil particles compared with the nd model the delayed drainage accelerates solute transport with weak adsorption while it has the opposite effect with strong adsorption bts predicted by the ld model is always smaller than that of the nd f model it is also found that the larger leakage coefficient of the aquitard significantly enlarges the difference of bts between the nd f and ld models δ t and the consolidation factor of the aquitard is positively correlated with the δ t the ratio of δ t over the bts of the ld model has a linear positive relationship with the average cumulative water release of the per unit volume aquitard under the fixed drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer keywords large strain aquitard solute transport analytical solution parameters sensitivity analysis groundwater pollution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction aquitards are typically composed of clay and silt which is widely distributed in multi layer aquifer system in alluvial plains or entire basins konikow and neuzil 2007 zhang et al 2013 and they usually act as the natural hydrogeological barriers to protect regional aquifers from pollution yan et al 2001 zhuang et al 2015 in addition the aquitards such as natural clayey deposits or compacted clay are most widely used as bottom liners of landfills worldwide xie et al 2016 however aquitards also may act as a long term contamination source to their adjacent aquifers due its high porosity and low permeability hendry et al 2004 li et al 2017 liu and ball 2002 which will cause obstacles in groundwater management and remediation li et al 2021 in short aquitard plays a significant role in controlling fluid flow and solute transport processes in aquifer aquitard systems the mass exchange in the aquifer aquitard system is an important process impacting water flow and solute transport li et al 2021 when a contaminant in an aquifer contacts a clean aquitard a concentration gradient exists across the aquifer aquitard interface and molecular diffusion will drive the solute into the aquitard zhan et al 2009 aquitards with high compressibility are prone to consolidation under the surcharge load or decreasing hydraulic head which can cause pore water flow which will be another important mechanism for solute transport in the aquitard li et al 2017 xie and leo 2004 xue et al 2005 the effect of delayed drainage during the consolidation process of the aquitards on the solute transport process cannot be ignored while studying solute transport in aquitards aquitard consolidation plays a significant impact on contaminant breakthrough time mass flux cumulative mass outflow and concentration distribution and these effects last long after consolidation has been completed pu et al 2021 therefore solute transport in the aquitard should consider deformation zhang et al 2013 smith 2000 proposed a mathematical model for solute transport in saturated porous media undergoing a one dimensional small strain consolidation and obtained its analytical solution under a quasi steady state alshawabkeh et al 2005 proposed a solute transport model on the basis of the terzaghi consolidation theory and concluded that advection generated by consolidation would accelerate solute transport yan et al 2020a found that the performance of the composite liner system would be significantly reduced due to clay consolidation while studying the quasi steady state small deformation model with an analytical solution the above mentioned studies have focused on solute transport in a deformed porous medium undergoing small strain consolidation large strain consolidation usually occurs while the soil layer with large porosity e g spatially the newly formed sedimentary soft soil under the condition of large load or hydraulic head decline the one dimensional large consolidation deformation theory proposed by gibson et al 1967 is widely used in the study of large strain consolidation over the last 20 years some researchers carried out studies on solute transport in a deformed clay liner undergoing large strain consolidation lewis et al 2009 described a solute transport model in a large deformed landfill clay liner and showed that the strongest reduction in breakthrough time of solute transport is more prone to occur in the highly compressible liner pu and fox 2016 developed a piecewise liner model that considered one dimensional large strain consolidation and solute transport in layered soils and found that pre consolidation plays an important role in settlement and solute transport the advection dispersion equation is frequently used to describe solute transport and it is usually solved by numerical or analytical methods almeida and cotta 1995 ramírez sabag and lópez falcón 2021 the generalized integral method gitt is widely used for solving linear heat transfer and mass diffusion problems specifically it facilitates the construction of an integral transform pair that can be mathematically manipulated with relative ease cotta 1993 mikhailov and özişik 1984 liu et al 1998 used the gitt to solve the analytical solution of the one dimensional solute advection dispersion equation in a multilayer porous media liu et al 2000 further developed the method of liu et al 1998 introducing in detail how to use the gitt to solve the analytical solution of one dimensional solute transport in heterogeneous porous media approximately multilayer guerrero et al 2009 developed a one dimensional analytical solution for multi species transport for finite porous media and constant boundary conditions using the gitt yan et al 2021 used the gitt to solve the analytical solution of solute transport in the clay barrier under the condition of constant overlying load in which the model considered clay consolidation diffusion and solute adsorption suk 2016 developed a semi analytical procedure using the gitt to solve the coupled multispecies reactive solute transport equations which overcomes the limitation of identical retardation values suk et al 2022 introduced a new semi analytical solution using gitt to describe solute transport induced by an injection well with a constant injection rate in spatially and temporally variable flow groundwater leakage usually occurs in an aquifer aquitard system when a hydraulic gradient develops in the system and it tends to cause deformation and water release of the adjacent aquitard ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 shi et al 2011 wang and zhan 2013 li et al 2017 proposed a view that delayed drainage extends the breakthrough time of solute transport in the aquitard undergoing small deformation li et al 2019 found that increasing the deformation of the aquitard and decreasing hydraulic conductivity will increase the impact of delayed drainage on solute transport in the aquitard to the knowledge of the authors no analytical solution has been presented which considers the combined processes of solute transport and delayed drainage in a large deformed aquitard based on the premise of the one dimensional consolidation theory for large strain aquitard developed by li et al 2018 and the governing equation of solute transport in a one dimensional deformed porous medium proposed by peters and smith 2002 this study first establishes the mathematical model for solute transport in a large strain aquitard affected by a delayed drainage ld model secondly an analytical solution for drawdown variation in the aquitard under variable drawdowns in adjacent confined aquifer and an analytical solution describing the solute concentration variation in the large strain aquitard is derived under the condition of variable solute concentration in the unconfined aquifer third the effect of delayed drainage on solute transport in a large strain aquitard is studied and factors that control solute transport are explored by parametric sensitivity analysis 2 mathematical model the model studied in this paper is a multi layer aquifer system with infinite lateral extent unconfined aquifer aquitard confined aquifer which is shown in fig 1 in the lagrangian coordinate system the vertical downward direction is taken as the positive direction of a l and the origin is located at the top of the aquitard the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is generally smaller than that of the aquifer by at least two orders of magnitude therefore it is reasonable to assume that the water flow in the aquitard is vertically moving neuman and gardner 1989 neuman and witherspoon 1969 2 1 governing equations the governing equation for aquitard consolidation is derived from mass conservation principles and the effective stress principle it is assumed that the aquitard is homogeneous at the initial time namely the initial void ratio is constant in the aquitard and there is no consideration of the self weight of soil secondly the water flow conforms to darcy s law thirdly the pore water and soil particles cannot be compressed and the deformation of the aquitard which is not affected by the concentration field equals the cumulative water release from the per unit area of the aquitard the governing equation for aquitard consolidation with drawdown s as the control variable is developed by li et al 2018 that is 1 c v 0 2 s a 2 s s s a 2 s t where t is time c v 0 k v 0 s s is the consolidation coefficient of the large strain aquitard k v k v 0 1 e 2 1 e 0 2 is the hydraulic conductivity which decreases with a decreasing void ratio e during the consolidation process of the large strain aquitard s s 1 1 e d e d s is the specific storage of the aquitard which is constant k v 0 is the initial hydraulic conductivity e and e 0 are the void ratio and the initial void ratio respectively the governing equation for solute transport in a deformed clay layer is derived by assuming that the mass transfer in the solid phase and fluid phase follows the mass conservation principle the governing equations of solute transport in a large strain aquitard undergoing one dimensional consolidation in terms of lagrangian coordinates a t have been derived by peters and smith 2002 given as 2 a de 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v c a e 1 e 0 c t 1 1 e 0 c s t where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient which is the sum of the effective diffusion coefficient and the mechanical dispersion coefficient and it is assumed to be constant during the consolidation process of the aquitard lewis et al 2009 li et al 2019 li et al 2017 c is the solute concentration in the pore water of the aquitard c s is the solute concentration adsorbed on solid particles and v is the darcy flow velocity in the aquitard to solve eq 2 the constitutive relationship between the constitutive relationship between c s and c needs to be clarified it is assumed that adsorption is a linear and equilibrium process which holds at relatively low concentrations yan et al 2020b 3 c s ρ s k d c where ρ s is a solid density and k d is the partition coefficient substituting eq 3 into eq 2 leads to 4 a de 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v c a e ρ s k d 1 e 0 c t eq 4 is the governing equation of solute transport in a deformed aquitard undergoing consolidation with linear isothermal adsorption 2 2 initial and boundary conditions initially the drawdown is zero in the aquitard and the solute concentration in the aquitard is zero too therefore the initial conditions of drawdown and solute concentration distribution in the aquitard are assumed as follows 5 s a 0 0 0 a l 6 c a 0 0 0 a l the shallow unconfined aquifer can be recharged by atmospheric precipitation and surface water it is assumed that the hydraulic head does not change in the unconfined aquifer the pollution of unconfined aquifer at some locations are worsening due to increasingly frequent human activities and the solute concentration is assumed to be variable with time 7 s 0 t 0 t 0 8 c 0 t f t t 0 where f t is the solute concentration in the unconfined aquifer and it variates with time the hydraulic head is assumed to decline with time in the confined aquifer underlying the aquitard due to groundwater exploitation because the deep confined aquifer is in a free drainage state contaminated water follows the hydraulic gradient from the unconfined aquifer through the aquitard and then to the underlying confined aquifer the boundary condition is the danckwert s condition at the outlet danckwerts 1953 which leads to a mass conservation boundary condition based on the above assumptions the lower boundary conditions for consolidation and solute transport can be obtained as follows 9 s l t g t t 0 10 c l t a 0 t 0 where g t is the drawdown variation in the underlying confined aquifer and it is assumed to be increasing with time 3 analytical solutions 3 1 analytical solution of consolidation the analytical solutions describing the variation of drawdown void ratio and darcy flow velocity at position a and at time t in the aquitard undergoing large strain consolidation can be obtained by the variable transformation and variable separation method appendix a and thus 11 s a t 1 s s ln 1 n 1 2 1 n n π e n 2 π 2 c v 0 t l 2 e s s g 0 1 0 t s s e s s g τ d g τ d τ e n 2 π 2 c v 0 τ l 2 d τ s i

governing equation of solute transport in the aquitard undergoing large strain consolidation the analytical solutions describing the variation of solute concentration in the aquitard undergoing large

30 terms of n and r values respectively are required to compute the series solution liu et al 2000 4 model comparison and verification in this section the analytical solutions of consolidation and solute transport in the large strain aquitard were analyzed and the numerical method of the explicit finite difference scheme was used to verify the accuracy of the analytical solutions of consolidation and solute transport respectively in the case study the drawdown variation in the underlying confined aquifer is assumed to be g t φ l n 1 t and the contaminant concentration in the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be f t c 0 2 e t the hydraulic parameters are referring to the land subsidence study of xie and leo 2004 lewis et al 2009 and zhuang et al 2015 the dispersion coefficient is in the light of the study of solute transport in composite liners by foose et al 2002 lewis et al 2009 and takeda et al 2014 table 1 summarizes consolidation and solute transport input parameters in the aquitard for facilitating the comparison breakthrough times of the predicted solute transport bts is defined as the time at which the solute reaches a predetermined concentration of 0 01 c 0 in this study 4 1 consolidation of the aquitard the variation of s e and v in the large strain aquitard at different times t 1 3 5 15 20 years and different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m are calculated using eqs 11 12 and 13 respectively fig 2 and the results are compared with the numerical solution in fig 2a and 2b s increases significantly initially due to quick pore water releases and it almost increases linear with the coordinate a after t 20 years at t 20 years s values are 1 198 3 647 6 185 8 831 and 11 603 m while a 1 3 5 7 9 m respectively the variation rate of s is large at the beginning and it slows down while the drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer increases slowly as shown in fig 2c and 2d e decreases significantly at initial stage of consolidation and the change rate increases with the increasing a the variation rate of e at different positions increases slowly and synchronously as the drawdown increases slowly in the underlying confined aquifer at t 20 years e decreases linear with a and values are 0 976 0 928 0 880 0 831 0 781 for a 1 3 5 7 9 m respectively fig 2e and 2f show that v is much smaller at the upper part of the aquitard than at the lower part during initial consolidation as consolidation progresses v at the top of the aquitard gradually increases and v at the bottom increases first and then decreases with a large change rate the v in the whole section of the aquitard tends to be the same and increases slowly reaching about 0 038 m year at t 20 years in short the proposed analytical solution is in good agreement with the numerical solution and the behavior of s e and v in the aquitard is affected by consolidation and drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer 4 2 solute transport in the aquitard to validate the accuracy of the analytical solution proposed in this study for solute transport in the large strain aquitard a numerical method previously used by li et al 2019 is adopted and solved using the finite difference method fig 3 fig 3a shows the variation of solute concentration at the middle and bottom of the aquitard a 5 m a 10 m of which the bts are 37 60 and 76 00 years respectively the bts predicted by numerical solution are 37 58 and 76 01 respectively indicating good agreement with the analytical solution fig 3b shows the distribution of solute concentrations in the aquitard at t 50 years and t 100 years respectively at a 5 and a 10 m the ratio of solute concentration to initial solute concentration c c 0 are 0 240 and 0 at 50 years respectively and 1 979 and 0 617 at 100 years the c c 0 predicted by numerical solution are 0 241 and 0 at 50 years respectively and 1 981 and 0 615 at 100 years which is consistent with the analytical solution 5 parametric sensitivity analysis in order to study the effect of consolidation on solute transport in large strain aquitard we conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis of bts by varying partitioning coefficient thickness of aquitard drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer initial hydraulic conductivity specific storage hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and initial void ratio values one at a time based on the values provided in the above case study for making the analysis to be simpler it is assumed the hydraulic head decline in the underlying confined aquifer and the solute concentration in the unconfined aquifer to be constant namely s l t φ and c 0 t c 0 to clarify the effect of delayed drainage on solute transport in a large strain aquitard ld model another two cases were proposed rigid porous medium nd model and equivalent rigid porous medium nd f model and the bts predicted by the ld nd and nd f models are defined as t ld t nd and t nd f respectively the darcy flow velocity and the void ratio will not change with time and position in the two models the hydraulic conductivities in the nd and nd f models are equal to those of the aquitard at initial time and at the end of consolidation respectively and the void ratio in the two models is equal to that of the aquitard at initial time thus the governing equation for solute transport for the nd and nd f models can be obtained by simplifying eq 4 that is 15 e 1 e a d c a v d c a e ρ s k d 1 e c t where the v d and e are the darcy flow velocity and void ratio of the aquitard respectively and they are both constants in the nd model and nd f model 5 1 comparison with a rigid porous medium fig 4 reveals the effect of the partitioning coefficients on breakthrough curves predicted by ld and nd models at a 10 m the results indicate that the strong adsorption will significantly extend the solute transit time the bts predicted by the ld model t ld 96 7 years is 5 6 years shorter than that of nd model t nd 102 3 years without considering the adsorption of soil particles the bts determined by the ld and nd models are 154 and 157 6 years respectively for k d 0 2 ml g and they are 240 1 and 240 years respectively for k d 0 5 ml g solute transport predicted by the ld model is found to be slower than that predicted by the nd model at a relatively larger k d value about k d 0 5 ml g and bts determined by the ld and nd models are 383 8 and 378 4 years respectively for k d 1 ml g the impacts of φ and l on the solute transport in the aquitard undergoing delayed drainage are shown in fig 5 a k d 0 ml g and fig 5b k d 1 ml g while the other parameters are kept to be the same as those given in table 1 results in fig 5 show that φ and l play a strong role on the bts predicted by the ld model and bts increases with decreasing φ and increasing l while l 10 m and k d 0 ml g bts are 96 7 and 53 years at φ 10 20 m respectively fig 5a the larger φ and smaller l lead to a larger darcy flow velocity which accelerates bts in the aquitard the difference of bts between nd and ld models increases with decreasing φ and increasing l resulting in 5 7 years l 10 φ 10 m 5 5 years l 10 φ 20 m 23 years l 20 φ 10 m and 22 2 years l 20 φ 20 m respectively while k d 0 ml g while k d 1 ml g fig 5b the difference of bts between nd and ld models increases with increasing φ and l resulting in 5 5 years l 10 φ 10 m 8 years l 10 φ 20 m 20 3 years l 20 φ 10 m and 30 9 years l 20 φ 20 m respectively fig 6 shows the impact of k v 0 and s s on the solute transport in the aquitard provided that k d 0 ml g fig 6a and k d 1 ml g fig 6b with the other parameters kept to be the same as those given in table 1 results in fig 6a reveal that the bts determined by the ld model decreases with an increasing k v 0 while s s 0 01 the bts are 96 7 and 39 3 years at k v 0 0 0315 and 0 0946 m year respectively without considering adsorption it is also found that a larger s s value leads to shorter bts for the ld model while k v 0 0 0315 the bts are 96 7 and 88 5 years at s s 0 01 and 0 03 m 1 respectively the s s has the opposite effect on the bts of the ld model while k d 1 ml g fig 6b the results in fig 6b of which the starting point of abscissa is not set to be zero for a clear comparison shows that the bts are 383 9 and 397 4 years at s s 0 01 and 0 03 m 1 respectively while k v 0 0 0315 m year the larger k v 0 and smaller s s leads to a larger darcy flow velocity which accelerates solute transport in the aquitard the difference of bts between the ld and nd models increases with an increasing s s and decreasing k v 0 and they are 5 7 years k v 0 0 0315 m year s s 0 01 m 1 2 1 years k v 0 0 0946 m year s s 0 01 m 1 13 8 years k v 0 0 0315 m year s s 0 03 m 1 and 4 8 years k v 0 0 0946 m year s s 0 03 m 1 respectively while k d 0 ml g the same relationship exists while k d 1 ml g fig 6b the impact of d and e 0 on the bts in the aquitard determined by the ld and nd models are shown in fig 7 a k d 0 ml g and fig 7b k d 1 ml g while the other parameters are kept to be the same as those given in table 1 results in fig 7 reveal that the larger value of d shortens the bts of the ld model while e 0 1 the bts of the ld model are 96 7 and 68 6 years at d 0 01 and 0 03 m2 year respectively fig 7a it is also found that a larger e 0 leads to longer bts for the ld model while d 0 01 m2 year the bts are 94 and 122 1 years at e 0 1 and 2 respectively the e 0 has the opposite effect on the bts of the ld model while k d 1 ml g fig 7b results in fig 7b of which the starting point of abscissa is not set to be zero for a clear comparison show that the bts are 383 9 and 298 9 years at e 0 1 and 2 respectively while d 0 01 m2 year the larger d namely stronger hydrodynamic dispersion accelerates solute transport in the aquitard the e 0 which affects the delay index with adsorption plays different roles on bts the difference of bts between the ld and nd models increases with a decreasing e 0 and d without considering the adsorption while k d 1 ml g the difference increases with decreases of e 0 under the condition of weak hydrodynamic dispersion and it is opposite under strong hydrodynamic dispersion while under the small void ratio of aquitard the difference increases with decreases of d otherwise it increases with increases of d while k d 1 ml g 5 2 comparison with equivalent rigid porous medium in this section the difference of bts between ld and nd f models δ t t nd f t ld is evaluated and the relationships between δ t and leakage coefficient σ k v 0 l and consolidation factor δ l 2 c v 0 of the aquitard are analyzed respectively fig 8 reveals that the bts of the nd f model are always longer than that of the ld model and δ t tends to increase with a decreasing value of σ it can be seen that the δ t increases with an increasing φ and s s while a larger value of σ weakens the impact of s s and φ on δ t the δ t are 9 7 18 6 and 26 7 years for s s 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 m 1 respectively with σ 0 00315 years while σ 0 0189 years they are 0 9 1 8 and 2 8 years respectively fig 8a the δ t are 7 8 9 7 and 10 4 years for φ 5 10 15 m respectively with σ 0 00315 years and they are 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 years for σ 0 0189 years fig 8b results reveal that the value of k d and e 0 slightly impact on the relationship between σ and δ t in other words the adsorption of soil particles and void ratio of the aquitard have slight effects on the value of δ t fig 8c and 8d the relationship between δ and δ t is shown in fig 9 and the impacts of four parameters e 0 φ d and k d on the relationship between δ and δ t are analyzed results indicate that δ t increases linearly with an increasing δ which means that the increasing values of l and s s and a decreasing value of k v 0 enlarge the value of δ t it is also found that the larger value of δ increases the impact of these four parameters e 0 φ d and k d on δ t and the larger values of φ e 0 and smaller values of d and k d tend to result in a greater δ t among them the impact of hydrodynamic dispersion on the δ t is the greatest and the impact of adsorption is the least in particular the ratios of δ t on δ are about 0 287 0 199 and 0 154 for corresponding d 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 m2 year respectively fig 9c and they are 0 277 0 285 and 0 281 for k d 0 0 2 and 1 ml g respectively fig 9d for further analysis the ratio ε of δ t over t ld has been obtained and the relationships between s s φ and ε are presented in fig 10 a and 10b it indicates that larger values of φ and s s result in larger ε which all follow positive linear correlation respectively in other words increasing φ and s s tend to enlarge the difference of bts between ld and nd f models the larger s s and φ lead to a greater slope of positive linear correlation the proportions of the ε to the φ are 0 006 0 012 and 0 016 for s s 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 m 1 respectively fig 10a and the proportions of ε to s s are 3 16 5 91 and 8 25 for φ 5 10 and 15 m respectively fig 10b the cumulative water released from the aquitard is q c v 0 1 e s s φ l at the end of consolidation li et al 2018 to clarify the relationship between q and bts of the ld model the relationship between the average cumulative water release per unit volume aquitard q l and ε at different e 0 and d values are shown in fig 10c and fig 10d results show that q l and ε approximately follow a linear relationship and an increasing q l enlarges the value of ε the relationship between ε and q l is influenced slightly by the value of e 0 and d the proportions of ε to q l are 1 463 1 457 and 1 456 for e 0 0 5 0 75 and 1 respectively fig 10c and they are 1 456 1 411 and 1 382 for d 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 m2 year respectively fig 10d 6 conclusions in this study a mathematical model for solute transport in a large strain aquitard of which self weight of soil particles is ignored is established by coupling the consolidation and delayed drainage processes the analytical solutions of the above mathematical model are derived to study the processes of consolidation and solute transport in the aquitard using the variable transformation and variable separation method and gitt and the accuracy of the analytical solutions are verified using a numerical method the parameter sensitivity of solute transport in the large strain aquitard is discussed by comparing it with the nd and nd f models based on the above research the following conclusions are drawn 1 the bts of solute transport in the aquitard is influenced by many factors among which larger φ k v 0 d and smaller l k d reduce the bts which means that for larger darcy flow stronger solute diffusivity and weaker adsorption of soil particles result in shorter bts of the ld model the larger s s and smaller e 0 will reduce the bts without considering adsorption and the opposite effect will occur when adsorption is considered 2 compared with a rigid porous medium delayed drainage accelerates solute transport when adsorption is weak k d 0 5 ml g and the bts of the ld model is longer than that of nd model when the partitioning coefficient is large k d 0 5 ml g the difference of bts between ld and nd model increases with increasing l s s and decreasing k v 0 3 compared with the equivalent rigid porous medium it is found that decreasing σ and increasing δ significantly enlarge the value of δ t and δ and δ t follow a linear positive correlation the ratio of δ t on δ increases with increasing φ e and with decreasing kd d ε has a linear positive correlation with s s and φ and it also has an obvious linear positive relationship with q l while both e 0 and d play a slight role on the linear relationship the proposed analytical solutions are derived under the assumption of homogeneous with initial void ratio at initial time and they are applicable to the thin aquitard however they would bring great calculation error to study the water flow and solute transport in the thick aquitard undergoing large strain consolidation the research about thick aquitard considering more flexible and practical variation of consolidation parameter and the nonuniformly distributed void ratio caused by soil self weight stress will be studied in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2175,this paper proposed a model for solute transport in a large strain aquitard coupling effects of diffusion adsorption and consolidation processes the analytical solutions describing the drawdown and solute transport in the aquitard were derived under the condition of variable drawdowns in adjacent confined aquifer the breakthrough time bts of solute transport in the large strain aquitard ld model was analyzed and compared with that of the rigid porous medium nd model before consolidation and the equivalent rigid porous medium nd f model at end of the consolidation respectively results reveal that greater darcy flow velocity stronger solute diffusivity and weaker adsorption of soil particles result in shorter bts of solute transport in the large strain aquitard and the impacts of specific storage and void ratio on the bts are influenced by the adsorption of soil particles compared with the nd model the delayed drainage accelerates solute transport with weak adsorption while it has the opposite effect with strong adsorption bts predicted by the ld model is always smaller than that of the nd f model it is also found that the larger leakage coefficient of the aquitard significantly enlarges the difference of bts between the nd f and ld models δ t and the consolidation factor of the aquitard is positively correlated with the δ t the ratio of δ t over the bts of the ld model has a linear positive relationship with the average cumulative water release of the per unit volume aquitard under the fixed drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer keywords large strain aquitard solute transport analytical solution parameters sensitivity analysis groundwater pollution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction aquitards are typically composed of clay and silt which is widely distributed in multi layer aquifer system in alluvial plains or entire basins konikow and neuzil 2007 zhang et al 2013 and they usually act as the natural hydrogeological barriers to protect regional aquifers from pollution yan et al 2001 zhuang et al 2015 in addition the aquitards such as natural clayey deposits or compacted clay are most widely used as bottom liners of landfills worldwide xie et al 2016 however aquitards also may act as a long term contamination source to their adjacent aquifers due its high porosity and low permeability hendry et al 2004 li et al 2017 liu and ball 2002 which will cause obstacles in groundwater management and remediation li et al 2021 in short aquitard plays a significant role in controlling fluid flow and solute transport processes in aquifer aquitard systems the mass exchange in the aquifer aquitard system is an important process impacting water flow and solute transport li et al 2021 when a contaminant in an aquifer contacts a clean aquitard a concentration gradient exists across the aquifer aquitard interface and molecular diffusion will drive the solute into the aquitard zhan et al 2009 aquitards with high compressibility are prone to consolidation under the surcharge load or decreasing hydraulic head which can cause pore water flow which will be another important mechanism for solute transport in the aquitard li et al 2017 xie and leo 2004 xue et al 2005 the effect of delayed drainage during the consolidation process of the aquitards on the solute transport process cannot be ignored while studying solute transport in aquitards aquitard consolidation plays a significant impact on contaminant breakthrough time mass flux cumulative mass outflow and concentration distribution and these effects last long after consolidation has been completed pu et al 2021 therefore solute transport in the aquitard should consider deformation zhang et al 2013 smith 2000 proposed a mathematical model for solute transport in saturated porous media undergoing a one dimensional small strain consolidation and obtained its analytical solution under a quasi steady state alshawabkeh et al 2005 proposed a solute transport model on the basis of the terzaghi consolidation theory and concluded that advection generated by consolidation would accelerate solute transport yan et al 2020a found that the performance of the composite liner system would be significantly reduced due to clay consolidation while studying the quasi steady state small deformation model with an analytical solution the above mentioned studies have focused on solute transport in a deformed porous medium undergoing small strain consolidation large strain consolidation usually occurs while the soil layer with large porosity e g spatially the newly formed sedimentary soft soil under the condition of large load or hydraulic head decline the one dimensional large consolidation deformation theory proposed by gibson et al 1967 is widely used in the study of large strain consolidation over the last 20 years some researchers carried out studies on solute transport in a deformed clay liner undergoing large strain consolidation lewis et al 2009 described a solute transport model in a large deformed landfill clay liner and showed that the strongest reduction in breakthrough time of solute transport is more prone to occur in the highly compressible liner pu and fox 2016 developed a piecewise liner model that considered one dimensional large strain consolidation and solute transport in layered soils and found that pre consolidation plays an important role in settlement and solute transport the advection dispersion equation is frequently used to describe solute transport and it is usually solved by numerical or analytical methods almeida and cotta 1995 ramírez sabag and lópez falcón 2021 the generalized integral method gitt is widely used for solving linear heat transfer and mass diffusion problems specifically it facilitates the construction of an integral transform pair that can be mathematically manipulated with relative ease cotta 1993 mikhailov and özişik 1984 liu et al 1998 used the gitt to solve the analytical solution of the one dimensional solute advection dispersion equation in a multilayer porous media liu et al 2000 further developed the method of liu et al 1998 introducing in detail how to use the gitt to solve the analytical solution of one dimensional solute transport in heterogeneous porous media approximately multilayer guerrero et al 2009 developed a one dimensional analytical solution for multi species transport for finite porous media and constant boundary conditions using the gitt yan et al 2021 used the gitt to solve the analytical solution of solute transport in the clay barrier under the condition of constant overlying load in which the model considered clay consolidation diffusion and solute adsorption suk 2016 developed a semi analytical procedure using the gitt to solve the coupled multispecies reactive solute transport equations which overcomes the limitation of identical retardation values suk et al 2022 introduced a new semi analytical solution using gitt to describe solute transport induced by an injection well with a constant injection rate in spatially and temporally variable flow groundwater leakage usually occurs in an aquifer aquitard system when a hydraulic gradient develops in the system and it tends to cause deformation and water release of the adjacent aquitard ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 shi et al 2011 wang and zhan 2013 li et al 2017 proposed a view that delayed drainage extends the breakthrough time of solute transport in the aquitard undergoing small deformation li et al 2019 found that increasing the deformation of the aquitard and decreasing hydraulic conductivity will increase the impact of delayed drainage on solute transport in the aquitard to the knowledge of the authors no analytical solution has been presented which considers the combined processes of solute transport and delayed drainage in a large deformed aquitard based on the premise of the one dimensional consolidation theory for large strain aquitard developed by li et al 2018 and the governing equation of solute transport in a one dimensional deformed porous medium proposed by peters and smith 2002 this study first establishes the mathematical model for solute transport in a large strain aquitard affected by a delayed drainage ld model secondly an analytical solution for drawdown variation in the aquitard under variable drawdowns in adjacent confined aquifer and an analytical solution describing the solute concentration variation in the large strain aquitard is derived under the condition of variable solute concentration in the unconfined aquifer third the effect of delayed drainage on solute transport in a large strain aquitard is studied and factors that control solute transport are explored by parametric sensitivity analysis 2 mathematical model the model studied in this paper is a multi layer aquifer system with infinite lateral extent unconfined aquifer aquitard confined aquifer which is shown in fig 1 in the lagrangian coordinate system the vertical downward direction is taken as the positive direction of a l and the origin is located at the top of the aquitard the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is generally smaller than that of the aquifer by at least two orders of magnitude therefore it is reasonable to assume that the water flow in the aquitard is vertically moving neuman and gardner 1989 neuman and witherspoon 1969 2 1 governing equations the governing equation for aquitard consolidation is derived from mass conservation principles and the effective stress principle it is assumed that the aquitard is homogeneous at the initial time namely the initial void ratio is constant in the aquitard and there is no consideration of the self weight of soil secondly the water flow conforms to darcy s law thirdly the pore water and soil particles cannot be compressed and the deformation of the aquitard which is not affected by the concentration field equals the cumulative water release from the per unit area of the aquitard the governing equation for aquitard consolidation with drawdown s as the control variable is developed by li et al 2018 that is 1 c v 0 2 s a 2 s s s a 2 s t where t is time c v 0 k v 0 s s is the consolidation coefficient of the large strain aquitard k v k v 0 1 e 2 1 e 0 2 is the hydraulic conductivity which decreases with a decreasing void ratio e during the consolidation process of the large strain aquitard s s 1 1 e d e d s is the specific storage of the aquitard which is constant k v 0 is the initial hydraulic conductivity e and e 0 are the void ratio and the initial void ratio respectively the governing equation for solute transport in a deformed clay layer is derived by assuming that the mass transfer in the solid phase and fluid phase follows the mass conservation principle the governing equations of solute transport in a large strain aquitard undergoing one dimensional consolidation in terms of lagrangian coordinates a t have been derived by peters and smith 2002 given as 2 a de 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v c a e 1 e 0 c t 1 1 e 0 c s t where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient which is the sum of the effective diffusion coefficient and the mechanical dispersion coefficient and it is assumed to be constant during the consolidation process of the aquitard lewis et al 2009 li et al 2019 li et al 2017 c is the solute concentration in the pore water of the aquitard c s is the solute concentration adsorbed on solid particles and v is the darcy flow velocity in the aquitard to solve eq 2 the constitutive relationship between the constitutive relationship between c s and c needs to be clarified it is assumed that adsorption is a linear and equilibrium process which holds at relatively low concentrations yan et al 2020b 3 c s ρ s k d c where ρ s is a solid density and k d is the partition coefficient substituting eq 3 into eq 2 leads to 4 a de 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v c a e ρ s k d 1 e 0 c t eq 4 is the governing equation of solute transport in a deformed aquitard undergoing consolidation with linear isothermal adsorption 2 2 initial and boundary conditions initially the drawdown is zero in the aquitard and the solute concentration in the aquitard is zero too therefore the initial conditions of drawdown and solute concentration distribution in the aquitard are assumed as follows 5 s a 0 0 0 a l 6 c a 0 0 0 a l the shallow unconfined aquifer can be recharged by atmospheric precipitation and surface water it is assumed that the hydraulic head does not change in the unconfined aquifer the pollution of unconfined aquifer at some locations are worsening due to increasingly frequent human activities and the solute concentration is assumed to be variable with time 7 s 0 t 0 t 0 8 c 0 t f t t 0 where f t is the solute concentration in the unconfined aquifer and it variates with time the hydraulic head is assumed to decline with time in the confined aquifer underlying the aquitard due to groundwater exploitation because the deep confined aquifer is in a free drainage state contaminated water follows the hydraulic gradient from the unconfined aquifer through the aquitard and then to the underlying confined aquifer the boundary condition is the danckwert s condition at the outlet danckwerts 1953 which leads to a mass conservation boundary condition based on the above assumptions the lower boundary conditions for consolidation and solute transport can be obtained as follows 9 s l t g t t 0 10 c l t a 0 t 0 where g t is the drawdown variation in the underlying confined aquifer and it is assumed to be increasing with time 3 analytical solutions 3 1 analytical solution of consolidation the analytical solutions describing the variation of drawdown void ratio and darcy flow velocity at position a and at time t in the aquitard undergoing large strain consolidation can be obtained by the

30 terms of n and r values respectively are required to compute the series solution liu et al 2000 4 model comparison and verification in this section the analytical solutions of consolidation and solute transport in the large strain aquitard were analyzed and the numerical method of the explicit finite difference scheme was used to verify the accuracy of the analytical solutions of consolidation and solute transport respectively in the case study the drawdown variation in the underlying confined aquifer is assumed to be g t φ l n 1 t and the contaminant concentration in the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be f t c 0 2 e t the hydraulic parameters are referring to the land subsidence study of xie and leo 2004 lewis et al 2009 and zhuang et al 2015 the dispersion coefficient is in the light of the study of solute transport in composite liners by foose et al 2002 lewis et al 2009 and takeda et al 2014 table 1 summarizes consolidation and solute transport input parameters in the aquitard for facilitating the comparison breakthrough times of the predicted solute transport bts is defined as the time at which the solute reaches a predetermined concentration of 0 01 c 0 in this study 4 1 consolidation of the aquitard the variation of s e and v in the large strain aquitard at different times t 1 3 5 15 20 years and different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m are calculated using eqs 11 12 and 13 respectively fig 2 and the results are compared with the numerical solution in fig 2a and 2b s increases significantly initially due to quick pore water releases and it almost increases linear with the coordinate a after t 20 years at t 20 years s values are 1 198 3 647 6 185 8 831 and 11 603 m while a 1 3 5 7 9 m respectively the variation rate of s is large at the beginning and it slows down while the drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer increases slowly as shown in fig 2c and 2d e decreases significantly at initial stage of consolidation and the change rate increases with the increasing a the variation rate of e at different positions increases slowly and synchronously as the drawdown increases slowly in the underlying confined aquifer at t 20 years e decreases linear with a and values are 0 976 0 928 0 880 0 831 0 781 for a 1 3 5 7 9 m respectively fig 2e and 2f show that v is much smaller at the upper part of the aquitard than at the lower part during initial consolidation as consolidation progresses v at the top of the aquitard gradually increases and v at the bottom increases first and then decreases with a large change rate the v in the whole section of the aquitard tends to be the same and increases slowly reaching about 0 038 m year at t 20 years in short the proposed analytical solution is in good agreement with the numerical solution and the behavior of s e and v in the aquitard is affected by consolidation and drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer 4 2 solute transport in the aquitard to validate the accuracy of the analytical solution proposed in this study for solute transport in the large strain aquitard a numerical method previously used by li et al 2019 is adopted and solved using the finite difference method fig 3 fig 3a shows the variation of solute concentration at the middle and bottom of the aquitard a 5 m a 10 m of which the bts are 37 60 and 76 00 years respectively the bts predicted by numerical solution are 37 58 and 76 01 respectively indicating good agreement with the analytical solution fig 3b shows the distribution of solute concentrations in the aquitard at t 50 years and t 100 years respectively at a 5 and a 10 m the ratio of solute concentration to initial solute concentration c c 0 are 0 240 and 0 at 50 years respectively and 1 979 and 0 617 at 100 years the c c 0 predicted by numerical solution are 0 241 and 0 at 50 years respectively and 1 981 and 0 615 at 100 years which is consistent with the analytical solution 5 parametric sensitivity analysis in order to study the effect of consolidation on solute transport in large strain aquitard we conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis of bts by varying partitioning coefficient thickness of aquitard drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer initial hydraulic conductivity specific storage hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and initial void ratio values one at a time based on the values provided in the above case study for making the analysis to be simpler it is assumed the hydraulic head decline in the underlying confined aquifer and the solute concentration in the unconfined aquifer to be constant namely s l t φ and c 0 t c 0 to clarify the effect of delayed drainage on solute transport in a large strain aquitard ld model another two cases were proposed rigid porous medium nd model and equivalent rigid porous medium nd f model and the bts predicted by the ld nd and nd f models are defined as t ld t nd and t nd f respectively the darcy flow velocity and the void ratio will not change with time and position in the two models the hydraulic conductivities in the nd and nd f models are equal to those of the aquitard at initial time and at the end of consolidation respectively and the void ratio in the two models is equal to that of the aquitard at initial time thus the governing equation for solute transport for the nd and nd f models can be obtained by simplifying eq 4 that is 15 e 1 e a d c a v d c a e ρ s k d 1 e c t where the v d and e are the darcy flow velocity and void ratio of the aquitard respectively and they are both constants in the nd model and nd f model 5 1 comparison with a rigid porous medium fig 4 reveals the effect of the partitioning coefficients on breakthrough curves predicted by ld and nd models at a 10 m the results indicate that the strong adsorption will significantly extend the solute transit time the bts predicted by the ld model t ld 96 7 years is 5 6 years shorter than that of nd model t nd 102 3 years without considering the adsorption of soil particles the bts determined by the ld and nd models are 154 and 157 6 years respectively for k d 0 2 ml g and they are 240 1 and 240 years respectively for k d 0 5 ml g solute transport predicted by the ld model is found to be slower than that predicted by the nd model at a relatively larger k d value about k d 0 5 ml g and bts determined by the ld and nd models are 383 8 and 378 4 years respectively for k d 1 ml g the impacts of φ and l on the solute transport in the aquitard undergoing delayed drainage are shown in fig 5 a k d 0 ml g and fig 5b k d 1 ml g while the other parameters are kept to be the same as those given in table 1 results in fig 5 show that φ and l play a strong role on the bts predicted by the ld model and bts increases with decreasing φ and increasing l while l 10 m and k d 0 ml g bts are 96 7 and 53 years at φ 10 20 m respectively fig 5a the larger φ and smaller l lead to a larger darcy flow velocity which accelerates bts in the aquitard the difference of bts between nd and ld models increases with decreasing φ and increasing l resulting in 5 7 years l 10 φ 10 m 5 5 years l 10 φ 20 m 23 years l 20 φ 10 m and 22 2 years l 20 φ 20 m respectively while k d 0 ml g while k d 1 ml g fig 5b the difference of bts between nd and ld models increases with increasing φ and l resulting in 5 5 years l 10 φ 10 m 8 years l 10 φ 20 m 20 3 years l 20 φ 10 m and 30 9 years l 20 φ 20 m respectively fig 6 shows the impact of k v 0 and s s on the solute transport in the aquitard provided that k d 0 ml g fig 6a and k d 1 ml g fig 6b with the other parameters kept to be the same as those given in table 1 results in fig 6a reveal that the bts determined by the ld model decreases with an increasing k v 0 while s s 0 01 the bts are 96 7 and 39 3 years at k v 0 0 0315 and 0 0946 m year respectively without considering adsorption it is also found that a larger s s value leads to shorter bts for the ld model while k v 0 0 0315 the bts are 96 7 and 88 5 years at s s 0 01 and 0 03 m 1 respectively the s s has the opposite effect on the bts of the ld model while k d 1 ml g fig 6b the results in fig 6b of which the starting point of abscissa is not set to be zero for a clear comparison shows that the bts are 383 9 and 397 4 years at s s 0 01 and 0 03 m 1 respectively while k v 0 0 0315 m year the larger k v 0 and smaller s s leads to a larger darcy flow velocity which accelerates solute transport in the aquitard the difference of bts between the ld and nd models increases with an increasing s s and decreasing k v 0 and they are 5 7 years k v 0 0 0315 m year s s 0 01 m 1 2 1 years k v 0 0 0946 m year s s 0 01 m 1 13 8 years k v 0 0 0315 m year s s 0 03 m 1 and 4 8 years k v 0 0 0946 m year s s 0 03 m 1 respectively while k d 0 ml g the same relationship exists while k d 1 ml g fig 6b the impact of d and e 0 on the bts in the aquitard determined by the ld and nd models are shown in fig 7 a k d 0 ml g and fig 7b k d 1 ml g while the other parameters are kept to be the same as those given in table 1 results in fig 7 reveal that the larger value of d shortens the bts of the ld model while e 0 1 the bts of the ld model are 96 7 and 68 6 years at d 0 01 and 0 03 m2 year respectively fig 7a it is also found that a larger e 0 leads to longer bts for the ld model while d 0 01 m2 year the bts are 94 and 122 1 years at e 0 1 and 2 respectively the e 0 has the opposite effect on the bts of the ld model while k d 1 ml g fig 7b results in fig 7b of which the starting point of abscissa is not set to be zero for a clear comparison show that the bts are 383 9 and 298 9 years at e 0 1 and 2 respectively while d 0 01 m2 year the larger d namely stronger hydrodynamic dispersion accelerates solute transport in the aquitard the e 0 which affects the delay index with adsorption plays different roles on bts the difference of bts between the ld and nd models increases with a decreasing e 0 and d without considering the adsorption while k d 1 ml g the difference increases with decreases of e 0 under the condition of weak hydrodynamic dispersion and it is opposite under strong hydrodynamic dispersion while under the small void ratio of aquitard the difference increases with decreases of d otherwise it increases with increases of d while k d 1 ml g 5 2 comparison with equivalent rigid porous medium in this section the difference of bts between ld and nd f models δ t t nd f t ld is evaluated and the relationships between δ t and leakage coefficient σ k v 0 l and consolidation factor δ l 2 c v 0 of the aquitard are analyzed respectively fig 8 reveals that the bts of the nd f model are always longer than that of the ld model and δ t tends to increase with a decreasing value of σ it can be seen that the δ t increases with an increasing φ and s s while a larger value of σ weakens the impact of s s and φ on δ t the δ t are 9 7 18 6 and 26 7 years for s s 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 m 1 respectively with σ 0 00315 years while σ 0 0189 years they are 0 9 1 8 and 2 8 years respectively fig 8a the δ t are 7 8 9 7 and 10 4 years for φ 5 10 15 m respectively with σ 0 00315 years and they are 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 years for σ 0 0189 years fig 8b results reveal that the value of k d and e 0 slightly impact on the relationship between σ and δ t in other words the adsorption of soil particles and void ratio of the aquitard have slight effects on the value of δ t fig 8c and 8d the relationship between δ and δ t is shown in fig 9 and the impacts of four parameters e 0 φ d and k d on the relationship between δ and δ t are analyzed results indicate that δ t increases linearly with an increasing δ which means that the increasing values of l and s s and a decreasing value of k v 0 enlarge the value of δ t it is also found that the larger value of δ increases the impact of these four parameters e 0 φ d and k d on δ t and the larger values of φ e 0 and smaller values of d and k d tend to result in a greater δ t among them the impact of hydrodynamic dispersion on the δ t is the greatest and the impact of adsorption is the least in particular the ratios of δ t on δ are about 0 287 0 199 and 0 154 for corresponding d 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 m2 year respectively fig 9c and they are 0 277 0 285 and 0 281 for k d 0 0 2 and 1 ml g respectively fig 9d for further analysis the ratio ε of δ t over t ld has been obtained and the relationships between s s φ and ε are presented in fig 10 a and 10b it indicates that larger values of φ and s s result in larger ε which all follow positive linear correlation respectively in other words increasing φ and s s tend to enlarge the difference of bts between ld and nd f models the larger s s and φ lead to a greater slope of positive linear correlation the proportions of the ε to the φ are 0 006 0 012 and 0 016 for s s 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 m 1 respectively fig 10a and the proportions of ε to s s are 3 16 5 91 and 8 25 for φ 5 10 and 15 m respectively fig 10b the cumulative water released from the aquitard is q c v 0 1 e s s φ l at the end of consolidation li et al 2018 to clarify the relationship between q and bts of the ld model the relationship between the average cumulative water release per unit volume aquitard q l and ε at different e 0 and d values are shown in fig 10c and fig 10d results show that q l and ε approximately follow a linear relationship and an increasing q l enlarges the value of ε the relationship between ε and q l is influenced slightly by the value of e 0 and d the proportions of ε to q l are 1 463 1 457 and 1 456 for e 0 0 5 0 75 and 1 respectively fig 10c and they are 1 456 1 411 and 1 382 for d 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 m2 year respectively fig 10d 6 conclusions in this study a mathematical model for solute transport in a large strain aquitard of which self weight of soil particles is ignored is established by coupling the consolidation and delayed drainage processes the analytical solutions of the above mathematical model are derived to study the processes of consolidation and solute transport in the aquitard using the variable transformation and variable separation method and gitt and the accuracy of the analytical solutions are verified using a numerical method the parameter sensitivity of solute transport in the large strain aquitard is discussed by comparing it with the nd and nd f models based on the above research the following conclusions are drawn 1 the bts of solute transport in the aquitard is influenced by many factors among which larger φ k v 0 d and smaller l k d reduce the bts which means that for larger darcy flow stronger solute diffusivity and weaker adsorption of soil particles result in shorter bts of the ld model the larger s s and smaller e 0 will reduce the bts without considering adsorption and the opposite effect will occur when adsorption is considered 2 compared with a rigid porous medium delayed drainage accelerates solute transport when adsorption is weak k d 0 5 ml g and the bts of the ld model is longer than that of nd model when the partitioning coefficient is large k d 0 5 ml g the difference of bts between ld and nd model increases with increasing l s s and decreasing k v 0 3 compared with the equivalent rigid porous medium it is found that decreasing σ and increasing δ significantly enlarge the value of δ t and δ and δ t follow a linear positive correlation the ratio of δ t on δ increases with increasing φ e and with decreasing kd d ε has a linear positive correlation with s s and φ and it also has an obvious linear positive relationship with q l while both e 0 and d play a slight role on the linear relationship the proposed analytical solutions are derived under the assumption of homogeneous with initial void ratio at initial time and they are applicable to the thin aquitard however they would bring great calculation error to study the water flow and solute transport in the thick aquitard undergoing large strain consolidation the research about thick aquitard considering more flexible and practical variation of consolidation parameter and the nonuniformly distributed void ratio caused by soil self weight

2176,researchers seek improved models for estimating baseflow in ungauged catchments as the statistical and process based methods traditionally used are not easily transferable and do not give robust predictions respectively in this study a process based statistical hybrid model for estimating baseflow known here as the budyko type baseflow regression bbr model was developed by combining the linear storage discharge relationship with the budyko function and applying multiple regression the performance of the hybrid model was then evaluated using data from 671 near natural catchments acquired from four large sample hydrometeorological datasets the results showed that the bbr model performed well in estimating baseflow on both national and regional scales the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted mean annual baseflow varied from 0 85 to 0 94 for the calibration catchments and from 0 71 to 0 96 for the validation catchments the bbr model has more of a physical basis is more transferable and is less likely to produce unrealistic negative mean annual baseflows than traditional multiple regression models it is also less complex than process based models the calibrated bbr models were used to estimate the mean annual baseflow and the elasticity of the baseflow to climate and catchment attributes at the national scale for the united states united kingdom brazil and australia the results showed that climate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration had the most control on the baseflow and that the soil sand content and the normalized difference vegetation index were also important catchment attributes the bbr model developed in this study offers scientists a new and improved method for estimating baseflow the results generated by the model in this study will improve our understanding of how climate and landscape control the baseflow keywords budyko type baseflow regression model process based statistical model

periods when there is no precipitation or snowmelt hall 1968 nathan mcmahon 1990 accurate information about baseflow availability is needed to develop strategies for managing water resources ebrahim villholth 2016 protecting aquatic ecosystems de graaf et al 2019 and controlling nonpoint source pollution he et al 2020 governments international organizations and other agencies are interested in addressing water issues across state national and continental boundaries santhi et al 2008 for example santhi et al 2008 and huang et al 2021 produced baseflow index bfi and baseflow volume maps of the contiguous united states us singh et al 2019 predicted bfi values for all reaches of the river network in new zealand and beck et al 2013 estimated the global distribution of bfi values from climatological and physiographic properties however a major challenge in acquiring large scale baseflow characteristics is that ungauged catchments where streamflow is not measured account for the majority of earth s land surface blöschl et al 2013 fekete vörösmarty 2007 which hinders direct separation of baseflow from measured streamflow therefore alternative techniques for estimating baseflow values of ungauged catchments are required to provide planners and decision makers with accurate baseflow information baseflow can be estimated with either process based or statistical methods from information about climate and physiographic properties mcmahon et al 2013 process based methods estimate baseflow generation from conceptualizations of the main physical processes booker woods 2014 most process based hydrological models such as the simhyd mac hbv xinanjiang and arno models simulate the baseflow with linear or non linear storage discharge functions it is known however that there may be large uncertainties associated with the baseflow estimates because of deficiencies in the model structure approaches to parameterization and heterogeneity in the media properties blöschl 2005 samuel et al 2012 tested the performance of five different mac hbv models for simulating baseflow using a range of combinations of model parameters and linear and nonlinear storage discharge functions and by optimizing the model parameter sets with different criteria they found that the error associated with the simulated baseflow volumes varied considerably with the median error ranging from 1 0 to 12 7 zhang et al 2020 found that the simhyd and xinanjiang models calibrated for 596 australian catchments overestimated the mean annual bfi by 81 and 146 respectively cheng et al 2020 attempted to improve the baseflow predictions by changing the storage discharge functions of five monthly water balance models to nonlinear from linear and found only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the estimates from the modified models statistical methods are mainly based on observations and seek to characterize the baseflow characteristics by quantifying the relationship between the baseflow and the climate and catchment attributes using for example multiple regression methods artificial neural networks and random forests multiple regression methods have been used to predict the bfi or baseflow volumes in the elbe river basin german haberlandt et al 2001 the thames basin uk bloomfield et al 2009 the great lakes basin neff et al 2005 a mediterranean region longobardi villani 2008 wisconsin gebert et al 2007 pennsylvania zhu day 2009 and indiana ahiablame et al 2013 in the us and the contiguous us santhi et al 2008 artificial neural networks have been used to predict the global bfi beck et al 2013 while random forests have been used to predict the bfi at the national scale in new zealand singh et al 2019 and the contiguous us huang et al 2021 statistical methods are widely used for estimating baseflow and because of their relative simplicity and good predictive power they can be transferred to ungauged catchments however as conventional statistical models are essentially empirical it remains difficult to gain insights into the physical relationships between the inputs and the outputs in addition statistical models once calibrated generally cannot be used beyond the study region the budyko models budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 fu 1981 ol dekop 1911 pike 1964 schreiber 1904 turc 1954 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 represent an empirical statistical method that captures the hydrological mechanism by which precipitation and energy control the evaporation process the budyko 1974 theory states that the long term evaporation ratio the ratio between evaporation and precipitation may be modeled as a function of the long term aridity index the ratio between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation interest in using the budyko 1974 framework to estimate baseflow has grown in recent years cheng et al 2020 meira neto et al 2020 wang and wu 2013 wang and wu 2013 observed a budyko type relationship between the baseflow coefficient bfc the ratio between baseflow and precipitation and the aridity index for 185 mopex duan et al 2006 catchments in the us and concluded that the aridity index was the main control on the bfc using a hypothesis similar to that proposed by budyko 1974 meira neto et al 2020 proposed an exponential decay form of the analytical equation that described the relationship between the aridity index and the bfc and found that the aridity index explained 89 of the spatial variability in the baseflow in 378 catchments within the us gnann et al 2019 found that the bfc could not be modeled as a function of the aridity index alone and that the catchment storage capacity was important in determining the bfc in humid catchments cheng et al 2021 proposed a budyko type analytical formulation to relate the aridity index and the storage capacity index the ratio between the catchment storage capacity and the mean annual precipitation to the bfc and found that the analytical formulation captured the spatial variability of observed bfc in the 950 catchments in the us united kingdom uk and australia r2 0 75 budyko models typically include one shape parameter that represents the integrated effects of the climate soil vegetation and topography characteristics of a specific catchment fu wang 2019 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 the shape parameter is usually conceptual and reflects the functional aspect of the entire catchment however the process relationships between the shape parameter and the measurable catchment attributes are poorly understood because of strong cross correlations among these attributes blöschl 2005 yang et al 2008 in addition the storage capacity index in the analytical bfc formulation from cheng et al 2021 is a conceptual variable it is very difficult to obtain the shape parameter and the storage capacity index from observations which blöschl et al 2013 means that it is difficult to use budyko type models to estimate the baseflow in ungauged catchments in practice many hydrological models have both physical and empirical components which means that they can benefit from 1 the ability of empirically based models to efficiently characterize the observed data in statistical terms and 2 prior knowledge about hydrological processes pechlivanidis et al 2011 which may make it easier to identify suitable model parameters in this study we combined the linear storage discharge relationship with the budyko function and used multiple regression methods to develop a process based statistical model to estimate the baseflow i e the budyko type baseflow regression bbr model the bbr model relies more on the physical basis and has a more universal functional form than traditional multiple regression models and is less complex than process based models the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the ability of our proposed bbr model to estimate the baseflow and 2 identify the main controls on the baseflow using the model in section 2 the bbr model is introduced the hydrometeorological and physiographical data and the methods used are presented in section 3 the results are presented and discussed in sections 4 and 5 and the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 derivation of the bbr model in process based hydrologic models baseflow is often simulated with the linear storage discharge relationship cheng et al 2020 samuel et al 2012 zhang chiew 2009 direct runoff is calculated as a linear function of the precipitation and the relative subsurface water storage wang et al 2014 here we assumed that 1 the mean annual baseflow was proportional to the mean annual subsurface water storage and 2 the mean annual direct runoff was proportional to the mean annual precipitation and the relative subsurface water storage based on these assumptions the following equations were obtained 1 q b k g s 2 q d k s ps s max where qb qd p and s are the mean annual baseflow direct runoff precipitation and subsurface water storage mm respectively and kg ks and smax are the storage discharge coefficient dimensionless direct runoff coefficient dimensionless and subsurface storage capacity mm respectively using the definition of the bfi and eqs 1 and 2 the long term bfi can be expressed as 3 q b q q b q b q d k g s k g s k s p s s max α α p where α kgsmax ks the physical meaning of α can be interpreted as the catchment storage capacity rescaled by the ratio between the storage discharge coefficient and the surface flow coefficient budyko 1974 hypothesized that the mean annual evaporation ratio e p was primarily determined by the aridity index pet p at the mean annual scale the budyko hypothesis can be expressed as 4 e p f pet p where e is the mean annual evaporation and f pet p represents the budyko functions assuming there were negligible changes in the catchment storage the mean annual runoff coefficient q p can be expressed according to the water balance as 5 q p 1 e p 1 f pet p various parametric budyko type functions such as fu s equation have incorporated the effect of landscape factors fu 1981 6 q p 1 pet p ω 1 ω pet p where ω is the shape parameter that represents the effects of other factors e g climate seasonality soil vegetation and topography the mean annual baseflow can be written as the product of the mean annual precipitation runoff coefficient and the bfi 7 q b p q p

sample hydrometeorological datasets 3 data and methodology 3 1 data andréassian et al 2006 underscored that hydrological modeling research should be based on a large number of catchments in order to 1 improve models and assess their generality 2 move from climate region specific towards general catchment models and 3 effectively calibrate model parameters when applied to ungauged basins a significant number of catchments from a wide range of hydrological conditions enable us to go beyond individual case studies and derive robust conclusions on hydrological processes and models addor et al 2020 therefore the bbr model was evaluated based on large samples of hydrometeorological data and catchment attributes in this study table 1 the analysis period spanned 30 hydrologic years from 1 october 1984 to 30 september 2014 the model was calibrated and validated using data for catchment precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet and runoff q from large sample hydrometeorological datasets from the us uk brazil and australia camels camels gb camels br and camels aus data for the global mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from the worldclim v2 1 dataset fick hijmans 2017 and the global aridity index and potential evapotranspiration database v3 zomer et al 2022 respectively were used in the model application the catchment attributes included the catchment area a elevation elev slope slop soil depth dept sand content sand silt content silt clay content clay subsurface hydraulic conductivity k and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the topographic data were derived from earthenv dem90 robinson et al 2014 the soil depth was derived from the global 1 km gridded thickness of soil regolith and sedimentary deposit layers pelletier et al 2016 and then was averaged over the catchment the soil texture fractions at six soil depths 0 5 5 15 15 30 30 60 60 100 and 100 200 cm were derived from the global gridded soil information dataset soilgrids250m hengl et al 2017 and a depth weighted harmonic averaging was applied and then averaged over the catchment the subsurface hydraulic conductivity was extracted from the glhymps 2 0 gleeson et al 2014 huscroft et al 2018 and averaged over the catchment the normalized difference vegetation index for each catchment was extracted from the global gimms ndvi3g v1 dataset 1981 2015 the national center for atmospheric research 2018 and averaged for october 1984 to september 2014 we used unregulated catchments with low levels of human activities in the analysis in an attempt to maximize the accuracy of the baseflow separation from the observed streamflow the catchments in camels and camels aus and the catchments identified as being part of the uk benchmark network harrigan et al 2018 in camels gb have experienced minimal effects from regulation and human activities catchments free of human disturbance are not clearly identified in camels br so the near natural catchments in camels br were defined by the 1 consumptive use perc 1 total consumptive water use in 2017 normalized by the mean annual streamflow 2 regulation degree 0 ratio of total reservoir storage capacity of the catchment to its total annual flow 3 crop perc 10 percentage of the catchment covered by croplands and the 4 imperv perc 1 percentage of the catchment covered by artificial surfaces or urban areas the near natural catchments were further refined by removing catchments with 1 areas smaller than 5 km2 to avoid measurement errors and catchment delineation errors 2 water coverage greater than 5 as lake drainage was not included 3 more than 20 of the precipitation falling as snow as snowmelt was not considered 4 more than 90 days yr with zero discharge as runoff in harsh intermittent streams is mainly generated via infiltration excess runoff 5 runoff coefficients greater than 1 as this would indicate significant water balance issues and 6 more than 1 of streamflow values missing gnann et al 2019 meira neto et al 2020 the final data set consisted of 671 near natural catchments with distinct hydro climate and landscape properties fig 1 the areas of the study catchments ranged from 5 4 to 47745 km2 the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and total runoff ranged from 367 to 3509 378 2309 and 4 2975 mm respectively the aridity index ranged from 0 12 to 3 74 and had a median of 0 85 table 2 the mean annual baseflow that was used to develop and validate the model was then calculated from the observed streamflow data first baseflow was separated from the daily streamflow using the revised ukih method piggott et al 2005 three hysep methods fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum sloto crouse 1996 and the one parameter lyne hollick digital filter lyne hollick 1979 the digital filter with a filter parameter of 0 925 was applied forward backward and forward again as suggested by nathan and mcmahon 1990 many researchers have reported strong correlations between baseflow estimates and tracer based estimates using 0 925 e g gonzales et al 2009 lott stewart 2016 partington et al 2012 second the outputs from these five methods were averaged as the observed daily baseflow to minimize the uncertainties introduced using different methods zhang et al 2020 finally the observed daily baseflow values were aggregated to the mean annual values 3 2 parameters calibration and validation the study catchments were ranked in ascending order by the aridity index for each country and one in every five catchments was treated as ungauged or a validation site and the others were treated as gauged or calibration sites meaning that 80 of the catchments were used for calibration and 20 were used for validation fig 2 the catchment attributes were analyzed for correlations to test for multicollinearity before starting to calibrate the bbr models see fig s1 silt and clay were removed because they were highly correlated with sand ω and α were directly calculated using eqs 6 and 3 for each catchment in the calibration set respectively stepwise regression was used to develop the initial mathematical relationships between ω and α and the catchment attributes and these relationships were then used to build eqs 9 and 10 the linear and non linear logarithmic forms of the response variable ω and α and the catchment attributes were tested in the stepwise regression models if the non linear values contributed significantly the non linear form was retained in the stepwise regression models and was transformed the functional forms of the stepwise regression models were incorporated into the bbr model eq 11 and the model coefficients were recalibrated to the observed mean annual baseflow the model coefficients were estimated with the non linear ordinary least squares ols method with the coefficients of the stepwise regression models as the initial values the catchment attributes with significance levels smaller than 0 05 were retained in the model we also developed a stepwise multiple regression model to estimate the baseflow in each country so that we could compare our bbr model with traditional multiple regression methods using the method used earlier to build the initial mathematical relationship between the ω or α and catchment attributes the model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r 2 percent bias pbias and the root mean square error rmse which were calculated as 12 r 2 1 i 1 n q b s q b o 2 i 1 n q b o q b o 2 13 pbias i 1 n q b s q b o i 1 n q b o 100 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n q b s q b o 2 where q b o q b s and q b o are the observed mean annual baseflow the simulated mean annual baseflow and the average of q b o for all catchments respectively and n is the total number of catchments r 2 ranges from to 1 with 1 as the optimal value pbias ranges from to with 0 as the optimal value rmse ranges from 0 to with 0 as the optimal value 3 3 application of the calibrated bbr model the mean annual baseflows were estimated for the level 7 hydrobasins lehner and grill 2013 in the us uk brazil and australia with the calibrated bbr models furthermore the elasticities of the baseflow to the climate and catchment attributes were also estimated so that the main controls on the baseflow could be identified berghuijs et al 2017 15 e x q b q b x x where ex is the relative change in qb because of a relative change in the driving factor x the derivation of ex is described in detail in the supplementary materials the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data were sourced from the worldclim v2 1 dataset fick and hijmans 2017 and the global aridity index and potential evapotranspiration database v3 zomer et al 2022 respectively both datasets contain high resolution 30 arc seconds global raster data for the period from 1970 to 2000 the landscape properties were derived from the same datasets as shown in table 1 all the climate and landscape variables were averaged to the level 7 catchments the mean annual baseflow the elasticities of the baseflow and the uncertainties were estimated with a monte carlo framework we assumed that the coefficients of the bbr model were independent of each other and that they followed a multivariate normal distribution 16 a b n μ a μ b σ a 2 σ b 2 where μ and σ are the arrays of the average and standard deviation of each model coefficient calibrated in section 3 3 in total 10 000 model coefficient sets were generated from the multivariate normal distribution and then 10 000 sets of mean annual baseflow and baseflow elasticities were simulated using eqs 11 and 15 for each level 7 catchment respectively the averages and relative standard deviations were calculated to represent the mean annual baseflow the elasticities of the baseflow and their uncertainties 4 results 4 1 observed baseflow estimation the mean annual baseflows estimated by the five different baseflow separation methods are shown in fig 3 there was good agreement between the five methods and the pearson correlation coefficients r were close to 1 we acknowledge that some subjectivity may have been introduced through the choice of the baseflow separation methods however any subjectivity had a minimal effect on the results and the results from the five methods were used to represent the observed baseflow 4 2 performance of the bbr model eq 11 was used as the universal functional form of the bbr models for the us uk brazil and australia 17 ω e x p a 0 a 1 s l o p 18 α e x p b 0 b 1 s a n d b 2 l n n d v

on the mean annual baseflow in that region and so was removed of the catchment characteristics sand ndvi elev and slop were statistically significant in the us sand ndvi and slop were statistically significant in the uk and sand and slop were statistically significant in brazil and australia we then compared the outputs from the bbr models with the observed mean annual baseflow fig 4 a d and found that the bbr models performed well in the us uk brazil and australia most of the data were very close to the 1 1 line the r 2 values ranged from 0 88 to 0 94 for the calibration catchments and from 0 71 to 0 96 for the validation catchments the absolute values of pbias for the uk us and brazil were all smaller than 2 0 while the pbias value for australia was 14 9 table 3 the rmse ranged from 72 to 90 mm for the calibration catchments and from 79 to 114 mm for the validation catchments traditional multiple regression methods usually yield different functional forms in different regions table 4 the functional form of our bbr models was more universal i e eqs 11 eq 17 eq 18 and so could be applied in different regions additionally the bbr models gave better results than the traditional multiple regression methods table 4 fig 4e h the r 2 rmse values from the bbr models were all larger smaller than or close to the r 2 rmse produced by the traditional multiple regression models and the pbias values were similar furthermore the bbr models gave positive predictions of the mean annual baseflow fig 4a d while traditional multiple regression models gave unrealistic negative values fig 4e and h 4 3 factors influencing the mean annual baseflow at the national scale the mean annual baseflow was estimated for the level 7 catchments across the us uk brazil and australia using a monte carlo framework the mean and standard deviation values of the estimated annual baseflows were 78 and 235 mm 227 and 199 mm 378 and 318 mm and 13 and 56 mm for the us uk brazil and australia respectively the mean annual baseflow estimates varied spatially fig 5 and the baseflow values were high in the northwestern us northern uk and in the amazon basin in brazil they were low in the great plains colorado plateau and great basin in the us the northeastern brazilian highlands and most areas of australia the ranges of the relative standard deviations of our estimated mean annual baseflows fig 5b show that there was relatively high uncertainty associated with the estimated mean annual baseflow in relatively arid regions fig 5c including most parts of the western us eastern england northeastern brazilian highlands and the australian outback the absolute elasticities of baseflow to changes in the driving factors ex for the level 7 catchments are shown in fig 6 the elasticity of baseflow to precipitation ep was always larger than zero was between 0 64 and 5 96 and had a median of 3 43 the ep exceeded 1 00 in 99 5 of the level 7 catchments which indicated that the relative change in the baseflow was usually greater than the relative change in the precipitation in addition for all the level 7 catchments ep was always greater than the absolute elasticity of the baseflow to the potential evapotranspiration epet the values of epet were negative in most of the level 7 catchments apart from 11 catchments where the uncertainties relative standard deviations were extremely large the absolute epet ranged from 0 01 to 4 98 had a median of 2 61 and was greater than 1 00 in 93 8 of the level 7 catchments the elasticities of the baseflow to the sand content esand ndvi endvi elevation eelev and slope eslop had positive and negative values which shows that the catchment attributes had different effects on the baseflow the absolute esand was between 0 00 and 4 32 had a median of 0 38 and was 1 00 in 86 2 of the level 7 catchments the absolute endvi ranged from 0 00 to 1 38 had a median of 0 00 and was 1 00 in 99 7 of the level 7 catchments the absolute eelev and eslop were close to zero which suggests that the catchment elevation and slope had little effect on the baseflow the values of ep were generally high in the arid regions fig 7 a such as the great plains in the us eastern england brazilian highlands and all of australia the distributions of the absolute epet fig 7b and ep were similar comparison of the values for the different regions showed that the absolute esand fig 7c was relatively high in australia and the absolute endvi fig 7d was relatively high in the uk the baseflow was more sensitive to changes in climate than to the catchment attributes of the catchment attributes sand and the ndvi had most influence on the baseflow figs 6 and 7 5 discussion 5 1 utility of the bbr model at the regional scale this research mainly focuses on baseflow estimation across national scales to derive a better sense of the utility of the bbr model it was further tested in two relatively small regions i e north carolina us and victoria australia in total 27 catchments in north carolina and 49 catchments in victoria were extracted from the 671 catchments fig 8 a and d the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and total runoff ranged 1175 2117 mm 970 1236 mm and 288 1321 mm for catchments in north carolina respectively and ranged 485 1578 mm 969 1240 mm and 32 584 mm for catchments in victoria respectively the bbr models and step regression models for these two regions were determined using the same procedures as described in section 3 2 and the results are presented in table 5 the bbr model performed well in estimating the baseflow in these two regions 0 85 r 2 0 94 12 5 pbias 0 2 and 42 mm rmse 84 mm and the goodness of fit was as good at the regional scale as at the national scale 0 71 r 2 0 96 0 8 pbias 14 7 and 72 mm rmse 114 mm moreover the performance of the bbr model for north carolina was comparable with that of the step regression model fig 8b and c whereas the bbr model performed better than the step regression model for victoria table 5 fig 8e and f the step regression model also predicted negative values of the mean annual baseflow in some catchments of victoria fig 8f overall the bbr model demonstrated better predictive power and greater robustness than the step regression model on both national and regional scales 5 2 advantages of the bbr model the budyko type baseflow regression bbr model proposed in this study has more of a physical basis than traditional multiple regression models and is less complex than process based models it is process based in nature as the functional form was derived from the budyko function and the linear storage discharge relationship it is statistical in nature in that the parameters ω and α were related to the catchment attributes through multiple regression methods the structure and computation of the bbr model are less complex than those of process based models which means that it will be easy to use in ungauged catchments furthermore the form of the function of the bbr model is more universal than that of the traditional multiple regression models meaning that it is more transferable the bbr model gives realistic positive values of the mean annual baseflow while purely statistical models may produce unrealistic negative values because they estimate baseflow by relating field observations to catchment attributes only attempt to minimize uncertainties over a specified region and do not have any physically based constraints santhi et al 2008 for example obtained negative estimates of the mean annual baseflow in two hydrologic landscape regions of the us using a stepwise regression method the calibrated multiple regression models for the us australia and victoria of australia also produced negative mean annual baseflow values fig 4e and h fig 8f in this study in contrast the bbr model will not produce negative values because it incorporates the functional form of the budyko models and the parameters ω and α are expressed as exponential functions of the catchment attributes eqs 17 18 and both the budyko models and exponential functions yield positive values 5 3 controls on baseflow beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 estimated the global mean annual bfi and streamflow using artificial neural networks the spatial distribution of the mean annual baseflow derived from beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 by multiplying the mean annual streamflow with bfi and then averaged to the level 7 hydrobasins scale are shown in fig 9 the spatial distributions of the estimates of the mean annual baseflow from this study fig 5a and from the studies of beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 were similar and the r 2 of 0 82 indicates good agreement fig s2 the mean annual baseflow values estimated in this study were generally lower than those derived by beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 fig s2 perhaps because the baseflow separation procedures were different here we used the average of five baseflow separation methods to represent the observed baseflow while beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 used the linear reservoir model to separate the baseflow from the observed streamflow santhi et al 2008 used the digital filter arnold et al 1995 and the inverse distance weighting spatial interpolation methods to estimate the mean annual baseflow in the us the results from the study of santhi et al 2008 were similar to those obtained in this study for the us see fig 5 in santhi et al 2008 the results from sensitivity analysis section 4 3 showed that the climate factors i e p and pet had more influence on the baseflow than the catchment attributes van dijk 2010 also reported that climate explained 84 of the variation in the mean annual baseflow in 183 australian catchments while berghuijs et al 2017 found that precipitation was the strongest influence on the runoff for 83 of the land grid cells in their study of the catchment characteristics sand ndvi elev and slop all had a statistically significant impact on the mean annual baseflow in the us sand ndvi and slop had statistically significant effects in the uk sand and slop had statistically significant effects in brazil and australia table 3 sand slop and a had statistically significant effects in north carolina us and ndvi and elev had statistically significant effects in victoria australia table 5 this suggests that the controls of catchment properties on baseflow were diverse in different regions and on different scales and that the bbr model could represent the most important processes such that insignificant processes could be shut off from a continental perspective sand ndvi elev and slop had statistically significant effects on the mean annual baseflow and sand and the ndvi were the most important fig 6 the influence of catchment attributes on baseflow is reflected in the changes of the shape parameter ω and the rescaled catchment storage capacity α eq 8 indicates that the baseflow increases as ω decreases and α increases ω represents the retention capacity of a catchment and as the value of ω increases the amount of water retained in a catchment will also increase meaning that less runoff is generated the values of the model coefficient a 1 were negative for the us uk and brazil table 3 which suggests that ω would decrease as slop increased yang et al 2007 also found that ω and slop were inversely related α represents the catchment storage capacity smax rescaled by the ratio between the storage discharge coefficient kg and the surface flow coefficient ks an increase in α will give an increase in the bfi eq 3 meaning that the baseflow component in the total runoff is higher sand affects the catchment storage capacity infiltration rate and subsurface hydraulic conductivity and so influences the magnitude of α the ndvi represents the vegetation coverage of a catchment vegetation together with climate has an important role in the evolution of the catchment characteristics through biotic manipulation of soils carrillo et al 2011 such as root growth animal burrowing and other bioturbation processes that are often associated with catchment infiltration and subsurface storage capacity price 2011 and so influences the magnitude of α the catchment topographical characteristics i e elev and slop also had statistically significant effects on α but were less important than sand and ndvi 5 4 uncertainty analysis the daily hydrometeorological data used in this study came from different datasets which may have led to some inconsistencies the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data in camels were derived from the daymet data set thornton et al 2012 while in camels gb the precipitation was derived from the ceh gridded estimates of areal rainfall ceh gear dataset keller et al 2015 tanguy et al 2016 and potential evapotranspiration was derived from the climate hydrology and ecology research support system potential evapotranspiration chess pe dataset robinson et al 2016 in camels br the precipitation was derived from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps data v2 0 funk et al 2015 and the potential evapotranspiration was derived from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 3a martens et al 2017 while the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in camels aus were derived from the scientific information for land owners silo dataset jeffrey et al 2001 the actual hydrological processes may not be accurately characterized in simple model structures which may also give rise to uncertainty the analytical bfi formula eq 3 was derived from the linear storage discharge relationship eq 1 and a linear relationship between the direct runoff and precipitation and the relative catchment storage eq 2 while a linear storage discharge relationship may have a weaker physical basis and may be less universal than a nonlinear storage discharge relationship cheng et al 2020 van dijk 2010 found that the baseflow estimates obtained from linear and non linear storage discharge relationships were very similar some of the uncertainty in the results may be attributed to the time periods of the datasets used here the bbr models were developed from mean annual climate data for 1984 2014 while the calibrated models were used to simulate the national scale mean annual baseflow and its sensitivity to changes in the main influences section 4 3 from the mean annual climate data for 1970 2000 the monte carlo framework used in this study section 3 4 only considers the uncertainties from the model parameters uncertainties from climate and catchment attribute data should also be considered in future analysis 6 conclusions in this study we have described the development and application of a hybrid bbr model that combined the linear storage discharge relationship the budyko function and multiple regression methods the performance of the new hybrid model was evaluated using hydrometeorological and physiographic data from 671 near natural catchments of which 80 were used for developing the model and 20 were used for validating the model the results showed that the bbr model gave good estimates of baseflow at both national and regional scales the r 2 between the observed and predicted mean annual baseflow varied from 0 85 to 0 94 for the calibration catchments and from 0 71 to 0 96 for the validation catchments the bbr model has a more physical basis than traditional multiple regression models and is less complex than process based models it is more universal and gives better predictions than traditional multiple regression methods and it will not produce negative values the calibrated bbr models were used to estimate the national scale mean annual baseflow in the us uk brazil and australia the spatial distribution of the mean annual baseflow estimated by the bbr models agreed well r 2 0 82 with the estimates from artificial neural networks beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 the sensitivity analysis suggested that climate the soil sand content and the normalized difference vegetation index were the most important influences on baseflow in this study the results confirm that the bbr model gives good estimates of baseflow in ungauged catchments and that it could also be used to investigate the influence of climate and catchment characteristics on baseflow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2176,researchers seek improved models for estimating baseflow in ungauged catchments as the statistical and process based methods traditionally used are not easily transferable and do not give robust predictions respectively in this study a process based statistical hybrid model for estimating baseflow known here as the budyko type baseflow regression bbr model was developed by combining the linear storage discharge relationship with the budyko function and applying multiple regression the performance of the hybrid model was then evaluated using data from 671 near natural catchments acquired from four large sample hydrometeorological datasets the results showed that the bbr model performed well in estimating baseflow on both national and regional scales the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted mean annual baseflow varied from 0 85 to 0 94 for the calibration catchments and from 0 71 to 0 96 for the validation catchments the bbr model has more of a physical basis is more transferable and is less likely to produce unrealistic negative mean annual baseflows than traditional multiple regression models it is also less complex than process based models the calibrated bbr models were used to estimate the mean annual baseflow and the elasticity of the baseflow to climate and catchment attributes at the national scale for the united states united kingdom brazil and australia the results showed that climate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration had the most control on the baseflow and that the soil sand content and the normalized difference vegetation index were also important catchment attributes the bbr model developed in this study offers scientists a new and improved method for estimating baseflow the results generated by the model in this study will improve our understanding of how climate and landscape control the baseflow keywords budyko type baseflow regression model process based statistical model

periods when there is no precipitation or snowmelt hall 1968 nathan mcmahon 1990 accurate information about baseflow availability is needed to develop strategies for managing water resources ebrahim villholth 2016 protecting aquatic ecosystems de graaf et al 2019 and controlling nonpoint source pollution he et al 2020 governments international organizations and other agencies are interested in addressing water issues across state national and continental boundaries santhi et al 2008 for example santhi et al 2008 and huang et al 2021 produced baseflow index bfi and baseflow volume maps of the contiguous united states us singh et al 2019 predicted bfi values for all reaches of the river network in new zealand and beck et al 2013 estimated the global distribution of bfi values from climatological and physiographic properties however a major challenge in acquiring large scale baseflow characteristics is that ungauged catchments where streamflow is not measured account for the majority of earth s land surface blöschl et al 2013 fekete vörösmarty 2007 which hinders direct separation of baseflow from measured streamflow therefore alternative techniques for estimating baseflow values of ungauged catchments are required to provide planners and decision makers with accurate baseflow information baseflow can be estimated with either process based or statistical methods from information about climate and physiographic properties mcmahon et al 2013 process based methods estimate baseflow generation from conceptualizations of the main physical processes booker woods 2014 most process based hydrological models such as the simhyd mac hbv xinanjiang and arno models simulate the baseflow with linear or non linear storage discharge functions it is known however that there may be large uncertainties associated with the baseflow estimates because of deficiencies in the model structure approaches to parameterization and heterogeneity in the media properties blöschl 2005 samuel et al 2012 tested the performance of five different mac hbv models for simulating baseflow using a range of combinations of model parameters and linear and nonlinear storage discharge functions and by optimizing the model parameter sets with different criteria they found that the error associated with the simulated baseflow volumes varied considerably with the median error ranging from 1 0 to 12 7 zhang et al 2020 found that the simhyd and xinanjiang models calibrated for 596 australian catchments overestimated the mean annual bfi by 81 and 146 respectively cheng et al 2020 attempted to improve the baseflow predictions by changing the storage discharge functions of five monthly water balance models to nonlinear from linear and found only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the estimates from the modified models statistical methods are mainly based on observations and seek to characterize the baseflow characteristics by quantifying the relationship between the baseflow and the climate and catchment attributes using for example multiple regression methods artificial neural networks and random forests multiple regression methods have been used to predict the bfi or baseflow volumes in the elbe river basin german haberlandt et al 2001 the thames basin uk bloomfield et al 2009 the great lakes basin neff et al 2005 a mediterranean region longobardi villani 2008 wisconsin gebert et al 2007 pennsylvania zhu day 2009 and indiana ahiablame et al 2013 in the us and the contiguous us santhi et al 2008 artificial neural networks have been used to predict the global bfi beck et al 2013 while random forests have been used to predict the bfi at the national scale in new zealand singh et al 2019 and the contiguous us huang et al 2021 statistical methods are widely used for estimating baseflow and because of their relative simplicity and good predictive power they can be transferred to ungauged catchments however as conventional statistical models are essentially empirical it remains difficult to gain insights into the physical relationships between the inputs and the outputs in addition statistical models once calibrated generally cannot be used beyond the study region the budyko models budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 fu 1981 ol dekop 1911 pike 1964 schreiber 1904 turc 1954 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 represent an empirical statistical method that captures the hydrological mechanism by which precipitation and energy control the evaporation process the budyko 1974 theory states that the long term evaporation ratio the ratio between evaporation and precipitation may be modeled as a function of the long term aridity index the ratio between potential evapotranspiration and precipitation interest in using the budyko 1974 framework to estimate baseflow has grown in recent years cheng et al 2020 meira neto et al 2020 wang and wu 2013 wang and wu 2013 observed a budyko type relationship between the baseflow coefficient bfc the ratio between baseflow and precipitation and the aridity index for 185 mopex duan et al 2006 catchments in the us and concluded that the aridity index was the main control on the bfc using a hypothesis similar to that proposed by budyko 1974 meira neto et al 2020 proposed an exponential decay form of the analytical equation that described the relationship between the aridity index and the bfc and found that the aridity index explained 89 of the spatial variability in the baseflow in 378 catchments within the us gnann et al 2019 found that the bfc could not be modeled as a function of the aridity index alone and that the catchment storage capacity was important in determining the bfc in humid catchments cheng et al 2021 proposed a budyko type analytical formulation to relate the aridity index and the storage capacity index the ratio between the catchment storage capacity and the mean annual precipitation to the bfc and found that the analytical formulation captured the spatial variability of observed bfc in the 950 catchments in the us united kingdom uk and australia r2 0 75 budyko models typically include one shape parameter that represents the integrated effects of the climate soil vegetation and topography characteristics of a specific catchment fu wang 2019 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 the shape parameter is usually conceptual and reflects the functional aspect of the entire catchment however the process relationships between the shape parameter and the measurable catchment attributes are poorly understood because of strong cross correlations among these attributes blöschl 2005 yang et al 2008 in addition the storage capacity index in the analytical bfc formulation from cheng et al 2021 is a conceptual variable it is very difficult to obtain the shape parameter and the storage capacity index from observations which blöschl et al 2013 means that it is difficult to use budyko type models to estimate the baseflow in ungauged catchments in practice many hydrological models have both physical and empirical components which means that they can benefit from 1 the ability of empirically based models to efficiently characterize the observed data in statistical terms and 2 prior knowledge about hydrological processes pechlivanidis et al 2011 which may make it easier to identify suitable model parameters in this study we combined the linear storage discharge relationship with the budyko function and used multiple regression methods to develop a process based statistical model to estimate the baseflow i e the budyko type baseflow regression bbr model the bbr model relies more on the physical basis and has a more universal functional form than traditional multiple regression models and is less complex than process based models the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the ability of our proposed bbr model to estimate the baseflow and 2 identify the main controls on the baseflow using the model in section 2 the bbr model is introduced the hydrometeorological and physiographical data and the methods used are presented in section 3 the results are presented and discussed in sections 4 and 5 and the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 derivation of the bbr model in process based hydrologic models baseflow is often simulated with the linear storage discharge relationship cheng et al 2020 samuel et al 2012 zhang chiew 2009 direct runoff is calculated as a linear function of the precipitation and the relative subsurface water storage wang et al 2014 here we assumed that 1 the mean annual baseflow was proportional to the mean annual subsurface water storage and 2 the mean annual direct runoff was proportional to the mean annual precipitation and the relative subsurface water storage based on these assumptions the following equations were obtained 1 q b k g s 2 q d k s ps s max where qb qd p and s are the mean annual baseflow direct runoff precipitation and subsurface water storage mm respectively and kg ks and smax are the storage discharge coefficient dimensionless direct runoff coefficient dimensionless and subsurface storage capacity mm respectively using the definition of the bfi and eqs 1 and 2 the long term bfi can be expressed as 3 q b q q b q b q d k g s k g s k s p s s max α α p where α kgsmax ks the physical meaning of α can be interpreted as the catchment storage capacity rescaled by the ratio between the storage discharge coefficient and the surface flow coefficient budyko 1974 hypothesized that the mean annual evaporation ratio e p was primarily determined by the aridity index pet p at the mean annual scale the budyko hypothesis can be expressed as 4 e p f pet p where e is the mean annual evaporation and f pet p represents the budyko functions assuming there were negligible changes in the catchment storage the mean annual runoff coefficient q p can be expressed according to the water balance as 5 q p 1 e p 1 f pet p various parametric budyko type functions such as fu s equation have incorporated the effect of landscape factors fu 1981 6 q p 1 pet p ω 1 ω pet p where ω is the shape parameter that represents the effects of other factors e g climate seasonality soil vegetation and topography the mean annual baseflow can be written as the product of the mean annual precipitation runoff coefficient and the bfi 7 q b p q p

baseflow can be estimated by the climate and catchment attributes 11 q b h p p e t ω p f ω a pet f ω a 1 f ω a p e t g ω b g ω b p the performance of eq 11 the bbr model was then evaluated using large sample hydrometeorological datasets 3 data and methodology 3 1 data andréassian et al 2006 underscored that hydrological modeling research should be based on a large number of catchments in order to 1 improve models and assess their generality 2 move from climate region specific towards general catchment models and 3 effectively calibrate model parameters when applied to ungauged basins a significant number of catchments from a wide range of hydrological conditions enable us to go beyond individual case studies and derive robust conclusions on hydrological processes and models addor et al 2020 therefore the bbr model was evaluated based on large samples of hydrometeorological data and catchment attributes in this study table 1 the analysis period spanned 30 hydrologic years from 1

the topographic data were derived from earthenv dem90 robinson et al 2014 the soil depth was derived from the global 1 km gridded thickness of soil regolith and sedimentary deposit layers pelletier et al 2016 and then was averaged over the catchment the soil texture fractions at six soil depths 0 5 5 15 15 30 30 60 60 100 and 100 200 cm were derived from the global gridded soil information dataset soilgrids250m hengl et al 2017 and a depth weighted harmonic averaging was applied and then averaged over the catchment the subsurface hydraulic conductivity was extracted from the glhymps 2 0 gleeson et al 2014 huscroft et al 2018 and averaged over the catchment the normalized difference vegetation index for each catchment was extracted from the global gimms ndvi3g v1 dataset 1981 2015 the national center for atmospheric research 2018 and averaged for october 1984 to september 2014 we used unregulated catchments with low levels of human activities in the analysis in an attempt to maximize the accuracy of the baseflow separation from the observed streamflow the catchments in camels and camels aus and the catchments identified as being part of the uk benchmark network harrigan et al 2018 in camels gb have experienced minimal effects from regulation and human activities catchments free of human disturbance are not clearly identified in camels br so the near natural catchments in camels br were defined by the 1 consumptive use perc 1 total consumptive water use in 2017 normalized by the mean annual streamflow 2 regulation degree 0 ratio of total reservoir storage capacity of the catchment to its total annual flow 3 crop perc 10 percentage of the catchment covered by croplands and the 4 imperv perc 1 percentage of the catchment covered by artificial surfaces or urban areas the near natural catchments were further refined by removing catchments with 1 areas smaller than 5 km2 to avoid measurement errors and catchment delineation errors 2 water coverage greater than 5 as lake drainage was not included 3 more than 20 of the precipitation falling as snow as snowmelt was not considered 4 more than 90 days yr with zero discharge as runoff in harsh intermittent streams is mainly generated via infiltration excess runoff 5 runoff coefficients greater than 1 as this would indicate significant water balance issues and 6 more than 1 of streamflow values missing gnann et al 2019 meira neto et al 2020 the final data set consisted of 671 near natural catchments with distinct hydro climate and landscape properties fig 1 the areas of the study catchments ranged from 5 4 to 47745 km2 the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and total runoff ranged from 367 to 3509 378 2309 and 4 2975 mm respectively the aridity index ranged from 0 12 to 3 74 and had a median of 0 85 table 2 the mean annual baseflow that was used to develop and validate the model was then calculated from the observed streamflow data first baseflow was separated from the daily streamflow using the revised ukih method piggott et al 2005 three hysep methods fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum sloto crouse 1996 and the one parameter lyne hollick digital filter lyne hollick 1979 the digital filter with a filter parameter of 0 925 was applied forward backward and forward again as suggested by nathan and mcmahon 1990 many researchers have reported strong correlations between baseflow estimates and tracer based estimates using 0 925 e g gonzales et al 2009 lott stewart 2016 partington et al 2012 second the outputs from these five methods were averaged as the observed daily baseflow to minimize the uncertainties introduced using different methods zhang et al 2020 finally the observed daily baseflow values were aggregated to the mean annual values 3 2 parameters calibration and validation the study catchments were ranked in ascending order by the aridity index for each country and one in every five catchments was treated as ungauged or a validation site and the others were treated as gauged or calibration sites meaning that 80 of the catchments were used for calibration and 20 were used for validation fig 2 the catchment attributes were analyzed for correlations to test for multicollinearity before starting to calibrate the bbr models see fig s1 silt and clay were removed because they were highly correlated with sand ω and α were directly calculated using eqs 6 and 3 for each catchment in the calibration set respectively stepwise regression was used to develop the initial mathematical relationships between ω and α and the catchment attributes and these relationships were then used to build eqs 9 and 10 the linear and non linear logarithmic forms of the response variable ω and α and the catchment attributes were tested in the stepwise regression models if the non linear values contributed significantly the non linear form was retained in the stepwise regression models and was transformed the functional forms of the stepwise regression models were incorporated into the bbr model eq 11 and the model coefficients were recalibrated to the observed mean annual baseflow the model coefficients were estimated with the non linear ordinary least squares ols method with the coefficients of the stepwise regression models as the initial values the catchment attributes with significance levels smaller than 0 05 were retained in the model we also developed a stepwise multiple regression model to estimate the baseflow in each country so that we could compare our bbr model with traditional multiple regression methods using the method used earlier to build the initial mathematical relationship between the ω or α and catchment attributes the model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r 2 percent bias pbias and the root mean square error rmse which were calculated as 12 r 2 1 i 1 n q b s q b o 2 i 1 n q b o q b o 2 13 pbias i 1 n q b s q b o i 1 n q b o 100 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n q b s q b o 2 where q b o q b s and q b o are the observed mean annual baseflow the simulated mean annual baseflow and the average of q b o for all catchments respectively and n is the total number of catchments r 2 ranges from to 1 with 1 as the optimal value pbias ranges from to with 0 as the optimal value rmse ranges from 0 to with 0 as the optimal value 3 3 application of the calibrated bbr model the mean annual baseflows were estimated for the level 7 hydrobasins lehner and grill 2013 in the us uk brazil and australia with the calibrated bbr models furthermore the elasticities of the baseflow to the climate and catchment attributes were also estimated so that the main controls on the baseflow could be identified berghuijs et al 2017 15 e x q b q b x x where ex is the relative change in qb because of a relative change in the driving factor x the derivation of ex is described in detail in the supplementary materials the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data were sourced from the worldclim v2 1 dataset fick and hijmans 2017 and the global aridity index and potential evapotranspiration database v3 zomer et al 2022 respectively both datasets contain high resolution 30 arc seconds global raster data for the period from 1970 to 2000 the landscape properties were derived from the same datasets as shown in table 1 all the climate and landscape variables were averaged to the level 7 catchments the mean annual baseflow the elasticities of the baseflow and the uncertainties were estimated with a monte carlo framework we assumed that the coefficients of the bbr model were independent of each other and that they followed a multivariate normal distribution 16 a b n μ a μ b σ a 2 σ b 2 where μ and σ are the arrays of the average and standard deviation of each model coefficient calibrated in section 3 3 in total 10 000 model coefficient sets were generated from the multivariate normal distribution and then 10 000 sets of mean annual baseflow and baseflow elasticities were simulated using eqs 11 and 15 for each level 7 catchment respectively the averages and relative standard deviations were calculated to represent the mean annual baseflow the elasticities of the baseflow and their uncertainties 4 results 4 1 observed baseflow estimation the mean annual baseflows estimated by the five different baseflow separation methods are shown in fig 3 there was good agreement between the five methods and the pearson correlation coefficients r were close to 1 we acknowledge that some subjectivity may have been introduced through the choice of the baseflow separation methods however any subjectivity had a minimal effect on the results and the results from the five methods were used to represent the observed baseflow 4 2 performance of the bbr model eq 11 was used as the universal functional form of the bbr models for the us uk brazil and australia 17 ω e x p a 0 a 1 s l o p 18 α e x p b 0 b 1 s a n d b 2 l n n d v i b 3 l n e l e v b 4 s l o p where ai and bi are the model coefficients and are summarized in table 3 when ai or bi the catchment attribute did not have a statistically significant p 0 05 influence on the mean annual baseflow in that region and so was removed of the catchment characteristics sand ndvi elev and slop were statistically significant in the us sand ndvi and slop were statistically significant in the uk and sand and slop were statistically significant in brazil and australia we then compared the outputs from the bbr models with the observed mean annual baseflow fig 4 a d and found that the bbr models performed well in the us uk brazil and australia most of the data were very close to the 1 1 line the r 2 values ranged from 0 88 to 0 94 for the calibration catchments and from 0 71 to 0 96 for the validation catchments the absolute values of pbias for the uk us and brazil were all smaller than 2 0 while the pbias value for australia was 14 9 table 3 the rmse ranged from 72 to 90 mm for the calibration catchments and from 79 to 114 mm for the validation catchments traditional multiple regression methods usually yield different functional forms in different regions table 4 the functional form of our bbr models was more universal i e eqs 11 eq 17 eq 18 and so could be applied in different regions additionally the bbr models gave better results than the traditional multiple regression methods table 4 fig 4e h the r 2 rmse values from the bbr models were all larger smaller than or close to the r 2 rmse produced by the traditional multiple regression models and the pbias values were similar furthermore the bbr models gave positive predictions of the mean annual baseflow fig 4a d while traditional multiple regression models gave unrealistic negative values fig 4e and h 4 3 factors influencing the mean annual baseflow at the national scale the mean annual baseflow was estimated for the level 7 catchments across the us uk brazil and australia using a monte carlo framework the mean and standard deviation values of the estimated annual baseflows were 78 and 235 mm 227 and 199 mm 378 and 318 mm and 13 and 56 mm for the us uk brazil and australia respectively the mean annual baseflow estimates varied spatially fig 5 and the baseflow values were high in the northwestern us northern uk and in the amazon basin in brazil they were low in the great plains colorado plateau and great basin in the us the northeastern brazilian highlands and most areas of australia the ranges of the relative standard deviations of our estimated mean annual baseflows fig 5b show that there was relatively high uncertainty associated with the estimated mean annual baseflow in relatively arid regions fig 5c including most parts of the western us eastern england northeastern brazilian highlands and the australian outback the absolute elasticities of baseflow to changes in the driving factors ex for the level 7 catchments are shown in fig 6 the elasticity of baseflow to precipitation ep was always larger than zero was between 0 64 and 5 96 and had a median of 3 43 the ep exceeded 1 00 in 99 5 of the level 7 catchments which indicated that the relative change in the baseflow was usually greater than the relative change in the precipitation in addition for all the level 7 catchments ep was always greater than the absolute elasticity of the baseflow to the potential evapotranspiration epet the values of epet were negative in most of the level 7 catchments apart from 11 catchments where the uncertainties relative standard deviations were extremely large the absolute epet ranged from 0 01 to 4 98 had a median of 2 61 and was greater than 1 00 in 93 8 of the level 7 catchments the elasticities of the baseflow to the sand content esand ndvi endvi elevation eelev and slope eslop had positive and negative values which shows that the catchment attributes had different effects on the baseflow the absolute esand was between 0 00 and 4 32 had a median of 0 38 and was 1 00 in 86 2 of the level 7 catchments the absolute endvi ranged from 0 00 to 1 38 had a median of 0 00 and was 1 00 in 99 7 of the level 7 catchments the absolute eelev and eslop were close to zero which suggests that the catchment elevation and slope had little effect on the baseflow the values of ep were generally high in the arid regions fig 7 a such as the great plains in the us eastern england brazilian highlands and all of australia the distributions of the absolute epet fig 7b and ep were similar comparison of the values for the different regions showed that the absolute esand fig 7c was relatively high in australia and the absolute endvi fig 7d was relatively high in the uk the baseflow was more sensitive to changes in climate than to the catchment attributes of the catchment attributes sand and the ndvi had most influence on the baseflow figs 6 and 7 5 discussion 5 1 utility of the bbr model at the regional scale this research mainly focuses on baseflow estimation across national scales to derive a better sense of the utility of the bbr model it was further tested in two relatively small regions i e north carolina us and victoria australia in total 27 catchments in north carolina and 49 catchments in victoria were extracted from the 671 catchments fig 8 a and d the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and total runoff ranged 1175 2117 mm 970 1236 mm and 288 1321 mm for catchments in north carolina respectively and ranged 485 1578 mm 969 1240 mm and 32 584 mm for catchments in victoria respectively the bbr models and step regression models for these two regions were determined using the same procedures as described in section 3 2 and the results are presented in table 5 the bbr model performed well in estimating the baseflow in these two regions 0 85 r 2 0 94 12 5 pbias 0 2 and 42 mm rmse 84 mm and the goodness of fit was as good at the regional scale as at the national scale 0 71 r 2 0 96 0 8 pbias 14 7 and 72 mm rmse 114 mm moreover the performance of the bbr model for north carolina was comparable with that of the step regression model fig 8b and c whereas the bbr model performed better than the step regression model for victoria table 5 fig 8e and f the step regression model also predicted negative values of the mean annual baseflow in some catchments of victoria fig 8f overall the bbr model demonstrated better predictive power and greater robustness than the step regression model on both national and regional scales 5 2 advantages of the bbr model the budyko type baseflow regression bbr model proposed in this study has more of a physical basis than traditional multiple regression models and is less complex than process based models it is process based in nature as the functional form was derived from the budyko function and the linear storage discharge relationship it is statistical in nature in that the parameters ω and α were related to the catchment attributes through multiple regression methods the structure and computation of the bbr model are less complex than those of process based models which means that it will be easy to use in ungauged catchments furthermore the form of the function of the bbr model is more universal than that of the traditional multiple regression models meaning that it is more transferable the bbr model gives realistic positive values of the mean annual baseflow while purely statistical models may produce unrealistic negative values because they estimate baseflow by relating field observations to catchment attributes only attempt to minimize uncertainties over a specified region and do not have any physically based constraints santhi et al 2008 for example obtained negative estimates of the mean annual baseflow in two hydrologic landscape regions of the us using a stepwise regression method the calibrated multiple regression models for the us australia and victoria of australia also produced negative mean annual baseflow values fig 4e and h fig 8f in this study in contrast the bbr model will not produce negative values because it incorporates the functional form of the budyko models and the parameters ω and α are expressed as exponential functions of the catchment attributes eqs 17 18 and both the budyko models and exponential functions yield positive values 5 3 controls on baseflow beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 estimated the global mean annual bfi and streamflow using artificial neural networks the spatial distribution of the mean annual baseflow derived from beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 by multiplying the mean annual streamflow with bfi and then averaged to the level 7 hydrobasins scale are shown in fig 9 the spatial distributions of the estimates of the mean annual baseflow from this study fig 5a and from the studies of beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 were similar and the r 2 of 0 82 indicates good agreement fig s2 the mean annual baseflow values estimated in this study were generally lower than those derived by beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 fig s2 perhaps because the baseflow separation procedures were different here we used the average of five baseflow separation methods to represent the observed baseflow while beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 used the linear reservoir model to separate the baseflow from the observed streamflow santhi et al 2008 used the digital filter arnold et al 1995 and the inverse distance weighting spatial interpolation methods to estimate the mean annual baseflow in the us the results from the study of santhi et al 2008 were similar to those obtained in this study for the us see fig 5 in santhi et al 2008 the results from sensitivity analysis section 4 3 showed that the climate factors i e p and pet had more influence on the baseflow than the catchment attributes van dijk 2010 also reported that climate explained 84 of the variation in the mean annual baseflow in 183 australian catchments while berghuijs et al 2017 found that precipitation was the strongest influence on the runoff for 83 of the land grid cells in their study of the catchment characteristics sand ndvi elev and slop all had a statistically significant impact on the mean annual baseflow in the us sand ndvi and slop had statistically significant effects in the uk sand and slop had statistically significant effects in brazil and australia table 3 sand slop and a had statistically significant effects in north carolina us and ndvi and elev had statistically significant effects in victoria australia table 5 this suggests that the controls of catchment properties on baseflow were diverse in different regions and on different scales and that the bbr model could represent the most important processes such that insignificant processes could be shut off from a continental perspective sand ndvi elev and slop had statistically significant effects on the mean annual baseflow and sand and the ndvi were the most important fig 6 the influence of catchment attributes on baseflow is reflected in the changes of the shape parameter ω and the rescaled catchment storage capacity α eq 8 indicates that the baseflow increases as ω decreases and α increases ω represents the retention capacity of a catchment and as the value of ω increases the amount of water retained in a catchment will also increase meaning that less runoff is generated the values of the model coefficient a 1 were negative for the us uk and brazil table 3 which suggests that ω would decrease as slop increased yang et al 2007 also found that ω and slop were inversely related α represents the catchment storage capacity smax rescaled by the ratio between the storage discharge coefficient kg and the surface flow coefficient ks an increase in α will give an increase in the bfi eq 3 meaning that the baseflow component in the total runoff is higher sand affects the catchment storage capacity infiltration rate and subsurface hydraulic conductivity and so influences the magnitude of α the ndvi represents the vegetation coverage of a catchment vegetation together with climate has an important role in the evolution of the catchment characteristics through biotic manipulation of soils carrillo et al 2011 such as root growth animal burrowing and other bioturbation processes that are often associated with catchment infiltration and subsurface storage capacity price 2011 and so influences the magnitude of α the catchment topographical characteristics i e elev and slop also had statistically significant effects on α but were less important than sand and ndvi 5 4 uncertainty analysis the daily hydrometeorological data used in this study came from different datasets which may have led to some inconsistencies the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data in camels were derived from the daymet data set thornton et al 2012 while in camels gb the precipitation was derived from the ceh gridded estimates of areal rainfall ceh gear dataset keller et al 2015 tanguy et al 2016 and potential evapotranspiration was derived from the climate hydrology and ecology research support system potential evapotranspiration chess pe dataset robinson et al 2016 in camels br the precipitation was derived from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps data v2 0 funk et al 2015 and the potential evapotranspiration was derived from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 3a martens et al 2017 while the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in camels aus were derived from the scientific information for land owners silo dataset jeffrey et al 2001 the actual hydrological processes may not be accurately characterized in simple model structures which may also give rise to uncertainty the analytical bfi formula eq 3 was derived from the linear storage discharge relationship eq 1 and a linear relationship between the direct runoff and precipitation and the relative catchment storage eq 2 while a linear storage discharge relationship may have a weaker physical basis and may be less universal than a nonlinear storage discharge relationship cheng et al 2020 van dijk 2010 found that the baseflow estimates obtained from linear and non linear storage discharge relationships were very similar some of the uncertainty in the results may be attributed to the time periods of the datasets used here the bbr models were developed from mean annual climate data for 1984 2014 while the calibrated models were used to simulate the national scale mean annual baseflow and its sensitivity to changes in the main influences section 4 3 from the mean annual climate data for 1970 2000 the monte carlo framework used in this study section 3 4 only considers the uncertainties from the model parameters uncertainties from climate and catchment attribute data should also be considered in future analysis 6 conclusions in this study we have described the development and application of a hybrid bbr model that combined the linear storage discharge relationship the budyko function and multiple regression methods the performance of the new hybrid model was evaluated using hydrometeorological and physiographic data from 671 near natural catchments of which 80 were used for developing the model and 20 were used for validating the model the results showed that the bbr model gave good estimates of baseflow at both national and regional scales the r 2 between the observed and predicted mean annual baseflow varied from 0 85 to 0 94 for the calibration catchments and from 0 71 to 0 96 for the validation catchments the bbr model has a more physical basis than traditional multiple regression models and is less complex than process based models it is more universal and gives better predictions than traditional multiple regression methods and it will not produce negative values the calibrated bbr models were used to estimate the national scale mean annual baseflow in the us uk brazil and australia the spatial distribution of the mean annual baseflow estimated by the bbr models agreed well r 2 0 82 with the estimates from artificial neural networks beck et al 2013 beck et al 2015 the sensitivity analysis suggested that climate the soil sand content and the normalized difference vegetation index were the most important influences on baseflow in this study the results confirm that the bbr model gives good estimates of baseflow in ungauged catchments and that it could also be used to investigate the influence of climate and catchment characteristics on baseflow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2177,solute cycling models for rivers in arid watersheds must identify solute sources and their spatial and temporal connectivity to rivers to assess the processes that control the solute behavior in these rivers in this study we collected hourly time series of total dissolved ions tdi concentrations water levels water temperatures and air temperatures at select stations distributed longitudinally in a river in an arid watershed our objectives were to 1 document the spatial and temporal variations in solute concentrations and 2 determine the processes controlling the spatial and temporal variations in solute concentrations we conducted this investigation over a two year period at four stations along the okavango river flowing through the okavango delta delta in the middle kalahari desert botswana at the spatial scale we observed progressive downriver enrichment in tdi concentrations associated with evapotranspiration of river water because of the 5 months river transit across the hot delta at a temporal scale the tdi concentrations increased seasonally from evapoconcentration and sub seasonally from solute transfer from the watershed to the river we analyzed sub seasonal tdi concentration perturbations using the slope β of the relationship between tdi concentrations and normalized water level c nwl relationships we find that at low discharge during flow recession and at the beginning of rising discharge from flooding the solute enrichment anomalies with β 0 are related to hydrologic connectivity between the river and solute stores in the river floodplains hundreds of thousands of salt islands and isolated evapoconcentrated wetland pools our findings indicate that hydrologically driven river connectivity to solute stores in the local watershed and evapotranspiration jointly control the solute behavior at variable spatial and temporal scales in rivers in arid watersheds we anticipate that our findings will inform solute transport and solute cycling models for rivers in arid watersheds keywords time series investigation total dissolved ions solute cycling concentration normalized water level endorheic basin okavango delta data availability data are published as supplementary table 1 introduction rivers act as conduits of water and solutes dissolved ions in water out of the river basin in exorheic basins and to the terminus of endorheic basins solute transformation across river basins and the role of rivers in solute transport make rivers an important component of the global solute cycle studies in exorheic basins typically found in humid environments have advanced our knowledge and understanding of source s of solutes solute transport in stream processes and catchment specific characteristics that control the spatial and temporal variability in solute behavior fovet et al 2018 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 wymore et al 2020 liu et al 2020 knowledge on solute cycling in exorheic basins is critical for quantifying weathering fluxes solute load and solute export out of basins to oceans which has implications for the global oceanic solute cycle comparatively limited studies e g oromeng et al 2021 letshele et al 2023 have been conducted in rivers draining endorheic basins in arid environments to understand the processes controlling the spatial and temporal variability of solutes and solute cycling perhaps because endorheic basins are disconnected from the ocean and thus are regarded as unimportant in the global cycling of solutes nevertheless endorheic basins occupy 20 23 of the earth s surface nichols 2007 nyberg et al 2018 which we use to suggest that substantial amounts of solutes transferred from the upper portions of watersheds are transformed in the rivers and stored at the terminus of endorheic basins in spite of the potential importance of terrestrial solute cycling at the local and regional levels in endorheic basins the processes that control the cycling of solutes are not well understood because of limited investigations a study by oromeng et al 2021 conducted in the endorheic okavango river basin provided much needed insights on the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the river solute behavior a study of the okavango river by letshele et al 2023 showed that downriver solute enrichment was related to the d excess parameter derived from the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of river water additionally the letshele et al 2023 study also found marked disagreement between the mean tdi mean d excess model and tdi d excess data from previous studies which was used to invoke non evaporative solute enrichment in the okavango delta the oromeng et al 2021 and the letshele et al 2023 studies can be used to suggest that more work still needs to be done to constrain the spatio temporal controls of solute cycling across large spatial scales and over short to long term timescales in endorheic basins understanding solute cycling in endorheic basins has implications for knowing the river salinity status which impacts water quality and river ecology unlike exorheic basins in humid environments the hydrology of rivers in endorheic basins in arid environments is characterized by highly variable river flow and downriver water transmission losses to groundwater and evapotranspiration yet little is known on how the downriver modifications of water and solutes modulates solute behavior at various temporal scales understanding the spatial and temporal river solute dynamics across river basins requires assessments of river discharge and solute concentrations with a temporal resolution adequate to capture processes occurring at multiple locations across the basin hydrochemical investigations utilize river discharge to constrain hydrologic controls on solute behavior in rivers e g evans and davies 1998 godsey et al 2009 moatar et al 2017 zhi et al 2018 oromeng et al 2021 however there are many rivers that are ungauged and those that are gauged may not be gauged at locations useful for experiments that investigate the spatial evolution of the hydrochemistry of rivers the lack of discharge measurements for many ungauged rivers and at select river segments may be due to difficulties in defining river channel cross sectional area and measuring flow velocity for example measuring discharge in braided stream reaches and reaches with extensive wetlands can be challenging and thus will impact our ability to assess discharge related solute behavior a way to meet this challenge in studying discharged based solute behavior is a qualitative comparison where relative water level changes at multiple river reaches can be considered a proxy for discharge supplementary fig 1 the water levels for each measured reach are normalized and used as a relative indicator of discharge the normalization can be tested by comparing the solute behavior using normalized water levels with the solute behavior where river discharge is measured along the river supplementary fig 1 if the solute discharge and solute normalized water levels relationships show similar temporal behavior then the normalized water levels can be used as a proxy for discharge in ungauged river segments hydrochemical studies of solute behavior in rivers take into consideration both river discharge and solute concentrations the solute dynamics can be characterized using the total dissolved ions tdi which are reflective of the gross river solute composition e g oromeng et al 2021 tdi concentrations can be measured by electronic meters and recorded and stored in data loggers at a much higher frequency than can be measured manually thus assessing the relationship between solute concentrations as tdi and normalized water levels c nwl relationship at high frequency during different flow regimes across a river basin will allow us to tease out salient solute behavior patterns driven by variable processes we investigated the processes controlling the spatial and temporal solute behavior in the okavango river in northwestern botswana the okavango river flows in an endorheic basin the okavango river basin hereafter referred to as the orb the orb covers two climatic regimes from a higher rainfall temperate region in angola to the steppe middle kalahari desert in botswana ellery et al 2003 peel et al 2007 near the terminus of the orb lies the okavango delta delta the okavango river meanders extensively through a narrow valley of the panhandle region of the delta before it disperses into a series of distributary channels on a large alluvial fan forming the lower delta region in the lower delta region the river is mostly characterized by braided flow through the okavango delta wetlands the hydrology of the delta is highly variable and controlled by an annual flood pulse initiated by rains from the upper watershed in angola and by local rains e g wolski et al 2005 the delta and its wetlands are subjected to high evapotranspiration et rates which cause salt precipitation on floodplains and on the numerous tree islands in the delta wetlands e g mccarthy et al 1991 1998 gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 gumbricht et al 2004 akondi et al 2019 evapotranspiration also causes enrichment of solutes in isolated wetland pools scattered across the delta e g dincer et al 1979 the role that these solute stores ie floodplains salt islands and isolated wetland pools which are distributed differentially across the delta have on the okavango river solute cycling is yet to be investigated investigations of the solute behavior in the okavango river in the delta conducted at the proximal portion of the delta in mohembo oromeng et al 2021 and distal portion of the delta in maun oromeng et al 2021 ramatlapeng et al 2021 have suggested that hydrologic connectivity between the okavango river and solute stores in the local watershed and evapotranspiration control the spatial and temporal river solute behavior although the oromeng et al 2021 and ramatlapeng et al 2021 studies have provided insights on the role of hydrology and evapotranspiration in controlling solute behavior at the inlet and outlet of the delta there is still a lack of understanding of the processes driving the variations in river solute concentrations both in space and time for the nearly 450 km river distance between the delta inlet and outlet e g letshele et al 2023 the delta serves as an important source of potable water and food fish water lily to the riparian communities mosepele et al 2006 2009 kgathi et al 2006 and therefore studying the processes that may affect the solute behavior in the delta is crucial for water quality monitoring and ecological sustainability in this study we made hourly measurements of tdi concentrations water level air temperature and water temperature at 4 stations located spatially across the delta our objectives were to 1 document the spatial and temporal variations of solutes and 2 determine the processes controlling variations in solute concentrations in the okavango river we used tdi concentrations to characterize solute behavior and air temperature and water temperature to assess seasonality and climatic controls on solute behavior in the river we utilized normalized water levels to elucidate the influence of hydrological changes on solute behavior monitoring hydrologic water level hydrochemical tdi concentrations and climatic water and air temperature controls at a high frequency allowed us to assess solute behavior dynamics occurring at seasonal and sub seasonal timescales across the delta the placement of one of our stations at the inlet of the delta captured solute transport and processes influenced by the upper headwater catchments localized chemical transformation in the delta which controls the solute dynamics that affect the delta and its wetlands was assessed for two stations within the delta and a station at the river exit from the delta the findings from our study provide insights on the hydrologic climatic and geomorphological processes controlling the spatio temporal solute behavior in okavango delta and is applicable to other rivers in endorheic basins 2 the okavango delta 2 1 location the delta lies near the terminus of the endorheic orb this study was conducted along the okavango river located between latitudes 18 and 21 s and longitudes 22 and 24 e in the okavango delta in northwest botswana fig 1 the upper watershed of the orb comprises the cubango and cuito basins which are drained by the cubango river and cuito river respectively and merge in angola to form the okavango river the okavango river enters the delta in botswana at mohembo and flows for 450 km from the inlet to the outlet of the delta in maun the delta consists of a panhandle region and a lower delta region the panhandle of the delta is a 6 000 km2 valley through which the okavango river meanders before branching out into distributary channels forming the lower delta the lower delta is an alluvial fan with a surface area of 22 000 km2 mccarthy et al 1992 and lies in the quaternary half graben of the okavango rift zone mccarthy et al 1993 modisi et al 2000 kinabo et al 2007 2008 bufford et al 2012 the landscape of the delta has been shaped by neotectonics river sedimentation formation of channels channel avulsion and wetland development mccarthy and ellery 1994 mccarthy et al 1998 the topographical elevations vary from 1025 m where the okavango river flows into the delta at mohembo to 920 m in the mababe depression gumbricht et al 2001 the topography of the delta is relatively flat mccarthy et al 1998 mccarthy 2006 with gentle undulations where the local relief rarely exceeds 2 m except for areas with termite mounds and islands mccarthy et al 1998 gumbricht et al 2001 mccarthy 2006 2 2 geology the cubango and cuito sub basins in the upper orb in angola lie on the precambrian congo craton the cuito basin and southern part of the cubango sub basins are covered by the karoo supergroup sedimentary rocks overlain by thick unconsolidated kalahari sands clays lime rock and lateritic layers of the kalahari superior formation bereslawski 1997 catuneanu et al 2005 jones 2010 the headwater portion of the cubango sub basin is underlain by a crystalline precambrian bedrock comprising granite and dolerite bereslawski 1997 jones 2010 in the okavango delta the bedrock geology is comprised of precambrian crystalline rocks of the damara and ghanzi chobe orogenic belt modie 2000 milzow et al 2009 the surficial geology consists of the quaternary kalahari alluvium and recent swamp sediments overlying 105 175 m of lacustrine and fluvio deltaic sediments ringrose et al 2009 at the surface the sediments in the okavango delta are mostly sands with varying proportions of silt clays and carbonates huntsman mapila et al 2005 the surficial sediments originate from a mixture of aeolian quartz diagenetic carbonates and components of weathered proterozoic granitoids and mafic ultramafic rocks exposed in the northwestern part of botswana huntsman mapila et al 2005 2 3 climate the climate of the orb ranges from a temperate climate in the angolan highlands to a steppe arid kalahari desert in northwestern botswana peel et al 2007 the climate is characterized by a wet season which spans from november to march and a dry season which spans from april to october mccarthy and ellery 1994 milzow et al 2009 steudel et al 2013 the mean annual rainfall in the upper watershed is 1100 mm pombo et al 2015 in the delta the mean annual rainfall ranges between 455 and 490 mm mccarthy et al 2000 temperatures in the upper orb range between 13 and 17 c during the dry season and from 20 to 25 c during the wet season baumberg et al 2014 the highest mean monthly maximum temperatures over the delta ranges between 32 and 35 c during the wet season and the lowest mean monthly minimum temperatures range from 2 to 7 c during the dry season moses and gondwe 2019 the delta is subjected to high temperatures with an estimated potential evapotranspiration of 2172 mm y which is 4 times greater than the rainfall received in the delta wilson and dincer 1976 thus evapotranspiration has a profound effect on the water balance in the delta and contributes to the development and growth of the 150 000 tree island complexes scattered across the delta gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 the tree islands cover 5 of the permanently flooded ecotone 25 of the seasonal ecotone and 50 of the occasionally flooded ecotone gumbricht et al 2004 humphries et al 2014 evapoconcentration also causes enrichment of solutes in the numerous isolated surface water pools scattered in the delta s seasonally and occasionally flooded ecotones mccarthy et al 1998 2 4 hydrology the cuito and cubango rivers in the upper watershed in angola contribute about 45 and 55 of the discharge respectively to the okavango river flowing through the delta mendelsohn and el obeid 2004 the hydrology of the okavango river and delta is primarily driven by an annual flood derived from the highlands of angola and by local rains the mean annual inflow of water from the upper watershed to the delta is 9 2 109 m3 y and the seasonal rains contribute an additional 6 109 m3 y mccarthy and ellery 1998 merron 1991 the annual flood pulse reaches the inlet to the delta in mohembo between february and may and gradually flows across the delta as a progressive wave to the outlet of the delta in maun for 4 6 months mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 mccarthy and ellery 1998 as the flood advances across the delta the area inundated varies from an annual low of 4500 6000 km2 to an annual high of 9000 12 000 km2 ramberg and wolski 2008 because the kalahari sands in the delta have relatively high hydraulic conductivity 10 30 m day and porosity 30 obakeng and gieske 1997 the slow propagation of the flood wave is accompanied by groundwater recharge in the shallow unconfined aquifer mccarthy 2006 making the okavango river influent the deepening of the groundwater table away from the okavango river and delta wetlands is evidence for groundwater recharge by the okavango river mccarthy et al 1997 ellery et al 2003 mccarthy 2006 milzow et al 2009 akondi et al 2019 the variable flooding in the delta creates vegetation zonations mladenov et al 2005 wolski et al 2006 the panhandle region is in the permanently flooded ecotone dominated by grass miscanthus junceus reeds phragmites australis and giant sedges cyperus papyrus ellery et al 2003 on the channel margins water depths average 1 5 m wilson and dincer 1976 average river gradient is 1 5500 gumbricht et al 2004 and the river flows at a velocity of 0 4 0 8 m s within the channel wolski et al 2006 the lower delta has seasonally flooded and occasionally flooded ecotones the seasonally flooded ecotone is dominated by cyperus papyrus and phragmites mauritianus and the occasionally flooded ecotone is dominated by miscanthus junceus ellery et al 2003 in the lower delta water depths generally decrease downriver and average 1 m wilson and dincer 1976 the okavango river s gradient in the lower delta averages 1 3 300 gumbricht et al 2004 and the average river velocity is 0 01 m s wolski et al 2006 3 methods 3 1 data collection 3 1 1 water level water temperature river

conductivity calibration on the leveloggers according to solinst s instructions to ensure accurate readings the solinst ltc leveloggers are equipped with sensors which record river water level m water temperature c and specific conductance sc µs cm the water level sensor of the solinst ltc has an automatic temperature compensation for normalization the sensor records water level with an accuracy of 0 1 percentage of full scale and a temperature compensation range from 10 c to 40 c the 4 electrode conductivity sensor of the solinst ltc has a resolution of 1 µs cm with the ability to measure on a full range of 0 to 80 000 µs cm the conductivity sensor can operate in water temperatures ranging from 20 c to 80 c we also deployed solinst barologgers at the mohembo seronga ori island and maun stations the solinst barologgers record air temperature c and were programmed to record and convert barometric pressure to equivalent water level m using a conversion factor of 0 101972 m kpa the accuracy of the air temperature sensor is 0 05 c with a resolution of 0 003 c whilst the accuracy of the barologger pressure sensor is 0 05 kpa the solinst ltc barologgers were set to an altitude of 1006 m above sea level a s l for the mohembo and seronga stations 0 m a s l for the ori island station and 929 m a s l for the maun station at each of the 4 stations the levelogger was deployed in the water column in a perforated pvc tube and the barologger was deployed in the same pvc tube above the surface of the water the perforated tubes allowed for free flow of water to the leveloggers and air to the barologgers while also providing protection to the dataloggers from external interferences like curious wildlife and people the perforated tubes were strategically placed in locations along the river where there would be little to no external interferences the leveloggers and barologgers were set to collect data in a linear sampling mode at hourly intervals and data was collected from july 2010 to july 2012 upon completion of the monitoring the leveloggers were examined for presence of biofilm on the sensor surfaces to ensure that the recorded readings were accurate we found that there was no biofilm and coatings on the sensors as part of our data quality control for missing data in our long term monitoring data correction was performed using the regression imputation method where the regression equation of the variables of interest is employed instead of data removal or data smoothing for instance attempts to remove the barologger from the pvc casing by unknown individual s failed however the cord holding the barologger was cut in that attempt and the barologger fell to the bottom of the tube and was immersed in river thus it did not record the air temperature missing air temperature values n 11 291 from seronga were corrected using a regression equation of the relationship between the air temperature at the seronga station and that of mohembo station seronga air

covering the mohembo and seronga stations we selected the okavango research institute ori weather station to represent rainfall for the lower delta covering ori island and maun monthly rainfall data for the shakawe and ori weather stations were obtained from the archives of ori https okavangodata ub bw ori monitoring water 3 2 data analyses 3 2 1 total dissolved ions tdi estimates the total dissolved ions mg l were estimated from the specific conductance µs cm measurements recorded by leveloggers at the 4 stations e g oromeng et al 2021 the relationship between tdi and sc was established based on the assumption that tdi represents all the electrically conductive ionic species in river water lloyd and heathcote 1985 the tdi was estimated using a linear regression equation developed from the relationship between sc and tdi for 57 measurements across the delta oromeng et al 2021 atekwana unpublished 1 tdi 0 65 s c 0 38 where tdi is the total dissolved ions 0 65 is the slope of the linear regression 0 38 is the y intercept and sc is the specific conductance 3 2 2 normalization of river levels river water levels from the leveloggers were corrected for barometric pressure changes by subtracting the time equivalent barometric pressure values recorded by the barologger after compensating for barometric pressure changes we normalized water levels using the min max normalization method dawam and ku mahamud 2019 given by 2 nwl w l i w l min w l max w l min where nwl is the normalized water level wl i is the instantaneous water level at any time of interest wl min is the minimum water level and wl max is the highest water level measured for either the rising or receding limbs of an annual discharge hydrograph for the data with incomplete water level measurements i e unknown highest water level value for periods where discharge was measured we used the highest river discharge from data from the archives of ori discharge database during that time frame to determine the corresponding water level value using the following equations developed for the mohembo eqn 3 and the maun eqn 4 discharge measuring stations 3 log d i s c h arg e 1 5574 log w a t e r l e v e l 1

concentration normalized water level c nwl relationships c nwl matrix of linear slope β of the log c normalized water level regression was derived from log transformed tdi concentrations and normalized water level following methods from previous studies godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 which utilized log discharge instead of normalized water level the β was derived from the best fit equation of the linear regression of log c vs normalized water level in this case the c nwl relationships are defined by a power law function 5 c α n w l β where c is the instantaneous tdi concentration and nwl is the corresponding normalized water level the intercept α and the slope β of the power law are derived from the linear regressions of log c vs normalized water level a slope β near zero indicate little to no changes in concentration despite high variability in water levels chemostatic behavior a slope 0 depicts solute dilution and slope 0 depicts solute enrichment basu et al 2011 clow and mast 2010 godsey et al 2009 the slope β values were estimated on a daily timescale using the hourly measurements for every 24 h under the assumption that this is an adequate frequency to capture the temporal changes in solute concentrations and solute transport regimes oromeng et al 2021 the statistical analysis of the c nwl data was performed in microsoft excel and r studio 4 results 4 1 summary statistics the temporal measurements of tdi concentrations air temperature water temperature monthly rainfall amount and water levels from the mohembo seronga ori island and maun stations are presented in supplementary table 1 the summary statistics of the tdi concentrations air temperature water temperature monthly rainfall amount and normalized water levels are presented in table 1 4 2 spatial and temporal variations in tdi concentrations the tdi concentrations increase across the 4 stations mohembo seronga ori island and maun in the downriver direction fig 2 a b c and d fig 3 a the tdi concentrations in the panhandle of the delta at mohembo station ranged between 6 and 84 mg l with a mean of 17 11 mg l table 1 while at the seronga station the tdi concentrations ranged from 11 to 71 mg l with a mean of 27 13 mg l table 1 in the lower delta at ori island the tdi concentrations ranged between 28 and 61 mg l with a mean of 47 8 mg l and between 40 and 97 mg l with a mean of 71 9 mg l at the maun station table 1 at a temporal scale the tdi concentrations from the 4 stations showed distinct interannual seasonal and sub seasonal monthly weekly and daily variations fig 2a b c and d at an interannual scale the tdi concentrations were generally lower in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2012 at the seasonal scale the tdi concentrations in mohembo increased continuously from july to january which was followed by a sudden decrease to low tdi concentrations from february to july fig 2a the six month long period of low tdi concentrations was characterized by two prominent tdi concentration peaks in september and january followed by a general decrease in tdi concentrations to the next seasonal cycle in seronga we observed a continuous increase in tdi concentrations from august to december followed by a continuous decrease to lower concentration spanning january to august fig 2b during the period of lower tdi concentrations we observed a sub peak in tdi concentrations in june in the lower delta at ori island the tdi concentrations increased from september to peak concentrations in november followed by a slight decrease in tdi concentrations from december to march then increased to may before decreasing markedly to the lowest tdi concentrations in august fig 2c in maun the seasonal tdi concentrations showed peaks in october and january and the tdi concentrations were lower in february and june fig 2d the sub seasonal behavior of the tdi concentrations varied downriver fig 2a b c and d at the mohembo station we observe higher frequency variation in the tdi concentration peaks between june and january and very little concentration fluctuation during the period of low tdi concentrations fig 2a at the seronga station there are more sub seasonal changes in the tdi concentrations near the tdi concentration peaks which make these peaks much broader compared to those observed at the mohembo station at the ori station the sub seasonal concentration changes are small in maun the sub seasonal tdi concentrations showed much higher frequency and were much broader near the peak tdi concentrations 4 3 spatial and temporal variations in air temperature and water temperature in mohembo the air temperature ranged between 0 5 and 46 c with a mean of 23 7 c while the water temperature ranged from 14 to 31 c with a mean of 24 4 c table 1 in seronga the air temperature ranged between 6 and 41 c with a mean of 23 6 c while the water temperature ranged from 14 to 30 c with a mean of 23 4 c table 1 the air temperatures at ori island ranged between 6 and 39 c with a mean of 23 7 c while the water temperature ranged from 15 to 29 c with a mean of 24 3 c table 1 in maun air temperatures ranged between 2 and 43 c with a mean of 23 7 c while water temperature ranged from 13 to 31 c with a mean of 24 4 c table 1 higher air temperatures fig 2e f g and h and water temperatures fig 2i j k and l were observed during the rainy season between september and april and lower air temperatures and water temperatures were observed during the dry season between may and august there is little spatial variability in the air and water temperatures across the okavango delta as observed at the mohembo seronga ori island and maun stations fig 3b and c we observed similar annual seasonal and sub seasonal patterns in air temperatures fig 2e f g and h and water temperatures fig 2i j k and l across the okavango delta the sub seasonal range in air temperature is much greater than water temperatures 4 4 spatial and temporal variations in monthly rain and normalized water levels 4 4 1 temporal monthly rainfall the rainy season in the okavango delta spanned november to may fig 2m n o and p the dry season spanned june to september at mohembo and seronga the monthly rainfall ranged from 0 to 143 mm with a mean of 38 49 mm table 1 peak monthly rainfall occurred in january in the lower delta monthly rainfall at ori island and maun ranged from 0 to 213 mm with a mean of 40 63 mm table 1 monthly rainfall peaked at 213 mm in december 2010 peak rainfall in the okavango delta fig 2m n o and p is out of phase with peak discharge fig 2q r s and t 4 4 2 normalized water level the relationships between solute concentrations and normalized water levels c nwl at the inlet station at mohembo and at the delta outlet station in maun show similar behavior to the relationships observed between solute concentrations and river discharge c q in the oromeng et al 2021 study supplementary fig 2 and 3 indicating that normalized water levels provide good qualitative characterization of hydrologic controls on solute concentrations as river discharge changes in the panhandle of the delta the normalized water level hydrograph at mohembo showed rising water levels beginning in november and peaking in may with sub peaks occurring in february and april fig 2q the rising water levels are then followed by a 6 month long recession from june to november before water levels begin to rise steadily during the next hydrologic year fig 2q the water level hydrograph in seronga mimics that of mohembo and is characterized by a steady increase in water levels from january to may the rising limb of the hydrograph showed a sub peak in february fig 2r the rising water levels are then followed by a 7 month long recession spanning june to december before water levels began to rise steadily marking the beginning of the next flooding cycle fig 2r in the lower delta at ori island the hydrograph showed that normalized water levels began increasing in january and peaking in june with minor sub peaks observed in january fig 2s the hydrograph recession spanned july to december fig 2s the normalized water level hydrograph at maun showed rising water levels beginning in march and peaking in august with occurrence of a sub peak in january fig 2t the peak water levels were followed by decreasing water levels from july to february with a sub peak in january fig 2t 5 discussion 5 1 spatial and temporal shifts in the river solute concentrations the results of our investigation of the spatial and temporal changes of the solute concentrations in the okavango river show downriver enrichment in the tdi concentrations across the delta e g fig 3a and seasonal and sub seasonal shifts in solute concentrations observed at the different monitoring stations across the delta fig 2a b c and d the spatial and temporal variability in river solute concentrations can be linked to two main processes 1 climate driven evapotranspiration et characterized by seasonality and 2 sub seasonal scale hydrologically driven differential solute transfer from the local watershed into the river which is superimposed on the seasonal et driven response 5 2 et as the persistent driver of the downriver solute increase across the okavango delta the average tdi concentrations progressively increase downriver at a rate of 0 11 mg l per km based on the linear regression model mean tdi 0 11 distance 12 25 r2 0 89 of tdi concentrations vs distance from the mohembo station to the maun station fig 3a alternatively we could fit the data with an exponential model and obtain a similar tdi concentration change rate of 0 1 mg l per km the mean annual air temperatures do not differ much for the different stations across the delta fig 3b indicating that the local weather conditions were identical across the delta similarly the mean annual water temperatures do not differ much for the different stations across the delta fig 3c indicating that there were no differences in the river water temperature across the delta thus the downriver increase in the solute concentrations is attributed to et driven progressive evapoconcentration e g sawula and martins 1991 mccarthy et al 1993 akoko et al 2013 atekwana et al 2016 mosimane et al 2017 mogobe et al 2018 oromeng et al 2021 letshele et al 2023 consistent with the 5 months river transit time the flood peak took to travel the 450 km from the proximal portion of the delta in mohembo to the distal portion of the delta in maun the standard deviations from the annual mean tdi concentrations for each of the stations on the linear regression model fig 3a speak to additional non evaporative processes causing changes in the river solute concentrations on a temporal scale the effects of et on tdi concentrations should correspond to seasonality where solute concentration enrichment should be observed during the hot rainy season when et rates are higher however seasonal tdi concentration peaks observed at the 4 stations across the delta fig 2a b c and d do not always coincide with peak seasonal high air temperatures fig 2e f g h and seasonal high water temperatures fig 2i j k and l the poor correspondence of the seasonal and sub seasonal peaks in the tdi concentrations and water temperatures can be used to argue that other processes besides et play a role in controlling the temporal solute chemistry of the okavango river 5 3 hydrologically driven modifications of the solute behavior in the okavango river our results of the spatial and temporal variations in the tdi concentrations in the okavango river e g fig 2a b c and d and fig 3a show spatial and temporal heterogeneity evident in the distinct signatures of both dilution and solute enrichment across our stations spatial and temporal variations in tdi concentrations can be linked to specific hydrological processes e g boyer et al 1997 ahearn et al 2004 dalzell et al 2007 liu et al 2008 geeraert et al 2017 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 duvert et al 2020 developing over the large spatial scale of the delta the hydrology of the okavango river is controlled by an annual flood pulse from the upper watershed in angola which contributes a mean annual inflow of 9 2 109 m3 y to the delta and by seasonal rains which contribute an additional 6 109 m3 y to the delta s hydrology mccarthy and ellery 1998 merron 1991 thus if hydrology drives the temporal perturbations in the river solute behavior we should observe modifications in the solute concentrations from the pulse flooding spanning march to september fig 2q r s and t and from local rains which span november through march fig 2m n o and p the addition of fresh water with low salinity or low dissolved solutes from the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains is expected to induce dilution in the river solute concentrations e g ahearn et al 2004 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 to understand the role of the pulse flooding and rains in driving the seasonal and sub seasonal perturbations in the river solute behavior we utilized the temporal slopes β of the relationship between solute concentrations and normalized water levels as a determinant of whether increases in water levels cause solute enrichment or dilution godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 in addition we assessed the relationship between solute concentrations and normalized water levels c nwl relationship to get additional insights on discharge timing and solute delivery into the river we observed that the behavior of solutes was similar during different rising and receding limbs indicating that similar processes control the solute behavior regardless of the timing of the hydrologic event figs 4 5 6 and 7 5 3 1 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations in the upper watershed above the delta the normalized water level nwl hydrographs at our stations are color differentiated based on the rising and falling limbs over time we show the nwl hydrograph for the mohembo station fig 4a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 4b the temporal slopes β fig 4c and the c nwl relationships fig 4d for the rising and falling limbs of the nwl hydrographs the changes in the tdi concentrations at the mohembo station are reflective of solute behavior controlled by processes occurring in the upper watershed in namibia and angola the upper watershed above the mohembo station where all the river flow is sourced from cubango and cuito rivers is dominated by a temperate climate peel et al 2007 groundwater influx into the river at baseflow steudel et al 2013 causes solute enrichment during low flow conditions in the okavango river as reflected by the temporal increases in the tdi concentrations fig 4b and in slope values of 0 fig 4c at low flow october to january the solute enrichment occurring at low flow could also be attributed to wet season storage of floodwaters in the vast floodplains of the cubango and cuito rivers which is released into the river during the dry season steudel et al 2013 the increasing river solute concentrations are also observed on the c nwl relationships at low flow to 0 5 nwl during the rising limb of the hydrograph and from 0 5 nwl to low flow on the receding limb of the hydrograph fig 4d these observed enrichment episodes at low flow are attenuated by two dilution episodes occurring mid flow 0 5 nwl fig 4d in the rising limb of the discharge hydrograph february fig 4b and 0 7 to 0 5 nwl fig 4d during the falling limb of the discharge hydrograph may fig 4b the dilution of tdi concentrations back to baseline solute concentrations between mid flow and peak flow can be attributed to the supply of runoff from the cuito and cubango sub watersheds in the form of the annual flooding 5 3 2 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations in the panhandle region of the delta the variations of the tdi concentrations relative to normalized water levels at the seronga station fig 5 capture the solute concentration modifications within the panhandle portion of the delta the nwl hydrograph for seronga fig 5a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 5b the temporal slopes β fig 5c and the c nwl relationships fig 5d for the rising and falling limbs of the nwl hydrograph are also shown unlike at mohembo the arrival of the flood pulse at seronga induces solute dilution during the rising limb of the hydrograph fig 5c and d as the previously increasing tdi concentrations with decreasing water levels sharply decreases as the flood recedes water enriched in solutes drains into the river with decreasing water levels evidenced by the temporal slopes with β 0 fig 5c during flood recession october to january and the solute enrichment between 0 3 nwl to low flow from c nwl relationships fig 5d the river water with enriched solutes could be from the drainage of the riparian swamps delivering dissolved salts sourced from the tree islands and isolated wetland pools in the panhandle to the river as the flood recedes this explanation is consistent with solute particularly carbon delivery into the river in the panhandle during flow recession captured in the akoko et al 2013 study 5 3 3 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations in the lower delta region for the ori island station we show the nwl hydrograph fig 6a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 6b the temporal slopes β fig 6c and the c nwl relationships fig 6d for the rising and falling limbs of the nwl hydrograph we observe minimal solute response in the river at the ori island station compared to the mohembo and seronga stations as reflected in the temporal slopes plot where β 0 fig 6c and where the tdi concentrations are nearly constant from 0 4 nwl to peak flow fig 6d however the tdi concentrations slightly increase from 0 4 nwl to low flow on the falling limbs fig 5d the relatively small change in the solute concentration in the river in this reach where the wetlands are seasonally flooded mladenov et al 2005 wolski et al 2006 is indicative of a more homogeneous solute reservoir feeding the river as river water flows from the confined panhandle to the upper portion of the lower delta it spreads out into a distributary system thus the minimal change in the solute concentrations as the flood pulse advances and recedes may be because the absolute amount of new water delivered to this portion of the boro river that flows through the ori station is a small fraction of the discharge of the okavango river flowing through the panhandle we note that there is a slight decrease in the tdi concentrations in the lower delta during the rainy season december february from low water to about 0 4 nwl during the rising limbs fig 6b and d the annual flood pulse causes a marked decrease in the tdi concentrations from may to november and between nwl of 0 7 and peak discharge on the rising limb and from peak discharge to 0 4 nwl on the receding limb of the nwl hydrograph nevertheless it appears that the amount of new river water from the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains cause only limited mixing and dilution of solutes in the river and that the temporal slopes of 0 fig 6c indicate a similar solute source alternatively we hypothesize that the river water flow from the panhandle confined flow with transverse width of 12 km spreads across a much larger portion of the wetland transverse width of 150 km for distributaries tooth and mccarthy 2004 in the lower delta in this scenario water in the river is a much smaller component compared to water in the wetland that interacts with the river in addition since the river near the ori island station is close to a tree island the minimal change in the solute concentrations may be due to the unidirectional et driven water flow towards the tree island e g mccarthy et al 1991 mladenov et al 2014 ramberg and wolski 2008 which results in little to no solute transfer from the floodplains into the river along this river reach and similar reaches 5 3 4 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations at the outlet of the delta for the maun station we show the nwl hydrograph fig 7a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 7b the temporal slopes β fig 7c and the c nwl relationships fig 7d for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph at maun the river is confined and thus the water that spread out from the distributary system and over a much broader wetland area in the lower delta region at the ori island reach is channeled through a narrow 30 100 m width channel we observe mostly a dilution driven solute response in the river characterized by slope values of β 0 during flow recession from july november fig 7c the decreases in the tdi concentrations are observed from 0 8 nwl to peak flow fig 7d it is evident that the change in the river morphology and therefore the river water wetland interaction between the lower delta and the delta outlet plays a significant role in the differences in the solute response in the lower delta at the ori island and the outlet of the delta in maun the river channel at the outlet in maun is basically a collection system because the river at this location has relatively limited interaction with wetlands compared to the river at the ori station fig 1 at the maun station the tdi concentrations increase during flood recession from july to november and show greater variability compared to the flood recession from october to february or during the flood rise from february to june fig 7b although the tdi concentrations fig 7b increase during the flood recession fig 7a the slopes are 0 and indicate a source of water with lower solute concentrations consistent with dilution during this period fig 7c additionally the effect of seasonal rains is observable in the hydrograph from december to march fig 7a accompanied by tdi concentration decreases fig 7b yet the slope values β 0 indicate no change in solute source 7c the c nwl is relatively flat from 0 4 nwl to low flow fig 7d it therefore appears that during the rainy season the falling rains which may have interacted with the solute reservoirs in the delta wetland precipitates on the floodplain and on the islands and the isolated evaporated wetland pools and the broader watershed may not have transferred enough solutes into the river to cause significant enrichment in the river solutes alternatively since our monitoring period was during the transition from the drought and flood period the delta was significantly flooded and several intermittent channels flowed after 15 y of no flow therefore the dilution response in the okavango river at the outlet may be due to the contribution of additional fresh water from the newly flowing channels in the lower delta 5 4 implications of the variable solute responses across endorheic basins our results show spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the river solute response driven by hydrologic processes et and the changing river morphology across the endorheic okavango river basin our findings demonstrate that in endorheic basins where river flow is highly variable and et rates are high water movement and solute processing in rivers are strongly governed by hydrology and et which causes salt accumulation on the basin surface yapiyev et al 2017 and evapoconcentration of solutes in the river and in wetlands in addition the diverse morphology of rivers draining endorheic basins modifies river flow and solute behavior across the basin and typically transitions from 1 channel systems in the headwaters originating from mountains or highlands e g upper okavango river basin fig 8 to 2 a well defined and confined channel dominated by advective transport panhandle fig 8 then 3 a dispersal system forming a lower delta area lower delta region fig 8 and 4 an outlet channel delta outlet fig 8 through which water is exported from the delta area to a terminal lake e g lake ngami similar to the okavango river several other river systems in endorheic basins exhibit changing river morphology for instance the helmand river drains the transboundary endorheic helmand basin occupying parts of afghanistan pakistan and iran the helmand river transitions from the upper delta in the headwaters to the lower delta comprised of wetlands then flow towards the lowest part ending in a hypersaline lake named gowd e zareh vekerdy et al 2006 yapiyev et al 2017 this diverse morphology of rivers in endorheic basins that modifies water flow and solute transport has implications for the characterization of spatial solute dynamics the design of water quality monitoring regimes and water management decision making across endorheic basins the upper watershed section segment 1 fig 8 is characterized by variable solute responses in the channel system driven by episodic solute enrichment from river connectivity to groundwater and river floodplain interaction involving the release of solute enriched water packages from floodplains into the river during low flow and dilution from flooding at high flow unlike the upper watershed the lower watershed area hosting segments 2 3 and 4 fig 8 are characterized by groundwater recharge by the river and solute enrichment from river interaction with solute stores in the local watershed the difference in the river groundwater wetland interaction between the upper watershed and lower watershed area is typical of river basins transcending different climatic conditions for instance the okavango river basin spans from temperate climate in the upper watershed to semi arid climate within the lower watershed area and thus providing interesting insights on the hydrologic controls of solute behavior in settings with both effluent and influent rivers draining an endorheic basin the water exiting the upper watershed flows within a well defined and confined channel in the middle section of the basin segment 2 fig 8 which transports solutes to the lower delta area owing to the channel confinement and associated faster flow the flowing water in the channel has a shorter residence time resulting mostly in advection dominating over the effects of et in the river channel in this river segment the river interacts with riparian swamps which drain solute enriched water into the river at low flow and flooding induces dilution in the river at high flow the solute responses in the middle segment of basins are crucial for determining solute cycling and solute transport rates in faster flowing confined channels with episodic solute input from riparian wetlands upon reaching the terminus of an endorheic basin the river spreads out into distributary channels forming the lower delta region segment 3 fig 8 the lower delta is dominated by dispersive transport of water and solutes gooseff et al 2008 which allows for extensive river floodplain wetland island interaction due to the water dispersion in the lower delta water depths are shallow and river flow is slower gooseff et al 2008 thereby increasing the residence time of water in the lower delta which predisposes the water to pronounced effects of et in endorheic basins although one would expect high solute variability in the lower delta area from river floodplain wetland island interaction and et the occurrence of location specific solute response of minimal solute variability can be observed in the distributary channels depending on the amount of water and solutes delivered from the upper delta to the different river reaches in the lower delta area and the extent of river floodplain wetland island interaction along the river reaches the location specific solute responses in the lower delta region of endorheic basins have implications for constraining solute behavior in lower delta areas as it may be highly variable both in space and time the outlet of the delta area segment 4 fig 8 acts as a collection system where water exported out of the delta area is channeled through a narrow river channel the solute dynamics at the delta outlet is dependent on the solute concentrations of the exported water from the lower delta such that if the water from the lower delta region did not accumulate solutes to cause significant solute enrichment in the river the outlet will show a dilution driven response thus the delta outlet is a good point to monitor solute load and outflux from the delta area of endorheic basins which has implications for quantifying salt contribution of inland deltas to downstream lakes and salt pans the variable solute responses in the different segments of a river in an endorheic basin show that river systems in endorheic basins can be complex and it may be misleading to describe them as single hydrochemical response river systems the river connectivity to solute stores salt precipitates and isolated wetland pools in the local watershed e g covino 2017 observed across the different segments of the river geometry mostly at lower flow e g figs 4 6 and 7 highlights the existence of hydro geochemical hot moments created by hydrology and hotspots within floodplains salt islands and isolated wetland pools in endorheic basins the hot moments in rivers in endorheic basins are characterized by solute enrichments occurring mostly at low flow which are attenuated to baseline river chemistry by pulse flooding and storm events we propose that the hydrologic reset of hot moments in the river to baseline river chemistry helps maintain the surface water resources fresh in endorheic basins by diluting river solutes and evapoconcentrated solutes in wetland water and by facilitating the flushing of solutes out of the delta area via hydrologic solute flushing as suggested for the okavango delta by ramatlapeng et al 2021 under the ongoing climate change which is projected to significantly affect river inflow by reducing precipitation while simultaneously increasing et in endorheic basins such as the okavango river basin milzow et al 2010 the main mechanisms ie hydrologic reset in the river and hydrologic solute flushing from the delta maintaining surface waters fresh are under great threat the projected increasing aridity in most endorheic basins will impact the hydrochemical status of the rivers by enhancing salinization and thereby affecting the river s ecological functioning and water quality status 6 conclusions a high frequency time series investigation of solutes conducted in the okavango river across the okavango delta in the middle kalahari desert in botswana showed marked spatial and temporal variability in solute concentrations the variations in river solute concentrations are controlled by two main processes that modify solute behavior 1 seasonal climate driven evapotranspiration et and 2 hydrologically driven differential solute transfer from the local wetlands into the okavango river at the spatial scale et causes progressive downriver enrichment in tdi concentrations at 0 1 mg l per km of river flow at a temporal scale the tdi concentrations increase from evapoconcentration during the hot rainy season and decrease from an annual pulse flooding additionally superimposed on the seasonal solute behavior are sub seasonal solute transfer from the floodplains salt islands and isolated evaporated wetland pools initiated by hydrologic piston flow during rising flooding and drainage into the river during flood recession the influx of solutes into the river by pulse flooding helps maintain the delta in pristine freshwater conditions by facilitating solute flushing and export out of the delta our findings indicate that the temporal hydrology river connectivity to solute stores in the local watershed and evapotranspiration jointly control the solute behavior at variable spatial and temporal scales in rivers in arid watersheds and that concentration normalized water levels c nwl relationships constructed from high resolution time series data are useful in characterizing solute dynamics in

2177,solute cycling models for rivers in arid watersheds must identify solute sources and their spatial and temporal connectivity to rivers to assess the processes that control the solute behavior in these rivers in this study we collected hourly time series of total dissolved ions tdi concentrations water levels water temperatures and air temperatures at select stations distributed longitudinally in a river in an arid watershed our objectives were to 1 document the spatial and temporal variations in solute concentrations and 2 determine the processes controlling the spatial and temporal variations in solute concentrations we conducted this investigation over a two year period at four stations along the okavango river flowing through the okavango delta delta in the middle kalahari desert botswana at the spatial scale we observed progressive downriver enrichment in tdi concentrations associated with evapotranspiration of river water because of the 5 months river transit across the hot delta at a temporal scale the tdi concentrations increased seasonally from evapoconcentration and sub seasonally from solute transfer from the watershed to the river we analyzed sub seasonal tdi concentration perturbations using the slope β of the relationship between tdi concentrations and normalized water level c nwl relationships we find that at low discharge during flow recession and at the beginning of rising discharge from flooding the solute enrichment anomalies with β 0 are related to hydrologic connectivity between the river and solute stores in the river floodplains hundreds of thousands of salt islands and isolated evapoconcentrated wetland pools our findings indicate that hydrologically driven river connectivity to solute stores in the local watershed and evapotranspiration jointly control the solute behavior at variable spatial and temporal scales in rivers in arid watersheds we anticipate that our findings will inform solute transport and solute cycling models for rivers in arid watersheds keywords time series investigation total dissolved ions solute cycling concentration normalized water level endorheic basin okavango delta data availability data are published as supplementary table 1 introduction rivers act as conduits of water and solutes dissolved ions in water out of the river basin in exorheic basins and to the terminus of endorheic basins solute transformation across river basins and the role of rivers in solute transport make rivers an important component of the global solute cycle studies in exorheic basins typically found in humid environments have advanced our knowledge and understanding of source s of solutes solute transport in stream processes and catchment specific characteristics that control the spatial and temporal variability in solute behavior fovet et al 2018 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 wymore et al 2020 liu et al 2020 knowledge on solute cycling in exorheic basins is critical for quantifying weathering fluxes solute load and solute export out of basins to oceans which has implications for the global oceanic solute cycle comparatively limited studies e g oromeng et al 2021 letshele et al 2023 have been conducted in rivers draining endorheic basins in arid environments to understand the processes controlling the spatial and temporal variability of solutes and solute cycling perhaps because endorheic basins are disconnected from the ocean and thus are regarded as unimportant in the global cycling of solutes nevertheless endorheic basins occupy 20 23 of the earth s surface nichols 2007 nyberg et al 2018 which we use to suggest that substantial amounts of solutes transferred from the upper portions of watersheds are transformed in the rivers and stored at the terminus of endorheic basins in spite of the potential importance of terrestrial solute cycling at the local and regional levels in endorheic basins the processes that control the cycling of solutes are not well understood because of limited investigations a study by oromeng et al 2021 conducted in the endorheic okavango river basin provided much needed insights on the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on the river solute behavior a study of the okavango river by letshele et al 2023 showed that downriver solute enrichment was related to the d excess parameter derived from the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of river water additionally the letshele et al 2023 study also found marked disagreement between the mean tdi mean d excess model and tdi d excess data from previous studies which was used to invoke non evaporative solute enrichment in the okavango delta the oromeng et al 2021 and the letshele et al 2023 studies can be used to suggest that more work still needs to be done to constrain the spatio temporal controls of solute cycling across large spatial scales and over short to long term timescales in endorheic basins understanding solute cycling in endorheic basins has implications for knowing the river salinity status which impacts water quality and river ecology unlike exorheic basins in humid environments the hydrology of rivers in endorheic basins in arid environments is characterized by highly variable river flow and downriver water transmission losses to groundwater and evapotranspiration yet little is known on how the downriver modifications of water and solutes modulates solute behavior at various temporal scales understanding the spatial and temporal river solute dynamics across river basins requires assessments of river discharge and solute concentrations with a temporal resolution adequate to capture processes occurring at multiple locations across the basin hydrochemical investigations utilize river discharge to constrain hydrologic controls on solute behavior in rivers e g evans and davies 1998 godsey et al 2009 moatar et al 2017 zhi et al 2018 oromeng et al 2021 however there are many rivers that are ungauged and those that are gauged may not be gauged at locations useful for experiments that investigate the spatial evolution of the hydrochemistry of rivers the lack of discharge measurements for many ungauged rivers and at select river segments may be due to difficulties in defining river channel cross sectional area and measuring flow velocity for example measuring discharge in braided stream reaches and reaches with extensive wetlands can be challenging and thus will impact our ability to assess discharge related solute behavior a way to meet this challenge in studying discharged based solute behavior is a qualitative comparison where relative water level changes at multiple river reaches can be considered a proxy for discharge supplementary fig 1 the water levels for each measured reach are normalized and used as a relative indicator of discharge the normalization can be tested by comparing the solute behavior using normalized water levels with the solute behavior where river discharge is measured along the river supplementary fig 1 if the solute discharge and solute normalized water levels relationships show similar temporal behavior then the normalized water levels can be used as a proxy for discharge in ungauged river segments hydrochemical studies of solute behavior in rivers take into consideration both river discharge and solute concentrations the solute dynamics can be characterized using the total dissolved ions tdi which are reflective of the gross river solute composition e g oromeng et al 2021 tdi concentrations can be measured by electronic meters and recorded and stored in data loggers at a much higher frequency than can be measured manually thus assessing the relationship between solute concentrations as tdi and normalized water levels c nwl relationship at high frequency during different flow regimes across a river basin will allow us to tease out salient solute behavior patterns driven by variable processes we investigated the processes controlling the spatial and temporal solute behavior in the okavango river in northwestern botswana the okavango river flows in an endorheic basin the okavango river basin hereafter referred to as the orb the orb covers two climatic regimes from a higher rainfall temperate region in angola to the steppe middle kalahari desert in botswana ellery et al 2003 peel et al 2007 near the terminus of the orb lies the okavango delta delta the okavango river meanders extensively through a narrow valley of the panhandle region of the delta before it disperses into a series of distributary channels on a large alluvial fan forming the lower delta region in the lower delta region the river is mostly characterized by braided flow through the okavango delta wetlands the hydrology of the delta is highly variable and controlled by an annual flood pulse initiated by rains from the upper watershed in angola and by local rains e g wolski et al 2005 the delta and its wetlands are subjected to high evapotranspiration et rates which cause salt precipitation on floodplains and on the numerous tree islands in the delta wetlands e g mccarthy et al 1991 1998 gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 gumbricht et al 2004 akondi et al 2019 evapotranspiration also causes enrichment of solutes in isolated wetland pools scattered across the delta e g dincer et al 1979 the role that these solute stores ie floodplains salt islands and isolated wetland pools which are distributed differentially across the delta have on the okavango river solute cycling is yet to be investigated investigations of the solute behavior in the okavango river in the delta conducted at the proximal portion of the delta in mohembo oromeng et al 2021 and distal portion of the delta in maun oromeng et al 2021 ramatlapeng et al 2021 have suggested that hydrologic connectivity between the okavango river and solute stores in the local watershed and evapotranspiration control the spatial and temporal river solute behavior although the oromeng et al 2021 and ramatlapeng et al 2021 studies have provided insights on the role of hydrology and evapotranspiration in controlling solute behavior at the inlet and outlet of the delta there is still a lack of understanding of the processes driving the variations in river solute concentrations both in space and time for the nearly 450 km river distance between the delta inlet and outlet e g letshele et al 2023 the delta serves as an important source of potable water and food fish water lily to the riparian communities mosepele et al 2006 2009 kgathi et al 2006 and therefore studying the processes that may affect the solute behavior in the delta is crucial for water quality monitoring and ecological sustainability in this study we made hourly measurements of tdi concentrations water level air temperature and water temperature at 4 stations located spatially across the delta our objectives were to 1 document the spatial and temporal variations of solutes and 2 determine the processes controlling variations in solute concentrations in the okavango river we used tdi concentrations to characterize solute behavior and air temperature and water temperature to assess seasonality and climatic controls on solute behavior in the river we utilized normalized water levels to elucidate the influence of hydrological changes on solute behavior monitoring hydrologic water level hydrochemical tdi concentrations and climatic water and air temperature controls at a high frequency allowed us to assess solute behavior dynamics occurring at seasonal and sub seasonal timescales across the delta the placement of one of our stations at the inlet of the delta captured solute transport and processes influenced by the upper headwater catchments localized chemical transformation in the delta which controls the solute dynamics that affect the delta and its wetlands was assessed for two stations within the delta and a station at the river exit from the delta the findings from our study provide insights on the hydrologic climatic and geomorphological processes controlling the spatio temporal solute behavior in okavango delta and is applicable to other rivers in endorheic basins 2 the okavango delta 2 1 location the delta lies near the terminus of the endorheic orb this study was conducted along the okavango river located between latitudes 18 and 21 s and longitudes 22 and 24 e in the okavango delta in northwest botswana fig 1 the upper watershed of the orb comprises the cubango and cuito basins which are drained by the cubango river and cuito river respectively and merge in angola to form the okavango river the okavango river enters the delta in botswana at mohembo and flows for 450 km from the inlet to the outlet of the delta in maun the delta consists of a panhandle region and a lower delta region the panhandle of the delta is a 6 000 km2 valley through which the okavango river meanders before branching out into distributary channels forming the lower delta the lower delta is an alluvial fan with a surface area of 22 000 km2 mccarthy et al 1992 and lies in the quaternary half graben of the okavango rift zone mccarthy et al 1993 modisi et al 2000 kinabo et al 2007 2008 bufford et al 2012 the landscape of the delta has been shaped by neotectonics river sedimentation formation of channels channel avulsion and wetland development mccarthy and ellery 1994 mccarthy et al 1998 the topographical elevations vary from 1025 m where the okavango river flows into the delta at mohembo to 920 m in the mababe depression gumbricht et al 2001 the topography of the delta is relatively flat mccarthy et al 1998 mccarthy 2006 with gentle undulations where the local relief rarely exceeds 2 m except for areas with termite mounds and islands mccarthy et al 1998 gumbricht et al 2001 mccarthy 2006 2 2 geology the cubango and cuito sub basins in the upper orb in angola lie on the precambrian congo craton the cuito basin and southern part of the cubango sub basins are covered by the karoo supergroup sedimentary rocks overlain by thick unconsolidated kalahari sands clays lime rock and lateritic layers of the kalahari superior formation bereslawski 1997 catuneanu et al 2005 jones 2010 the headwater portion of the cubango sub basin is underlain by a crystalline precambrian bedrock comprising granite and dolerite bereslawski 1997 jones 2010 in the okavango delta the bedrock geology is comprised of precambrian crystalline rocks of the damara and ghanzi chobe orogenic belt modie 2000 milzow et al 2009 the surficial geology consists of the quaternary kalahari alluvium and recent swamp sediments overlying 105 175 m of lacustrine and fluvio deltaic sediments ringrose et al 2009 at the surface the sediments in the okavango delta are mostly sands with varying proportions of silt clays and carbonates huntsman mapila et al 2005 the surficial sediments originate from a mixture of aeolian quartz diagenetic carbonates and components of weathered proterozoic granitoids and mafic ultramafic rocks exposed in the northwestern part of botswana huntsman mapila et al 2005 2 3 climate the climate of the orb ranges from a temperate climate in the angolan highlands to a steppe arid kalahari desert in northwestern botswana peel et al 2007 the climate is characterized by a wet season which spans from november to march and a dry season which spans from april to october mccarthy and ellery 1994 milzow et al 2009 steudel et al 2013 the mean annual rainfall in the upper watershed is 1100 mm pombo et al 2015 in the delta the mean annual rainfall ranges between 455 and 490 mm mccarthy et al 2000 temperatures in the upper orb range between 13 and 17 c during the dry season and from 20 to 25 c during the wet season baumberg et al 2014 the highest mean monthly maximum temperatures over the delta ranges between 32 and 35 c during the wet season and the lowest mean monthly minimum temperatures range from 2 to 7 c during the dry season moses and gondwe 2019 the delta is subjected to high temperatures with an estimated potential evapotranspiration of 2172 mm y which is 4 times greater than the rainfall received in the delta wilson and dincer 1976 thus evapotranspiration has a profound effect on the water balance in the delta and contributes to the development and growth of the 150 000 tree island complexes scattered across the delta gumbricht and mccarthy 2003 the tree islands cover 5 of the permanently flooded ecotone 25 of the seasonal ecotone and 50 of the occasionally flooded ecotone gumbricht et al 2004 humphries et al 2014 evapoconcentration also causes enrichment of solutes in the numerous isolated surface water pools scattered in the delta s seasonally and occasionally flooded ecotones mccarthy et al 1998 2 4 hydrology the cuito and cubango rivers in the upper watershed in angola contribute about 45 and 55 of the discharge respectively to the okavango river flowing through the delta mendelsohn and el obeid 2004 the hydrology of the okavango river and delta is primarily driven by an annual flood derived from the highlands of angola and by local rains the mean annual inflow of water from the upper watershed to the delta is 9 2 109 m3 y and the seasonal rains contribute an additional 6 109 m3 y mccarthy and ellery 1998 merron 1991 the annual flood pulse reaches the inlet to the delta in mohembo between february and may and gradually flows across the delta as a progressive wave to the outlet of the delta in maun for 4 6 months mccarthy and metcalfe 1990 mccarthy and ellery 1998 as the flood advances across the delta the area inundated varies from an annual low of 4500 6000 km2 to an annual high of 9000 12 000 km2 ramberg and wolski 2008 because the kalahari sands in the delta have relatively high hydraulic conductivity 10 30 m day and porosity 30 obakeng and gieske 1997 the slow propagation of the flood wave is accompanied by groundwater recharge in the shallow unconfined aquifer mccarthy 2006 making the okavango river influent the deepening of the groundwater table away from the okavango river and delta wetlands is evidence for groundwater recharge by the okavango river mccarthy et al 1997 ellery et al 2003 mccarthy 2006 milzow et al 2009 akondi et al 2019 the variable flooding in the delta creates vegetation zonations mladenov et al 2005 wolski et al 2006 the panhandle region is in the permanently flooded ecotone dominated by grass miscanthus junceus reeds phragmites australis and giant sedges cyperus papyrus ellery et al 2003 on the channel margins water depths average 1 5 m wilson and dincer 1976 average river gradient is 1 5500 gumbricht et al 2004 and the river flows at a velocity of 0 4 0 8 m s within the channel wolski et al 2006 the lower delta has seasonally flooded and occasionally flooded ecotones the seasonally flooded ecotone is dominated by cyperus papyrus and phragmites mauritianus and the occasionally flooded ecotone is dominated by miscanthus junceus ellery et al 2003 in the lower delta water depths generally decrease downriver and average 1 m wilson and dincer 1976 the okavango river

conductivity calibration on the leveloggers according to solinst s instructions to ensure accurate readings the solinst ltc leveloggers are equipped with sensors which record river water level m water temperature c and specific conductance sc µs cm the water level sensor of the solinst ltc has an automatic temperature compensation for normalization the sensor records water level with an accuracy of 0 1 percentage of full scale and a temperature compensation range from 10 c to 40 c the 4 electrode conductivity sensor of the solinst ltc has a resolution of 1 µs cm with the ability to measure on a full range of 0 to 80 000 µs cm the conductivity sensor can operate in water temperatures ranging from 20 c to 80 c we also deployed solinst barologgers at the mohembo seronga ori island and maun stations the solinst barologgers record air temperature c and were programmed to record and convert barometric pressure to equivalent water level m using a conversion factor of 0 101972 m kpa the accuracy of the air temperature sensor is 0 05 c with a resolution of 0 003 c whilst the accuracy of the barologger pressure sensor is 0 05 kpa the solinst ltc barologgers were set to an altitude of 1006 m above sea level a s l for the mohembo and seronga stations 0 m a s l for the ori island station and 929 m a s l for the maun station at each of the 4 stations the levelogger was deployed in the water column in a perforated pvc tube and the barologger was deployed in the same pvc tube above the surface of the water the perforated tubes allowed for free flow of water to the leveloggers and air to the barologgers while also providing protection to the dataloggers from external interferences like curious wildlife and people the perforated tubes were strategically placed in locations along the river where there would be little to no external interferences the leveloggers and barologgers were set to collect data in a linear sampling mode at hourly intervals and data was collected from july 2010 to july 2012 upon completion of the monitoring the leveloggers were examined for presence of biofilm on the sensor surfaces to ensure that the recorded readings were accurate we found that there was no biofilm and coatings on the sensors as part of our data quality control for missing data in our long term monitoring data correction was performed using the regression imputation method where the regression equation of the variables of interest is employed instead of data removal or data smoothing for instance attempts to remove the barologger from the pvc casing by unknown individual s failed however the cord holding the barologger was cut in that attempt and the barologger fell to the bottom of the tube and was immersed in river thus it did not record the air temperature missing air temperature values n 11 291 from seronga were corrected using a regression equation of the relationship between the air temperature at the seronga station and that of mohembo station seronga air

from the relationship between sc and tdi for 57 measurements across the delta oromeng et al 2021 atekwana unpublished 1 tdi 0 65 s c 0 38 where tdi is the total dissolved ions 0 65 is the slope of the linear regression 0 38 is the y intercept and sc is the specific conductance 3 2 2 normalization of river levels river water levels from the leveloggers were corrected for barometric pressure changes by subtracting the time equivalent barometric pressure values recorded by the barologger after compensating for barometric pressure changes we normalized water levels using the min max normalization

minimum water level and wl max is the highest water level measured for either the rising or receding limbs of an annual discharge hydrograph for the data with incomplete water level measurements i e unknown highest water level value for periods where discharge was measured we used the highest river discharge from data from the archives of ori discharge database during that time frame to determine

concentration normalized water level c nwl relationships c nwl matrix of linear slope β of the log c normalized water level regression was derived from log transformed tdi concentrations and normalized water level following methods from previous studies godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 which utilized log discharge instead of normalized water level the β was derived from the best fit equation of the linear regression of log c vs normalized water level in this case the c nwl relationships are defined by a power law function 5 c α n w l β where c is the instantaneous tdi concentration and nwl is the corresponding normalized water level the intercept α and the slope β of the power law are derived from the linear regressions of log c vs normalized water level a slope β near zero indicate little to no changes in concentration despite high variability in water levels chemostatic behavior a slope 0 depicts solute dilution and slope 0 depicts solute enrichment basu et al 2011 clow and mast 2010 godsey et al 2009 the slope β values were estimated on a daily timescale using the hourly measurements for every 24 h under the assumption that this is an adequate frequency to capture the temporal changes in solute concentrations and solute transport regimes oromeng et al 2021 the statistical analysis of the c nwl data was performed in

mohembo seronga ori island and maun stations are presented in supplementary table 1 the summary statistics of the tdi concentrations air temperature water temperature monthly rainfall amount and normalized water levels are presented in table 1 4 2 spatial and temporal variations in tdi concentrations the tdi concentrations increase across the 4 stations mohembo seronga ori island and maun in the downriver direction fig 2 a b c and d fig 3 a the tdi concentrations in the panhandle of the delta at mohembo station ranged between 6 and 84 mg l with a mean of 17 11 mg l table 1 while at the seronga station the tdi concentrations ranged from 11 to 71 mg l with a mean of 27 13 mg l table 1 in the lower delta at ori island the tdi concentrations ranged between 28 and 61 mg l with a mean of 47 8 mg l and between 40 and 97 mg l with a mean of 71 9 mg l at the maun station table 1 at a temporal scale the tdi concentrations from the 4 stations showed distinct interannual seasonal and sub seasonal monthly weekly and daily variations fig 2a b c and d at an interannual scale the tdi concentrations were generally lower in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2012 at the seasonal scale the tdi concentrations in mohembo increased continuously from july to january which was followed by a sudden decrease to low tdi concentrations from february to july fig 2a the six month long period of low tdi concentrations was characterized by two prominent tdi concentration peaks in september and january followed by a general decrease in tdi concentrations to the next seasonal cycle in seronga we observed a continuous increase in tdi concentrations from august to december followed by a continuous decrease to lower concentration spanning january to august fig 2b during the period of lower tdi concentrations we observed a sub peak in tdi concentrations in june in the lower delta at ori island the tdi concentrations increased from september to peak concentrations in november followed by a slight decrease in tdi concentrations from december to march then increased to may before decreasing markedly to the lowest tdi concentrations in august fig 2c in maun the seasonal tdi concentrations showed peaks in october and january and the tdi concentrations were lower in february and june fig 2d the sub seasonal behavior of the tdi concentrations varied downriver fig 2a b c and d at the mohembo station we observe higher frequency variation in the tdi concentration peaks between june and january and very little concentration fluctuation during the period of low tdi concentrations fig 2a at the seronga station there are more sub seasonal changes in the tdi concentrations near the tdi concentration peaks which make these peaks much broader compared to those observed at the mohembo station at the ori station the sub seasonal concentration changes are small in maun the sub seasonal tdi concentrations showed much higher frequency and were much broader near the peak tdi concentrations 4 3 spatial and temporal variations in air temperature and water temperature in mohembo the air temperature ranged between 0 5 and 46 c with a mean of 23 7 c while the water temperature ranged from 14 to 31 c with a mean of 24 4 c table 1 in seronga the air temperature ranged between 6 and 41 c with a mean of 23 6 c while the water temperature ranged from 14 to 30 c with a mean of 23

ranged between 2 and 43 c with a mean of 23 7 c while water temperature ranged from 13 to 31 c with a mean of 24 4 c table 1 higher air temperatures fig 2e f g and h and water temperatures fig 2i j k and l were observed during the rainy season between september and april and lower air temperatures and water temperatures were observed during the dry season between may and august there is little spatial variability in the air and water temperatures across the okavango delta as observed at the mohembo seronga ori island and maun stations fig 3b and c we observed similar annual seasonal and sub seasonal patterns in air temperatures fig 2e f g and h and water temperatures fig 2i j k and l across the okavango delta the sub seasonal range in air temperature is much greater than water temperatures 4 4 spatial and temporal variations in monthly rain and normalized water levels 4 4 1 temporal monthly rainfall the rainy season in the okavango delta spanned november to may fig 2m n o and p the dry season spanned june to september at mohembo and seronga the monthly rainfall ranged from 0 to 143 mm with a mean of 38 49 mm table 1 peak monthly rainfall occurred in january in the lower delta monthly rainfall at ori island and maun ranged from 0 to 213 mm with a mean of 40 63 mm table 1 monthly rainfall peaked at 213 mm in december 2010 peak rainfall in the okavango delta fig 2m n o and p is out of phase with peak discharge fig 2q r s and t 4 4 2 normalized water level the relationships between solute concentrations and normalized water levels c nwl at the inlet station at mohembo and at the delta outlet station in maun show similar behavior to the relationships observed between solute concentrations and river discharge c q in the oromeng et al 2021 study supplementary fig 2 and 3 indicating that normalized water levels provide good qualitative characterization of hydrologic controls on solute concentrations as river discharge changes in the panhandle of the delta the normalized water level hydrograph at mohembo showed rising water levels beginning in november and peaking in may with sub peaks occurring in february and april fig 2q the rising water levels are then followed by a 6 month long recession from june to november before water levels begin to rise steadily during the next hydrologic year fig 2q the water level hydrograph in seronga mimics that of mohembo and is characterized by a steady increase in water levels from january to may the rising limb of the hydrograph showed a sub peak in february fig 2r the rising water levels are then followed by a 7 month long recession spanning june to december before water levels began to rise steadily marking the beginning of the next flooding cycle fig 2r in the lower delta at ori island the hydrograph showed that normalized water levels began increasing in january and peaking in june with minor sub peaks observed in january fig 2s the hydrograph recession spanned july to december fig 2s the normalized water level hydrograph at maun showed rising water levels beginning in march and peaking in august with occurrence of a sub peak in january fig 2t the peak water levels were followed by decreasing water levels from july to february with a sub peak in january fig 2t 5 discussion 5 1 spatial and temporal shifts in the river solute concentrations the results of our investigation of the spatial and temporal changes of the solute concentrations in the okavango river show downriver enrichment in the tdi concentrations across the delta e g fig 3a and seasonal and sub seasonal shifts in solute concentrations observed at the different monitoring stations across the delta fig 2a b c and d the spatial and temporal variability in river solute concentrations can be linked to two main processes 1 climate driven evapotranspiration et characterized by seasonality and 2 sub seasonal scale hydrologically driven differential solute transfer from the local watershed into the river which is superimposed on the seasonal et driven response 5 2 et as the persistent driver of the downriver solute increase across the okavango delta the average tdi concentrations progressively increase downriver at a rate of 0 11 mg l per km based on the linear regression model mean tdi 0 11 distance 12 25 r2 0 89 of tdi concentrations vs distance from the mohembo station to the maun station fig 3a alternatively we could fit the data with an exponential model and obtain a similar tdi concentration change rate of 0 1 mg l per km the mean annual air temperatures do not differ much for the different stations across the delta fig 3b indicating that the local weather conditions were identical across the delta similarly the mean annual water temperatures do not differ much for the different stations across the delta fig 3c indicating that there were no differences in the river water temperature across the delta thus the downriver increase in the solute concentrations is attributed to et driven progressive evapoconcentration e g sawula and martins 1991 mccarthy et al 1993 akoko et al 2013 atekwana et al 2016 mosimane et al 2017 mogobe et al 2018 oromeng et al 2021 letshele et al 2023 consistent with the 5 months river transit time the flood peak took to travel the 450 km from the proximal portion of the delta in mohembo to the distal portion of the delta in maun the standard deviations from the annual mean tdi concentrations for each of the stations on the linear regression model fig 3a speak to additional non evaporative processes causing changes in the river solute concentrations on a temporal scale the effects of et on tdi concentrations should correspond to seasonality where solute concentration enrichment should be observed during the hot rainy season when et rates are higher however seasonal tdi concentration peaks observed at the 4 stations across the delta fig 2a b c and d do not always coincide with peak seasonal high air temperatures fig 2e f g h and seasonal high water temperatures fig 2i j k and l the poor correspondence of the seasonal and sub seasonal peaks in the tdi concentrations and water temperatures can be used to argue that other processes besides et play a role in controlling the temporal solute chemistry of the okavango river 5 3 hydrologically driven modifications of the solute behavior in the okavango river our results of the spatial and temporal variations in the tdi concentrations in the okavango river e g fig 2a b c and d and fig 3a show spatial and temporal heterogeneity evident in the distinct signatures of both dilution and solute enrichment across our stations spatial and temporal variations in tdi concentrations can be linked to specific hydrological processes e g boyer et al 1997 ahearn et al 2004 dalzell et al 2007 liu et al 2008 geeraert et al 2017 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 duvert et al 2020 developing over the large spatial scale of the delta the hydrology of the okavango river is controlled by an annual flood pulse from the upper watershed in angola which contributes a mean annual inflow of 9 2 109 m3 y to the delta and by seasonal rains which contribute an additional 6 109 m3 y to the delta s hydrology mccarthy and ellery 1998 merron 1991 thus if hydrology drives the temporal perturbations in the river solute behavior we should observe modifications in the solute concentrations from the pulse flooding spanning march to september fig 2q r s and t and from local rains which span november through march fig 2m n o and p the addition of fresh water with low salinity or low dissolved solutes from the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains is expected to induce dilution in the river solute concentrations e g ahearn et al 2004 herndon et al 2018 rose et al 2018 to understand the role of the pulse flooding and rains in driving the seasonal and sub seasonal perturbations in the river solute behavior we utilized the temporal slopes β of the relationship between solute concentrations and normalized water levels as a determinant of whether increases in water levels cause solute enrichment or dilution godsey et al 2009 musolff et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 in addition we assessed the relationship between solute concentrations and normalized water levels c nwl relationship to get additional insights on discharge timing and solute delivery into the river we observed that the behavior of solutes was similar during different rising and receding limbs indicating that similar processes control the solute behavior regardless of the timing of the hydrologic event figs 4 5 6 and 7 5 3 1 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations in the upper watershed above the delta the normalized water level nwl hydrographs at our stations are color differentiated based on the rising and falling limbs over time we show the nwl hydrograph for the mohembo station fig 4a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 4b the temporal slopes β fig 4c and the c nwl relationships fig 4d for the rising and falling limbs of the nwl hydrographs the changes in the tdi concentrations at the mohembo station are reflective of solute behavior controlled by processes occurring in the upper watershed in namibia and angola the upper watershed above the mohembo station where all the river flow is sourced from cubango and cuito rivers is dominated by a temperate climate peel et al 2007 groundwater influx into the river at baseflow steudel et al 2013 causes solute enrichment during low flow conditions in the okavango river as reflected by the temporal increases in the tdi concentrations fig 4b and in slope values of 0 fig 4c at low flow october to january the solute enrichment occurring at low flow could also be attributed to wet season storage of floodwaters in the vast floodplains of the cubango and cuito rivers which is released into the river during the dry season steudel et al 2013 the increasing river solute concentrations are also observed on the c nwl relationships at low flow to 0 5 nwl during the rising limb of the hydrograph and from 0 5 nwl to low flow on the receding limb of the hydrograph fig 4d these observed enrichment episodes at low flow are attenuated by two dilution episodes occurring mid flow 0 5 nwl fig 4d in the rising limb of the discharge hydrograph february fig 4b and 0 7 to 0 5 nwl fig 4d during the falling limb of the discharge hydrograph may fig 4b the dilution of tdi concentrations back to baseline solute concentrations between mid flow and peak flow can be attributed to the supply of runoff from the cuito and cubango sub watersheds in the form of the annual flooding 5 3 2 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations in the panhandle region of the delta the variations of the tdi concentrations relative to normalized water levels at the seronga station fig 5 capture the solute concentration modifications within the panhandle portion of the delta the nwl hydrograph for seronga fig 5a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 5b the temporal slopes β fig 5c and the c nwl relationships fig 5d for the rising and falling limbs of the nwl hydrograph are also shown unlike at mohembo the arrival of the flood pulse at seronga induces solute dilution during the rising limb of the hydrograph fig 5c and d as the previously increasing tdi concentrations with decreasing water levels sharply decreases as the flood recedes water enriched in solutes drains into the river with decreasing water levels evidenced by the temporal slopes with β 0 fig 5c during flood recession october to january and the solute enrichment between 0 3 nwl to low flow from c nwl relationships fig 5d the river water with enriched solutes could be from the drainage of the riparian swamps delivering dissolved salts sourced from the tree islands and isolated wetland pools in the panhandle to the river as the flood recedes this explanation is consistent with solute particularly carbon delivery into the river in the panhandle during flow recession captured in the akoko et al 2013 study 5 3 3 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations in the lower delta region for the ori island station we show the nwl hydrograph fig 6a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 6b the temporal slopes β fig 6c and the c nwl relationships fig 6d for the rising and falling limbs of the nwl hydrograph we observe minimal solute response in the river at the ori island station compared to the mohembo and seronga stations as reflected in the temporal slopes plot where β 0 fig 6c and where the tdi concentrations are nearly constant from 0 4 nwl to peak flow fig 6d however the tdi concentrations slightly increase from 0 4 nwl to low flow on the falling limbs fig 5d the relatively small change in the solute concentration in the river in this reach where the wetlands are seasonally flooded mladenov et al 2005 wolski et al 2006 is indicative of a more homogeneous solute reservoir feeding the river as river water flows from the confined panhandle to the upper portion of the lower delta it spreads out into a distributary system thus the minimal change in the solute concentrations as the flood pulse advances and recedes may be because the absolute amount of new water delivered to this portion of the boro river that flows through the ori station is a small fraction of the discharge of the okavango river flowing through the panhandle we note that there is a slight decrease in the tdi concentrations in the lower delta during the rainy season december february from low water to about 0 4 nwl during the rising limbs fig 6b and d the annual flood pulse causes a marked decrease in the tdi concentrations from may to november and between nwl of 0 7 and peak discharge on the rising limb and from peak discharge to 0 4 nwl on the receding limb of the nwl hydrograph nevertheless it appears that the amount of new river water from the annual pulse flooding and seasonal rains cause only limited mixing and dilution of solutes in the river and that the temporal slopes of 0 fig 6c indicate a similar solute source alternatively we hypothesize that the river water flow from the panhandle confined flow with transverse width of 12 km spreads across a much larger portion of the wetland transverse width of 150 km for distributaries tooth and mccarthy 2004 in the lower delta in this scenario water in the river is a much smaller component compared to water in the wetland that interacts with the river in addition since the river near the ori island station is close to a tree island the minimal change in the solute concentrations may be due to the unidirectional et driven water flow towards the tree island e g mccarthy et al 1991 mladenov et al 2014 ramberg and wolski 2008 which results in little to no solute transfer from the floodplains into the river along this river reach and similar reaches 5 3 4 hydrologic controls on the tdi concentration variations at the outlet of the delta for the maun station we show the nwl hydrograph fig 7a the temporal tdi concentrations fig 7b the temporal slopes β fig 7c and the c nwl relationships fig 7d for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph at maun the river is confined and thus the water that spread out from the distributary system and over a much broader wetland area in the lower delta region at the ori island reach is channeled through a narrow 30 100 m width channel we observe mostly a dilution driven solute response in the river characterized by slope values of β 0 during flow recession from july november fig 7c the decreases in the tdi concentrations are observed from 0 8 nwl to peak flow fig 7d it is evident that the change in the river morphology and therefore the river water wetland interaction between the lower delta and the delta outlet plays a significant role in the differences in the solute response in the lower delta at the ori island and the outlet of the delta in maun the river channel at the outlet in maun is basically a collection system because the river at this location has relatively limited interaction with wetlands compared to the river at the ori station fig 1 at the maun station the tdi concentrations increase during flood recession from july to november and show greater variability compared to the flood recession from october to february or during the flood rise from february to june fig 7b although the tdi concentrations fig 7b increase during the flood recession fig 7a the slopes are 0 and indicate a source of water with lower solute concentrations consistent with dilution during this period fig 7c additionally the effect of seasonal rains is observable in the hydrograph from december to march fig 7a accompanied by tdi concentration decreases fig 7b yet the slope values β 0 indicate no change in solute source 7c the c nwl is relatively flat from 0 4 nwl to low flow fig 7d it therefore appears that during the rainy season the falling rains which may have interacted with the solute reservoirs in the delta wetland precipitates on the floodplain and on the islands and the isolated evaporated wetland pools and the broader watershed may not have transferred enough solutes into the river to cause significant enrichment in the river solutes alternatively since our monitoring period was during the transition from the drought and flood period the delta was significantly flooded and several intermittent channels flowed after 15 y of no flow therefore the dilution response in the okavango river at the outlet may be due to the contribution of additional fresh water from the newly flowing channels in the lower delta 5 4 implications of the variable solute responses across endorheic basins our results show spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the river solute response driven by hydrologic processes et and the changing river morphology across the endorheic okavango river basin our findings demonstrate that in endorheic basins where river flow is highly variable and et rates are high water movement and solute processing in rivers are strongly governed by hydrology and et which causes salt accumulation on the basin surface yapiyev et al 2017 and evapoconcentration of solutes in the river and in wetlands in addition the diverse morphology of rivers draining endorheic basins modifies river flow and solute behavior across the basin and typically transitions from 1 channel systems in the headwaters originating from mountains or highlands e g upper okavango river basin fig 8 to 2 a well defined and confined channel dominated by advective transport panhandle fig 8 then 3 a dispersal system forming a lower delta area lower delta region fig 8 and 4 an outlet channel delta outlet fig 8 through which water is exported from the delta area to a terminal lake e g lake ngami similar to the okavango river several other river systems in endorheic basins exhibit changing river morphology for instance the helmand river drains the transboundary endorheic helmand basin occupying parts of afghanistan pakistan and iran the helmand river transitions from the upper delta in the headwaters to the lower delta comprised of wetlands then flow towards the lowest part ending in a hypersaline lake named gowd e zareh vekerdy et al 2006 yapiyev et al 2017 this diverse morphology of rivers in endorheic basins that modifies water flow and solute transport has implications for the characterization of spatial solute dynamics the design of water quality monitoring regimes and water management decision making across endorheic basins the upper watershed section segment 1 fig 8 is characterized by variable solute responses in the channel system driven by episodic solute enrichment from river connectivity to groundwater and river floodplain interaction involving the release of solute enriched water packages from floodplains into the river during low flow and dilution from flooding at high flow unlike the upper watershed the lower watershed area hosting segments 2 3 and 4 fig 8 are characterized by groundwater recharge by the river and solute enrichment from river interaction with solute stores in the local watershed the difference in the river groundwater wetland interaction between the upper watershed and lower watershed area is typical of river basins transcending different climatic conditions for instance the okavango river basin spans from temperate climate in the upper watershed to semi arid climate within the lower watershed area and thus providing interesting insights on the hydrologic controls of solute behavior in settings with both effluent and influent rivers draining an endorheic basin the water exiting the upper watershed flows within a well defined and confined channel in the middle section of the basin segment 2 fig 8 which transports solutes to the lower delta area owing to the channel confinement and associated faster flow the flowing water in the channel has a shorter residence time resulting mostly in advection dominating over the effects of et in the river channel in this river segment the river interacts with riparian swamps which drain solute enriched water into the river at low flow and flooding induces dilution in the river at high flow the solute responses in the middle segment of basins are crucial for determining solute cycling and solute transport rates in faster flowing confined channels with episodic solute input from riparian wetlands upon reaching the terminus of an endorheic basin the river spreads out into distributary channels forming the lower delta region segment 3 fig 8 the lower delta is dominated by dispersive transport of water and solutes gooseff et al 2008 which allows for extensive river floodplain wetland island interaction due to the water dispersion in the lower delta water depths are shallow and river flow is slower gooseff et al 2008 thereby increasing the residence time of water in the lower delta which predisposes the water to pronounced effects of et in endorheic basins although one would expect high solute variability in the lower delta area from river floodplain wetland island interaction and et the occurrence of location specific solute response of minimal solute variability can be observed in the distributary channels depending on the amount of water and solutes delivered from the upper delta to the different river reaches in the lower delta area and the extent of river floodplain wetland island interaction along the river reaches the location specific solute responses in the lower delta region of endorheic basins have implications for constraining solute behavior in lower delta areas as it may be highly variable both in space and time the outlet of the delta area segment 4 fig 8 acts as a collection system where water exported out of the delta area is channeled through a narrow river channel the solute dynamics at the delta outlet is dependent on the solute concentrations of the exported water from the lower delta such that if the water from the lower delta region did not accumulate solutes to cause significant solute enrichment in the river the outlet will show a dilution driven response thus the delta outlet is a good point to monitor solute load and outflux from the delta area of endorheic basins which has implications for quantifying salt contribution of inland deltas to downstream lakes and salt pans the variable solute responses in the different segments of a river in an endorheic basin show that river systems in endorheic basins can be complex and it may be misleading to describe them as single hydrochemical response river systems the river connectivity to solute stores salt precipitates and isolated wetland pools in the local watershed e g covino 2017 observed across the different segments of the river geometry mostly at lower flow e g figs 4 6 and 7 highlights the existence of hydro geochemical hot moments created by hydrology and hotspots within floodplains salt islands and isolated wetland pools in endorheic basins the hot moments in rivers in endorheic basins are characterized by solute enrichments occurring mostly at low flow which are attenuated to baseline river chemistry by pulse flooding and storm events we propose that the hydrologic reset of hot moments in the river to baseline river chemistry helps maintain the surface water resources fresh in endorheic basins by diluting river solutes and evapoconcentrated solutes in wetland water and by facilitating the flushing of solutes out of the delta area via hydrologic solute flushing as suggested for the okavango delta by ramatlapeng et al 2021 under the ongoing climate change which is projected to significantly affect river inflow by reducing precipitation while simultaneously increasing et in endorheic basins such as the okavango river basin milzow et al 2010 the main mechanisms ie hydrologic reset in the river and hydrologic solute flushing from the delta maintaining surface waters fresh are under great threat the projected increasing aridity in most endorheic basins will impact the hydrochemical status of the rivers by enhancing salinization and thereby affecting the river s ecological functioning and water quality status 6 conclusions a high frequency time series investigation of solutes conducted in the okavango river across the okavango delta in the middle kalahari desert in botswana showed marked spatial and temporal variability in solute concentrations the variations in river solute concentrations are controlled by two main processes that modify solute behavior 1 seasonal climate driven evapotranspiration et and 2 hydrologically driven differential solute transfer from the local wetlands into the okavango river at the spatial scale et causes progressive downriver enrichment in tdi concentrations at 0 1 mg l per km of river flow at a temporal scale the tdi concentrations increase from evapoconcentration during the hot rainy season and decrease from an annual pulse flooding additionally superimposed on the seasonal solute behavior are sub seasonal solute transfer from the floodplains salt islands and isolated evaporated wetland pools initiated by hydrologic piston flow during rising flooding and drainage into the river during flood recession the influx of solutes into the river by pulse flooding helps maintain the delta in pristine freshwater conditions by facilitating solute flushing and export out of the delta our findings indicate that the temporal hydrology river connectivity to solute stores in the local watershed and evapotranspiration jointly control the solute behavior at variable spatial and temporal scales in rivers in arid watersheds and that concentration normalized water levels c nwl relationships constructed from high resolution time series data are useful in characterizing solute dynamics in

resources play a vital role in our daily lives and are used for example for irrigation hydroelectricity urban water resources and industry it is therefore essential to take measures to ensure the rational use of water resources while preventing and mitigating water related disasters flood is one of the most serious natural disasters that threatens cities echendu 2022 therefore it is very necessary to improve the flood forecasting method and improve the forecasting accuracy with the development of computer technology and the rise of interdisciplinary the water level prediction model has undergone a transformation from a traditional conceptual model to an intelligent model mohammadi 2021 traditional conceptual models are mainly based on the methods of fluid mechanics theory mathematical statistics or physical experiments to analyze hydrological characteristics ostad ali askari 2022 this method can provide higher prediction accuracy in some scenarios but the derivation

river the hanjiang river joins the yangtze at wuhan which experienced several major flood disasters in the past from the geographical point of view water level of the hanjiang river rises rapidly is an important factor for triggering downstream floods since hanchuan is the last station on the hanjiang river before wuhan 60 km upstream from wuhan the water level data from hanchuan is also important for predicting floods at wuhan 2 2 data source analyzing the water level of rivers is important for predicting runoff and accurate water level data minimizes the impact of errors on further

classify floral images lin et al 2021 proposed an attention network for multi target tracking zhang et al 2021b improved the outcome of sporting events prediction of lstm models using the attention mechanism wang et al 2021 proposed a convolutional neural network lstm attention hybrid deep learning model to predict traffic flow the focus of this paper is to screen the spatial and temporal characteristics of flood prediction model based on attention mechanism to filter out the parts that are favorable for prediction from the spatial and temporal information of input we apply an attention mechanism in front of the input of the original lstm firstly according to the spatio temporal information in the input of each time step of the lstm the spatio temporal attention weight matrix are respectively generated afterward the two weight matrices are combined into a spatio temporal attention weight matrix and adjust the input characteristics dynamically for each time step through the attention weight matrix the structure of sta lstm model is shown in fig 3 the historical water level data of the upstream hydrological stations are used as input and the model outputs the predicted water level value for the next n time steps an efficient method is needed to calculate the attention score for selecting the more useful parts for the prediction attention scores need to satisfy two criteria the score is non negative and the sum of the scores equals 1 the softmax function conforms to the above requirements and is commonly used in neural network models which makes the weights selection range more flexible 3 2 1 spatial attention module the spatial attention module serves to study how the prediction results depend on the water level series from each geographic location let the input be a two dimensional matrix x r m n where m and n denote the number of hydrographic stations and hours in each input sequence in this paper spatial features represent the water level observed by all hydrological stations at the same time the sequence of t time step is given by x t x 1 t x 2 t x m t 1 m t fig 4 shows the spatial attention scores generation process for all hydrological stations for each hourly input sequence the input sequence is activated by relu to make input more expressive then the softmax function is used to generate spatial attention scores 7 α i

models sa lstm spatial attention lstm networks the original lstm is given spatial weights using the spatial attention module of section 3 2 1 ta lstm temporal attention lstm networks the original lstm is given temporal weights using temporal attention module from section 3 2 2 sta lstm spatio temporal attention lstm the original lstm is given spatio temporal weights using the spatio temporal attention module of section 3 2 3 4 experiments 4 1 implementation settings all experiments were implemented on a windows system cpu intel r core tm i7 10700kf 3 8 ghz gpu nvidia geforce rtx3070 8g using the python programing language we look back 6 timesteps 6 h in the past and predict 6 timesteps 6 h before the final experiments we use the learning rate run units and epochs to form the hyperparameter space and obtain the robust parameters by searching the hyperparameter space fig 6 a c show the the relationship between model error and hyperparameter space adam is used as a gradient descent algorithm for training models adam s initial learning rate and decay rate are both 0 001 the learning rate is reduced to the original 0 5 after every 20 eopchs and the batch size is 256 table 1 lists the detailed parameters fig 6 d explores the effect of the combination of activations in spatial and temporal attention modules on sta lstm in addition we also explore two cases where the attention mechanism is in front of the lstm or behind the results show that the activations combination relu relu in front of the lstm model improves model the most 4 2 evaluation metrics this work uses four indicators to measure the performance of prediction model mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape determination coefficient r2 the mae rmse and mape reflect the difference between actual values and predicted values obtained from the samples smaller metrics improve the performance r2 quantifies the closeness between the predicted value and the actual the r2 is positively correlated with the accuracy of model prediction these indicators can be expressed as follows 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i p i 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i p i 2 14 mape 1 n i 1 n y i p i y i 15 r 2 1 i 1 n y i p i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the totally number of input features y i is the actual value p i is the predicted and y is the average value of input 4 3 method comparison and analysis table 2 contains the average performance of our proposed three attention models and baseline models in this 6 h water level prediction task the results show that our proposed attention models outperforms the lstm in most cases especially the sta lstm performs the best the spatio temporal attention module reduces the mae rmse and mape of the lstm and improves r2 shows the benefits of proposed attention modules the evaluation metrics of predictions from models at 6 moments were shown in fig 7 a d the result show that the prediction errors of all models increase as the prediction interval increases from mae and mape it can be seen that the proposed sta lstm performe best than other models in the prediction results at all times there is no significant difference in rmse of the three attention models but the prediction performance is better than others r2 shows that sta lstm outperforms other models in most cases combined with the existing experimental results we can initially draw the following conclusions 1 the causes of floods are complex and the forecasting error increases with the forecast interval 2 our proposed attention models perform better in experiments specifically the sta lstm proposed in this paper performs the best in most cases and the prediction accuracy of sa lstm is slightly better than ta lstm in most moments 3 the attention mechanism can make full use of the spatio temporal information in the input for lstm 4 4 evaluation of prediction results analyzing the predicted values of a model is an important way to evaluate the predictive ability fig 8 shows the relationship between the predicted and ground truth values of sta lstm the closer r2 is to 1 the higher the prediction accuracy of the sta lstm it can be seen that as the prediction interval increases the dispersion of the predicted values increases and r2 decreases this is consistent with the conclusion of fig 7 in order to supplement the validity of the validation prediction results we count the frequency of errors across all prediction intervals see fig 9 the closer the errors are to the normal distribution the red curve in fig 9 the higher the reliability of the model prediction results as shown in fig 9 as the prediction interval increases the error histogram gradually deviates to the right of the normal which means the model prediction accuracy decreases fig 10 shows prediction of different models at t 6 which is consistent with the conclusion in section 4 3 fig 8 and fig 9 provide plausible explanations for the prediction results of our proposed model although the model can produce good prediction results the error will inevitably increase with input information this trend is in line with the general situation and the error variation range is acceptable 4 5 visual attention analysis to explore the changes of spatial and temporal attention with time in the proposed sta lstm we visualize the attention weights of sta lstm fig 11 shows the spatial attention visualization results of sta lstm at 6 prediction intervals the x coordinate is the input feature from upstream to downstream hydrological stations in hanjiang river fig 12 shows the temporal attention visualization results of sta lstm at 6 prediction intervals and the x coordinate is the input historical times the spatial weights gradually increases from upstream to downstream and the temporal weights decreases as the historical moment increases fig 13 presents the spatio temporal attention weights visualization of sta lstm at 6 prediction intervals the distribution of spatio temporal weights at each forecasting time is relatively similar as the prediction intervals increases the attention weights of the model decreases and the hydrological stationcloser to the exit location contributes more to the prediction results from fig 11 to fig 13 we can draw the following conclusions 1 the spatial attention module pays more attention to features of the spatial position closer to the output and the spatial weights increases almost linearly from upstream to downstream the temporal attention module pays more attention to the previous historical moment 2 with the increase of prediction intervals the distribution of spatio temporal weights becomes more concentrated and the model pays more attention to valuable informations so that the prediction performance of sta lstm model will not decrease too much 5 conclusions although the spatial and temporal characteristics in the input sequences play an important role in water level prediction irrelevant inputs will cause noises to affect the prediction results we proposed a spatio temporal attention mechanism imporved lstm sta lstm to forecast river water level in this study we evaluated the prediction results of sta lstm on the hanjiang river dataset to explore the feasibility of improving the prediction ability of spatio temporal attention through comparison of evaluation indicators we found that spatio temporal attention can effectively improve the prediction effect of the model this study is consistent with the conclusions of other reports gao et al 2016 wu et al 2020 in addition we visualized the spatial and temporal attention weights to provide strong support for the attention mechanism in this study we discussed the spatio temporal attention mechanism to improve lstm however whether the proposed attention mechanism could improves other models is also needed to be exporled for future work we will investigate the spatio temporal attention mechanism to improve other models credit authorship contribution statement yingfei wang conceptualization software validation formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original draft writing

attention module of section 3 2 3 4 experiments 4 1 implementation settings all experiments were implemented on a windows system cpu intel r core tm i7 10700kf 3 8 ghz gpu nvidia geforce rtx3070 8g using the python programing language we look back 6 timesteps 6 h in the past and predict 6 timesteps 6 h before the final experiments we use the learning rate run units and epochs to form the hyperparameter space and obtain the robust parameters by searching the hyperparameter space fig 6 a c show the the relationship between model error and hyperparameter space adam is used as a gradient descent algorithm for training models adam s initial learning rate and decay rate are both 0 001 the learning rate is reduced to the original 0 5 after every 20 eopchs and the batch size is 256 table 1 lists the detailed parameters fig 6 d explores the effect of the combination of activations in spatial and temporal attention modules on sta lstm in addition we also explore two cases where the attention mechanism is in front of the lstm or behind the results show that the activations combination relu relu in front of the lstm model improves model the most 4 2 evaluation metrics this work uses four indicators to measure the performance of prediction model mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape determination coefficient r2 the mae rmse and mape reflect the difference between actual values and predicted values obtained from the samples smaller metrics improve the performance r2 quantifies the closeness between the predicted value and the actual the r2 is positively correlated with the accuracy of model prediction these indicators can be expressed as follows 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i p i 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i p i 2 14 mape 1 n i 1 n y i p i y i 15 r 2 1 i 1 n y i p i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the totally number of input features y i is the actual value p i is the predicted and y is the average value of input 4 3 method comparison and analysis table 2 contains the average performance of our proposed three attention models and baseline models in this 6 h water level prediction task the results show that our proposed attention models outperforms the lstm in most cases especially the sta lstm performs the best the spatio temporal attention module reduces the mae rmse and mape of the lstm and improves r2 shows the benefits of proposed attention modules the evaluation metrics of predictions from models at 6 moments were shown in fig 7 a d the result show that the prediction errors of all models increase as the prediction interval increases from mae and mape it can be seen that the proposed sta lstm performe best than other models in the prediction results at all times there is no significant difference in rmse of the three attention models but the prediction performance is better than others r2 shows that sta lstm outperforms other models in most cases combined with the existing experimental results we can initially draw the following conclusions 1 the causes of floods are complex and the forecasting error increases with the forecast interval 2 our proposed attention models perform better in experiments specifically the sta lstm proposed in this paper performs the best in most cases and the prediction accuracy of sa lstm is slightly better than ta lstm in most moments 3 the attention mechanism can make full use of the spatio temporal information in the input for lstm 4 4 evaluation of prediction results analyzing the predicted values of a model is an important way to evaluate the predictive ability fig 8 shows the relationship between the predicted and ground truth values of sta lstm the closer r2 is to 1 the higher the prediction accuracy of the sta lstm it can be seen that as the prediction interval increases the dispersion of the predicted values increases and r2 decreases this is consistent with the conclusion of fig 7 in order to supplement the validity of the validation prediction results we count the frequency of errors across all prediction intervals see fig 9 the closer the errors are to the normal distribution the red curve in fig 9 the higher the reliability of the model prediction results as shown in fig 9 as the prediction interval increases the error histogram gradually deviates to the right of the normal which means the model prediction accuracy decreases fig 10 shows prediction of different models at t 6 which is consistent with the conclusion in section 4 3 fig 8 and fig 9 provide plausible explanations for the prediction results of our proposed model although the model can produce good prediction results the error will inevitably increase with input information this trend is in line with the general situation and the error variation range is acceptable 4 5 visual attention analysis to explore the changes of spatial and temporal attention with time in the proposed sta lstm we visualize the attention weights of sta lstm fig 11 shows the spatial attention visualization results of sta lstm at 6 prediction intervals the x coordinate is the input feature from upstream to downstream hydrological stations in hanjiang river fig 12 shows the temporal attention visualization results of sta lstm at 6 prediction intervals and the x coordinate is the input historical times the spatial weights gradually increases from upstream to downstream and the temporal weights decreases as the historical moment increases fig 13 presents the spatio temporal attention weights visualization of sta lstm at 6 prediction intervals the distribution of spatio temporal weights at each forecasting time is relatively similar as the prediction intervals increases the attention weights of the model decreases and the hydrological stationcloser to the exit location contributes more to the prediction results from fig 11 to fig 13 we can draw the following conclusions 1 the spatial attention module pays more attention to features of the spatial position closer to the output and the spatial weights increases almost linearly from upstream to downstream the temporal attention module pays more attention to the previous historical moment 2 with the increase of prediction intervals the distribution of spatio temporal weights becomes more concentrated and the model pays more attention to valuable informations so that the prediction performance of sta lstm model will not decrease too much 5 conclusions although the spatial and temporal characteristics in the input sequences play an important role in water level prediction irrelevant inputs will cause noises to affect the prediction results we proposed a spatio temporal attention mechanism imporved lstm sta lstm to forecast river water level in this study we evaluated the prediction results of sta lstm on the hanjiang river dataset to explore the feasibility of improving the prediction ability of spatio temporal attention through comparison of evaluation indicators we found that spatio temporal attention can effectively improve the prediction effect of the model this study is consistent with the conclusions of other reports gao et al 2016 wu et al 2020 in addition we visualized the spatial and temporal attention weights to provide strong support for the attention mechanism in this study we discussed the spatio temporal attention mechanism to improve lstm however whether the proposed attention mechanism could improves other models is also needed to be exporled for future work we will investigate the spatio temporal attention mechanism to improve other models credit authorship contribution statement yingfei wang conceptualization software validation formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original draft writing

2179,that streamflow from even aged forests is a function of forest age the kuczera curve is an accepted paradigm in australian forest hydrology and less commonly in the northern hemisphere however none of a dozen stand replacement experiments in australian obligate seeder forests have faithfully reproduced the kuczera curve here we test an alternative model based on the self thinning line showing that both the kuczera curve and results of subsequent stand replacement experiments can be explained by observed changes in self thinning after disturbance self thinning in even aged forests is dictated by the rate of reduction in stocking density as mean tree size increases comparison of stand basal area and stocking densities in stands of eucalyptus regnans f muell regenerated after wildfires in 1851 and 1939 suggested significant differences in self thinning lines between age cohorts in three large catchments a simple forest growth and water use model only reproduced observed substantial long term reductions in streamflow after stand replacement mean reduction from 1940 to 1982 of 233 mm year 1 when observed cohort specific changes in the intercept of the self thinning line stl were incorporated modelled mean reduction 235 mm year 1 use of a single stl intercept in both pre and post disturbance simulations did not produce the observed streamflow responses modelled mean reduction 37 mm year 1 averaged over six e regnans experimental catchments in which the dominant forest was either partly or completely removed and replaced with the same species the observed decadal maximum streamflow reduction was only 7 mm year 1 compared to 22 mm year 1 using the model with observed stl intercepts but 200 mm year 1 using the kuczera curve consequently hydrological responses to disturbance are less predictable than previously assumed as the reasons for changes in self thinning behaviour are not yet understood we speculate that in this case it is related to variability in seed supply and competition with shorter lived understorey species in the early stages of regeneration keywords eucalyptus regnans kuczera curve streamflow self thinning line data

ea and consequently in streamflow potentially have large multi decadal impacts on water supplies for cities agriculture and the environment langford 1976 kuczera 1987 long term streamflow responses to stand replacement in natural forests vary goeking and tarboton 2020 even within a single forest type watson et al 2001 to properly understand the hydrological effects of climate induced increases in stand replacement frequency over decades a better understanding of how stand replacement influences ea is required rates of change in stand structure after stand replacement are strongly influenced by self thinning behavior the rate of reduction in stem density as average plant size increases fig 1 we examined whether an ecohydrological model incorporating self thinning explains varied long term streamflow responses to stand replacement we use a case study from southeastern australia s native obligate seeder eucalyptus forests where half a century of hydrology research has provided a wealth of long term streamflow ea and forest growth data for model parameterization and validation widespread stand replacement of mature 85 years old eucayptus regnans f muel and e delegatensis r t baker stands after severe wildfire in 1939 resulted in maximum streamflow reductions of 50 two to three decades later langford 1976 kuczera 1987 using 43 years of post 1939 streamflow in eight large catchments with varying proportions of stand replacement kuczera fitted various curves to the observed streamflow changes which were ultimately distilled into an average streamflow versus age curve for practical purposes kuczera 1985 1987 vertessy et al 2001 however kuczera cautioned that wide confidence intervals around this curve fig 2 created large uncertainty in the magnitude and timing of the maximum streamflow decline and in the shape and timing of the recovery for example for the predominant 1939 regrowth aged 83 years in 2022 the lower and upper 90 confidence limits for regional mean annual streamflow are 600 and 1200 mm year 1 meaning prediction of future water supplies for melbourne is uncertain the generalised kuczera curve despite its large uncertainties and despite being limited in application to the specific catchments from which it was derived kuczera et al 1989 has subsequently been applied in various forest disturbance studies for example examining trade offs between timber production and water supplies or predicting long term effects of climate change on water availability spring et al 2005 roderick and farquhar 2012 taylor et al 2019 it has been suggested that increasing the frequency of stand replacement in e regnans forests due to climate change and timber harvesting will cause permanent reductions in streamflow lindenmayer et al 2011 however a dozen stand replacement experiments designed to reproduce the effect of the 1939 fire in several obligate seeder eucalyptus species through clear fell and regeneration have resulted in smaller or shorter lived streamflow declines watson et al 2001 bren et al 2010 webb et al 2012 hypothesised to be due to relatively low rainfall poor initial regeneration or defoliation by insects watson et al 2001 which would all reduce evapotranspiration in the regenerating forest and therefore lessen the impact on streamflow in australian forest hydrology the kuczera curve paradigm has been built into more recent hydrological modelling of stand replacement either directly taylor et al 2019 or using stand age to drive changes in leaf area index lai and canopy conductance that force the model to recreate similar streamflow changes to those observed after 1939 watson et al 1999 peel et al 2000 lane et al 2010 feikema et al 2013 this modelling relies on space for time substitution whereby lais of different co existing but spatially separated age classes were used to define a lai age curve on the assumption that stands of the same species will always follow the same lai age trajectory watson et al 1999 an alternative possibility is that different stand replacement events result in different growth trajectories due for example to changes in the rate of self thinning caused by changing levels of competition after stand replacement changing levels of environmental stress or increasing atmospheric co2 zhang et al 2017 kubiske et al 2018 mrad et al 2020 forrester et al 2021 more broadly kuczera like responses long term water yield decline to stand replacement have been identified in various forest types in the former soviet union shiklomanov and krestovsky 1988 and north america jones post 2004 andreassian and trinquet 2009 naranjo et al 2012 crampe et al 2021 suggesting that they can occur in other forests when stand replacement results in long term increases in ea however unlike in e regnans the decline in streamflow below pre disturbance level is usually not evident for several decades and is usually less than the initial water yield increase jones post 2004 crampe et al 2021 as more forests become subjected to disturbance in future due to increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires diseases and insect attacks droughts and storms it may be important for management of water supplies and water dependent ecosystems to improve our understanding of whether long term streamflow declines will become more common examining how long term mean annual ea changes as a function of self thinning and stand development will contribute to this improvement a recent theoretical analysis by inbar et al 2022 indicates streamflow could be sensitive to self thinning line fig 1 slope intercept and rate of curvature towards the line as full stocking is approached however this theoretical exploration has not been robustly evaluated against field observations of forest dynamics and streamflow the analysis presented here built on this idea by developing a relatively simple ecohydrological model tested rigorously using a substantial database of long term forest inventory and streamflow the validated model was used to test whether self thinning can explain observed hydrological responses in six stand replacement experiments and whether stand replacement always results in the same growth trajectory that produces the long term streamflow decline observed by kuczera 1985 1987 after the 1939 wildfires problem statement the kuczera curve was derived from a specific set of observed streamflow changes that occurred after a single stand replacement event however because it is not always consistent with experimentally derived streamflow responses to stand replacement in similar forest types watson et al 2001 bren et al 2010 webb et al 2012 there exists uncertainty in predictions of responses to future disturbances current modelling is based on forest age rather than on forest growth rates and structure but there may not always be a consistent relationship between age and stand variables that determine average annual water use this modelling does not incorporate forest self thinning behavior and cannot account for climate change effects on growth rates apart from the theoretical analysis of inbar et al 2022 no studies that we are aware of have examined the relationship between long term self thinning and streamflow our underlying hypothesis is that variability in observed streamflow responses to stand replacement in even aged forests is at least partly the result of temporal and spatial variability in self thinning behaviour our objective was to test this hypothesis using a simple bottom up streamflow model with stand growth and ea driven by self thinning we achieve this by 1 developing and parameterising a simple ecohydrological model incorporating self thinning behaviour based on existing plot scale studies of stand growth and ea 2 validating the model using five decades of forest inventory and streamflow observations in 15 small 1 km2 experimental catchments 3 running the model using self thinning lines estimated from pre and post disturbance forest inventory to try to reproduce observed long term hydrological responses to stand replacement in nine catchments six small experimental catchments and three larger water supply catchments subjected to stand replacement after wildfire or clear fell timber harvest and regeneration 2 methods 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 overview the variable of interest was annual streamflow and the experimental unit was the catchment as detailed below we developed and validated an ecohydrological model to predict stand growth evapotranspiration and streamflow at the catchment scale and then used this model to predict the effects of stand replacement on annual streamflow and compared predicted effects with observed effects in nine catchments subjected to some form of stand replacement table 1 the main method used to quantify the effects of stand replacement on annual streamflow was the rainfall runoff method the relationship between runoff and rainfall before disturbance was quantified in each of the nine catchments subjected to stand replacement and any consistent deviation in the observed streamflow from this relationship after disturbance was assumed to have been caused by the disturbance 2 1 2 location and description of the catchments the model was parameterised and validated using high quality long term rainfall streamflow and forest inventory data from 17 first order 1 km2 each experimental catchments located 80 km northeast of melbourne australia latitude 37 36 s longitude 145 36 e table 1 in the 1960s and early 1970s the catchment manager now melbourne water corporation set up these experimental catchments at north maroondah and coranderrk table 1 fig 3 after a period of pre treatment streamflow monitoring lasting for between 4 and 13 years various treatments were applied to 12 of these catchments and streamflow monitoring was continued for a further period of decades table 1 each treated catchment received a unique treatment which we refer to here as an experiment six of the catchments received what we refer to as a stand replacement experiment the dominant forest was removed by clearfell harvest and replaced with forest of the same species either by application of seed or by replanting with seedlings at known densities in five of these six catchments all the e regnans forest was removed and replaced while in the sixth patches of forest 80 m in diameter were removed and replaced covering 54 of the catchment area six other catchments received various thinning treatments and five were left undisturbed as controls but two of these are known to be unreliable moran and o shaughnessy 1984 benyon et al 2015 and so were not used in our streamflow analysis pre and post treatment forest inventory stocking density and stand basal area rainfall and streamflow data covering a wide range of forest ages and structures have been collected from the catchments for up to five decades table 1 enabling extensive model validation and the effects of various stand replacement experiments with different ni and stli to be quantified moran and o shaughnessy 1984 provide details of the precipitation and streamflow measurement networks in summary monthly rainfall has been measured across the study area using a network of 29 rain gauges while accurate measurements of streamflow are provided by sharp edged stainless steel v notch weirs for which stage height was calibrated to streamflow in situ using portable flumes moran and o shaughnessy 1984 forest inventories table 1 included measurements of stem diameter at 1 3 m height of all overstorey trees in various sample plots pre treatment surveys were based on strip lines covering 10 of each catchment table 1 post treatment surveys varied with treatment type and forest age table 1 10 strip line in the treated black spur and ettercon catchments five 40 40 m plots in each of the three treated monda catchments one 5 m 20 m or 10 m 20 m randomly located plot per treated hectare in the picaninny and myrtle 2 regrowth 45 plots in picaninny and 22 in myrtle 2 the 2010 inventory in black spur 1 was from a single circular plot in one of the regrowth patches in addition to the experimental catchments we analyzed annual streamflow measurements from three larger water supply sub catchments of the maroondah water supply catchment table 1 fig 3 for which streamflow data were available from 1926 onwards these were three of the catchments used by kuczera 1987 as the basis for developing the kuczera curve following broadscale stand replacement after wildfire in 1939 as there were no undisturbed catchments to use as controls after the 1939 fires kuczera used a rainfall runoff method to identify streamflow responses to the fire we used the same method to identify streamflow responses to stand replacement in streamflow simulated by our model for comparison with observed streamflow responses identified using the rainfall runoff method in the three larger water supply catchments and the six small experimental catchments that received stand replacement treatments the nine catchments in table 1 having treatment designated sr 2 2 model overview a simple 1d catchment model simulating key growth and evapotranspiration processes was developed first order catchments within the study area fig 3 were modelled which typically have one dominant overstorey type e regnans of a uniform age occupying 72 to 97 of the catchment area with the remainder around the stream being scrub or gully vegetation of which between 1 and 6 is defined as a permanently wetted area moran and o shaughnessy 1984 there are usually no e regnans trees within the gully and wetted areas the e regnans forest type is widespread in tasmania and southern and eastern victoria australia at elevations between 200 and 1000 m above sea level with mean annual precipitation almost exclusively rain between 1200 mm yr 1 and 2400 mm yr 1 watson et al 1998 the climate is warm temperate and rainy while soils are typically 10 15 m deep well structured krasnozems having high infiltration and water holding capacity langford and o shaughnessy 1977 fig 4 shows a schematic representation of the catchment scale and stand scale ecohydrological models used for the dominant overstorey type detailed descriptions of all model parameters and equations are provided in the appendix in summary modelling focusses on the e regnans area and uses a combination of previously published benyon et al 2017 and newly developed empirical equations to predict daily overstorey and understorey ea overstorey transpiration ta appendix equation a24 is modelled as a function of daily stand sapwood area asap equation a1 mean sap velocity vsap equation a26 and soil water equation a22 understorey ea is modelled daily equations a8 and a9 based on overstorey sapwood area equation a1 rainfall interception equations a12 a13 understorey vpd equations a6 a7 and stand age we used a daily timestep for modelling of stand processes because stand growth in the model is linked to transpiration which is modelled as a function of daily mean vpd sapwood area and daily soil water we used a monthly timestep for the response variable streamflow because there are delays of some hours to months in water moving from different parts of each catchment to the gauging weirs where the response variable was measured for each month we aggregated the modelled daily deep drainage water that escaped past the root zone to monthly totals the streamflow response of interest is the annual total flow fluctuations in streamflow at shorter timescales than annual are of less interest to the catchment manager as all the flows from the catchments supplying melbourne can be captured in large storage reservoirs which have total capacity several times the mean annual stream flow we used published data for e regnans on npp with age volkova et al 2018 fig 1a and live tree biomass with age volkova et al 2018 fig 1c combined with a respiration ra biomass with age relationship from piao et al 2010 fig 2 to calculate gpp for various ages of e regnans from 10 to 150 years gpp npp ra live biomass we calculated annual transpiration for these ages based on a sapwood area age relationship from haydon et al 1997 and a mean sap velocity for e regnans of 11 6 cm hour 1 from benyon et al 2017 across stand ages from 10 to 150 years these calculations gave an almost constant water use efficiency wue of 0 00481 gg 1 standard deviation 0 00029 gg 1 this single value for wue is used in the model to derive daily overstorey gpp equation a10 from ta of which a proportion determined by age is available for stem volume increment is equation a14 daily stand mean height h equation a11 is modelled as a function of age and stocking density daily stand basal area ba increment equation a2 is calculated based on daily is taking account of h stand qd is calculated at the end of each day by converting tree mean basal area to diameter assuming a circular stem cross section equation a20 if the new qd places the stand above the self thinning line fig 1 n is reduced to the maximum n permitted by the self thinning line equation a18 the model does not currently include the curvature towards the stl shown in fig 1 assuming instead that n does not begin to reduce until the stand reaches the self thinning line the new n each day is used to predict stand mean sapwood thickness swt using an empirical relationship equation a23 determined by calibration of modelled against observed mean streamflow in a sample of three catchments the black spur group table 1 fig 3 fig 6 two of which were selectively thinned after 4 years see model parameterization steps below net rainfall enters the upper of two soil layers l1 and l2 l1 provides water for understorey transpiration and evaporation calculated as an empirical function of daily d estimated above the understorey du equation a7 and overstorey age vertessy et al 2001 benyon et al 2017 once l1 is full equation a21 any additional soil water drains to a second layer l2 which provides all water for ta once l2 is also full equation a22 any additional drainage from l1 to l2 becomes available for streamflow this excess drainage is accumulated each month and at month s end is routed to the stream using empirically determined lags of up to 14 months equation a31 for the wetted area which contains no e regnans trees monthly ea is calculated as a fixed proportion of p equation a29 and the remaining p enters the stream equation a33 for gully vegetation in the non wetted area ea for each month is fixed totalling 700 mm year 1 drawn from a single soil water store once this store is full equation a34 any excess p from that portion of the catchment that month enters the stream equation a32 2 3 model development and parameterisation for model parameterization and validation we used the 15 out of 17 experimental catchments considered to have reasonably reliable streamflow records based on moran and o shaughnessy 1984 and benyon et al 2015 the catchments used for specific model parameterization steps section 2 3 1 are indicated in the right hand column of table 1 2 3 1 model parameterization steps 1 calculate pre and post treatment stli for each catchment individually assuming a fixed slope of 1 605 reineke 1933 the fixed slope originally postulated by reineke was used because there was often only one pre or post treatment inventory making it impossible to fit both a unique slope and intercept for the stl as there would be an infinite number of solutions using a single value for the slope enabled calculation of a unique stli even when there was only one measurement of n and qd available several self thinning lines have been published for e regnans trouve et al 2017 these were initially tried but were unable to provide satisfactory predictions of long term changes in both n and qd by using a fixed slope a unique stli can be calculated based on only one set of inventory data assuming the forest at that time has reached the self thinning line this was done by using the inventory data to calculate qd then using qd in the stl with the fixed slope of 1 605 to calculate n stli was varied iteratively in the equation until the correct n from the inventory data was calculated 2 previously benyon et al 2015 showed that in small plots of e regnans plot mean sapwood thickness was correlated with n as sapwood area is a key variable in determining transpiration in the model and transpiration makes up a large component of total et which in turn has a strong influence on streamflow we calibrated the sapwood thickness swt versus n relationship at the catchment scale using a subset of the experimental catchments for the three treated black spur catchments including two both pre and post selective thinning simulations were started in 1972 with known pre treatment ba and n moran and o shaughnessy 1984 hawthorne et al 2013 and sapwood thickness swt was iteratively varied until pre treatment mean and post 1976 treatment in the two thinned catchments annual streamflow was correctly simulated final swt values were plotted against modelled mean n for the same periods for these five data points to develop an empirical relationship between swt and n equation a23 fig 6 for model validation we used this same relationship for the other 12 experimental catchments note that fig 6 also shows data points for the other 12 catchments and for the small sample plots from benyon et al 2015 for comparison 3 for one catchment an untreated control ettercon 3 the model was run for 36 years starting with known ba and n and the proportion of gpp going to stems cppa was fixed for each model run but varied iteratively for different model runs until stand basal areas at later ages were correctly simulated to correctly simulate the first observed n and ba at age 33 a lower cppa had to be used for the first 15 years the final model begins with cppa of 0 16 at age 1 increasing linearly to 0 23 at age 15 then remaining constant at 0 23 after that 4 stand mean height is used in the model to calculate stand daily basal area increment from stand daily stem volume increment it is therefore necessary to calculate stand height each day this is done empirically based on stand age however it was found that when ni was low use of a fixed height age relationship resulted in unrealistically low ba growth probably because too much cpp was going into height growth low competition in low density stands results in lower height growth and greater diameter growth to overcome this initial height growth in low density stands before the stl is reached was calibrated using ba and n measured in 2019 age 41 from three catchments mondas 1 2 and 3 harvested and regenerated at stand densities of 500 2000 and 10000 stems ha 1 in 1978 height growth in each of these catchments was iteratively varied in the model reduced by a fixed proportion for each model run until ba and n in 2019 was correctly simulated these three data points were used to derive a relationship between the height growth correction and initial n equation a11 5 lags between stand scale processes and streamflow were calibrated separately for the north maroondah and coranderrk catchments by iteratively varying monthly lags until a good fit to monthly streamflow was achieved in the ettercon 3 catchment representing all north maroondah catchments and the slip creek catchment representing the coranderrk group in summary for the stand scale model the cppa age function was calibrated using ettercon 3 the effect of ni on height growth was calibrated using mondas 1 2 and 3 post treatment and the swt vs n function was calibrated using black spurs 1 2 and 3 including post treatment for bs2 and bs3 at the catchment scale the streamflow monthly lags were calibrated using ettercon 3 for the north maroondah catchments and slip for the coranderrk catchments 2 3 2 model validation for streamflow validation the swt vs n function and the mean ni in 1940 derived from the three black spurs were used in the model for all of the other catchments including pre and post treatment periods and the observed monthly and modelled monthly streamflows were compared modelling steps for this validation are described below 1 treatments that did not involve stand replacement were simulated by restarting the model using the observed ba n and proportion of e

alternate 35 m wide strips of forest were removed and retained without e regnans regeneration the proportion of forest was reduced and the proportion of scrub gully vegetation type increased to match the reductions in eucalypt forest area of 48 and 43 reported by hawthorne et al 2013 6 models for all 1939 regrowth catchments were initialised from 1940 age 1 2 4 simulation of streamflow responses to stand replacement the parameterised and validated model was used to simulate the effects of stand replacement in nine catchments 1 for three large sub catchments of the maroondah water supply catchment watts graceburn and donnellys table 1 fig 3 a similar method to kuczera 1985 1987 was used to estimate responses of annual streamflow to the 1939 fire as a function of post fire forest age the model was run from 1926 to 1939 with pre 1939 forest assumed to date from fire in 1851 this assumption is based on unpublished melbourne water corporation forest inventory showing that of 2936 ha of unburnt mature obligate seeder forest in maroondah catchment remaining after 1939 2312 ha 79 was the 1851 age class for the pre fire period a relationship between annual streamflow and three seasonal rainfall totals may december january april and december april in the previous year was fitted by regression analysis for the post fire period this regression relationship was used to predict annual streamflows based on observed rainfall for the three periods each year and any deviation in observed in this case modelled using the ecohydrological model from predicted streamflow represented the modelled effect of the fire the stli for the 1851 and 1939 forest age classes were determined from 134 inventory plots 18 in the 1851 and 116 in the 1939 age classes measured between december 2009 and may 2010 benyon and lane 2013 2 streamflow responses to stand replacement in five of the six stand replacement experiments table 1 black spur 1 monda 1 2 and 3 myrtle 2 were determined in the same way as for 1 above and the modelled and observed treatment effects were compared with those predicted based on forest age using the kuczera curve fig 2 for picaninny streamflow responses published in bren et al 2010 were used in the analysis 3 as an added test of whether the model is an improvement over the use of forest age as the determinant of annual et it was rerun for each simulation but the growth functions were turned off and modelled sapwood area asap was replaced with asap versus forest age functions from haydon et al 1997 and vertessy et al 2001 2 5 statistical analysis for comparing mean stli of the various catchment groups and age classes simple t tests were used in excel after first comparing variances for comparing goodness of fit of annual streamflow simulations the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metric gupta and kling 2011 was used 3 results 3 1 model parameterisation 3 1 1 self thinning line intercepts our underlying hypothesis that variability in streamflow responses to stand replacement is at least partly the result of variability in self thinning behaviour would not be testable if there were no changes in the stl after stand replacement and no spatial variation in stls this sub section examines how the calculated stl intercepts differed between groups of catchments and forest age classes and how they changed after stand replacement or thinning pre treatment mean stli with standard errors are shown in fig 5 for the north maroondah and coranderrk experimental catchment groups and for the 18 plots of 1851 and 116 plots of 1939 age classes measured in 2009 10 the mean stli of the 1939 age class was significantly higher than for all other groups p 0 01 the differences being greatest for the 1851 age class including coranderrk p 0 01 there were no statistically significant differences between the four north maroondah catchment groups black spur monda ettercon and myrtle despite differences in mean rainfall elevation and age there was a significant difference between the north maroondah catchments and the coranderrk catchments p 0 05 the effects of various selective thinning or clearfell including patch cut and regeneration treatments on stli were varied table 2 but overall there was little change in the pre and post treatment mean stli which among the eight treated catchments was 11 60 before treatment and 11 56 up to 41 years after treatment however in individual catchments there were sometimes substantial changes in the stli after stand replacement for example an increase from 11 24 to 11 65 after clearfell and regeneration in picaninny contrasting with a decrease of similar magnitude from 11 46 to 11 07 after the same treatment in myrtle 2 the mean absolute change in stli after treatment was 0 23 but with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in two selectively thinned catchments it increased in one but decreased in the other in the latter more heavily thinned catchment 50 basal area reduction there was no change in n between 1976 immediately after thinning and 2008 32 years after thinning indicating the stand had not yet returned to the self thinning line in the other selectively thinned catchment 33 basal area reduction n reduced from 138 immediately after thinning in 1976 to 96 in 2008 indicating self thinning had resumed in six stand replacement experiments stli increased in three catchments but decreased in the other three in summary these results indicate stli can change substantially after disturbance but the magnitude and direction of change is not consistent 3 1 2 relationship between mean swt and n the relationship between calibrated catchment mean sapwood thickness swt and n is shown in fig 6 in the years following heavy selective thinning in black spur 3 catchment mean sapwood thickness had to be increased from 1 7 to 3 0 cm for streamflow to be correctly simulated power functions fitted only to the three black spur catchments including pre and post selective thinning and to all regrowth catchments are similar fig 6 benyon et al 2015 measured the mean sapwood thickness directly in various small inventory plots which also showed a dependence of stand mean swt on n however in that study the relationship was not quite the same as when a catchment mean swt was not measured but calibrated using pre treatment and post selective thinning streamflow fig 6 the two oldgrowth catchments did not fit the relationship falling well below the regression lines apart from post selective thinning no catchment had a mean swt greater than 2 1 cm 3 1 3 proportion of gpp going to stems to achieve correct basal areas after beginning simulations at age 1 year the proportion of gpp going to stem growth had to be reduced when stand age was 15 years this may reflect that in young stands a greater proportion of gpp is used in growing roots and leaves and that the stands are thinning rapidly and the model does not account for dead trees in e regnans annual mortality peaks at about 50 of total npp at around age 25 years volkova et al 2018 which our model does not account for however our model gives predictions of cumulative gpp and live tree carbon consistent with literature values for example for an undisturbed 1939 regrowth catchment ettercon 3 the model predicts cumulative gpp of 2800 t ha 1 at age 80 compared with 2766 t ha 1 if npp of 1300 t ha 1 from volkova et al 2018 is multiplied by an average npp gpp ratio of 0 47 landsberg et al 2020 and both our model and volkova et al 2018 have live tree carbon of 300tc ha 1 at this age 3 2 model validation when swt vs n and ni were fitted using only the three black spur catchments using both pre and post selective thinning data and with treatment effects included the average model fit to monthly streamflow for the other 12 catchments fig 7 was very good nse 0 86 the modelled mean streamflow was 45 2 mm month 1 compared with 45 5 mm month 1 observed and the cumulative error from 1972 to 2018 was 0 6 the fit of mean annual streamflow before and after treatment fig 8 was also very good with nse of 0 92 and modelled mean streamflow of 614 mm year 1 compared with 617 mm year 1 observed these results indicate that for these forests the model captures the most important forest growth and et processes influencing monthly and mean annual streamflows and that these parameters are consistent between different catchments and stand ages the streamflow observations cover forest stands ranging from 1 to 240 years providing confidence that the model can be used reliably to model long term streamflow responses to stand replacement 3 3 effects of stli on streamflow responses to stand replacement 3 3 1 modelled and observed effects of stand replacement in 1939 stli had a strong influence on simulated streamflow responses to stand replacement after fire fig 9 with observed stlis from fig 5 used in the model fig 9a to 9c the timing and magnitude of the streamflow response observed by kuczera 1985 1987 was predicted more accurately than using the haydon et al 1997 or vertessy et al 2001 models fig 10 table 3 using the observed stlis modelled mean streamflow reduction across the three catchments between 1940 and 1982 was 235 mm year 1 compared with 233 mm year 1 observed for watts where 17 years of additional streamflow data were available for 2002 to 2018 almost 80 years after the fire both the observed and modelled fire effects on streamflow were still evident fig 9a mean fire effect for this period of 262 mm year 1 using the kuczera method and 322 mm year 1 modelled based on the entire period when streamflows were observed in each catchment model nse scores were 0 41 for watts 0 66 for graceburn and 0 47 for donnellys table 3 when the observed stli values were used that the nse values were only moderate rather than high is perhaps because there is substantial year to year noise in the rainfall runoff relationship caused by variables that were not modelled using the haydon et al 1997 sapwood areas example shown for watts in fig 10 the model always substantially under estimated the mean maximum and timing of the post fire streamflow reductions table 3 nses 0 04 to 0 44 model fit was similarly poor using the vertessy et al 2001 sapwood area model fig 10 table 3 nses 0 07 to 0 98 indicating that our prior understanding of the sapwood area dynamics in these forests was poor predictions of the mean streamflow responses were closer to those observed but the 10 year mean maximum flow reductions were much larger and occurred earlier than observed with a more rapid recovery example shown for watts in fig 10 using different stli from those observed for each age cohort gave very different predictions of streamflow responses even without model statistics such as the very negative nse values in table 3 the model fits are obviously very poor demonstrating that variability in the stli may have a strong influence on the hydrological response to stand replacement when the stli was not changed after 1939 1851 stli used both before and after 1939 much smaller streamflow reductions were predicted than were observed by kuczera fig 9d to 9f table 3 10 year running mean maximum flow reductions of 81 104 and 61 mm year 1 for watts graceburn and donnellys occurring only 7 or 8 years after the fire with the fire effects no longer evident after 32 years and a mean streamflow reduction from 1940 to 1982 of only 37 mm year 1 when the stlis were swapped post 1939 used before 1939 and pre 1939 used after 1939 the model predicted a substantial increase in streamflow fig 9g to 9i table 3 for the 1940 to 1982 period the modelled streamflow changes averaged 275 mm year 1 compared with 233 mm year 1 observed the 1939 regrowth forest in these catchments is now approaching the age of the 1851 regrowth when the 1939 fire occurred if a major fire occurs in the next decade and replaces the current 1939 regrowth using the historical climate the model predicts there will be a slight average 40 mm year 1 to substantial average 278 mm year 1 increase in mean annual streamflow over the next 80 years slight if there is no change in the current stli substantial if the new regrowth has the same stli as the 1851 regrowth 3 3 2 modelled and observed effects of six stand replacement experiments streamflow responses in six stand replacement experiments were predicted more reliably on average by the model than by the kuczera curve or by the haydon et al 1997 and vertessy et al 2001 sapwood area age models figs 11 and 12 table 4 in myrtle 2 the model did not predict the substantial streamflow increase in the first 5 years post treatment but after that the treatment effect was reasonably well simulated fig 11a with predicted mean reduction in streamflow from 1991 to 2018 of 124 mm year 1 compared with 123 mm year 1 observed however in the final 10 years 2009 2018 the model under predicted the treatment effect by an average of 123 mm year 1 77 mm year 1 modelled compared with 200 mm year 1 observed both the modelled and observed streamflow reductions were much less than predicted by the kuczera curve which gives a mean reduction between 1990 and 2018 of 329 mm year 1 and 472 mm year 1 in the last 10 years the nse was 0 28 for the model compared with 1 65 for the kuczera curve the haydon et al and vertessy et al models performed poorly predicting mean treatment effects respectively of 484 mm year 1 and 405 mm year 1 with nses of 5 25 and 4 03 for picaninny the simulation was not a good fit for the first 12 years post treatment fig 11b resulting in a poor nse score 0 02 but from age 13 to 35 the modelled treatment effect compares reasonably well with observations with a mean reduction for this period of 171 mm year 1 predicted compared with 127 mm year 1 observed however for 18 of these 23 years the model predicts a greater reduction in streamflow than observed the modelled maximum streamflow decline is much less than predicted by the kuczera curve consistent with observations which would be expected based on the low rainfall in this catchment in the black spur 1 patch cut and regeneration experiment simulated and observed treatment effects were in good agreement fig 11c nse 0 69 and in this case apart from the first 10 years after treatment are reasonably consistent with the kuczera curve which has the same trend and magnitude in streamflow changes but is a poor fit nse 1 16 simulations for the three monda catchments with and without effects of insect defoliation had both observed and modelled declines in streamflow after the initial post harvest peak less than predicted by the kuczera curve fig 12 when streamflow observations ceased 20 years after treatment no strong downward trend in streamflow was evident in either the observed or modelled streamflows for monda 1 and monda 2 this lack of a strong trend combined with large year to year variability in the observed treatment responses resulted in poor model fits table 4 nses usually negative however the modelled post treatment mean and periodic responses were much closer to observations than when the kuczera curve was used even when insect defoliation was not modelled for low density regeneration monda 3 where defoliation had little effect on basal area and stocking the model without defoliation reproduced the mean response well with a mean streamflow increase over the 20 years of 85 mm year 1 predicted compared to 87 mm year 1 observed for high density regeneration monda 2 the mean response was predicted well by the model with defoliation mean increase of 185 mm year 1 compared with 187 mm year 1 observed the predicted response was not so good for monda 1 mean streamflow increase of 115 mm year 1 with defoliation and 72 mm year 1 without compared with 172 mm year 1 observed but was better than the kuczera curve which predicted a mean streamflow reduction of 87 mm year 1 for the final 5 years of observations the models predict that beyond age 20 streamflow would decline below pre treatment in monda 1 and 3 but less than predicted by the kuczera curve without streamflow observations however these predictions cannot be verified 4 discussion 4 1 changing stls can explain varied effects of stand replacement our modelling supports the inbar et al 2022 hypothesis that self thinning can explain long term streamflow changes we went a step further by developing a model using forest inventory and water use data and validating against comprehensive long term streamflow records with a fixed stl slope of 1 605 reineke 1933 the model only reproduced long term streamflow reductions after wildfire observed by kuczera 1985 1987 when the increase in stl intercept observed in forest inventory in remnant stands was used in the model simulations of six stand replacement experiments using stli based on pre and post treatment inventories usually produced better predictions of streamflow responses than the kuczera curve in most cases streamflow reductions were less than predicted by the kuczera curve predictions using sapwood area in the model derived from two published sapwood area age models haydon et al 1997 vertessy et al 2001 gave worse predictions of streamflow responses to stand replacement possibly because these models do not account for how structural differences related to n and self thinning affect the relationship between sapwood area and age these results imply that the kuczera curve is a special case not only when compared to other eucalyptus forest types as suggested by webb et al 2012 but even within the e regnans forest type no stand replacement experiments have produced streamflow declines as large as those occurring after the 1939 fires at coranderrk bren et al 2010 this can be explained by relatively low rainfall compared to the larger catchments studied by kuczera 1985 1987 however in the myrtle 2 experiment where oldgrowth e regnans forest was converted to regrowth in a more typical rainfall zone watson et al 2001 the streamflow decrease has been much less than after the 1939 fires our modelling suggests this is because the stli decreased after stand replacement at myrtle 2 whereas it increased substantially after the 1939 fires our results enable a better understanding of how stand replacement is likely to affect streamflows in future more than half of melbourne s water is supplied by forest regenerated in 1939 the already high stli in this age class means it is unlikely to increase after the next stand replacement as it did in 1939 meaning the next fire will result in only a small reduction in streamflow or even an increase rather than being the rule in these forests the kuczera curve appears to be only one of several possible responses to disturbance perhaps explaining why the kuczera curve is unusual in the international forest hydrology literature 4 2 why does the stli vary between cohorts while a change in the stli can explain why streamflow declined after stand replacement in 1939 and why responses of the same magnitude have not been observed in small catchment experiments it raises a question about why the stli changed after 1939 and more generally about what causes stls to change in the same forest type following stand replacement one possibility in e regnans is that the eucalyptus stl is influenced by the proportion of competing acacia species in the early stages of regeneration several acacia species are common in the understorey of e regnans but when these stands are replaced acacia seedlings often compete strongly with eucalyptus seedlings and for the next 15 to 20 years stands can consist of a mixture of co dominant e regnans a dealbata and or a melanoxylon vertessy et al 1994 hawthorne et al 2018 before the acacias are overtopped and become a mid storey pfautsch et al 2010 sometimes pure stands of acacia regenerate but these are shorter lived than e regnans and die out within 80 years lakmali et al 2022 fig 13 shows the correlation between eucalyptus stli and proportional acacia basal area for mixed stands using data from the monda catchments at age 41 and from several other studies polglase and attiwill 1992 vertessy et al 1994 pfautsch et al 2010 hawthorn et al 2018 once the acacias have become suppressed or died after 75 80 years a remnant e regnans stand will be left having a relatively low stli during the pre fire calibration period used by kuczera 1987 from 1926 to 1938 the dominant 1851 age class would have been 75 to 88 years old which is the age at which a dealbata can quickly die out a predominance of mixed e regnans a dealbata stands in the 1851 regeneration could explain the low stli of this age cohort the regression line in fig 13b suggests that acacia basal area of 36 in the 1851 regrowth but only 18 in the 1939 regrowth could give the mean stli measured in the remnant 1851 and 1939 stands fig 5 benyon and lane 2013 reported noticeable differences in regeneration density of e regnans seedlings in three large catchments 1 and 2 years after stand replacing fires in 2009 in catchments with lower e regnans regeneration density mixed stands with different forest structures may have regenerated resulting in different self thinning behaviour and a different streamflow response the type of disturbance can also influence regeneration density and spatial variability in e regnans natural regeneration density following wildfire was spatially more variable than regeneration after clearfell harvest and aerial sowing causing long term differences in stand structure and stls trouve et al 2021 changes in atmospheric co2 and water availability may alter self thinning behaviour controlled increases in co2 for 11 years in trembling aspen resulted in higher stand basal area for a given stocking density kubiske et al 2018 a similar response to rising atmospheric co2 in e regnans in melbourne s catchments meaning an increase in stli would increase sapwood areas and therefore transpiration unless there was a counterbalancing decrease in stomatal conductance pretzsch and biber 2021 observed a correlation between stli and annual precipitation in pinus sylvestrus l in melbourne s catchments the climate is projected to become drier and warmer clarke et al 2019 possibly meaning a reduction in stli and a decrease in et although in e regnans the mean annual precipitation is substantially higher than in the pretzsch and biber 2021 study under projected climate changes wildfire in southeast australia and in some other fire prone regions is expected to become more frequent meaning stand replacement will occur more often lakmali et al 2022 potentially resulting in different self thinning and streamflow responses more generally if climate change causes changes in self thinning behaviour hydrological responses to disturbance may become more varied across the world s forests if an increase in co2 or temperature results in an increase in the stl intercept for a given mean tree size more trees can survive streamflows are likely to decrease for a given rainfall alternatively if more drought or high temperatures lowers the self thinning line the ratio of runoff to rainfall may increase although in absolute terms rainfall reductions may still result in streamflow reductions 4 3 limitations broader implications and future research needs our modelling approached was developed for a specific forest type with several important empirical relationships tuned to improve the model fit to streamflow using a small subset of the available data for this reason we would recommend against wide application of the model in its raw form beyond the forest type in which it was developed our modelling assumed that only the intercept of the stl varies within the forest type studied studies have shown that stl slopes and intercepts can vary between species between regeneration methods and over time within the same species charru et al 2012 forrester et al 2021 trouvé et al 2021 and that the parameters of the stl can vary depending on the statistical method used to fit the model zeide 2010 trouvé et al 2017 in forest types where stand replacement is known to have a long term influence on streamflow the approach we have used here might be useful for exploring possible causes of streamflow responses and whether these might change in future if self thinning behaviour changes to use a stl based modelling approach for an existing forest at least one measure of the current stocking density and basal area is needed after the stand has reached the self thinning line this requires either an extensive ground survey or in future may be achievable using remote sensing for example using lidar jaskierniak et al 2015 it may take a decade or more to obtain the required inventory data after a major disturbance for example detailed forest inventory for 7000 ha of oldgrowth e regnans regenerated in melbourne s catchments after wildfire in 2009 are still not available 13 years later meaning the likely long term hydrological impacts of this fire cannot yet be predicted with any certainty following this major disturbance we would have liked to have collected inventory data from age 5 years onwards and undertake remeasurements every 5 years to establish the long term stl of the regrowth for predicting long term streamflow responses however due to the presence of numerous very large dead trees access for measurements of the regrowth has been deemed too dangerous and access trails are no longer passable once access is again possible and it can be determined whether the regenerating forests have reached a stable self thinning line we believe that streamflow projections can be made for at least the next 50 years using the stl based method analysis of streamflow records by the catchment manager since the 2009 fire suggest that so far there is not a detectable streamflow reduction even where substantial areas of old e regnans forest were killed and regenerated in the high rainfall o shannassy catchment dr shane haydon melbourne water corporation personal communication this is consistent with observations by benyon and lane 2013 of relatively low eucalyptus seedling regeneration densities in o shannassy meaning likely development of mixed e regnans and acacia stands with a relatively low e regnans stl perhaps similar to the 1851 regrowth some of our fitted model parameters are substantially different from real world expectations or have not been well validated for example the proportion of gpp available for construction 16 to 23 in the model is much lower than the 40 to 60 suggested by the literature landsberg et al 2020 perhaps because the model does not keep track of mortality which can account for up to 50 of npp in e regnans volkova et al 2018 routing the excess rainfall to the stream after accounting for all evapotranspiration losses does not have any underlying physical basis the assumptions about evapotranspiration from the gully vegetation and saturated zone around the stream have not been validated using the current model parameters for e regnans if the model is initialised at age 1 year and run for more than 100 years the stand stops thinning to achieve the basal areas and stocking densities observed in very old forest the stli needs to begin to reduce after about 100 years this is consistent with more detailed studies of self thinning that suggest the stl curves downwards in older forests charru et al 2012 our study was undertaken in natural eucalyptus forest in which stand density and structure is largely controlled by natural processes or in the case of timber harvesting the silviculture is intended to mimic the response to wildfire planted forests can also affect long term catchment water yields in these forests the self thinning line is sometimes used to maximise the carrying capacity of the site the aim may be to manage stand density to maximise profitability taking account of the quality and volume of wood harvested and the cost of production and harvesting our modelling approach could be adapted to planted forests for integrated modelling of plantation growth evapotranspiration and streamflow planted forests are typically established at densities lower than the maximum carrying capacity of the site i e below the self thinning line to maximise the size of individual trees for economic reasons whether the planted forest ever reaches the self thinning line depends on the silviculture applied to the stand in short rotations for pulpwood or biomass production the planted forest will not be thinned if growth rates are rapid enough self thinning may begin before the plantation is harvested in longer rotations where the aim is to produce higher value products artificial thinning may be applied which may prevent the stand ever reaching the self thinning line using the self thinning model approach the effects of management decisions can be accounted for by reducing the stocking density and basal area in the model in line with known thinning regimes the self thinning line defines the maximum number of plants of a given mean size in this case tree mean basal area or quadratic mean dbh that can be carried by the site when growth rates temporarily slow due for example to below average temperatures drought insects disease the rate of increase in mean tree size may slow down which means the rate of self thinning also slows down if these stress factors are severe enough to cause tree death e g the site can temporarily no longer carry as many plants of a given mean size n may drop below the maximum carrying capacity of the site once conditions return to normal the drought breaks or the pests die off then it may take some time for the stand to return to the self thinning line this can be modelled if the effects of the stress factors on n and basal area are known in our study the effects of several insect attacks on n and stand basal area in the monda catchments were known from annual inventory measurements within the model it was possible to make a manual adjustment of n and basal area to account for these effects similarly after two selective thinnings in which the pre and post thinning n and basal area were observed the effect of thinning could be modelled by manually adjusting n and basal area at the time of thinning to match the observed post thinning n and basal area 5 conclusion ecohydrological modelling of long term water use and streamflow responses to disturbance in even aged e regnans forests was improved by accounting for the effects of changes in the self thinning line after stand replacement this modelling suggests the kuczera curve may have been the result of an unusually large increase in the self thinning line after fire induced stand replacement in 1939 reasons for changes in the stl after stand replacement are not yet known although may be related to post regeneration competition with shorter lived understorey species and to spatial variability in regeneration density the time since disturbance proxy for stand dynamics to explain rainfall runoff relationships proposed by kuczera 1987 haydon et al 1997 and vertessy et al 2001 and used in more recent modelling peel et al 2000 lane et al 2010 feikema et al 2013 taylor et al 2019 should be replaced with an explicit representation of forest structure dynamics as provided by the self thinning line this approach is parameterizable when both pre and post disturbance forest inventory data are available and better explains the diversity in rainfall runoff relationships observed in australian stand replacement experiments watson et al 2001 bren et al 2010 webb et al 2012 there is an opportunity to better understand the relationship between stand management and water output from afforested catchments gaining more information on forest stand structure dynamics versus water yield and understanding how global changes like climate change also affect stand structure is a natural progression of such studies

2179,that streamflow from even aged forests is a function of forest age the kuczera curve is an accepted paradigm in australian forest hydrology and less commonly in the northern hemisphere however none of a dozen stand replacement experiments in australian obligate seeder forests have faithfully reproduced the kuczera curve here we test an alternative model based on the self thinning line showing that both the kuczera curve and results of subsequent stand replacement experiments can be explained by observed changes in self thinning after disturbance self thinning in even aged forests is dictated by the rate of reduction in stocking density as mean tree size increases comparison of stand basal area and stocking densities in stands of eucalyptus regnans f muell regenerated after wildfires in 1851 and 1939 suggested significant differences in self thinning lines between age cohorts in three large catchments a simple forest growth and water use model only reproduced observed substantial long term reductions in streamflow after stand replacement mean reduction from 1940 to 1982 of 233 mm year 1 when observed cohort specific changes in the intercept of the self thinning line stl were incorporated modelled mean reduction 235 mm year 1 use of a single stl intercept in both pre and post disturbance simulations did not produce the observed streamflow responses modelled mean reduction 37 mm year 1 averaged over six e regnans experimental catchments in which the dominant forest was either partly or completely removed and replaced with the same species the observed decadal maximum streamflow reduction was only 7 mm year 1 compared to 22 mm year 1 using the model with observed stl intercepts but 200 mm year 1 using the kuczera curve consequently hydrological responses to disturbance are less predictable than previously assumed as the reasons for changes in self thinning behaviour are not yet understood we speculate that in this case it is related to

stand replacement in natural forests vary goeking and tarboton 2020 even within a single forest type watson et al 2001 to properly understand the hydrological effects of climate induced increases in stand replacement frequency over decades a better understanding of how stand replacement influences ea is required rates of change in stand structure after stand replacement are strongly influenced by self thinning behavior the rate of reduction in stem density as average plant size increases fig 1 we examined whether an ecohydrological model incorporating self thinning explains varied long term streamflow responses to stand replacement we use a case study from southeastern australia s native obligate seeder eucalyptus forests where half a century of hydrology research has provided a wealth of long term streamflow ea and forest growth data for model parameterization and validation widespread stand replacement of mature 85 years old eucayptus regnans f muel and e delegatensis r t baker stands after severe wildfire in 1939 resulted in maximum streamflow reductions of 50 two to three decades later langford 1976 kuczera 1987 using 43 years of post 1939 streamflow in eight large catchments with varying proportions of stand replacement kuczera fitted various curves to the observed streamflow changes which were ultimately distilled into an average streamflow versus age curve for practical purposes kuczera 1985 1987 vertessy et al 2001 however kuczera cautioned that wide confidence intervals around this curve fig 2 created large uncertainty in the magnitude and timing of the maximum streamflow decline and in the shape and timing of the recovery for example for the predominant 1939 regrowth aged 83 years in 2022 the lower and upper 90 confidence limits for regional mean annual streamflow are 600 and 1200 mm year 1 meaning prediction of future water supplies for melbourne is uncertain the generalised kuczera curve despite its large uncertainties and despite being limited in application to the specific catchments from which it was derived kuczera et al 1989 has subsequently been applied in various forest disturbance studies for example examining trade offs between timber production and water supplies or predicting long term effects of climate change on water availability spring et al 2005 roderick and farquhar 2012 taylor et al 2019 it has been suggested that increasing the frequency of stand replacement in e regnans forests due to climate change and timber harvesting will cause permanent reductions in streamflow lindenmayer et al 2011 however a dozen stand replacement experiments designed to reproduce the effect of the 1939 fire in several obligate seeder eucalyptus species through clear fell and regeneration have resulted in smaller or shorter lived streamflow declines watson et al 2001 bren et al 2010 webb et al 2012 hypothesised to be due to relatively low rainfall poor initial regeneration or defoliation by insects watson et al 2001 which would all reduce evapotranspiration in the regenerating forest and therefore lessen the impact on streamflow in australian forest hydrology the kuczera curve paradigm has been built into more recent hydrological modelling of stand replacement either directly taylor et al 2019 or using stand age to drive changes in leaf area index lai and canopy conductance that force the model to recreate similar streamflow changes to those observed after 1939 watson et al 1999 peel et al 2000 lane et al 2010 feikema et al 2013 this modelling relies on space for time substitution whereby lais of different co existing but spatially separated age classes were used to define a lai age curve on the assumption that stands of the same species will always follow the same lai age trajectory watson et al 1999 an alternative possibility is that different stand replacement events result in different growth trajectories due for example to changes in the rate of self thinning caused by changing levels of competition after stand replacement changing levels of environmental stress or increasing atmospheric co2 zhang et al 2017 kubiske et al 2018 mrad et al 2020 forrester et al 2021 more broadly kuczera like responses long term water yield decline to stand replacement have been identified in various forest types in the former soviet union shiklomanov and krestovsky 1988 and north america jones post 2004 andreassian and trinquet 2009 naranjo et al 2012 crampe et al 2021 suggesting that they can occur in other forests when stand replacement results in long term increases in ea however unlike in e regnans the decline in streamflow below pre disturbance level is usually not evident for several decades and is usually less than the initial water yield increase jones post 2004 crampe et al 2021 as more forests become subjected to disturbance in future due to increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires diseases and insect attacks droughts and storms it may be important for management of water supplies and water dependent ecosystems to improve our understanding of whether long term streamflow declines will become more common examining how long term mean annual ea changes as a function of self thinning and stand development will contribute to this improvement a recent theoretical analysis by inbar et al 2022 indicates streamflow could be sensitive to self thinning line fig 1 slope intercept and rate of curvature towards the line as full stocking is approached however this theoretical exploration has not been robustly evaluated against field observations of forest dynamics and streamflow the analysis presented here built on this idea by developing a relatively simple ecohydrological model tested rigorously using a substantial database of long term forest inventory and streamflow the validated model was used to test whether self thinning can explain observed hydrological responses in six stand replacement experiments and whether stand replacement always results in the same growth trajectory that produces the long term streamflow decline observed by kuczera 1985 1987 after the 1939 wildfires problem statement the kuczera curve was derived from a specific set of observed streamflow changes that occurred after a single stand replacement event however because it is not always consistent with experimentally derived streamflow responses to stand replacement in similar forest types watson et al 2001 bren et al 2010 webb et al 2012 there exists uncertainty in predictions of responses to future disturbances current modelling is based on forest age rather than on forest growth rates and structure but there may not always be a consistent relationship between age and stand variables that determine average annual water use this modelling does not incorporate forest self thinning behavior and cannot account for climate change effects on growth rates apart from the theoretical analysis of inbar et al 2022 no studies that we are aware of have examined the relationship between long term self thinning and streamflow our underlying hypothesis is that variability in observed streamflow responses to stand replacement in even aged forests is at least partly the result of temporal and spatial variability in self thinning behaviour our objective was to test this hypothesis using a simple bottom up streamflow model with stand growth and ea driven by self thinning we achieve this by 1 developing and parameterising a simple ecohydrological model incorporating self thinning behaviour based on existing plot scale studies of stand growth and ea 2 validating the model using five decades of forest inventory and streamflow observations in 15 small 1 km2 experimental catchments 3 running the model using self thinning lines estimated from pre and post disturbance forest inventory to try to reproduce observed long term hydrological responses to stand replacement in nine catchments six small experimental catchments and three larger water supply catchments subjected to stand replacement after wildfire or clear fell timber harvest and regeneration 2 methods 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 overview the variable of interest was annual streamflow and the experimental unit was the catchment as detailed below we developed and validated an ecohydrological model to predict stand growth evapotranspiration and streamflow at the catchment scale and then used this model to predict the effects of stand replacement on annual streamflow and compared predicted effects with observed effects in nine catchments subjected to some form of stand replacement table 1 the main method used to quantify the effects of stand replacement on annual streamflow was the rainfall runoff method the relationship between runoff and rainfall before disturbance was quantified in each of the nine catchments subjected to stand replacement and any consistent deviation in the observed streamflow from this relationship after disturbance was assumed to have been caused by the disturbance 2 1 2 location and description of the catchments the model was parameterised and validated using high quality long term rainfall streamflow and forest inventory data from 17 first order 1 km2 each experimental catchments located 80 km northeast of melbourne australia latitude 37 36 s longitude 145 36 e table 1 in the 1960s and early 1970s the catchment manager now melbourne water corporation set up these experimental catchments at north maroondah and coranderrk table 1 fig 3 after a period of pre treatment streamflow monitoring lasting for between 4 and 13 years various treatments were applied to 12 of these catchments and streamflow monitoring was continued for a further period of decades table 1 each treated catchment received a unique treatment which we refer to here as an experiment six of the catchments received what we refer to as a stand replacement experiment the dominant forest was removed by clearfell harvest and replaced with forest of the same species either by application of seed or by replanting with seedlings at known densities in five of these six catchments all the e regnans forest was removed and replaced while in the sixth patches of forest 80 m in diameter were removed and replaced covering 54 of the catchment area six other catchments received various thinning treatments and five were left undisturbed as controls but two of these are known to be unreliable moran and o shaughnessy 1984 benyon et al 2015 and so were not used in our streamflow analysis pre and post treatment forest inventory stocking density and stand basal area rainfall and streamflow data covering a wide range of forest ages and structures have been collected from the catchments for up to five decades table 1 enabling extensive model validation and the effects of various stand replacement experiments with different ni and stli to be quantified moran and o shaughnessy 1984 provide details of the precipitation and streamflow measurement networks in summary monthly rainfall has been measured across the study area using a network of 29 rain gauges while accurate measurements of streamflow are provided by sharp edged stainless steel v notch weirs for which stage height was calibrated to streamflow in situ using portable flumes moran and o shaughnessy 1984 forest inventories table 1 included measurements of stem diameter at 1 3 m height of all overstorey trees in various sample plots pre treatment surveys were based on strip lines covering 10 of each catchment table 1 post treatment surveys varied with treatment type and forest age table 1 10 strip line in the treated black spur and ettercon catchments five 40 40 m plots in each of the three treated monda catchments one 5 m 20 m or 10 m 20 m randomly located plot per treated hectare in the picaninny and myrtle 2 regrowth 45 plots in picaninny and 22 in myrtle 2 the 2010 inventory in black spur 1 was from a single circular plot in one of the regrowth patches in addition to the experimental catchments we analyzed annual streamflow measurements from three larger water supply sub catchments of the maroondah water supply catchment table 1 fig 3 for which streamflow data were available from 1926 onwards these were three of the catchments used by kuczera 1987 as the basis for developing the kuczera curve following broadscale stand replacement after wildfire in 1939 as there were no undisturbed catchments to use as controls after the 1939 fires kuczera used a rainfall runoff method to identify streamflow responses to the fire we used the same method to identify streamflow responses to stand replacement in streamflow simulated by our model for comparison with observed streamflow responses identified using the rainfall runoff method in the three larger water supply catchments and the six small experimental catchments that received stand replacement treatments the nine catchments in table 1 having treatment designated sr 2 2 model overview a simple 1d catchment model simulating key growth and evapotranspiration processes was developed first order catchments within the study area fig 3 were modelled which typically have one dominant overstorey type e regnans of a uniform age occupying 72 to 97 of the catchment area with the remainder around the stream being scrub or gully vegetation of which between 1 and 6 is defined as a permanently wetted area moran and o shaughnessy 1984 there are usually no e regnans trees within the gully and wetted areas the e regnans forest type is widespread in tasmania and southern and eastern victoria australia at elevations between 200 and 1000 m above sea level with mean annual precipitation almost exclusively rain between 1200 mm yr 1 and 2400 mm yr 1 watson et al 1998 the climate is warm temperate and rainy while soils are typically 10 15 m deep well structured krasnozems having high infiltration and water holding capacity langford and o shaughnessy 1977 fig 4 shows a schematic representation of the catchment scale and stand scale ecohydrological models used for the dominant overstorey type detailed descriptions of all model parameters and equations are provided in the appendix in summary modelling focusses on the e regnans area and uses a combination of previously published benyon et al 2017 and newly developed empirical equations to predict daily overstorey and understorey ea overstorey transpiration ta appendix equation a24 is modelled as a function of daily stand sapwood area asap equation a1 mean sap velocity vsap equation a26 and soil water equation a22 understorey ea is modelled daily equations a8 and a9 based on overstorey sapwood area equation a1 rainfall interception equations a12 a13 understorey vpd equations a6 a7 and stand age we used a daily timestep for modelling of stand processes because stand growth in the model is linked to transpiration which is modelled as a function of daily mean vpd sapwood area and daily soil water we used a monthly timestep for the response variable streamflow because there are delays of some hours to months in water moving from different parts of each catchment to the gauging weirs where the response variable was measured for each month we aggregated the modelled daily deep drainage water that escaped past the root zone to monthly totals the streamflow response of interest is the annual total flow fluctuations in streamflow at shorter timescales than annual are of less interest to the catchment manager as all the flows from the catchments supplying melbourne can be captured in large storage reservoirs which have total capacity several times the mean annual stream flow we used published data for e regnans on npp with age volkova et al 2018 fig 1a and live tree biomass with age volkova et al 2018 fig 1c combined with a respiration ra biomass with age relationship from piao et al 2010 fig 2 to calculate gpp for various ages of e regnans from 10 to 150 years gpp npp ra live biomass we calculated annual transpiration for these ages based on a sapwood area age relationship from haydon et al 1997 and a mean sap velocity for e regnans of 11 6 cm hour 1 from benyon et al 2017 across stand ages from 10 to 150 years these calculations gave an almost constant water use efficiency wue of 0 00481 gg 1 standard deviation 0 00029 gg 1 this single value for wue is used in the model to derive daily overstorey gpp equation a10 from ta of which a proportion determined by age is available for stem volume increment is equation a14 daily stand mean height h equation a11 is modelled as a function of age and stocking density daily stand basal area ba increment equation a2 is calculated based on daily is taking account of h stand qd is calculated at the end of each day by converting tree mean basal area to diameter assuming a circular stem cross section equation a20 if the new qd places the stand above the self thinning line fig 1 n is reduced to the maximum n permitted by the self thinning line equation a18 the model does not currently include the curvature towards the stl shown in fig 1 assuming instead that n does not begin to reduce until the stand reaches the self thinning line the new n each day is used to predict stand mean sapwood thickness swt using an empirical relationship equation a23 determined by calibration of modelled against observed mean streamflow in a sample of three catchments the black spur group table 1 fig 3 fig 6 two of which were selectively thinned after 4 years see model parameterization steps below net rainfall enters the upper of two soil layers l1 and l2 l1 provides water for understorey transpiration and evaporation calculated as an empirical function of daily d estimated above the understorey du equation a7 and overstorey age vertessy et al 2001 benyon et al 2017 once l1 is full equation a21 any additional soil water drains to a second layer l2 which provides all water for ta once l2 is also full equation a22 any additional drainage from l1 to l2 becomes available for streamflow this excess drainage is accumulated each month and at month s end is routed to the stream using empirically determined lags of up to 14 months equation a31 for the wetted area which contains no e regnans trees monthly ea is calculated as a fixed proportion of p equation a29 and the remaining p enters the stream equation a33 for gully vegetation in the non wetted area ea for each month is fixed totalling 700 mm year 1 drawn from a single soil water store once this store is full equation a34 any excess p from that portion of the catchment that month enters the stream equation a32 2 3 model development and parameterisation for model parameterization and validation we used the 15 out of 17 experimental catchments considered to have reasonably reliable streamflow records based on moran and o shaughnessy 1984 and benyon et al 2015 the catchments used for specific model parameterization steps section 2 3 1 are indicated in the right hand column of table 1 2 3 1 model parameterization steps 1 calculate pre and post treatment stli for each catchment individually assuming a fixed slope of 1 605 reineke 1933 the fixed slope originally postulated by reineke was used because there was often only one pre or post treatment inventory making it impossible to fit both a unique slope and intercept for the stl as there would be an infinite number of solutions using a single value for the slope enabled calculation of a unique stli even when there was only one measurement of n and qd available several self thinning lines have been published for e regnans trouve et al 2017 these were initially tried but were unable to provide satisfactory predictions of long term changes in both n and qd by using a fixed slope a unique stli can be calculated based on only one set of inventory data assuming the forest at that time has reached the self thinning line this was done by using the inventory data to calculate qd then using qd in the stl with the fixed slope of 1 605 to calculate n stli was varied iteratively in the equation until the correct n from the inventory data was calculated 2 previously benyon et al 2015 showed that in small plots of e regnans plot mean sapwood thickness was correlated with n as sapwood area is a key variable in determining transpiration in the model and transpiration makes up a large component of total et which in turn has a strong influence on streamflow we calibrated the sapwood thickness swt versus n relationship at the catchment scale using a subset of the experimental catchments for the three treated black spur catchments including two both pre and post selective thinning simulations were started in 1972 with known pre treatment ba and n moran and o shaughnessy 1984 hawthorne et al 2013 and sapwood thickness swt was iteratively varied until pre treatment mean and post 1976 treatment in the two thinned catchments annual streamflow was correctly simulated final swt values were plotted against modelled mean n for the same periods for these five data points to develop an empirical relationship between swt and n equation a23 fig 6 for model validation we used this same relationship for the other 12 experimental catchments note that fig 6 also shows data points for the other 12 catchments and for the small sample plots from benyon et al 2015 for comparison 3 for one catchment an untreated control ettercon 3 the model was run for 36 years starting with known ba and n and the proportion of gpp going to stems cppa was fixed for each model run but varied iteratively for different model runs until stand basal areas at later ages were correctly simulated to correctly simulate the first observed n and ba at age 33 a lower cppa had to be used for the first 15 years the final model begins with cppa of 0 16 at age 1 increasing linearly to 0 23 at age 15 then remaining constant at 0 23 after that 4 stand mean height is used in the model to calculate stand daily basal area increment from stand daily stem volume increment it is therefore necessary to calculate stand height each day this is done empirically based on stand age however it was found that when ni was low use of a fixed height age relationship resulted in unrealistically low ba growth probably because too much cpp was going into height growth low competition in low density stands results in lower height growth and greater diameter growth to overcome this initial height growth in low density stands before the stl is reached was calibrated using ba and n measured in 2019 age 41 from three catchments mondas 1 2 and 3 harvested and regenerated at stand densities of 500 2000 and 10000 stems ha 1 in 1978 height growth in each of these catchments was iteratively varied in the model reduced by a fixed proportion for each model run until ba and n in 2019 was correctly simulated these three data points were used to derive a relationship between the height growth correction and initial n equation a11 5 lags between stand scale processes and streamflow were calibrated separately for the north maroondah and coranderrk catchments by iteratively varying monthly lags until a good fit to monthly streamflow was achieved in the ettercon 3 catchment representing all north maroondah catchments and the slip creek catchment representing the coranderrk group in summary for the stand scale model the cppa age function was calibrated using ettercon 3 the effect of ni on height growth was calibrated using mondas 1 2 and 3 post treatment and the swt vs n function was calibrated using black spurs 1 2 and 3 including post treatment for bs2 and bs3 at the catchment scale the streamflow monthly lags were calibrated using ettercon 3 for the north maroondah catchments and slip for the coranderrk catchments 2 3 2 model validation for streamflow validation the swt vs n function and the mean ni in 1940 derived from the three black spurs were used in the model for all of the other catchments including pre and post treatment periods and the observed monthly and modelled monthly streamflows were compared modelling steps for this validation are described below 1 treatments that did not involve stand replacement were simulated by restarting the model using the observed ba n and proportion of e regnans forest remaining in each catchment immediately post treatment table 1 black spur 2 3 ettercon 1 4 blue jacket 2 post treatment stli in each treated catchment was determined from observed post treatment n and ba measured up to 41 years after treatment table 1 using the same stl slope of 1 605 3 in the three stand replacement experiments in which post treatment n was controlled table 1 monda 1 2 3 the known initial n was used as ni at age 1 4 in the three other stand replacement experiments table 1 picaninny myrtle 2 and black spur 1 where initial n was not known ni of the e regnans regeneration was varied iteratively until ba and n observed at a later age from the post treatment inventory plots were correctly simulated 5 in two strip thinning experiments ettercon 1 4 in which alternate 35 m wide strips of forest were removed and retained without e regnans regeneration the proportion of forest was reduced and the proportion of scrub gully vegetation type increased to match the reductions in eucalypt forest area of 48 and 43 reported by hawthorne et al 2013 6 models for all 1939 regrowth catchments were initialised from 1940 age 1 2 4 simulation of streamflow responses to stand replacement the parameterised and validated model was used to simulate the effects of stand replacement in nine catchments 1 for three large sub catchments of the maroondah water supply catchment watts graceburn and donnellys table 1 fig 3 a similar method to kuczera 1985 1987 was used to estimate responses of annual streamflow to the 1939 fire as a function of post fire forest age the model was run from 1926 to 1939 with pre 1939 forest assumed to date from fire in 1851 this assumption is based on unpublished melbourne water corporation forest inventory showing that of 2936 ha of unburnt mature obligate seeder forest in maroondah catchment remaining after 1939 2312 ha 79 was the 1851 age class for the pre fire period a relationship between annual streamflow and three seasonal rainfall totals may december january april and december april in the previous year was fitted by regression analysis for the post fire period this regression relationship was used to predict annual streamflows based on observed rainfall for the three periods each year and any deviation in observed in this case modelled using the ecohydrological model from predicted streamflow represented the modelled effect of the fire the stli for the 1851 and 1939 forest age classes were determined from 134 inventory plots 18 in the 1851 and 116 in the 1939 age classes measured between december 2009 and may 2010 benyon and lane 2013 2 streamflow responses to stand replacement in five of the six stand replacement experiments table 1 black spur 1 monda 1 2 and 3 myrtle 2 were determined in the same way as for 1 above and the modelled and observed treatment effects were compared with those predicted based on forest age using the kuczera curve fig 2 for picaninny streamflow responses published in bren et al 2010 were used in the analysis 3 as an added test of whether the model is an improvement over the use of forest age as the determinant of annual et it was rerun for each simulation but the growth functions were turned off and modelled sapwood area asap was replaced with asap versus forest age functions from haydon et al 1997 and vertessy et al 2001 2 5 statistical analysis for comparing mean stli of the various catchment groups and age classes simple t tests were used in excel after first comparing variances for comparing goodness of fit of annual streamflow simulations the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metric gupta and kling 2011 was used 3 results 3 1 model parameterisation 3 1 1 self thinning line intercepts our underlying hypothesis that variability in streamflow responses to stand replacement is at least partly the result of variability in self thinning behaviour would not be testable if there were no changes in the stl after stand replacement and no spatial variation in stls this sub section examines how the calculated stl intercepts differed between groups of catchments and forest age classes and how they changed after stand replacement or thinning pre treatment mean stli with standard errors are shown in fig 5 for the north maroondah and coranderrk experimental catchment groups and for the 18 plots of 1851 and 116 plots of 1939 age classes measured in 2009 10 the mean stli of the 1939 age class was significantly higher than for all other groups p 0 01 the differences being greatest for the 1851 age class including coranderrk p 0 01 there were no statistically significant differences between the four north maroondah catchment groups black spur monda ettercon and myrtle despite differences in mean rainfall elevation and age there was a significant difference between the north maroondah catchments and the coranderrk catchments p 0 05 the effects of various selective thinning or clearfell including patch cut and regeneration treatments on stli were varied table 2 but overall there was little change in the pre and post treatment mean stli which among the eight treated catchments was 11 60 before treatment and 11 56 up to 41 years after treatment however in individual catchments there were sometimes substantial changes in the stli after stand replacement for example an increase from 11 24 to 11 65 after clearfell and regeneration in picaninny contrasting with a decrease of similar magnitude from 11 46 to 11 07 after the same treatment in myrtle 2 the mean absolute change in stli after treatment was 0 23 but with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in two selectively thinned catchments it increased in one but decreased in the other in the latter more heavily thinned catchment 50 basal area reduction there was no change in n between 1976 immediately after thinning and 2008 32 years after thinning indicating the stand had not yet returned to the self thinning line in the other selectively thinned catchment 33 basal area reduction n reduced from 138 immediately after thinning in 1976 to 96 in 2008 indicating self thinning had resumed in six stand replacement experiments stli increased in three catchments but decreased in the other three in summary these results indicate stli can change substantially after disturbance but the magnitude and direction of change is not consistent 3 1 2 relationship between mean swt and n the relationship between calibrated catchment mean sapwood thickness swt and n is shown in fig 6 in the years following heavy selective thinning in black spur 3 catchment mean sapwood thickness had to be increased from 1 7 to 3 0 cm for streamflow to be correctly simulated power functions fitted only to the three black spur catchments including pre and post selective thinning and to all regrowth catchments are similar fig 6 benyon et al 2015 measured the mean sapwood thickness directly in various small inventory plots which also showed a dependence of stand mean swt on n however in that study the relationship was not quite the same as when a catchment mean swt was not measured but calibrated using pre treatment and post selective thinning streamflow fig 6 the two oldgrowth catchments did not fit the relationship falling well below the regression lines apart from post selective thinning no catchment had a mean swt greater than 2 1 cm 3 1 3 proportion of gpp going to stems to achieve correct basal areas after beginning simulations at age 1 year the proportion of gpp going to stem growth had to be reduced when stand age was 15 years this may reflect that in young stands a greater proportion of gpp is used in growing roots and leaves and that the stands are thinning rapidly and the model does not account for dead trees in e regnans annual mortality peaks at about 50 of total npp at around age 25 years volkova et al 2018 which our model does not account for however our model gives predictions of cumulative gpp and live tree carbon consistent with literature values for example for an undisturbed 1939 regrowth catchment ettercon 3 the model predicts cumulative gpp of 2800 t ha 1 at age 80 compared with 2766 t ha 1 if npp of 1300 t ha 1 from volkova et al 2018 is multiplied by an average npp gpp ratio of 0 47 landsberg et al 2020 and both our model and volkova et al 2018 have live tree carbon of 300tc ha 1 at this age 3 2 model validation when swt vs n and ni were fitted using only the three black spur catchments using both pre and post selective thinning data and with treatment effects included the average model fit to monthly streamflow for the other 12 catchments fig 7 was very good nse 0 86 the modelled mean streamflow was 45 2 mm month 1 compared with 45 5 mm month 1 observed and the cumulative error from 1972 to 2018 was 0 6 the fit of mean annual streamflow before and after treatment fig 8 was also very good with nse of 0 92 and modelled mean streamflow of 614 mm year 1 compared with 617 mm year 1 observed these results indicate that for these forests the model captures the most important forest growth and et processes influencing monthly and mean annual streamflows and that these parameters are consistent between different catchments and stand ages the streamflow observations cover forest stands ranging from 1 to 240 years providing confidence that the model can be used reliably to model long term streamflow responses to stand replacement 3 3 effects of stli on streamflow responses to stand replacement 3 3 1 modelled and observed effects of stand replacement in 1939 stli had a strong influence on simulated streamflow responses to stand replacement after fire fig 9 with observed stlis from fig 5 used in the model fig 9a to 9c the timing and magnitude of the streamflow response observed by kuczera 1985 1987 was predicted more accurately than using the haydon et al 1997 or vertessy et al 2001 models fig 10 table 3 using the observed stlis modelled mean streamflow reduction across the three catchments between 1940 and 1982 was 235 mm year 1 compared with 233 mm year 1 observed for watts where 17 years of additional streamflow data were available for 2002 to 2018 almost 80 years after the fire both the observed and modelled fire effects on streamflow were still evident fig 9a mean fire effect for this period of 262 mm year 1 using the kuczera method and 322 mm year 1 modelled based on the entire period when streamflows were observed in each catchment model nse scores were 0 41 for watts 0 66 for graceburn and 0 47 for donnellys table 3 when the observed stli values were used that the nse values were only moderate rather than high is perhaps because there is substantial year to year noise in the rainfall runoff relationship caused by variables that were not modelled using the haydon et al 1997 sapwood areas example shown for watts in fig 10 the model always substantially under estimated the mean maximum and timing of the post fire streamflow reductions table 3 nses 0 04 to 0 44 model fit was similarly poor using the vertessy et al 2001 sapwood area model fig 10 table 3 nses 0 07 to 0 98 indicating that our prior understanding of the sapwood area dynamics in these forests was poor predictions of the mean streamflow responses were closer to those observed but the 10 year mean maximum flow reductions were much larger and occurred earlier than observed with a more rapid recovery example shown for watts in fig 10 using different stli from those observed for each age cohort gave very different predictions of streamflow responses even without model statistics such as the very negative nse values in table 3 the model fits are obviously very poor demonstrating that variability in the stli may have a strong influence on the hydrological response to stand replacement when the stli was not changed after 1939 1851 stli used both before and after 1939 much smaller streamflow reductions were predicted than were observed by kuczera fig 9d to 9f table 3 10 year running mean maximum flow reductions of 81 104 and 61 mm year 1 for watts graceburn and donnellys occurring only 7 or 8 years after the fire with the fire effects no longer evident after 32 years and a mean streamflow reduction from 1940 to 1982 of only 37 mm year 1 when the stlis were swapped post 1939 used before 1939 and pre 1939 used after 1939 the model predicted a substantial increase in streamflow fig 9g to 9i table 3 for the 1940 to 1982 period the modelled streamflow changes averaged 275 mm year 1 compared with 233 mm year 1 observed the 1939 regrowth forest in these catchments is now approaching the age of the 1851 regrowth when the 1939 fire occurred if a major fire occurs in the next decade and replaces the current 1939 regrowth using the historical climate the model predicts there will be a slight average 40 mm year 1 to substantial average 278 mm year 1 increase in mean annual streamflow over the next 80 years slight if there is no change in the current stli substantial if the new regrowth has the same stli as the 1851 regrowth 3 3 2 modelled and observed effects of six stand replacement experiments streamflow responses in six stand replacement experiments were predicted more reliably on average by the model than by the kuczera curve or by the haydon et al 1997 and vertessy et al 2001 sapwood area age models figs 11 and 12 table 4 in myrtle 2 the model did not predict the substantial streamflow increase in the first 5 years post treatment but after that the treatment effect was reasonably well simulated fig 11a with predicted mean reduction in streamflow from 1991 to 2018 of 124 mm year 1 compared with 123 mm year 1 observed however in the final 10 years 2009 2018 the model under predicted the treatment effect by an average of 123 mm year 1 77 mm year 1 modelled compared with 200 mm year 1 observed both the modelled and observed streamflow reductions were much less than predicted by the kuczera curve which gives a mean reduction between 1990 and 2018 of 329 mm year 1 and 472 mm year 1 in the last 10 years the nse was 0 28 for the model compared with 1 65 for the kuczera curve the haydon et al and vertessy et al models performed poorly predicting mean treatment effects respectively of 484 mm year 1 and 405 mm year 1 with nses of 5 25 and 4 03 for picaninny the simulation was not a good fit for the first 12 years post treatment fig 11b resulting in a poor nse score 0 02 but from age 13 to 35 the modelled treatment effect compares reasonably well with observations with a mean reduction for this period of 171 mm year 1 predicted compared with 127 mm year 1 observed however for 18 of these 23 years the model predicts a greater reduction in streamflow than observed the modelled maximum streamflow decline is much less than predicted by the kuczera curve consistent with observations which would be expected based on the low rainfall in this catchment in the black spur 1 patch cut and regeneration experiment simulated and observed treatment effects were in good agreement fig 11c nse 0 69 and in this case apart from the first 10 years after treatment are reasonably consistent with the kuczera curve which has the same trend and magnitude in streamflow changes but is a poor fit nse 1 16 simulations for the three monda catchments with and without effects of insect defoliation had both observed and modelled declines in streamflow after the initial post harvest peak less than predicted by the kuczera curve fig 12 when streamflow observations ceased 20 years after treatment no strong downward trend in streamflow was evident in either the observed or modelled streamflows for monda 1 and monda 2 this lack of a strong trend combined with large year to year variability in the observed treatment responses resulted in poor model fits table 4 nses usually negative however the modelled post treatment mean and periodic responses were much closer to observations than when the kuczera curve was used even when insect defoliation was not modelled for low density regeneration monda 3 where defoliation had little effect on basal area and stocking the model without defoliation reproduced the mean response well with a mean streamflow increase over the 20 years of 85 mm year 1 predicted compared to 87 mm year 1 observed for high density regeneration monda 2 the mean response was predicted well by the model with defoliation mean increase of 185 mm year 1 compared with 187 mm year 1 observed the predicted response was not so good for monda 1 mean streamflow increase of 115 mm year 1 with defoliation and 72 mm year 1 without compared with 172 mm year 1 observed but was better than the kuczera curve which predicted a mean streamflow reduction of 87 mm year 1 for the final 5 years of observations the models predict that beyond age 20 streamflow would decline below pre treatment in monda 1 and 3 but less than predicted by the kuczera curve without streamflow observations however these predictions cannot be verified 4 discussion 4 1 changing stls can explain varied effects of stand replacement our modelling supports the inbar et al 2022 hypothesis that self thinning can explain long term streamflow changes we went a step further by developing a model using forest inventory and water use data and validating against comprehensive long term streamflow records with a fixed stl slope of 1 605 reineke 1933 the model only reproduced long term streamflow reductions after wildfire observed by kuczera 1985 1987 when the increase in stl intercept observed in forest inventory in remnant stands was used in the model simulations of six stand replacement experiments using stli based on pre and post treatment inventories usually produced better predictions of streamflow responses than the kuczera curve in most cases streamflow reductions were less than predicted by the kuczera curve predictions using sapwood area in the model derived from two published sapwood area age models haydon et al 1997 vertessy et al 2001 gave worse predictions of streamflow responses to stand replacement possibly because these models do not account for how structural differences related to n and self thinning affect the relationship between sapwood area and age these results imply that the kuczera curve is a special case not only when compared to other eucalyptus forest types as suggested by webb et al 2012 but even within the e regnans forest type no stand replacement experiments have produced streamflow declines as large as those occurring after the 1939 fires at coranderrk bren et al 2010 this can be explained by relatively low rainfall compared to the larger catchments studied by kuczera 1985 1987 however in the myrtle 2 experiment where oldgrowth e regnans forest was converted to regrowth in a more typical rainfall zone watson et al 2001 the streamflow decrease has been much less than after the 1939 fires our modelling suggests this is because the stli decreased after stand replacement at myrtle 2 whereas it increased substantially after the 1939 fires our results enable a better understanding of how stand replacement is likely to affect streamflows in future more than half of melbourne s water is supplied by forest regenerated in 1939 the already high stli in this age class means it is unlikely to increase after the next stand replacement as it did in 1939 meaning the next fire will result in only a small reduction in streamflow or even an increase rather than being the rule in these forests the kuczera curve appears to be only one of several possible responses to disturbance perhaps explaining why the kuczera curve is unusual in the international forest hydrology literature 4 2 why does the stli vary between cohorts while a change in the stli can explain why streamflow declined after stand replacement in 1939 and why responses of the same magnitude have not been observed in small catchment experiments it raises a question about why the stli changed after 1939 and more generally about what causes stls to change in the same forest type following stand replacement one possibility in e regnans is that the eucalyptus stl is influenced by the proportion of competing acacia species in the early stages of regeneration several acacia species are common in the understorey of e regnans but when these stands are replaced acacia seedlings often compete strongly with eucalyptus seedlings and for the next 15 to 20 years stands can consist of a mixture of co dominant e regnans a dealbata and or a melanoxylon vertessy et al 1994 hawthorne et al 2018 before the acacias are overtopped and become a mid storey pfautsch et al 2010 sometimes pure stands of acacia regenerate but these are shorter lived than e regnans and die out within 80 years lakmali et al 2022 fig 13 shows the correlation between eucalyptus stli and proportional acacia basal area for mixed stands using data from the monda catchments at age 41 and from several other studies polglase and attiwill 1992 vertessy et al 1994 pfautsch et al 2010 hawthorn et al 2018 once the acacias have become suppressed or died after 75 80 years a remnant e regnans stand will be left having a relatively low stli during the pre fire calibration period used by kuczera 1987 from 1926 to 1938 the dominant 1851 age class would have been 75 to 88 years old which is the age at which a dealbata can quickly die out a predominance of mixed e regnans a dealbata stands in the 1851 regeneration could explain the low stli of this age cohort the regression line in fig 13b suggests that acacia basal area of 36 in the 1851 regrowth but only 18 in the 1939 regrowth could give the mean stli measured in the remnant 1851 and 1939 stands fig 5 benyon and lane 2013 reported noticeable differences in regeneration density of e regnans seedlings in three large catchments 1 and 2 years after stand replacing fires in 2009 in catchments with lower e regnans regeneration density mixed stands with different forest structures may have regenerated resulting in different self thinning behaviour and a different streamflow response the type of disturbance can also influence regeneration density and spatial variability in e regnans natural regeneration density following wildfire was spatially more variable than regeneration after clearfell harvest and aerial sowing causing long term differences in stand structure and stls trouve et al 2021 changes in atmospheric co2 and water availability may alter self thinning behaviour controlled increases in co2 for 11 years in trembling aspen resulted in higher stand basal area for a given stocking density kubiske et al 2018 a similar response to rising atmospheric co2 in e regnans in melbourne s catchments meaning an increase in stli would increase sapwood areas and therefore transpiration unless there was a counterbalancing decrease in stomatal conductance pretzsch and biber 2021 observed a correlation between stli and annual precipitation in pinus sylvestrus l in melbourne s catchments the climate is projected to become drier and warmer clarke et al 2019 possibly meaning a reduction in stli and a decrease in et although in e regnans the mean annual precipitation is substantially higher than in the pretzsch and biber 2021 study under projected climate changes wildfire in southeast australia and in some other fire prone regions is expected to become more frequent meaning stand replacement will occur more often lakmali et al 2022 potentially resulting in different self thinning and streamflow responses more generally if climate change causes changes in self thinning behaviour hydrological responses to disturbance may become more varied across the world s forests if an increase in co2 or temperature results in an increase in the stl intercept for a given mean tree size more trees can survive streamflows are likely to decrease for a given rainfall alternatively if more drought or high temperatures lowers the self thinning line the ratio of runoff to rainfall may increase although in absolute terms rainfall reductions may still result in streamflow reductions 4 3 limitations broader implications and future research needs our modelling approached was developed for a specific forest type with several important empirical relationships tuned to improve the model fit to streamflow using a small subset of the available data for this reason we would recommend against wide application of the model in its raw form beyond the forest type in which it was developed our modelling assumed that only the intercept of the stl varies within the forest type studied studies have shown that stl slopes and intercepts can vary between species between regeneration methods and over time within the same species charru et al 2012 forrester et al 2021 trouvé et al 2021 and that the parameters of the stl can vary depending on the statistical method used to fit the model zeide 2010 trouvé et al 2017 in forest types where stand replacement is known to have a long term influence on streamflow the approach we have used here might be useful for exploring possible causes of streamflow responses and whether these might change in future if self thinning behaviour changes to use a stl based modelling approach for an existing forest at least one measure of the current stocking density and basal area is needed after the stand has reached the self thinning line this requires either an extensive ground survey or in future may be achievable using remote sensing for example using lidar jaskierniak et al 2015 it may take a decade or more to obtain the required inventory data after a major disturbance for example detailed forest inventory for 7000 ha of oldgrowth e regnans regenerated in melbourne s catchments after wildfire in 2009 are still not available 13 years later meaning the likely long term hydrological impacts of this fire cannot yet be predicted with any certainty following this major disturbance we would have liked to have collected inventory data from age 5 years onwards and undertake remeasurements every 5 years to establish the long term stl of the regrowth for predicting long term streamflow responses however due to the presence of numerous very large dead trees access for measurements of the regrowth has been deemed too dangerous and access trails are no longer passable once access is again possible and it can be determined whether the regenerating forests have reached a stable self thinning line we believe that streamflow projections can be made for at least the next 50 years using the stl based method analysis of streamflow records by the catchment manager since the 2009 fire suggest that so far there is not a detectable streamflow reduction even where substantial areas of old e regnans forest were killed and regenerated in the high rainfall o shannassy catchment dr shane haydon melbourne water corporation personal communication this is consistent with observations by benyon and lane 2013 of relatively low eucalyptus seedling regeneration densities in o shannassy meaning likely development of mixed e regnans and acacia stands with a relatively low e regnans stl perhaps similar to the 1851 regrowth some of our fitted model parameters are substantially different from real world expectations or have not been well validated for example the proportion of gpp available for construction 16 to 23 in the model is much lower than the 40 to 60 suggested by the literature landsberg et al 2020 perhaps because the model does not keep track of mortality which can account for up to 50 of npp in e regnans volkova et al 2018 routing the excess rainfall to the stream after accounting for all evapotranspiration losses does not have any underlying physical basis the assumptions about evapotranspiration from the gully vegetation and saturated zone around the stream have not been validated using the current model parameters for e regnans if the model is initialised at age 1 year and run for more than 100 years the stand stops thinning to achieve the basal areas and stocking densities observed in very old forest the stli needs to begin to reduce after about 100 years this is consistent with more detailed studies of self thinning that suggest the stl curves downwards in older forests charru et al 2012 our study was undertaken in natural eucalyptus forest in which stand density and structure is largely controlled by natural processes or in the case of timber harvesting the silviculture is intended to mimic the response to wildfire planted forests can also affect long term catchment water yields in these forests the self thinning line is sometimes used to maximise the carrying capacity of the site the aim may be to manage stand density to maximise profitability taking account of the quality and volume of wood harvested and the cost of production and harvesting our modelling approach could be adapted to planted forests for integrated modelling of plantation growth evapotranspiration and streamflow planted forests are typically established at densities lower than the maximum carrying capacity of the site i e below the self thinning line to maximise the size of individual trees for economic reasons whether the planted forest ever reaches the self thinning line depends on the silviculture applied to the stand in short rotations for pulpwood or biomass production the planted forest will not be thinned if growth rates are rapid enough self thinning may begin before the plantation is harvested in longer rotations where the aim is to produce higher value products artificial thinning may be applied which may prevent the stand ever reaching the self thinning line using the self thinning model approach the effects of management decisions can be accounted for by reducing the stocking density and basal area in the model in line with known thinning regimes the self thinning line defines the maximum number of plants of a given mean size in this case tree mean basal area or quadratic mean dbh that can be carried by the site when growth rates temporarily slow due for example to below average temperatures drought insects disease the rate of increase in mean tree size may slow down which means the rate of self thinning also slows down if these stress factors are severe enough to cause tree death e g the site can temporarily no longer carry as many plants of a given mean size n may drop below the maximum carrying capacity of the site once conditions return to normal the drought breaks or the pests die off then it may take some time for the stand to return to the self thinning line this can be modelled if the effects of the stress factors on n and basal area are known in our study the effects of several insect attacks on n and stand basal area in the monda catchments were known from annual inventory measurements within the model it was possible to make a manual adjustment of n and basal area to account for these effects similarly after two selective thinnings in which the pre and post thinning n and basal area were observed the effect of thinning could be modelled by manually adjusting n and basal area at the time of thinning to match the observed post thinning n and basal area 5 conclusion ecohydrological modelling of long term water use and streamflow responses to disturbance in even aged e regnans forests was improved by accounting for the effects of changes in the self thinning line after stand replacement this modelling suggests the kuczera curve may have been the result of an unusually large increase in the self thinning line after fire induced stand replacement in 1939 reasons for changes in the stl after stand replacement are not yet known although may be related to post regeneration competition with shorter lived understorey species and to spatial variability in regeneration density the time since disturbance proxy for stand dynamics to explain rainfall runoff relationships proposed by kuczera 1987 haydon et al 1997 and vertessy et al 2001 and used in more recent modelling peel et al 2000 lane et al 2010 feikema et al 2013 taylor et al 2019 should be replaced with an explicit representation of forest structure dynamics as provided by the self thinning line this approach is parameterizable when both pre and post disturbance forest inventory data are available and better explains the diversity in rainfall runoff relationships observed in australian stand replacement experiments watson et al 2001 bren et al 2010 webb et al 2012 there is an opportunity to better understand the relationship between stand management and water output from afforested catchments gaining more information on forest stand structure dynamics versus water yield and understanding how global changes like climate change also affect stand structure is a natural progression of such studies
