23150,a review is presented on a wide range of optimal sensor placement osp strategies and ways of evaluation an assessment guided optimal sensor placement algorithm based on minimal root mean square is proposed to give quantitative comparison on these options the algorithm is applied to an example of a cantilever beam as well as to a jacket platform where model uncertainty and measurement error are included simultaneously the results reveal the influence of the number of desired sensors and the number of modes of interest it is shown that the optimal sensor placement selected by the proposed strategy yields the best modal orthogonality of the corresponding mode shapes and competitive results are derived on the other two assessment standards i e the condition number of the reduced mode shape matrix and the determinant of the fisher information matrix the conclusions also show that the effective independence method keeps the largest determinant and there seems no regular trend on the condition number but unexpected biased solutions can be derived when unreasonable combination for number of wanted sensors and modes of interest are chosen the proposed minimal root mean square algorithm is capable of avoiding this drawback keywords optimal sensor placement assessment standard modal orthogonality modal independence 1 introduction the optimal sensor placement osp strategy has been an essential problem in engineering fields such as structural performance analysis or spatial variability assessment more often in modal identification process the desired number of sensors as well as their positions should be carefully determined such that the configuration recovers the target frequency of interest and reflects the structural mode shapes in an authentic manner in essence compared with the large amount of dofs in structures only a small number of sensors are available and accessibility limitations always need to be considered which calls for an automatic approach that results in an optimum or near optimum selection being the basic part of structure health monitoring shm the data from modal measurements should be of adequate precision and contents for subsequent applications such as model updating state evaluation and damage detection finally to judge the goodness of a set of sensor distribution several standards of evaluation should also be established in the past literatures some researchers looked from the point of view of the control principles for the sensor placement problem baruh and choe 1990 however others took a dynamic perspective that an optimal selection should recover those modal parameters of interest probably one of the most common method is the effective independence ei kammer 1991 the fisher information matrix fim is employed to form the effective independence vector which gives a fractional contribution of each candidate sensor with respect to the target modes those sensor locations with the largest continuous effective independence will be retained the effect of noise kammer 1992a and model error kammer 1992b in the ei method were also investigated based on this a modified mass weighted ei method garvey et al 1996 was advocated where the iterative deletion process of the candidate sensors is achieved along with the guyan reduction guyan 1965 which normally requires more computation since the guyan reduction neglects the inertia force of slave dofs the ratio k i i m i i for the i th coordinate was presented where k i i and m i i are the i th diagonal element of the stiffness and the mass matrix respectively penny et al 1994 the coordinates with the smaller ratios correspond to those sensors with the larger inertia effect and are considered as the master dofs on the hypothesis that the dof with the largest kinetic energy will ultimately produce the strongest dynamic response and observability larson et al 1994 suggested an osp algorithm that iteratively deletes the sensor with the smallest kinetic energy per mode from the candidate sequence and continuously retains those sensors with the largest values li et al 2007 showed the inherent connection between the effective independence and the modal kinetic energy method the average kinetic energy method and the weighted average kinetic energy method chung and moore 1993 follow the idea of the original manner and exclude the sensors on modal node zero motion point other energy approaches e g the driving point residue dpr the eigenvalue vector product evp and the effective independence driving point residue ei dpr were well described in the historical references papadopoulos and garcia 1998a meo and zumpano 2005 brown et al 1999 conducted studies on the multi objective osp considering kinetic energy liu et al 2005 used a modal assurance criterion method combined with ei to determine the sensor placement of a concrete cable stayed bridge besides these some other approaches based on genetic algorithms han et al 2014 neural networks worden and burrows 2001 have also been introduced to the osp strategy to evaluate how good a given set of sensor placement is several assessment standards are of great necessity though there seems to be no uniform benchmark five indicators in three distinct viewpoints were attempted penny et al 1994 i e the modal orthogonality the modal independence and the modal energy despite no optimal one was achieved for the reason that all of them hold both merits and drawbacks and even conclusions of little diversity were derived occasionally they still offered a quantitative judgment and thus comparisons could be made these indexes will be discussed later in this paper in terms of application zou et al 2017 utilized fim matrix to measure the performance of sensor configuration on a seafloor geodetic node multiple wireless sensor nodes were used to measure ship hydroelastic response bennett et al 2014 many jacket platforms adopt reduced model systems for model updating or damage identification purposes which also calls the need of osp strategy wang et al 2015 li et al 2008 giving the brief literature review and making the comparative study with several existing methods this paper also proposes an assessment guided osp technique named minimal root mean square min rms algorithm this osp strategy looks for a set of sensor distribution that minimizes the root mean square over the mass weighted modal assurance criterion mmac two numerical examples including a cantilever beam and a jacket platform are thoroughly studied with variation on the number of desired sensors as well as the number of modes of interest in the second example measurement noise and model uncertainty are added simultaneously the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is proved along with several important conclusions being summarized 2 methodologies a final osp set could be chosen either by an increasing order or a decreasing one the former means to add gradually into the final osp set with the sensor locations with better performance while the decreasing order adopted by most techniques requires an initial candidate set where unsatisfactory sensor locations would be deleted at each iterative step for large structure or model with massive number of dofs the selection of the initial candidate set is important but often dismissed a possible initial candidate set should contain as little as 40 50 of the total kinetic energy for each target mode kammer 1991 normally the rotational motions are difficult to measure and several locations suffer from limited accessibility these dofs would be primarily excluded from the initial candidate set in this paper φ is defined as the complete set of mode shapes φ r is the reduced form with size of m n where m denotes number of dofs in the initial candidate set and n is number of modes of interest the problem can be described by how to select the final osp set with s s m dofs which gives the best performance in certain assessment standards for simplicity and clarity a number of osp methods are reviewed and summarized in section 2 and the assessment standards will be discussed in the following section 3 note that the osp strategy is processed with adding or reducing dofs until a final osp set is selected which is generally accompanied by changing the system size in a reducing manner perhaps the simplest way is to directly delete rows and columns in the system matrix that correspond to the dofs to be eliminated while some other approaches require the guyan reduction which may derive a model with more precise dynamic response for comparison and unification all osp strategies in this paper adopt the guyan reduction when the system matrix needs to be reduced this will only affect the mass related osp strategies and the corresponding assessment standards 2 1 effective independence ei to select a set of sensor placement such that the derived mode shapes of interest are as linearly independent as possible while keeping more information about selected modal responses the diagonal elements of an effective independence matrix was employed kammer 1991 expressed by 1 e φ r a 1 φ r t where a is the fisher information matrix fim formulated as 2 a φ r t φ r where φ r denotes the target mode matrix of the initial candidate set since e is validated to be idempotent namely the trace and the rank of matrix e are numerically equal each element in vector e d the diagonal terms of e represents the fractional contribution of the corresponding dof to the linear independence of the mode shape matrix at each iterative step the dof with the smallest diagonal term is eliminated from the initial candidate set and the corresponding row and column in system matrix would be compacted the osp strategy ends when expected number of sensors are achieved poston and tolson 1992 proved that this method tends to maximize the determinant of a each element in vector e d varies from 0 to 1 the larger the value the greater the effective independence note that the inverse operation is required here to obtain a non singular matrix a the number of desired sensors should be no less than the number of target modes meo and zumpano 2005 2 2 mass weighted effective independence ei mass on the basis of the ei method a mass weighted strategy along with the guyan reduction was introduced garvey et al 1996 the mass weighted effective independence matrix becomes 3 e m a s s m g 0 5 φ r a m a s s 1 φ r t m g 0 5 where the fisher information matrix a m a s s is expressed as 4 a m a s s φ r t m g φ r and m g represents the reduced mass matrix by guyan reduction compared with eliminating the corresponding rows and columns of system matrix in a direct way guyan reduction neglects inertia force of the slave dofs and seeks for better dynamic responses this operation will only affect the mass weighted osp strategies and several mass related assessment indexes e g kinetic energy and more computation complexity is also implemented analogous to the ei method this osp strategy iteratively removes those dofs with small effective independence until designated number of sensors are obtained 2 3 effective independence driving point residue ei dpr considering that the sensor locations with lower energy may be included in a final osp set meo and zumpano 2005 proposed the effective independence driving point residue dpr approach which employs the energy operator dpr defined by 5 d p r j i 1 n φ i j 2 ω i where d p r j corresponds to the j th component of the vector d p r n is the total number of mode shapes of interest ω i and φ i j respectively denote the i th natural frequency and the j th element within the i th mode shape thus the energy weighted effective independence vector converts into 6 e d d p r e d d p r where represents the term by term multiplication each element in e d d p r is deemed as contribution of the dof to the corresponding effective independence and energy indicator again the dof with the smallest contribution will be eliminated and a final osp set is iteratively acquired 2 4 kinetic energy ke the ei related methods seek to maximize the determinant of the fisher information matrix a to retain as much information as possible but some other methods look into an energy based perspective assuming that the sensors with the largest kinetic energy might show better dynamic response and observability kammer 1991 thus these corresponding dofs should be reserved the kinetic energy matrix is formulated by 7 k e φ r m φ r where m is the mass matrix corresponding to the initial candidate set comparison is made among the maximum element of each row in k e and iterative elimination is implemented to the dof with the lowest value of those maximums the process repeats until desired s dofs are remained 2 5 average kinetic energy ake for consideration of the dofs within modal nodes the average kinetic energy ake method is proposed to balance the negative effect of those zero motion points the total kinetic energy for each dof is divided by number of modes of interest expressed by 8 a k e i 1 n j 1 n k e i where a k e i represents the contribution of the i th dof n is the number of modes of interest similar to the ke method an automatic selection process is executed to keep dofs with the best performance 2 6 weighted average kinetic energy wake the wake method adopts a new weight vector the average kinetic energy matrix is multiplied by the minimum value of kinetic energy within each dof this weight vector would completely exclude those dofs with modal nodes thus a final osp set with larger modal energy is expected the expression is 9 w a k e k e m i n a k e where k e m i n is the minimum in absolute value across the rows in k e 2 7 eigenvalue vector product evp the evp is another energy based method giving the i th dof of a factorial 10 e v p i j 1 n φ r i j where π denotes factorial operator φ r i j is the element of φ r at the position of i th row and j th column the dof with the smallest value of e v p i is removed at every iteration since the modal node is destined to lead to a zero e v p i the dofs with those modal nodes will always be eliminated 2 8 driving point residue dpr the dpr is a measure of particular sensor location when exciting a particular mode but it is also alternatively utilized as a strategy for sensor placement the dpr can be expressed by either eq 5 or 11 d p r φ r φ r λ r where the matrix d p r has the same size as φ r of m n λ r is the diagonal natural frequency matrix the osp procedure tends to consistently remain dofs corresponding to those rows in d p r with larger values in essence matrix d p r is sometimes clarified as an energy based approach with a frequency weight applied 2 9 average driving point residue adpr similar to the family of the k e methods to exclude the effect of zero motion point the average driving point residue adpr and weighted average driving point residue have been proposed chung and moore 1993 formulated by 12 a d p r j 1 n i 1 n d p r i j where a d p r j is the contribution of the j th dof averaged by the number of modes of interest n d p r i j denotes the j th element within the i th mode shape the weighted average driving point residue can be expressed as 13 w a d p r d p r m i n a d p r where d p r m i n is the minimum in absolute value across the rows in m 1 vector a d p r the optimum set of sensor placement is the one retains the largest a d p r and w a d p r across the entire candidate dofs 2 10 guyan reduction another viewpoint presents the osp method based on model reduction penny et al 1994 it is well known that the guyan reduction gr leaves out the inertia effect of the slave dofs thus the inertia force in these dofs should be chosen to be less important than the elastic force while the master dofs are selected oppositely this characteristic leads to an examination of the ratio k i i m i i for the i th coordinate where a small value means a significant inertia weight associated with this coordinate which should be retained as a master dof while the coordinates with larger values are chosen and removed from the candidate set after each deletion the system matrix is reduced with the guyan reduction and a new cycle is executed repeatedly until s desired dofs remain note that it is recommended to delete only one coordinate at a time for a balanced distribution since guyan reduction is lack of high order precision this method would guarantee a satisfactory result only if the lower modes are considered 3 assessment of goodness when a set of sensor placement is derived by any of the osp strategy mentioned above the evaluation of goodness is of great importance five indexes of assessment were suggested which check the problems via linearly independence orthogonality and energy viewpoints in this paper three of them are applied to give a comparative study among osp strategies herein φ r s is defined as the mode shape matrix driven from the final set of sensor distribution m s is the corresponding mass matrix with s dofs a the root mean square rms of the off diagonal entries of the mass weighted modal assurance criterion mmac matrix in modal test since mode shapes are expected to be orthogonal to the mass matrix as much as possible namely φ r s t m s φ r s i i is the identity matrix thus one could define mmac matrix that consists of 14 m m a c i j φ r s i t m s φ r s j 2 φ r s i t m s φ r s i φ r s j t m s φ r s j the diagonals of the mmac matrix are 1 and zero off diagonals are ideally wanted the rms of the off diagonal entries is formulated by 15 r m s s q r t i 1 n j 1 j i n m m a c i j 2 n 2 n where s q r t is the square root operator and n denotes the number of modes of interest the lower value of the rms indicates a better modal orthogonality so that a better set of sensor distribution is derived b the condition number cn of the final mode shape matrix φ r s a favorable mode shape matrix is expected to contain as much information as possible in other words the linear independence of the matrix should be guaranteed by singular value decomposition svd of φ r s the ratio between the biggest and the smallest singular value is calculated to represent the linear independence the svd is performed as 16 φ r s u t σ v where u v are two unitary matrices σ diag σ 1 σ 2 σ n and the singular values yield σ 1 σ 2 σ n 0 then 17 c n σ 1 σ n normally the condition number is greater to 1 the lower limit shows the complete orthogonality of the final mode shape matrix φ r s and the higher values correspond to those φ r s with lower linear independence c the determinant det of the fisher information matrix a an alternative standard of assessment is by comparing the determinant of the fisher information matrix which indicates the amount of information in the data at the reduced set of coordinates penny et al 1994 this value is expected to be as high as possible to give satisfactory amount of information poston and tolson 1992 suggested that the ei method seeks a set of osp that maximizes the determinant of a in addition it can be verified that the condition number of a is the square of the condition number with respect to the reduced mode shape matrix φ r this index is computed by 18 d e t d e t φ r s t φ r s where d e t means the determinant operator note that the determinant could be negative sometimes here the absolute value is employed 4 min rms since the root mean square rms could be taken as a remarkable feature of orthogonality an assessment guided osp strategy named minimal root mean square min rms is proposed that might be in favor of minimizing rms the strategy searches for a decreasing order in which one dof would be deleted from the initial candidate set at each iteration and keep the remains with minimum rms because an enormous number of combinations exist for the final osp set this approach advocates to eliminate one location at a time thus brings in a more uniform distribution and the error would be scattered note this algorithm may not lead to the perfect solution but it attempts an advantageous direction in lowering the rms thus an orthogonality favoured mode shape matrix is derived the algorithm depicted in fig 1 has five steps a define the initial candidate set s c including all dofs except for rotational ones and constrains set the number of desired sensors s and the number of modes of interest n b delete the first dof d 1 from the initial candidate set and calculate the corresponding compacted mode shape matrix φ r 1 and the mass matrix m r 1 c compute the r m s 1 using φ r 1 and m r 1 and return d 1 into initial candidate set d repeat step b to step c for every single dof in the initial candidate set calculate the corresponding r m s 2 r m s m the dof retains the smallest r m s r will be permanently eliminated e repeat step b to step d until the s desired number of sensors are left in s c the proposed strategy ensures that after every iterative step the eliminated dof d r will retain the smallest r m s r as result of this a mmac matrix of relatively low rms is expected to achieve which represents an ideal orthogonality of mode shapes 5 examples 5 1 cantilever beam the discussed osp strategies are applied to a uniform cantilever beam including 2 nodes and 4 dofs axial dofs are omitted in each plane element 30 elements of this kind with elastic modulus of 32 gpa and density of 2500 kg m3 are assembled the geometric parameters are shown in fig 2 as a benchmark model the number of desired sensors and the number of modes of interest should be carefully selected consider that only some lower frequency modes can be measured precisely the first three modes are set to be of particular interest n 3 according to practical applications the number of desired sensors is inadvisable to be too little since sufficient information should be guaranteed besides superabundant number of sensors would result in similar assessment values where significant difference may not be distinguished hence in this case 15 desired sensors s 15 is decided when the osp strategies are performed the optimum sensor locations calculated by different osp strategies are illustrated in fig 3 it is observed that the evp method restricts most sensors on the fixed end while on the contrary locations selected by wake and wadpr have better preference on the free end of the cantilever beam two groups of sensor locations with general wider span can be roughly divided by using ei family methods dpr and adpr method in addition more dispersedly distributed selections along the axis are presented by ke ake guyan and min rms method there are some intuitive recognitions that the closely distributed sensor placement may be unfavourable since the information in other part would be missing and the selections at the fixed end is better to be less than the ones toward the free end where motions are more acute for comparison a percentage length of the mean position within a set of location is employed from the fixed end and the goodness valued by the three discussed assessment standards are shown in table 1 the osp strategy would be one that maintains the largest det the smallest cn and rms when the desired s sensors are obtained it seems that no osp strategy is able to give a perfect solution in all three assessment standards the wake and the proposed min rms method obtain the lower rms in magnitude thus the orthogonality of mode shapes are ensured the ei method shows the largest value of det while the other ei based methods ei mass ei dpr as well as the min rms are of relative better performance as for the condition number cn ke ranks the smallest value and the difference are little among the results calculated by ei ei dpr and min rms which means the effective information are better by utilizing these methods in this case it is observed that the proposed min rms does not lead to the lowest value of root mean square as mentioned in section 4 one option is eliminated from the candidate set at every iterative step this only results in an alternative searching direction to the final set with the lowest rms which concludes there is still less possibility that a better solution would be found another important issue is the mutation of the cn which is not obvious in this case calculated by evp and wadpr algorithm the larger values of cn represent more redundancy of the derived mode shape matrix actually all energy based approaches as well as the guyan method suffer from this drawback especially when fewer number of sensors are wanted the ei based methods and the min rms algorithm seem to guarantee stable solutions which can be clearly compared in table 2 and fig 4 only with the curves of the best performance since there are many curves that represent results from different osp methods for clarity line graphs are employed in the following figures as seen in fig 4 the ei based methods and the proposed min rms algorithm tend to keep cn at a lower standard meanwhile all energy based methods i e ke ake wake evp dpr adpr wadpr show the greatest possibility on mutation of the cn while guyan method sees less unsatisfactory result occasionally see table 2 the values derived from evp dpr adpr wadpr are sometimes even prohibitively large since the modal independence and orthogonality are not the major consideration these methods will also result in smaller det of the fisher information matrix and the corresponding sensor distribution are normally more concentrated to survey in a more objective way fig 5 and fig 6 illustrate the det and rms obtained by different osp strategies against increasing number of desired sensors for clarity only the curves with relative good performance are presented the first three modes are set to be of particular interest note that one location will be eliminated from the candidate set at every iterative step thus the practical iteration process is in reversed order about the x axis from the fig 5 it is observed that the ei based methods and the proposed min rms rank the first class on det indicator the ei method reveals the highest value and comparable trend is followed by the min rms algorithm comparing with the energy based methods the ei mass and the ei dpr approaches are proved to demonstrate better performance in most cases the difference increases when sufficient number of desired sensors are required the rms variations are explained in fig 6 the general trend indicates that at each iterative step the removal of a certain dof from the candidate set would lead to an expanded level of rms value from s 21 to s 1 the fluctuant curves reveal unstable solutions when s is less than 8 the ei mass as well as the ke method tends to keep the lower rms when sufficient number of sensors are utilized s 8 the highlight is as expected that the proposed min rms algorithm nearly selects the lowest rms along the iteration which ensures that the corresponding mode shape is of the best orthogonality as mentioned in section 2 for comparison and unification guyan reduction is employed for all osp strategies when the system size needs to be compacted this would bring in non monotonicity for rms indicator as modal parameters are changing throughout the iteration condition number and rms affected by number of modes of interest are presented respectively in fig 7 and fig 8 the first 2 to 10 modes are set to be variable again curves only with the relative good performance are included when taking high order modal parameters into account negative escalations of the condition number are seen among all osp strategies notice that the degree of influence may vary the ake guyan and the other energy based methods not shown suffer most from the high modes while ei based methods retain lower values and the min rms also keeps outstanding cn at a relatively low level in fig 8 the rms of the mass weighted modal assurance criterion mmac matrix sees more irregular variation as high order modes are included during the optimization the number of modes of interest must not be set to 1 since the off diagonal entries are calculated as a whole the ei mass method is capable of providing satisfactory solution when few modes are adopted meanwhile the amazing result derived by min rms algorithm presents extreme low values against variable the other methods show more instability which indicates the modal orthogonality of derived mode shape is not always guaranteed it can be concluded from the first example that the proposed min rms algorithm tends to search for the lowest rms value throughout the optimization and also retains a comparable level of condition number and det indicator satisfactory results can always be guaranteed when different number of sensors are selected the join of the high order modes show negative influence on all indicators especially the rms values but excellent solution can still be derived by proposed min rms algorithm 5 2 jacket platform the second application is a typical jacket platform model chosen from an early work to identify the damage location from limited amount of modal information kim and stubbs 1995 consisting of 36 pipe elements and 16 nodes in four levels see fig 9 the platform is set to have uniform modulus of elasticity e 210gpa poisson s ratio ν 0 3 and mass density ρ 7850 k g m 3 the outer and inner diameter of the pipe element are 17 8 cm and 16 02 cm respectively the side length from the bottom to the top level are 10 97 m 8 53 m 6 10 m and 3 66 m the height between each level is identical 9 14 m and four grounding nodes are constrained for all dofs before performing osp strategies the candidate sensor placement set is defined by including all translational dofs except for those connected to the ground similar to the first example the guyan reduction technique is implemented for a compacted model where a total of 36 candidate sensor locations are initiated considering the practical application the first four modes and the number of desired sensors ranges from 12 to 24 are set to be of particular interest fig 9 shows the osp strategy calculated by the min rms algorithm when s 12 s 18 and s 24 in general when s 12 the sensors are arranged uniformly within every level as well as along x and y axis no selection along z axis is concluded as number of desired sensors s increases an escalating distribution is located on the top level along z direction when s 18 the last 6 added sensors are allocated evenly again among three levels three assessment indexes derived by different osp strategies are illustrated from fig 10 to fig 12 in this example the majority of the ei based and energy based methods obtain the same or similar result except for those concluded by the evp method which is verified to be the worst fig 10 gives the condition number against increasing s where ei based and energy based methods show advisable curves and descending trend can be obtained the evp method keeps the cn at very high value and relative excellent curve is concluded by guyan method the highlight is that the proposed min rms algorithm seeks the lowest rms but the cn concluded here is also retained at the lowest nearly all the time the det curves fig 11 show that the ei method still remains the best amount of information although in this special case most ei based and energy based methods show nearly the same transformation on curves the min rms algorithm is not capable of providing as much information as other methods except for guyan and evp which run the det value at the lowest level the superiority of the proposed algorithm is revealed in fig 12 where the min rms maintains the smallest value of rms no matter number of desired sensors changes the guyan method expresses moderate result comparing with those curves calculated by ei based and energy based methods which present prohibitively high value of the rms especially when few sensors are required s 18 the evp curve is not included due to extreme disproportion the difference among all approaches is narrowed when more sensors are added note the min rms algorithm shows the lowest rms values in every iterative step thus the best orthogonality is always assured the above conclusions are obtained on the assumption that the model is of sufficient accuracy and the noise contamination is neglected in reality the inevitable model uncertainty and the measurement error would bring in unknown and even negative influence on final solution which should be carefully considered generally there are three sorts of modelling errors i e discretization error configuration error and mechanical parameter error in this paper only random error associated with the material properties are considered which is verified to have normal distribution low and hao 2001 the contaminated noise in modal identification is also assumed to have a normal distribution in many studies papadopoulos and garcia 1998b considering the material parameter for stiffness and mass matrix of the system the modulus of elasticity e and mass density ρ for each element are selected to be the variables the uncertainties of the fe model and the noise contamination are assumed to be mutually independent expressed as 19 φ i j φ i j 0 φ i j 0 x λ i j φ i j 0 1 ε x φ i j 20 e k e k 0 e k 0 x e k e k 0 1 σ x e k 21 ρ k ρ k 0 ρ k 0 x ρ k ρ k 0 1 σ x ρ k where φ i j is the i th term of the j th contaminated eigenvector e k and ρ k respectively represent the k th elemental modulus of elasticity and mass density with error superscript 0 stands for the corresponding true value for simplicity random numbers x φ i j x e k x ρ k are written together as a vector x with zero mean and 1 standard deviation ε and σ are the level of noise and the level of model error since the mode shape is most likely to be contaminated by 3 measurement noise shi et al 2000a a maximum of 3 ε and σ are employed as random variables are contained 2000 monte carlo simulations for each situation are conducted to achieve statistical significance calculation results show that no fundamental change to the cn and det curves are observed when level of noise and model uncertainty increases partial solutions of the condition number curves associated with different level of ε and σ are presented the standard deviation of the min rms curves is also marked note the noise effect along with the model error induces very small changes to results derived by ei and guyan method while curves calculated by min rms see negative escalation when 3 noise and model error are included the presented values of condition number are reasonable compared with those obtained by evp method which is not shown in fig 13 the guyan method sees an amazing rise for det when 3 ε and σ are added but the prohibited deviation indicates the instability of this method see fig 14 the ei method tends to keep stable trend and the curves show high coincidence the curve of min rms with 1 ε and σ generally contains more information than those obtained from guyan method and the increasing noise and model error result in less value of the det the det derived by other methods not shown are not affected obviously by change of ε and σ the biggest essential change is observed on rms when noise effect and model error are considered in fig 15 all approaches suffer from huge augment on rms values especially when s 16 while the lowest level of rms is always retained by the proposed min rms algorithm along the increasing number of desired sensors it is concluded that the modal orthogonality is drastically influenced by contaminated modal parameters and the model error and the min rms could possibly handle the optimal sensor placement that yields the best orthogonality it has been verified in the first example that joining high order modes brings an instable influence figs 7 and 8 there is a similar trend when ε and σ are considered here fig 16 illustrates the change of condition number affected by modes under 1 ε and σ it is found the cn yields poor instability for those values calculated by most energy based methods when n 5 the ei based methods and the proposed min rms algorithm keep cn in a reasonable level the root mean square values also show greater difference in fig 17 and fig 18 where the number of modes of interest n ranges from 2 to 10 only curves with best performance are selected here when n is relative small n 5 the similar results are derived by ei based methods while more perturbations appear when n grows note the highlight that min rms algorithm seems to balance the effect caused by high order modes and always maintains the minimum values the 3 ε and σ obtains the same conclusion which is not shown here in the second example of a jacket platform different level of noise and model error are investigated under increasing desired sensors s and interest modes n the crucial change lies in the rms values see figs 12 and 15 while the other two indicators show smaller variations the high order modes deteriorate the modal independence of the derived mode shapes especially by using energy based methods one also sees perturbation on modal orthogonality when high order modes are taken into account the osp derived by the proposed min rms is capable of remaining the best orthogonality and competitive independence at the same time 6 conclusions in this paper some of the previous osp strategies are reviewed and a novel osp algorithm named min rms is proposed three sorts of assessment standard namely cn rms and det are utilized to give comparative study among all these approaches the effect by number of desired sensors as well as the number of modes of interest is thoroughly compared in simulation of a cantilever beam and a jacket platform in the second example noise contamination and model error are added there are three major conclusions as follow a the ei approach is capable of remaining the largest det when random noise and model error are added the ei approach shows the best performance on determinant of the fisher information matrix figs 5 and 11 which means the greatest amount of information this conclusion also corresponds to the viewpoint of poston and tolson 1992 the other ei based methods including ei mass and ei dpr normally obtain a similar or lower standard on det indicator b there is no rule for the condition number cn as a representative for modal independence cn is an alternative way of showing amount of information among modes of interest the value is normally larger than 1 and strongly affected by selected modes figs 8 and 16 the ke ake wake evp dpr adpr wadpr and guyan methods frequently obtain the ill condition numbers as energy is the central consideration among these approaches the ei based methods and the proposed min rms algorithm seem to avoid this drawback in addition the small number of desired sensors and join of high order modes may degenerate this indicator c the proposed min rms algorithm maintains the best modal orthogonality in most cases as a low rms favoured algorithm the min rms searches for the minimum rms value at every iterative step and provides a promising path to the final optimal sensor placement set the excellent results are derived especially when high level of noise and model error are participated the high order modes bring in the minimum effect to the proposed algorithm fig 18 and it concludes the best orthogonal mode shape it could be advantageous when high order modal parameters are required in modal identification the identified modal data can be utilized for further applications it would be interesting if the sensor locations selected by the min rms algorithm are employed for damage identification purpose note the identified damage can be totally different due to various damage detection methods and the corresponding optimization algorithms for example a sensitivity based method shi et al 2000b is utilized for both osp and damage structural damage identification purpose where the multiple damage location assurance criterion and a frequency sensitivity based linear system are respectively adopted for damage localization and quantification in another paper worden and burrows 2001 one employed neural network searching for default on a cantilever plate and checked optimal sensor locations selected by a

23150,a review is presented on a wide range of optimal sensor placement osp strategies and ways of evaluation an assessment guided optimal sensor placement algorithm based on minimal root mean square is proposed to give quantitative comparison on these options the algorithm is applied to an example of a cantilever beam as well as to a jacket platform where model uncertainty and measurement error are included simultaneously the results reveal the influence of the number of desired sensors and the number of modes of interest it is shown that the optimal sensor placement selected by the proposed strategy yields the best modal orthogonality of the corresponding mode shapes and competitive results are derived on the other two assessment standards i e the condition number of the reduced mode shape matrix and the determinant of the fisher information matrix the conclusions also show that the effective independence method keeps the largest determinant and there seems no regular trend on the condition number but unexpected biased solutions can be derived when unreasonable combination for number of wanted sensors and modes of interest are chosen the proposed minimal root mean square algorithm is capable of avoiding this drawback keywords optimal sensor placement assessment standard modal orthogonality modal independence 1 introduction the optimal sensor placement osp strategy has been an essential problem in engineering fields such as structural performance analysis or spatial variability assessment more often in modal identification process the desired number of sensors as well as their positions should be carefully determined such that the configuration recovers the target frequency of interest and reflects the structural mode shapes in an authentic manner in essence compared with the large amount of dofs in structures only a small number of sensors are available and accessibility limitations always need to be considered which calls for an automatic approach that results in an optimum or near optimum selection being the basic part of structure health monitoring shm the data from modal measurements should be of adequate precision and contents for subsequent applications such as model updating state evaluation and damage detection finally to judge the goodness of a set of sensor distribution several standards of evaluation should also be established in the past literatures some researchers looked from the point of view of the control principles for the sensor placement problem baruh and choe 1990 however others took a dynamic perspective that an optimal selection should recover those modal parameters of interest probably one of the most common method is the effective independence ei kammer 1991 the fisher information matrix fim is employed to form the effective independence vector which gives a fractional contribution of each candidate sensor with respect to the target modes those sensor locations with the largest continuous effective independence will be retained the effect of noise kammer 1992a and model error kammer 1992b in the ei method were also investigated based on this a modified mass weighted ei method garvey et al 1996 was advocated where the iterative deletion process of the candidate sensors is achieved along with the guyan reduction guyan 1965 which normally requires more computation since the guyan reduction neglects the inertia force of slave dofs the ratio k i i m i i for the i th coordinate was presented where k i i and m i i are the i th diagonal element of the stiffness and the mass matrix respectively penny et al 1994 the coordinates with the smaller ratios correspond to those sensors with the larger inertia effect and are considered as the master dofs on the hypothesis that the dof with the largest kinetic energy will ultimately produce the strongest dynamic response and observability larson et al 1994 suggested an osp algorithm that iteratively deletes the sensor with the smallest kinetic energy per mode from the candidate sequence and continuously retains those sensors with the largest values li et al 2007 showed the inherent connection between the effective independence and the modal kinetic energy method the average kinetic energy method and the weighted average kinetic energy method chung and moore 1993 follow the idea of the original manner and exclude the sensors on modal node zero motion point other energy approaches e g the driving point residue dpr the eigenvalue vector product evp and the effective independence driving point residue ei dpr were well described in the historical references papadopoulos and garcia 1998a meo and zumpano 2005 brown et al 1999 conducted studies on the multi objective osp considering kinetic energy liu et al 2005 used a modal assurance criterion method combined with ei to determine the sensor placement of a concrete cable stayed bridge besides these some other approaches based on genetic algorithms han et al 2014 neural networks worden and burrows 2001 have also been introduced to the osp strategy to evaluate how good a given set of sensor placement is several assessment standards are of great necessity though there seems to be no uniform benchmark five indicators in three distinct viewpoints were attempted penny et al 1994 i e the modal orthogonality the modal independence and the modal energy despite no optimal one was achieved for the reason that all of them hold both merits and drawbacks and even conclusions of little diversity were derived occasionally they still offered a quantitative judgment and thus comparisons could be made these indexes will be discussed later in this paper in terms of application zou et al 2017 utilized fim matrix to measure the performance of sensor configuration on a seafloor geodetic node multiple wireless sensor nodes were used to measure ship hydroelastic response bennett et al 2014 many jacket platforms adopt reduced model systems for model updating or damage identification purposes which also calls the need of osp strategy wang et al 2015 li et al 2008 giving the brief literature review and making the comparative study with several existing methods this paper also proposes an assessment guided osp technique named minimal root mean square min rms algorithm this osp strategy looks for a set of sensor distribution that minimizes the root mean square over the mass weighted modal assurance criterion mmac two numerical examples including a cantilever beam and a jacket platform are thoroughly studied with variation on the number of desired sensors as well as the number of modes of interest in the second example measurement noise and model uncertainty are added simultaneously the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is proved along with several important conclusions being summarized 2 methodologies a final osp set could be chosen either by an increasing order or a decreasing one the former means to add gradually into the final osp set with the sensor locations with better performance while the decreasing order adopted by most techniques requires an initial candidate set where unsatisfactory sensor locations would be deleted at each iterative step for large structure or model with massive number of dofs the selection of the initial candidate set is important but often dismissed a possible initial candidate set should contain as little as 40 50 of the total kinetic energy for each target mode kammer 1991 normally the rotational motions are difficult to measure and several locations suffer from limited accessibility these dofs would be primarily excluded from the initial candidate set in this paper φ is defined as the complete set of mode shapes φ r is the reduced form with size of m n where m denotes number of dofs in the initial candidate set and n is number of modes of interest the problem can be described by how to select the final osp set with s s m dofs which gives the best performance in certain assessment standards for simplicity and clarity a number of osp methods are reviewed and summarized in section 2 and the assessment standards will be discussed in the following section 3 note that the osp strategy is processed with adding or reducing dofs until a final osp set is selected which is generally accompanied by changing the system size in a reducing manner perhaps the simplest way is to directly delete rows and columns in the system matrix that correspond to the dofs to be eliminated while some other approaches require the guyan reduction which may derive a model with more precise dynamic response for comparison and unification all osp strategies in this paper adopt the guyan reduction when the system matrix needs to be reduced this will only affect the mass related osp strategies and the corresponding assessment standards 2 1 effective independence ei to select a set of sensor placement such that the derived mode shapes of interest are as linearly independent as possible while keeping more information about selected modal responses the diagonal elements of an effective independence matrix was employed kammer 1991 expressed by 1 e φ r a 1 φ r t where a is the fisher information matrix fim formulated as 2 a φ r t φ r where φ r denotes the target mode matrix of the initial candidate set since e is validated to be idempotent namely the trace and the rank of matrix e are numerically equal each element in vector e d the diagonal terms of e represents the fractional contribution of the corresponding dof to the linear independence of the mode shape matrix at each iterative step the dof with the smallest diagonal term is eliminated from the initial candidate set and the corresponding row and column in system matrix would be compacted the osp strategy ends when expected number of sensors are achieved poston and tolson 1992 proved that this method tends to maximize the determinant of a each element in vector e d varies from 0 to 1 the larger the value the greater the effective independence note that the inverse operation is required here to obtain a non singular matrix a the number of desired sensors should be no less than the number of target modes meo and zumpano 2005 2 2 mass weighted effective independence ei mass on the basis of the ei method a mass weighted strategy along with the guyan reduction was introduced garvey et al 1996 the mass weighted effective independence matrix becomes 3 e m a s s m g 0 5 φ r a m a s s 1 φ r t m g 0 5 where the fisher information matrix a m a s s is expressed as 4 a m a s s φ r t m g φ r and m g represents the reduced mass matrix by guyan reduction compared with eliminating the corresponding rows and columns of system matrix in a direct way guyan reduction neglects inertia force of the slave dofs and seeks for better dynamic responses this operation will only affect the mass weighted osp strategies and several mass related assessment indexes e g kinetic energy and more computation complexity is also implemented analogous to the ei method this osp strategy iteratively removes those dofs with small effective independence until designated number of sensors are obtained 2 3 effective independence driving point residue ei dpr considering that the sensor locations with lower energy may be included in a final osp set meo and zumpano 2005 proposed the effective independence driving point residue dpr approach which employs the energy operator dpr defined by 5 d p r j i 1 n φ i j 2 ω i where d p r j corresponds to the j th component of the vector d p r n is the total number of mode shapes of interest ω i and φ i j respectively denote the i th natural frequency and the j th element within the i th mode shape thus the energy weighted effective independence vector converts into 6 e d d p r e d d p r where represents the term by term multiplication each element in e d d p r is deemed as contribution of the dof to the corresponding effective independence and energy indicator again the dof with the smallest contribution will be eliminated and a final osp set is iteratively acquired 2 4 kinetic energy ke the ei related methods seek to maximize the determinant of the fisher information matrix a to retain as much information as possible but some other methods look into an energy based perspective assuming that the sensors with the largest kinetic energy might show better dynamic response and observability kammer 1991 thus these corresponding dofs should be reserved the kinetic energy matrix is formulated by 7 k e φ r m φ r where m is the mass matrix corresponding to the initial candidate set comparison is made among the maximum element of each row in k e and iterative elimination is implemented to the dof with the lowest value of those maximums the process repeats until desired s dofs are remained 2 5 average kinetic energy ake for consideration of the dofs within modal nodes the average kinetic energy ake method is proposed to balance the negative effect of those zero motion points the total kinetic energy for each dof is divided by number of modes of interest expressed by 8 a k e i 1 n j 1 n k e i where a k e i represents the contribution of the i th dof n is the number of modes of interest similar to the ke method an automatic selection process is executed to keep dofs with the best performance 2 6 weighted average kinetic energy wake the wake method adopts a new weight vector the average kinetic energy matrix is multiplied by the minimum value of kinetic energy within each dof this weight vector would completely exclude those dofs with modal nodes thus a final osp set with larger modal energy is expected the expression is 9 w a k e k e m i n a k e where k e m i n is the minimum in absolute value across the rows in k e 2 7 eigenvalue vector product evp the evp is another energy based method giving the i th dof of a factorial 10 e v p i j 1 n φ r i j where π denotes factorial operator φ r i j is the element of φ r at the position of i th row and j th column the dof with the smallest value of e v p i is removed at every iteration since the modal node is destined to lead to a zero e v p i the dofs with those modal nodes will always be eliminated 2 8 driving point residue dpr the dpr is a measure of particular sensor location when exciting a particular mode but it is also alternatively utilized as a strategy for sensor placement the dpr can be expressed by either eq 5 or 11 d p r φ r φ r λ r where the matrix d p r has the same size as φ r of m n λ r is the diagonal natural frequency matrix the osp procedure tends to consistently remain dofs corresponding to those rows in d p r with larger values in essence matrix d p r is sometimes clarified as an energy based approach with a frequency weight applied 2 9 average driving point residue adpr similar to the family of the k e methods to exclude the effect of zero motion point the average driving point residue adpr and weighted average driving point residue have been proposed chung and moore 1993 formulated by 12 a d p r j 1 n i 1 n d p r i j where a d p r j is the contribution of the j th dof averaged by the number of modes of interest n d p r i j denotes the j th element within the i th mode shape the weighted average driving point residue can be expressed as 13 w a d p r d p r m i n a d p r where d p r m i n is the minimum in absolute value across the rows in m 1 vector a d p r the optimum set of sensor placement is the one retains the largest a d p r and w a d p r across the entire candidate dofs 2 10 guyan reduction another viewpoint presents the osp method based on model reduction penny et al 1994 it is well known that the guyan reduction gr leaves out the inertia effect of the slave dofs thus the inertia force in these dofs should be chosen to be less important than the elastic force while the master dofs are selected oppositely this characteristic leads to an examination of the ratio k i i m i i for the i th coordinate where a small value means a significant inertia weight associated with this coordinate which should be retained as a master dof while the coordinates with larger values are chosen and removed from the candidate set after each deletion the system matrix is reduced with the guyan reduction and a new cycle is executed repeatedly until s desired dofs remain note that it is recommended to delete only one coordinate at a time for a balanced distribution since guyan reduction is lack of high order precision this method would guarantee a satisfactory result only if the lower modes are considered 3 assessment of goodness when a set of sensor placement is derived by any of the osp strategy mentioned above the evaluation of goodness is of great importance five indexes of assessment were suggested which check the problems via linearly independence orthogonality and energy viewpoints in this paper three of them are applied to give a comparative study among osp strategies herein φ r s is defined as the mode shape matrix driven from the final set of sensor distribution m s is the corresponding mass matrix with s dofs a the root mean square rms of the off diagonal entries of the mass weighted modal assurance criterion mmac matrix in modal test since mode shapes are expected to be orthogonal to the mass matrix as much as possible namely φ r s t m s φ r s i i is the identity matrix thus one could define mmac matrix that consists of 14 m m a c i j φ r s i t m s φ r s j 2 φ r s i t m s φ r s i φ r s j t m s φ r s j the diagonals of the mmac matrix are 1 and zero off diagonals are ideally wanted the rms of the off diagonal entries is formulated by 15 r m s s q r t i 1 n j 1 j i n m m a c i j 2 n 2 n where s q r t is the square root operator and n denotes the number of modes of interest the lower value of the rms indicates a better modal orthogonality so that a better set of sensor distribution is derived b the condition number cn of the final mode shape matrix φ r s a favorable mode shape matrix is expected to contain as much information as possible in other words the linear independence of the matrix should be guaranteed by singular value decomposition svd of φ r s the ratio between the biggest and the smallest singular value is calculated to represent the linear independence the svd is performed as 16 φ r s u t σ v where u v are two unitary matrices σ diag σ 1 σ 2 σ n and the singular values yield σ 1 σ 2 σ n 0 then 17 c n σ 1 σ n normally the condition number is greater to 1 the lower limit shows the complete orthogonality of the final mode shape matrix φ r s and the higher values correspond to those φ r s with lower linear independence c the determinant det of the fisher information matrix a an alternative standard of assessment is by comparing the determinant of the fisher information matrix which indicates the amount of information in the data at the reduced set of coordinates penny et al 1994 this value is expected to be as high as possible to give satisfactory amount of information poston and tolson 1992 suggested that the ei method seeks a set of osp that maximizes the determinant of a in addition it can be verified that the condition number of a is the square of the condition number with respect to the reduced mode shape matrix φ r this index is computed by 18 d e t d e t φ r s t φ r s where d e t means the determinant operator note that the determinant could be negative sometimes here the absolute value is employed 4 min rms since the root mean square rms could be taken as a remarkable feature of orthogonality an assessment guided osp strategy named minimal root mean square min rms is proposed that might be in favor of minimizing rms the strategy searches for a decreasing order in which one dof would be deleted from the initial candidate set at each iteration and keep the remains with minimum rms because an enormous number of combinations exist for the final osp set this approach advocates to eliminate one location at a time thus brings in a more uniform distribution and the error would be scattered note this algorithm may not lead to the perfect solution but it attempts an advantageous direction in lowering the rms thus an orthogonality favoured mode shape matrix is derived the algorithm depicted in fig 1 has five steps a define the initial candidate set s c including all dofs except for rotational ones and constrains set the number of desired sensors s and the number of modes of interest n b delete the first dof d 1 from the initial candidate set and calculate the corresponding compacted mode shape matrix φ r 1 and the mass matrix m r 1 c compute the r m s 1 using φ r 1 and m r 1 and return d 1 into initial candidate set d repeat step b to step c for every single dof in the initial candidate set calculate the corresponding r m s 2 r m s m the dof retains the smallest r m s r will be permanently eliminated e repeat step b to step d until the s desired number of sensors are left in s c the proposed strategy ensures that after every iterative step the eliminated dof d r will retain the smallest r m s r as result of this a mmac matrix of relatively low rms is expected to achieve which represents an ideal orthogonality of mode shapes 5 examples 5 1 cantilever beam the discussed osp strategies are applied to a uniform cantilever beam including 2 nodes and 4 dofs axial dofs are omitted in each plane element 30 elements of this kind with elastic modulus of 32 gpa and density of 2500 kg m3 are assembled the geometric parameters are shown in fig 2 as a benchmark model the number of desired sensors and the number of modes of interest should be carefully selected consider that only some lower frequency modes can be measured precisely the first three modes are set to be of particular interest n 3 according to practical applications the number of desired sensors is inadvisable to be too little since sufficient information should be guaranteed besides superabundant number of sensors would result in similar assessment values where significant difference may not be distinguished hence in this case 15 desired sensors s 15 is decided when the osp strategies are performed the optimum sensor locations calculated by different osp strategies are illustrated in fig 3 it is observed that the evp method restricts most sensors on the fixed end while on the contrary locations selected by wake and wadpr have better preference on the free end of the cantilever beam two groups of sensor locations with general wider span can be roughly divided by using ei family methods dpr and adpr method in addition more dispersedly distributed selections along the axis are presented by ke ake guyan and min rms method there are some intuitive recognitions that the closely distributed sensor placement may be unfavourable since the information in other part would be missing and the selections at the fixed end is better to be less than the ones toward the free end where motions are more acute for comparison a percentage length of the mean position within a set of location is employed from the fixed end and the goodness valued by the three discussed assessment standards are shown in table 1 the osp strategy would be one that maintains the largest det the smallest cn and rms when the desired s sensors are obtained it seems that no osp strategy is able to give a perfect solution in all three assessment standards the wake and the proposed min rms method obtain the lower rms in magnitude thus the orthogonality of mode shapes are ensured the ei method shows the largest value of det while the other ei based methods ei mass ei dpr as well as the min rms are of relative better performance as for the condition number cn ke ranks the smallest value and the difference are little among the results calculated by ei ei dpr and min rms which means the effective information are better by utilizing these methods in this case it is observed that the proposed min rms does not lead to the lowest value of root mean square as mentioned in section 4 one option is eliminated from the candidate set at every iterative step this only results in an alternative searching direction to the final set with the lowest rms which concludes there is still less possibility that a better solution would be found another important issue is the mutation of the cn which is not obvious in this case calculated by evp and wadpr algorithm the larger values of cn represent more redundancy of the derived mode shape matrix actually all energy based approaches as well as the guyan method suffer from this drawback especially when fewer number of sensors are wanted the ei based methods and the min rms algorithm seem to guarantee stable solutions which can be clearly compared in table 2 and fig 4 only with the curves of the best performance since there are many curves that represent results from different osp methods for clarity line graphs are employed in the following figures as seen in fig 4 the ei based methods and the proposed min rms algorithm tend to keep cn at a lower standard meanwhile all energy based methods i e ke ake wake evp dpr adpr wadpr show the greatest possibility on mutation of the cn while guyan method sees less unsatisfactory result occasionally see table 2 the values derived from evp dpr adpr wadpr are sometimes even prohibitively large since the modal independence and orthogonality are not the major consideration these methods will also result in smaller det of the fisher information matrix and the corresponding sensor distribution are normally more concentrated to survey in a more objective way fig 5 and fig 6 illustrate the det and rms obtained by different osp strategies against increasing number of desired sensors for clarity only the curves with relative good performance are presented the first three modes are set to be of particular interest note that one location will be eliminated from the candidate set at every iterative step thus the practical iteration process is in reversed order about the x axis from the fig 5 it is observed that the ei based methods and the proposed min rms rank the first class on det indicator the ei method reveals the highest value and comparable trend is followed by the min rms algorithm comparing with the energy based methods the ei mass and the ei dpr approaches are proved to demonstrate better performance in most cases the difference increases when sufficient number of desired sensors are required the rms variations are explained in fig 6 the general trend indicates that at each iterative step the removal of a certain dof from the candidate set would lead to an expanded level of rms value from s 21 to s 1 the fluctuant curves reveal unstable solutions when s is less than 8 the ei mass as well as the ke method tends to keep the lower rms when sufficient number of sensors are utilized s 8 the highlight is as expected that the proposed min rms algorithm nearly selects the lowest rms along the iteration which ensures that the corresponding mode shape is of the best orthogonality as mentioned in section 2 for comparison and unification guyan reduction is employed for all osp strategies when the system size needs to be compacted this would bring in non monotonicity for rms indicator as modal parameters are changing throughout the iteration condition number and rms affected by number of modes of interest are presented respectively in fig 7 and fig 8 the first 2 to 10 modes are set to be variable again curves only with the relative good performance are included when taking high order modal parameters into account negative escalations of the condition number are seen among all osp strategies notice that the degree of influence may vary the ake guyan and the other energy based methods not shown suffer most from the high modes while ei based methods retain lower values and the min rms also keeps outstanding cn at a relatively low level in fig 8 the rms of the mass weighted modal assurance criterion mmac matrix sees more irregular variation as high order modes are included during the optimization the number of modes of interest must not be set to 1 since the off diagonal entries are calculated as a whole the ei mass method is capable of providing satisfactory solution when few modes are adopted meanwhile the amazing result derived by min rms algorithm presents extreme low values against variable the other methods show more instability which indicates the modal orthogonality of derived mode shape is not always guaranteed it can be concluded from the first example that the proposed min rms algorithm tends to search for the lowest rms value throughout the optimization and also retains a comparable level of condition number and det indicator satisfactory results can always be guaranteed when different number of sensors are selected the join of the high order modes show negative influence on all indicators especially the rms values but excellent solution can still be derived by proposed min rms algorithm 5 2 jacket platform the second application is a typical jacket platform model chosen from an early work to identify the damage location from limited amount of modal information kim and stubbs 1995 consisting of 36 pipe elements and 16 nodes in four levels see fig 9 the platform is set to have uniform modulus of elasticity e 210gpa poisson s ratio ν 0 3 and mass density ρ 7850 k g m 3 the outer and inner diameter of the pipe element are 17 8 cm and 16 02 cm respectively the side length from the bottom to the top level are 10 97 m 8 53 m 6 10 m and 3 66 m the height between each level is identical 9 14 m and four grounding nodes are constrained for all dofs before performing osp strategies the candidate sensor placement set is defined by including all translational dofs except for those connected to the ground similar to the first example the guyan reduction technique is implemented for a compacted model where a total of 36 candidate sensor locations are initiated considering the practical application the first four modes and the number of desired sensors ranges from 12 to 24 are set to be of particular interest fig 9 shows the osp strategy calculated by the min rms algorithm when s 12 s 18 and s 24 in general when s 12 the sensors are arranged uniformly within every level as well as along x and y axis no selection along z axis is concluded as number of desired sensors s increases an escalating distribution is located on the top level along z direction when s 18 the last 6 added sensors are allocated evenly again among three levels three assessment indexes derived by different osp strategies are illustrated from fig 10 to fig 12 in this example the majority of the ei based and energy based methods obtain the same or similar result except for those concluded by the evp method which is verified to be the worst fig 10 gives the condition number against increasing s where ei based and energy based methods show advisable curves and descending trend can be obtained the evp method keeps the cn at very high value and relative excellent curve is concluded by guyan method the highlight is that the proposed min rms algorithm seeks the lowest rms but the cn concluded here is also retained at the lowest nearly all the time the det curves fig 11 show that the ei method still remains the best amount of information although in this special case most ei based and energy based methods show nearly the same transformation on curves the min rms algorithm is not capable of providing as much information as other methods except for guyan and evp which run the det value at the lowest level the superiority of the proposed algorithm is revealed in fig 12 where the min rms maintains the smallest value of rms no matter number of desired sensors changes the guyan method expresses moderate result comparing with those curves calculated by ei based and energy based methods which present prohibitively high value of the rms especially when few sensors are required s 18 the evp curve is not included due to extreme disproportion the difference among all approaches is narrowed when more sensors are added note the min rms algorithm shows the lowest rms values in every iterative step thus the best orthogonality is always assured the above conclusions are obtained on the assumption that the model is of sufficient accuracy and the noise contamination is neglected in reality the inevitable model uncertainty and the measurement error would bring in unknown and even negative influence on final solution which should be carefully considered generally there are three sorts of modelling errors i e discretization error configuration error and mechanical parameter error in this paper only random error associated with the material properties are considered which is verified to have normal distribution low and hao 2001 the contaminated noise in modal identification is also assumed to have a normal distribution in many studies papadopoulos and garcia 1998b considering the material parameter for stiffness and mass matrix of the system the modulus of elasticity e and mass density ρ for each element are selected to be the variables the uncertainties of the fe model and the noise contamination are assumed to be mutually independent expressed as 19 φ i j φ i j 0 φ i j 0 x λ i j φ i j 0 1 ε x φ i j 20 e k e k 0 e k 0 x e k e k 0 1 σ x e k 21 ρ k ρ k 0 ρ k 0 x ρ k ρ k 0 1 σ x ρ k where φ i j is the i th term of the j th contaminated eigenvector e k and ρ k respectively represent the k th elemental modulus of elasticity and mass density with error superscript 0 stands for the corresponding true value for simplicity random numbers x φ i j x e k x ρ k are written together as a vector x with zero mean and 1 standard deviation ε and σ are the level of noise and the level of model error since the mode shape is most likely to be contaminated by 3 measurement noise shi et al 2000a a maximum of 3 ε and σ are employed as random variables are contained 2000 monte carlo simulations for each situation are conducted to achieve statistical significance calculation results show that no fundamental change to the cn and det curves are observed when level of noise and model uncertainty increases partial solutions of the condition number curves associated with different level of ε and σ are presented the standard deviation of the min rms curves is also marked note the noise effect along with the model error induces very small changes to results derived by ei and guyan method while curves calculated by min rms see negative escalation when 3 noise and model error are included the presented values of condition number are reasonable compared with those obtained by evp method which is not shown in fig 13 the guyan method sees an amazing rise for det when 3 ε and σ are added but the prohibited deviation indicates the instability of this method see fig 14 the ei method tends to keep stable trend and the curves show high coincidence the curve of min rms with 1 ε and σ generally contains more information than those obtained from guyan method and the increasing noise and model error result in less value of the det the det derived by other methods not shown are not affected obviously by change of ε and σ the biggest essential change is observed on rms when noise effect and model error are considered in fig 15 all approaches suffer from huge augment on rms values especially when s 16 while the lowest level of rms is always retained by the proposed min rms algorithm along the increasing number of desired sensors it is concluded that the modal orthogonality is drastically influenced by contaminated modal parameters and the model error and the min rms could possibly handle the optimal sensor placement that yields the best orthogonality it has been verified in the first example that joining high order modes brings an instable influence figs 7 and 8 there is a similar trend when ε and σ are considered here fig 16 illustrates the change of condition number affected by modes under 1 ε and σ it is found the cn yields poor instability for those values calculated by most energy based methods when n 5 the ei based methods and the proposed min rms algorithm keep cn in a reasonable level the root mean square values also show greater difference in fig 17 and fig 18 where the number of modes of interest n ranges from 2 to 10 only curves with best performance are selected here when n is relative small n 5 the similar results are derived by ei based methods while more perturbations appear when n grows note the highlight that min rms algorithm seems to balance the effect caused by high order modes and always maintains the minimum values the 3 ε and σ obtains the same conclusion which is not shown here in the second example of a jacket platform different level of noise and model error are investigated under increasing desired sensors s and interest modes n the crucial change lies in the rms values see figs 12 and 15 while the other two indicators show smaller variations the high order modes deteriorate the modal independence of the derived mode shapes especially by using energy based methods one also sees perturbation on modal orthogonality when high order modes are taken into account the osp derived by the proposed min rms is capable of remaining the best orthogonality and competitive independence at the same time 6 conclusions in this paper some of the previous osp strategies are reviewed and a novel osp algorithm named min rms is proposed three sorts of assessment standard namely cn rms and det are utilized to give comparative study among all these approaches the effect by number of desired sensors as well as the number of modes of interest is thoroughly compared in simulation of a cantilever beam and a jacket platform in the second example noise contamination and model error are added there are three major conclusions as follow a the ei approach is capable of remaining the largest det when random noise and model error are added the ei approach shows the best performance on determinant of the fisher information matrix figs 5 and 11 which means the greatest amount of information this conclusion also corresponds to the viewpoint of poston and tolson 1992 the other ei based methods including ei mass and ei dpr normally obtain a similar or lower standard on det indicator b there is no rule for the condition number cn as a representative for modal independence cn is an alternative way of showing amount of information among modes of interest the value is normally larger than 1 and strongly affected by selected modes figs 8 and 16 the ke ake wake evp dpr adpr wadpr and guyan methods frequently obtain the ill condition numbers as energy is the central consideration among these approaches the ei based methods and the proposed min rms algorithm seem to avoid this drawback in addition the small number of desired sensors and join of high order modes may degenerate this indicator c the proposed min rms algorithm maintains the best modal orthogonality in most cases as a low rms favoured algorithm the min rms searches for the minimum rms value at every iterative step and provides a promising path to the final optimal sensor placement set the excellent results are derived especially when high level of noise and model error are participated the high order modes bring in the minimum effect to the proposed algorithm fig 18 and it concludes the best orthogonal mode shape it could be advantageous when high order modal parameters are required in modal identification the identified modal data can be utilized for further applications it would be interesting if the sensor locations selected by the min rms algorithm are employed for damage identification purpose note the identified damage can be totally different due to various damage detection methods and the corresponding optimization algorithms for example a sensitivity based method shi et al 2000b is utilized for both osp and damage structural damage identification purpose where the multiple damage location assurance criterion and a frequency sensitivity based linear system are respectively adopted for damage localization and quantification in another paper worden and burrows 2001 one employed neural network searching for default on a cantilever plate and checked optimal sensor locations selected by a number of osp methods a nonlinear mapping relation is expected to be built between optimal sensor locations and the identified damage it is an attractive topic which can be discussed in further

23151,a spatio temporal transformed gaussian field has been proposed to model wind variability in the northern north atlantic but it does not accurately describe the extreme wind speeds attributed to tropical storms and hurricanes in rychlik and mao 2018 this model was generalized by adding certain number of random components to model rare events with extreme wind speeds or severe storms and was named the hybrid model in this study these models are further developed and validated to properly describe the variation of wind speeds in the arctic area in most locations the transformed gaussian field is a sufficiently accurate model however in some regions e g the laptev and beaufort seas this model severely underestimates the frequencies of extreme wind speeds therefore the hybrid model is further improved to add poisson distributed random storm events to describe the wind variation in these regions and is named as the poisson hybrid model there are also locations e g along the east coast of greenland where the frequencies of high wind speeds are severely overestimated by the transformed gaussian model it is shown that this model can be used to estimate the long term distribution of wind speeds predict extreme wind speeds and simulate the spatio temporal wind fields for practical applications keywords wind speed spatio temporal wind statistics the arctic exponential transformation hermite transformation gaussian field poisson hybrid model extreme wind 1 introduction strong winds over the oceans can create dangerous metocean conditions for ships and offshore engineering activities such as oil and gas drilling rigs or renewable energy installations as sea ice declines human activities in the arctic ocean are increasing the arctic shipping is attracting increasing number of sailing ships and arctic offshore development is also increasing all these activities bring very urgent demands for the development of reliable models for wind and wave loads statistical properties of wind speed vary in terms of geographic location and season the median and other statistics e g standard deviation and return values are important parameters describing the wind climate these statistics of wind speed in the arctic have recently been presented in e g hughes and cassano 2015 and kislov and matveeva 2016 for practical engineering applications such as estimating the average wind energy that could be harvested at a fixed location the long term yearly wind speed distribution is needed in this case a weibull distribution often gives a good description of observed wind speeds takle and brown 1978 other models have been also proposed e g recently by drobinski 2015 to describe the wind speed variability if the weibull model is not sufficient accurate it is shown that the weibull distribution often underestimates the frequency of very high wind speeds in the arctic another useful wind characteristic is the expected frequency of episodes of wind speed exceeding a given value see appendix a for details the frequency is often called the crossing frequency a ratio of these two characteristics gives an estimate of the expected duration of a storm both the long term distribution and the crossing frequency are one dimensional characteristics that change slowly across locations and seasons however there are practical engineering problems that require multivariate characteristics e g the joint distribution of wind speeds at distinct locations and times for example these distributions are needed to evaluate the wind statistics encountered by a sailing vessel mao and rychlik 2016 and for predicting ship speeds mao et al 2016 in such cases spatio temporal models often based on well understood transformed gaussian models can be used to describe these wind statistics such models can be used to evaluate frequencies and distributions of various wind storms characteristics brodtkorb et al 2000 podgórski and rychlik 2016 the popular transformations proposed by brown et al 1984 winterstein 1988 etc are frequently used in engineering literature for example the exponential transformation proposed by brown et al 1984 was successfully used in mao and rychlik 2016 to model wind speed distributions in the north atlantic at offshore locations of the arctic the modified winterstein s transformation gives more accurate predictions of extreme winds while the brown s exponential transformation works better in inland locations in approximately 8 of the arctic area the transformed gaussian models underestimate the extreme wind speeds in this study the poisson hybrid model is proposed to model the wind variation in the arctic in this model the daily wind speed variation is modelled by the transformed gaussian field and a poisson number of random components is then added to model the rare events of extreme wind speeds the poisson hybrid model is compared with the previously proposed hybrid model in appendix c various transformed gaussian models are briefly presented in section 2 and section 3 presents some details of the poisson hybrid model based on the proposed poisson hybrid model the rice s method can be used for predicting extreme wind speeds and estimating the long term wind distribution in the arctic regions section 4 briefly reviews how to use the model to estimate the long term wind speed distribution and the crossing frequency and to derive 100 or 1000 year return values the extreme wind speeds the accuracy of the model is validated in section 5 by comparing the wind speed characteristics observed in the data with those evaluated from the fitted model section 6 presents examples of simulating spatio temporal wind fields by the proposed poisson hybrid model conclusions the reference list and four appendixes close the paper 2 various transformed gaussian models for wind speed variability transformed gaussian and hybrid models can be fitted to various data sources e g the wave heights measured from satellites baxevani et al 2005 2008 in this study the wind speed referring to the 10 min average wind speed with a unit of m s is investigated with these models the hindcast wind data over 26 years 1990 2015 with a 0 75 degree and 6 h resolution from the ecmwf era interim reanalysis dataset dee et al 2011 are used the distribution of wind speed in a large geographic region such as the arctic depends on the season and geographic location p t p x p y p however at shorter scales of hours and kilometers the wind speed can be considered stationary for a period of approximately one month and in a region of several degrees in diameter then the wind speed variation can be described by a transformed gaussian model using monotonic transformation x g w if the field 1 x p t x y g w t p t x p x y p y has standard gaussian distribution the local transformed gaussian model is fully defined if the transformation g and the correlation structure of the gaussian field x p t x y i e ρ t x y e g w t p x p y p g w t p t x p x y p y are specified 2 1 exponentially transformed gaussian model in rychlik and mao 2018 the brown s exponentially transformed gaussian model was proposed to model the wind speed w in the neighbourhood of a location p viz 2 w t p t x p x y p y a p m p σ p x p t x y normally the exponent a is of the range 0 a p 2 when a is very small the extreme wind prediction based on this transformation becomes very sensitive i e even small estimation errors in a may cause big errors in predicted extreme wind speeds empirically by setting 0 4 a p 2 can limit this problem without affecting the accuracy of the transformation model then the brown s exponential transformation can be also written as 3 g w w a p m p σ p the parameters a p m p and σ p 2 are estimated by the method of moments all parameters defining the model depend on the location p and are estimated pointwise for a given location p the transformation exponent a is first estimated to satisfy the criterion that the skewness of w a be zero then m σ 2 are set equal to the mean and variance monthly of the transformed wind speeds w a it should be noted that for the applications in which the model is used to predict extreme wind speeds by the model the parameters are smoothed over a spatial neighbourhood with a radius of approximately 3 the parameter m p can be evaluated from the median wind speed for example fig 1 presents the median wind speeds in january and august in the arctic and fig 2 shows the variability of parameter a p the variability of the standard deviation of the transformed wind speed σ p which varies in both time and space is presented in fig 3 the exponential transformation has been successfully applied in the north atlantic however in many arctic locations the exponential transformation does not work well i e the distribution of g w is not gaussian while the kurtosis of the exponentially transformed wind speeds often exceeds the gaussian threshold three leading to an underestimation of the frequency of high wind speeds therefore in this study the brown s exponential transformation is superposed with the hermite transformation proposed by winterstein 1988 this transformation is a monotonic cubic polynomial that is calibrated such that the first four moments mean variance skewness and kurtosis of the transformed model are equal to the moments of the data 2 2 superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations obviously if the distribution of w i e f w w were known then x g w where g w φ 1 f w w has the standard gaussian distribution φ x however the distribution of w is unknown and must be estimated from data here the method of moments is used i e the winterstein s hermite polynomial transformation g h r w is used to achieve a mean of zero variance of one skewness of zero and kurtosis of three however if the transformation is not monotonic over the range of w of interest it cannot ensure the transformation s stability i e the transformation cannot always be performed the stability is important for the automated estimation of models for large number of locations because the transformation is always monotonic for variables having zero skewness and the brown s exponentially transformed data has zero skewness this study proposes using the superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations viz g w g h r w a to achieve stability this superposition is a more stable transformation than the original winterstein s transformation 2 3 proposed transformation scheme to model the arctic wind in this paper the wind speed variation is modelled as follows first the exponential transformation as in eq 2 is performed the transformed field x has a zero mean variance of one and skewness of zero then x is described by three models depending on the kurtosis of x i e κ x is estimated using the transformed wind speeds i when κ w a 3 x is modelled by the superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations so that x g h r w a has a kurtosis of three and again x is approximated by a standardized gaussian field ii when κ w a 3 x is modelled by the zero mean and variance of one non gaussian field that is described by a newly proposed poisson hybrid model in section 3 iii when κ w a 3 x is modelled or approximated by a standardized gaussian field i e the wind speed variation is approximated by an exponentially transformed gaussian model the choice between models i and ii depends on the frequencies of extreme winds at specific locations model ii is used at locations where model i underestimates the frequencies of extreme wind speeds 3 local spatio temporal models for wind speed here locally stationary second order stochastic models are assumed it means that locally 4 g w t p t x p x y p y a p m p σ p x q q t x y where p t p x p y p and x is a zero mean unit variance homogeneous random field that has a correlation function denoted by ρ p in this study three models for x are briefly presented i e the gaussian x g as in lindgren 2013 the laplace moving average x l m a as presented in åberg and podgórski 2011 and the poisson hybrid x p h the hybrid process was introduced in kvarnström et al 2013 and the properties of laplace distributions were discussed in kotz et al 2001 3 1 gaussian field x g the standardized homogeneous gaussian field is defined by the correlation function ρ p similar to our previous studies rychlik and mao 2014 mao and rychlik 2016 the following gaussian correlation function is used in this paper for a location p the correlation of wind speeds around the surrounding homogeneous region q is written as 5 ρ q ρ t x y exp π 2 q λ q t 2 λ λ i j which is a positive definite matrix eq 5 defines the spatio temporal correlation of transformed wind speeds in the neighbourhood of location p 3 1 1 the kernel f constructed from ρ t x y for a wind speed field of the correlation function ρ a kernel f can be constructed to describe the characteristics of the wind speed time series and the shape of regions with extreme wind speeds it is defined such that f f q ρ q where defines a convolution operation for a correlation function ρ in eq 5 the kernel f is defined by 6 f q 2 π 3 4 detλ 1 4 exp π 2 q λ q t q t x y the gaussian field x g of the correlation in eq 5 can be generated by smoothing the gaussian white noise with kernel f more precisely an approximation of x g t x y is obtained by using a grid t k x i y j with discretization steps d x d y d t respectively subsequently 7 x g t x y i j k f t t k x x i y y j z i j k d x d y d t where z i j k are independent gaussian variables with a zero mean and variance of one the approximation error converges to zero as the discretization steps approach zero this model has been used to describe wind speeds in north atlantic rychlik and mao 2014 mao and rychlik 2016 however it performs poorly at locations where extraordinary weather events causing extreme winds e g cyclones and hurricanes occur rarely for such locations e g the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico a model called the hybrid model has been proposed in rychlik and mao 2018 this model is further developed in this study by letting the number of weather anomalies be a random poisson distributed variable this new model is described in the following subsections the gaussian model is a special case of poisson hybrid model that is obtained when the intensity of weather anomalies λ tends to zero in other extreme cases when the intensity of weather anomalies tends to infinity the poisson hybrid model approaches the laplace model described in the following subsection 3 2 laplace model the laplace distribution and process has kurtosis exceeding three as shown in eq 10 similarly the kurtosis of the hybrid model also exceeds three as proven in the appendix in kvarnström et al 2013 for proof hence it is also the case that the processes described by a poisson hybrid model also have kurtosis exceeding three see also eq 13 consequently the laplace model is defined for the brown s exponential transformed model as in eq 2 because it can be only defined when the kurtosis of the transformed wind speed exceeds three the wind speeds after the superposition of brown s and winterstein s transformations will have a kurtosis close to three in the laplace model the same kernel f defined in eq 6 will be used with a large region s 0 0 0 to define x l m a the size of s denoted by s depends on f through the matrix λ see section 4 2 in rychlik and mao 2018 for a discussion of the choice of s here a symmetrical laplace field x l m a is used the field is defined by kernel f region s and a scale parameter ϑ 0 the field at q t x y is approximated by the following sum of random functions modelling weather events with extreme values equal to y i r i and located at u i s 8 x l m a q i 1 x i q x i q y i r i f q u i here y i are independent laplace distributed variables with the probability density function f y y 0 25 exp y 2 this motivates the name laplace model the variables y i z i ζ i where z i has a standard normal distribution and ζ i is a standard exponentially distributed variable the three dimensional u i are uniformly distributed in s the factors r i are defined by 9 r i ϑ s v 1 v i ϑ where v 1 v i are independent random variables that are uniformly distributed over the interval 0 1 and are independent of y i u i it can be shown that as the region s grows the sum in eq 8 converges to a homogeneous field with mean zero unit variance and the correlation as in eq 5 the field is called laplace moving average x l m a q finally the skewness of x l m a q is zero and its kurtosis can be described as the details are provided in appendix b 10 κ x

functions x i are defined by eq 8 the number n is random and poisson distributed with the expected value 12 n e n λ s the non negative constant λ is called the intensity of weather anomalies or unusual weather episodes it is assumed that n is independent of all other variables used to define the model in eq 11 in a previous work rychlik and mao 2018 has used a constant n n and the model was named the hybrid model in this study the poisson hybrid model is used to describe the wind speed variability in the arctic only at locations where the transformed gaussian model severely underestimates the frequency of high wind speeds in the model of eq 11 p is chosen such that v x p h q 1 the region s is chosen as described in section 4 2 of rychlik and mao 2018 it is to be large enough that s f q 2 d q 1 next suppose that λ or n is estimated from the expected value of n then the scale parameter ϑ can be estimated by the method of moments where kurtosis κ x p h is equal to the observed kurtosis of the transformed wind speed data the formula for computing p and ϑ is given as follows a sketch of the proof is given in appendix b 13 κ x p h 3 3 1 2 ϑ e 2 n ϑ 1 2 ϑ 6 ϑ e n ϑ 1 ϑ

e n λ s is chosen to minimize a suitably chosen distance between the computed and observed crossing frequencies in the transformed wind speed data of course the intensity of anomalies λ is estimated by n s 4 extreme wind speed and long term wind distributions the risk of experiencing a strong wind can be measured in several ways for example at a fixed location the fraction of time that the wind speed is above a threshold u e g 30 m s during a year is of interest this fraction can be evaluated from the so called long term wind distribution i e by computing p w u another important piece of information is the number of wind episodes storms of the wind speed being continually above the threshold u during a year this quantity is equal to the number of times that wind speed upcrosses the level u denoted by n u the yearly upcrossing rate is the expectation e n u given by rice s formula rice 1944 1945 yet another characteristic is the maximum wind speed occurring during a year here it is denoted by m the probability p m u is a measure of severity of wind climate and the so called 100 1000 year extreme return wind speed denoted by w 100 w 1000 respectively are severity indices the 100 year extreme wind is defined as a quantile of the distribution of m viz as a solution of 14 ℙ m w 100 1 100 an alternative definition of the 100 year wind speed is that it is the level that wind speed exceeds on average once per 100 years under the assumption that the local wind climate is stationary w 100 is the solution to 15 e n w 100 1 100 as shown in section 4 2 the two equations i e eqs 14 and eq 15 give practically the same values of 100 year extreme wind speed 4 1 long term distribution of wind speed at fixed locations since the variability of w depends on season to avoid ambiguity when discussing the distribution of w the time span and the region where the wind observations are used for model construction need to be clearly specified by shrinking the time span to a single moment t p and the geographic region to a location p the local distribution of w p g 1 m p σ p x p 0 0 0 1 a p can be estimated the long term distribution is the average of the distribution w p for example the yearly distribution of w at x p y p is given by 16 ℙ w w 0 1 ℙ w t p x p y p w d t p if w is described by the transformed gaussian model then 17 ℙ w p w φ g w a p m p σ p p t p x p y p where φ x is the cumulative distribution of a standard gaussian variable 4 2 yearly maximum distribution rice s method a classical approach to obtaining the distribution of yearly maximums m is to fit three parameters of the generalized extreme distribution gev to the observed yearly maximums as discussed in appendix d in the present study only 26 yearly maximums are available the estimates of the three parameters of gev are uncertain i e the confidence intervals of the 100 1000 year return values predicted by eq 14 are very wide therefore in this work the transformed gaussian model fitted to all available data combined with eq 15 is used to estimate the return values the needed expected upcrossing rates e n u are computed using the rice s formula rice 1944 1945 as shown in appendix a this approach named rice s method leads to smaller estimation errors however rice s method can be biased if the transformed gaussian model does not accurately describe data the rice s method was successfully used in rychlik et al 2011 mao and rychlik 2013 for 100 year prediction of significant wave height in the north atlantic in the following sections both eqs 14 and 15 are used to estimate the 100 year return wind speed first the return values are estimated using eq 15 where e n u is evaluated from the transformed gaussian model using rice s formula then the estimates are validated using the returned values derived from eq 14 where m is obtained from a region of 1 5 degrees of wind data and has a gev distribution fitted to 26 yearly maximums now if there are systematic differences between the two types of estimates in a larger region such differences will indicate that the return values evaluated using the transformed gaussian model are biased in that region remark note that 18 ℙ m u ℙ n u 0 e n u since for high values of u p w 0 u is often negligible hence return values obtained from eq 15 are higher than those obtained from eq 14 the difference can be large if crossings of high levels cluster however for the transformed gaussian model the number of high level crossings is approximately poisson distributed hence the 100 or 1000 year return values evaluated by eqs 14 and 15 are very close leadbetter 1983 4 3 estimates of extreme wind speed in the arctic to validate the above rice s method methods based on the univariate extreme value theory coles 2001 are used for example by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution to yearly maximum wind speeds at a fixed location the extreme wind speed estimated from the fitted gev distribution is used as a reference value for validating rice s method alternatively the peak over threshold pot method davison and smith 1990 could be used however a strong seasonal wind speed variation and correlation make the pot method very complex to use and less suitable to our validation purpose in fig 4 the 100 year extreme wind evaluated by the rice s method is compared to the estimated values obtained from the gev distribution fitted to the 26 yearly maximums the 100 year extreme wind speed computed by the transformed gaussian model with brown s transformation is smoother than that estimated by the gev distribution fitted to the data some of the difference between the statistically extreme predictions can be explained by statistical estimation errors however there are larger regions where the two estimates differ considerably e g along with greenland coast in laptev and beaufort seas and in some locations in siberia i e the transformed gaussian model does not fit the wind speed variability well in those regions the possible reasons for the estimation biases are investigated in the following section 5 validation of models of wind variation at the arctic three wind speed characteristics discussed in section 4 i e the upcrossings yearly frequencies e n u from eq 28 the long term ℙ w u from eq 16 and the probability ℙ m u that the yearly maximum exceeds a threshold u from eq 18 as well as those directly derived from the data are used to validate the proposed models for describing the wind speed variation in the arctic first the transformed gaussian model works well for most locations in the arctic for example fig 5 compares the values of the three wind characteristics that are computed and observed at the location 0 e 75 75 n in the greenland sea and location 171 75 w 72 75 n in the chukchi sea respectively in addition ℙ w u computed by the fitted weibull distribution and ℙ m u derived from the fitted gev in eq 34 are presented the agreement between the theoretical characteristics computed from the transformed gaussian model and empirical characteristics is good the weibull distribution fits well the data at location 0 e 75 75 n while the weibull model does not describe well the high wind speeds at location 171 75 w 72 75 n second there are also locations where the transformed gaussian model is not sufficiently accurate e g the model overestimates the frequencies along the east coast of greenland while underestimating those of wind at the laptev sea examples of two such locations are illustrated in fig 6 for the wind speed at the coast of greenland high winds occur quite frequently and are of similar size for the wind speed at the laptev sea high wind speed episodes are rare and the wind during the episodes is much stronger than that during normal weather these phenomena are presented as time series at the two locations in fig 7 these types of signals are difficult to model accurately with a transformed gaussian model using a superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations the transformed gaussian model seems to work well at moderately high wind speeds but does not correctly predict the frequencies of extreme wind speeds this is because the extremes i e the tail types of wind distributions are defined by the extrapolation of transformation the extremes are outside the range of observed wind speeds and the tails of wind distributions determine when the proposed transformed gaussian model can be used for example at greenland locations the tails of wind distributions are very light but in the laptev sea the tails are heavier the winterstein s transformation results in exponential tails 5 1 regions of the validity of transformed gaussian models consequently the geographic locations will be classified into three types according to the following criterion the transformed gaussian method accurately approximates the frequency of strong winds type i but it underestimates type ii and overestimates type iii the frequency the classification is done by comparing the 1000 year extreme wind speed evaluated using the rice s method through the transformed gaussian model denoted by w 1000 t r g with the gev prediction of eq 36 denoted by w 1000 g e v these groups are presented as different markers for the entire arctic area in fig 8 more precisely for a given location if w 1000 g e v w 1000 t r g 8 m s the transformed gaussian model is suitable for describing the wind variation such locations e g the locations 0 e 75 75 n and 171 75 w 72 75 n in fig 5 are shown as blue dots in fig 8 and are classified as type i if w 1000 g e v w 1000 t r g 8 m s the transformed gaussian model underestimates the frequency of high wind speeds such locations e g the location 127 5 e 76 5 n shown in fig 6 are shown as red asterisks in fig 8 and are classified as type ii finally if w 1000 g e v w 1000 t r g 8 m s the model overestimates the frequency of high wind speeds such locations e g the location 16 5 w 73 5 n close to the coast of greenland are shown as green crosses in fig 8 and are classified as type iii in probability theory and statistics the generalized extreme value gev distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions developed within the extreme value theory to combine the gumbel c 0 fréchet c 0 and weibull families c 0 in eq 34 it is also known as type i ii and iii extreme value distributions in fact in the arctic region where the transformed gaussian model is applicable parameter c does not significantly differ from zero e g the gumbel distribution cannot be rejected type i in fig 8 the locations of type ii are similar because the fitted gev is of fréche type c 0 type ii gev in the laptev sea parameter c is often significantly negative as in the fréchet case finally at locations in a type iii region parameter c 0 e g the gev distribution is of type iii as well as illustrated in the bottom plot of fig 8 the classifications based on the gev and the transformed gaussian model give similar results the threshold 8 m s is chosen arbitrarily based on the practice that the difference of 8 m s for the 1000 year wind is very small from the engineering point of view a variable threshold that depends on location and the confidence interval for the shape parameter c could be used for a further detailed test however our goal is to have approximate classifications to limit the number of locations where the model has to be tested in detail the important criterion is to examine the clustering of locations of the same type because the model type in offshore areas may not change very rapidly it should be noted that the 1000 year extreme wind speed predicted by the fitted gev is uncertain and depends on the particular statistical method used for the distribution fitting e g the maximum likelihood method and probability weighted moments there is a risk of miss classification however if there are bigger regions clusters of type ii and iii their existence indicates that the transformed gaussian model is biased and another spatio temporal model should be used for the following analysis the arctic region where the transformed gaussian model underestimates the frequencies of high wind speeds is called the type ii region while the region of overestimation is called the type iii region for the type ii region the wind speed variation can be accurately described by the hybrid model as shown in fig 8 the laptev sea and the beaufort sea are type ii regions as discussed in section 5 2 on the other hand both type i and smaller type ii regions are included in the norwegian sea and the greenland sea except certain areas with some type iii locations close to the coast 5 2 the laptev sea and the beaufort sea the time series of wind speeds at a location at the laptev sea are presented in the bottom plot of fig 7 where the episodes storms of high speeds are rare furthermore the wind speed during such episodes is much higher than that during the normal weather the variation of such time series of wind speeds in particular at high wind speeds in the time series is not accurately described by the two transformed gaussian models brown s and modified winterstein s transformations or the weibull model in rychlik and mao 2018 a hybrid model is proposed to modify the transformed gaussian model by adding random components to the transformed gaussian field to represent events with extreme wind speeds the resulting random field is locally stationary and homogeneous in this study the model is further improved by considering the number of added components as a poisson process named the poisson hybrid model in this article it is used to describe the randomness of storm weather events i e the number of storm events at different locations among a large stationary spatial region is modelled by a poisson process fig 9 compares the wind characteristics obtained with the poisson hybrid model with those derived from the observed wind data two rather close locations in the laptev sea 127 5 e 76 5 n and 122 25 e 78 75 n are chosen the wind characteristics computed from the poisson hybrid model agree well with those derived from the observed data furthermore at both locations the weibull distribution underestimates the frequency of high wind speeds for these locations the fitted gev distribution is of type ii however parameter c is in both cases not significantly different from zero as wind speeds at the two locations are strongly correlated the simpler transformed gaussian model might be adequate for modelling the winds speeds at these locations similar results are presented in fig 10 where the accuracy of the poisson hybrid model and transformed gaussian model is demonstrated at a location in the beaufort sea 6 simulation of spatial and temporal wind speeds the simulation of wind speeds in both spatial and temporal domains is of special interest to practical engineering applications for example this proposed poisson hybrid model could be used to simulate wind conditions along arbitrary ship routes the simulated wind information is essential for estimating the payback times of wind assisted propulsion devices nelissen et al 2016 to be installed onboard ships and for assessing the safety of ships after installation based on such simulated wind information a ship could also choose to sail more economically to encounter more beneficial wind conditions along its routes furthermore wind field simulations provide important information regarding the choice and design of wind farms in specific regions the proposed poisson hybrid model can also be used to simulate artificial wind speeds in time and space viz w t p t x p x y p y m p σ p p x g q i 1 n x i q 1 a p an important feature of establishing the poisson hybrid model is to specify a region s p in which the extraordinary weather episodes are placed the region s p depends on the shape of the kernel f defined in eq 6 it should contain the location 0 0 0 and should be at least large enough that s p f q 2 d q 1 it means that extraordinary wind conditions with a center outside s p would not contribute to wind speed at p i e x i p 0 for p u i s p for completeness the following subsection briefly reviews the choice of s p in rychlik and mao 2018 using the average geometry size of a spatio temporal windy weather region 6 1 the region s at location p let windy weather be defined as x g t x y m p furthermore let τ be the average duration of uninterrupted windy weather at location p t p x p y p where t p is discretized by month for the estimation similarly let the average spatial extents of windy weather in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions be denoted by l x and l y

approximations to the observed average sizes of windy weather regions as most of the time the hybrid model is generated using a gaussian field x g for an accurate estimation of the long term distributions or crossing rates at a fixed location p the following region is used 20 s p 1 75 τ 1 75 τ 1 75 l x 1 75 l x 1 75 l y 1 75 l y where the parameters τ l x and l y are scale parameters of kernel f q in eqs 6 and 19 while the constant 1 75 is chosen such that the integral s f q 2 d q 1 the typical value of s p 3 5 3 τ l x l y is approximately 8 10 4 hour deg 2 if wind speeds are considered at a collection of positions q i in the neighbourhood of p it could happen that extraordinary wind conditions centered outside s p could contribute to winds at some of q i consequently the region s has to be enlarged to 21 s i s q i 6 2 model parameters for a laptev sea location 130 5 e 75 n in december fig 11 presents the dynamics of the strongest wind storm in 1990 2015 at the laptev sea in the following the wind speeds in both spatial and temporal domains around location 130 5e 75 n in december are simulated by the poisson hybrid model and further compared to hindcast wind speed data first for the established poisson hybrid model its fitted parameters for december are a 0 46 m 2 2 σ 0 5 p 0 987 and n e n 4 based on the given n the parameters p and ϑ are computed by eq 13 because the kurtosis of the transformed wind speed at 3 24 is close to 3 the parameter ϑ 0 0065 is small the parameters defining the spatio temporal dependence defined in eq 19 are τ 1 69 days and l x 23 3 l y 7 8 degrees furthermore the matrix λ is almost diagonal i e the gradient components are almost uncorrelated and there are no systematic movements of windy weather regions if the spatio temporally homogeneous properties of w in a neighbourhood field of p are needed s p must be enlarged to contain the neighbourhood for example if a time series during december i e 720 h should be simulated then using eqs 20 and 21 the region can be enlarged to 22 s i s q i 360 1 75 τ 360 1 75 τ 1 75 l x 1 75 l x 1 75 l y 1 75 l y now let the number of extraordinary events in s be denoted by n it is a poisson distributed random number of wind anomalies placed at random in s and e n λ p s n here λ p is the intensity of extraordinary wind events estimated at location p in our example n n s s

hybrid model the time step is 6 h and the simulated results correspond to 26 years of data fig 12 presents the time series of wind speed at this location obtained from the extracted hindcast top plots simulated by the poisson hybrid model middle plots and simulated by the transformed gaussian model without adding the random components in eq 11 bottom plots the figure demonstrates that the hybrid model can simulate extreme windy episodes as observed in the hindcast data whereas the transformed gaussian model differs from the transformed hybrid one only on very few occasions to compare the time series for low and moderately high speeds these plots have been zoomed in and presented in the right plots of fig 12 it is shown that the simulated time series of wind speeds are smoother than the observed values this is caused by the simplicity of the chosen kernel a more complex kernel as described in rychlik 2015 and rychlik and mao 2014 could be used instead 6 4 simulation of time series temporal of spatial wind fields in this section wind speeds in both spatial and temporal domains around location 130 5e 75 n in december are simulated by the poisson hybrid model these should be compared to the hindcast wind speed data shown in fig 11 three surfaces 6 h apart of the wind fields in a rectangle of 18 degrees of longitude and 12 4 degrees of latitude centred at 130 5 e 75 n are simulated the spatial grid resolution is 0 5 similar to the previous section the region s where weather anomalies are placed should be enlarged to 23 s 6 1 75 τ 6 1 75 τ 9 1 75 l x 9 1 75 l x 6 2 1 75 l y 6 2 1 75 l y the weather anomalies that occurred outside the region will not contribute to the increase in high wind speeds in the considered spatio temporal neighbourhood of p the poisson number of weather anomalies in region s has a mean of n n s s p 4 10 8 using eq 13 with n replaced by n and the observed kurtosis of the transformed wind speed at 130 5 e 75 n in december results in the following new values of the parameters ϑ and p ϑ 0 0043 and p 2 0 959 fig 13 presents one example of wind fields simulated at 6 h intervals by the transformed gaussian model left plots and the poisson hybrid model right plots quite often simulations of wind fields by the poisson hybrid model coincide with the simulations by the transformed gaussian model similar to the left plots while from time to time the random functions x i q contribute to the variation of wind fields in the region as can be seen in the right plots importantly the observed frequency of upcrossings of high wind speeds simulated by the poisson hybrid model agrees well with that observed in the hindcast data 7 conclusions the applicability of the transformed gaussian model using the modified winterstein s transformation and the poisson hybrid model to describe the wind speed variability in offshore locations of the arctic region has been demonstrated by estimating the yearly long term wind speed distribution the distributions of yearly maximum wind speed and crossing intensities of wind speed at several locations the wind speed distribution computed by these models agrees well with empirical wind characteristics and distributions derived from the ecmwf hindcast wind database it is also shown that the transformed gaussian model using the brown s transformation is more suitable for inland locations the transformed gaussian field can be used for spatio temporal modelling of wind speed variation in approximately 90 of locations in the arctic seas it is suitable for all of the norwegian sea and barents sea the chukchi sea the east siberian sea and most of the greenland sea in the entire beaufort and laptev seas the transformed gaussian model underestimates the frequencies of strong winds because the wind speeds during rare storms are much higher than those occurring normally at those regions the fitted gev distributions have the parameter c 0 i e of type ii extreme distribution however parameter c is not significantly different from zero i e type i extreme gumbel distribution the transformed gaussian model also accurately models the wind speeds at the locations where the type i distribution is applicable at inland locations and along the greenland coast both the transformed gaussian model and the hybrid model severely overestimate the frequencies of strong winds at those locations the gev distribution is often of type iii i e c 0 at the examined locations parameter c is significantly larger than zero at almost all offshore locations the proposed spatio temporal models can be used to evaluate wind statistics and simulate wind fields at fixed locations those provide a means for predicting the frequency of extreme wind speeds that is often needed in safety analysis of maritime operations and for the planning of coastline protection finally it should be noted that the commonly used weibull model of wind speeds underestimates the probabilities of high wind speeds at many locations it is shown that these models can be used at most locations except the coast of greenland acknowledgments support from the chalmers areas of advance of ict energy and

greatly improved the paper appendix a rice s formula for expected number of u crossings consider a fixed location p t p x p y p for simplicity of notation let t t p and w t w t x p y p describe the

t with respect to t the integral 25 μ p u z f w t w t z u d z is called the crossing intensity following the terms in eq 24 μ p u d t is equal to the expected number of crossings in the neighbourhood of t during an infinitesimal time interval d t rice s formula for the transformed gaussian model the assumption of local stationarity of the transformed using the brown s transformation gaussian model

eq 32 since e n λ s n eq 13 follows appendix c comparison of the hybrid and poisson hybrid models the hybrid model x h and the poisson hybrid models x p h are closely related both are defined by eq 11 where parameter n is a fixed integer or random poisson distributed number respectively in the poisson hybrid model the expected value e n λ s where λ is the intensity of extraordinary weather obviously λ s does not need to be an integer number the parameters of both models except λ and n are estimated using the method of moments hence mean variance skewness and kurtosis of x p h and x h are equal however the parameters are usually different since they depends on λ and n most often the estimated n is not equal to λ s mainly due to that parameter n is a integer value but λ can be any non negative real number this will be illustrated in the following example where n is taking value n 1 and λ s is chosen within the interval 0 2 note that for n 0 and λ 0 both x h and x p h are equally gaussian distributed appendix c1 model and matlab scripts for simulating w x p h w x h the properties of the hybrid model and the matlab scripts to estimate parameters p and ϑ were presented in rychlik and mao 2018 appendix c here the same hybrid model is used the parameters m 9 m s σ 3 m s matrix λ and the size of the region s are chosen as in the following scripts the kurtosis of w is 12 and the number of extraordinary events in s is n 1 this gives ϑ 0 096 and p 0 955 as shown in rychlik and mao 2018 appendix c image 2 for completeness the scripts to evaluate the parameters ϑ and p in case of the poisson hybrid x p h when e n e n 1 9 are also presented as follows the algorithm for the evaluation is presented in appendix b for e n 1 9 the following scripts give ϑ 0 0724 and p 0 9379 image 3 finally the following scripts are given to simulate values from the poisson hybrid model w x p h when hybrid 0 in the script and from the hybrid model w x h otherwise image 4 appendix c2 comparisons of x p h x h distributions samples of 800 000 independent wind speeds are simulated from the poisson hybrid model x p h for various values of e n 0 2 the empirical distributions of wind speeds simulated from x p h are estimated and compared to the distributions of wind speeds simulated from the hybrid model x h with parameter n 1 the results are presented in fig 14 this example shows that the distributions of wind speeds simulated by x p h with e n 1 and x h with n 1 are very close as shown in fig 14 red and black dashed thick lines this could indicate that the simpler hybrid model is preferred than the more complex poisson hybrid model however by letting e n to vary around value 1 leads to a quite wide range of distributions which change smoothly from the gaussian case e n 0 and the hybrid case x h with n 1 consequently the poisson hybrid model gives a richer class of distributions to model wind speeds than the hybrid model it should also be noted that the frequency of extreme values wind speeds above 60 m s seems to be close for all the models those are defined by the kurtosis value the distributions p w w differ mostly in the range of wind speed 20 50 m s where the exceedance probabilities are between 10 3 and 10 5 as e n gets smaller the probabilities p w x get closer to the gaussian probabilities the exceedance probabilities of wind speeds in range 20 50 m

poisson hybrid model x p h with e n 1 the right plot is a zoom in of the left plot fig 14 appendix d the gev probability distribution the class of distributions parameterized by three parameters θ a b

if c 0 the formula is valid for x b a c and if c 0 it is valid for x b a c the case c 0 is interpreted as the limit at c 0 for both distributions note that the gumbel distribution is a gev

23151,a spatio temporal transformed gaussian field has been proposed to model wind variability in the northern north atlantic but it does not accurately describe the extreme wind speeds attributed to tropical storms and hurricanes in rychlik and mao 2018 this model was generalized by adding certain number of random components to model rare events with extreme wind speeds or severe storms and was named the hybrid model in this study these models are further developed and validated to properly describe the variation of wind speeds in the arctic area in most locations the transformed gaussian field is a sufficiently accurate model however in some regions e g the laptev and beaufort seas this model severely underestimates the frequencies of extreme wind speeds therefore the hybrid model is further improved to add poisson distributed random storm events to describe the wind variation in these regions and is named as the poisson hybrid model there are also locations e g along the east coast of greenland where the frequencies of high wind speeds are severely overestimated by the transformed gaussian model it is shown that this model can be used to estimate the long term distribution of wind speeds predict extreme wind speeds and simulate the spatio temporal wind fields for practical applications keywords wind speed spatio temporal wind statistics the arctic exponential transformation hermite transformation gaussian field poisson hybrid model extreme wind 1 introduction strong winds over the oceans can create dangerous metocean conditions for ships and offshore engineering activities such as oil and gas drilling rigs or renewable energy installations as sea ice declines human activities in the arctic ocean are increasing the arctic shipping is attracting increasing number of sailing ships and arctic offshore development is also increasing all these activities bring very urgent demands for the development of reliable models for wind and wave loads statistical properties of wind speed vary in terms of geographic location and season the median and other statistics e g standard deviation and return values are important parameters describing the wind climate these statistics of wind speed in the arctic have recently been presented in e g hughes and cassano 2015 and kislov and matveeva 2016 for practical engineering applications such as estimating the average wind energy that could be harvested at a fixed location the long term yearly wind speed distribution is needed in this case a weibull distribution often gives a good description of observed wind speeds takle and brown 1978 other models have been also proposed e g recently by drobinski 2015 to describe the wind speed variability if the weibull model is not sufficient accurate it is shown that the weibull distribution often underestimates the frequency of very high wind speeds in the arctic another useful wind characteristic is the expected frequency of episodes of wind speed exceeding a given value see appendix a for details the frequency is often called the crossing frequency a ratio of these two characteristics gives an estimate of the expected duration of a storm both the long term distribution and the crossing frequency are one dimensional characteristics that change slowly across locations and seasons however there are practical engineering problems that require multivariate characteristics e g the joint distribution of wind speeds at distinct locations and times for example these distributions are needed to evaluate the wind statistics encountered by a sailing vessel mao and rychlik 2016 and for predicting ship speeds mao et al 2016 in such cases spatio temporal models often based on well understood transformed gaussian models can be used to describe these wind statistics such models can be used to evaluate frequencies and distributions of various wind storms characteristics brodtkorb et al 2000 podgórski and rychlik 2016 the popular transformations proposed by brown et al 1984 winterstein 1988 etc are frequently used in engineering literature for example the exponential transformation proposed by brown et al 1984 was successfully used in mao and rychlik 2016 to model wind speed distributions in the north atlantic at offshore locations of the arctic the modified winterstein s transformation gives more accurate predictions of extreme winds while the brown s exponential transformation works better in inland locations in approximately 8 of the arctic area the transformed gaussian models underestimate the extreme wind speeds in this study the poisson hybrid model is proposed to model the wind variation in the arctic in this model the daily wind speed variation is modelled by the transformed gaussian field and a poisson number of random components is then added to model the rare events of extreme wind speeds the poisson hybrid model is compared with the previously proposed hybrid model in appendix c various transformed gaussian models are briefly presented in section 2 and section 3 presents some details of the poisson hybrid model based on the proposed poisson hybrid model the rice s method can be used for predicting extreme wind speeds and estimating the long term wind distribution in the arctic regions section 4 briefly reviews how to use the model to estimate the long term wind speed distribution and the crossing frequency and to derive 100 or 1000 year return values the extreme wind speeds the accuracy of the model is validated in section 5 by comparing the wind speed characteristics observed in the data with those evaluated from the fitted model section 6 presents examples of simulating spatio temporal wind fields by the proposed poisson hybrid model conclusions the reference list and four appendixes close the paper 2 various transformed gaussian models for wind speed variability transformed gaussian and hybrid models can be fitted to various data sources e g the wave heights measured from satellites baxevani et al 2005 2008 in this study the wind speed referring to the 10 min average wind speed with a unit of m s is investigated with these models the hindcast wind data over 26 years 1990 2015 with a 0 75 degree and 6 h resolution from the ecmwf era interim reanalysis dataset dee et al 2011 are used the distribution of wind speed in a large geographic region such as the arctic depends on the season and geographic location p t p x p y p however at shorter scales of hours and kilometers the wind speed can be considered stationary for a period of approximately one month and in a region of several degrees in diameter then the wind speed variation can be described by a transformed gaussian model using monotonic transformation x g w if the field 1 x p t x y g w t p t x p x y p y has standard gaussian distribution the local transformed gaussian model is fully defined if the transformation g and the correlation structure of the gaussian field x p t x y i e ρ t x y e g w t p x p y p g w t p t x p x y p y are specified 2 1 exponentially transformed gaussian model in rychlik and mao 2018 the brown s exponentially transformed gaussian model was proposed to model the wind speed w in the neighbourhood of a location p viz 2 w t p t x p x y p y a p m p σ p x p t x y normally the exponent a is of the range 0 a p 2 when a is very small the extreme wind prediction based on this transformation becomes very sensitive i e even small estimation errors in a may cause big errors in predicted extreme wind speeds empirically by setting 0 4 a p 2 can limit this problem without affecting the accuracy of the transformation model then the brown s exponential transformation can be also written as 3 g w w a p m p σ p the parameters a p m p and σ p 2 are estimated by the method of moments all parameters defining the model depend on the location p and are estimated pointwise for a given location p the transformation exponent a is first estimated to satisfy the criterion that the skewness of w a be zero then m σ 2 are set equal to the mean and variance monthly of the transformed wind speeds w a it should be noted that for the applications in which the model is used to predict extreme wind speeds by the model the parameters are smoothed over a spatial neighbourhood with a radius of approximately 3 the parameter m p can be evaluated from the median wind speed for example fig 1 presents the median wind speeds in january and august in the arctic and fig 2 shows the variability of parameter a p the variability of the standard deviation of the transformed wind speed σ p which varies in both time and space is presented in fig 3 the exponential transformation has been successfully applied in the north atlantic however in many arctic locations the exponential transformation does not work well i e the distribution of g w is not gaussian while the kurtosis of the exponentially transformed wind speeds often exceeds the gaussian threshold three leading to an underestimation of the frequency of high wind speeds therefore in this study the brown s exponential transformation is superposed with the hermite transformation proposed by winterstein 1988 this transformation is a monotonic cubic polynomial that is calibrated such that the first four moments mean variance skewness and kurtosis of the transformed model are equal to the moments of the data 2 2 superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations obviously if the distribution of w i e f w w were known then x g w where g w φ 1 f w w has the standard gaussian distribution φ x however the distribution of w is unknown and must be estimated from data here the method of moments is used i e the winterstein s hermite polynomial transformation g h r w is used to achieve a mean of zero variance of one skewness of zero and kurtosis of three however if the transformation is not monotonic over the range of w of interest it cannot ensure the transformation s stability i e the transformation cannot always be performed the stability is important for the automated estimation of models for large number of locations because the transformation is always monotonic for variables having zero skewness and the brown s exponentially transformed data has zero skewness this study proposes using the superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations viz g w g h r w a to achieve stability this superposition is a more stable transformation than the original winterstein s transformation 2 3 proposed transformation scheme to model the arctic wind in this paper the wind speed variation is modelled as follows first the exponential transformation as in eq 2 is performed the transformed field x has a zero mean variance of one and skewness of zero then x is described by three models depending on the kurtosis of x i e κ x is estimated using the transformed wind speeds i when κ w a 3 x is modelled by the superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations so that x g h r w a has a kurtosis of three and again x is approximated by a standardized gaussian field ii when κ w a 3 x is modelled by the zero mean and variance of one non gaussian field that is described by a newly proposed poisson hybrid model in section 3 iii when κ w a 3 x is modelled or approximated by a standardized gaussian field i e the wind speed variation is approximated by an exponentially transformed gaussian model the choice between models i and ii depends on the frequencies of extreme winds at specific locations model ii is used at locations where model i underestimates the frequencies of extreme wind speeds 3 local spatio temporal models for wind speed here locally stationary second order stochastic models are assumed it means that locally 4 g w t p t x p x y p y a p m p σ p x q q t x y where p t p x p y p and x is a zero mean unit variance homogeneous random field that has a correlation function denoted by ρ p in this study three models for x are briefly presented i e the gaussian x g as in lindgren 2013 the laplace moving average x l m a as presented in åberg and podgórski 2011 and the poisson hybrid x p h the hybrid process was introduced in kvarnström et al 2013 and the properties of laplace distributions were discussed in kotz et al 2001 3 1 gaussian field x g the standardized homogeneous gaussian field is defined by the correlation function ρ p similar to our previous studies rychlik and mao 2014 mao and rychlik 2016 the following gaussian correlation function is used in this paper for a location p the correlation of wind speeds around the surrounding homogeneous region q is written as 5 ρ q ρ t x y exp π 2 q λ q t 2 λ λ i j which is a positive definite matrix eq 5 defines the spatio temporal correlation of transformed wind speeds in the neighbourhood of location p 3 1 1 the kernel f constructed from ρ t x y for a wind speed field of the correlation function ρ a kernel f can be constructed to describe the characteristics of the wind speed time series and the shape of regions with extreme wind speeds it is defined such that f f q ρ q where defines a convolution operation for a correlation function ρ in eq 5 the kernel f is defined by 6 f q 2 π 3 4 detλ 1 4 exp π 2 q λ q t q t x y the gaussian field x g of the correlation in eq 5 can be generated by smoothing the gaussian white noise with kernel f more precisely an approximation of x g t x y is obtained by using a grid t k x i y j with discretization steps d x d y d t respectively subsequently 7 x g t x y i j k f t t k x x i y y j z i j k d x d y d t where z i j k are independent gaussian variables with a zero mean and variance of one the approximation error converges to zero as the discretization steps approach zero this model has been used to describe wind speeds in north atlantic rychlik and mao 2014 mao and rychlik 2016 however it performs poorly at locations where extraordinary weather events causing extreme winds e g cyclones and hurricanes occur rarely for such locations e g the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico a model called the hybrid model has been proposed in rychlik and mao 2018 this model is further developed in this study by letting the number of weather anomalies be a random poisson distributed variable this new model is described in the following subsections the gaussian model is a special case of poisson hybrid model that is obtained when the intensity of weather anomalies λ tends to zero in other extreme cases when the intensity of weather anomalies tends to infinity the poisson hybrid model approaches the laplace model described in the following subsection 3 2 laplace model the laplace distribution and process has kurtosis exceeding three as shown in eq 10 similarly the kurtosis of the hybrid model also exceeds three as proven in the appendix in kvarnström et al 2013 for proof hence it is also the case that the processes described by a poisson hybrid model also have kurtosis exceeding three see also eq 13 consequently the laplace model is defined for the brown s exponential transformed model as in eq 2 because it can be only defined when the kurtosis of the transformed wind speed exceeds three the wind speeds after the superposition of brown s and winterstein s transformations will have a kurtosis close to three in the laplace model the same kernel f defined in eq 6 will be used with a large region s 0 0 0 to define x l m a the size of s denoted by s depends on f through the matrix λ see section 4 2 in rychlik and mao 2018 for a discussion of the choice of s here a symmetrical laplace field x l m a is used the field is defined by kernel f region s and a scale parameter ϑ 0 the field at q t x y is approximated by the following sum of random functions modelling weather events with extreme values equal to y i r i and located at u i s 8 x l m a q i 1 x i q x i q y i r i f q u i here y i are independent laplace distributed variables with the probability density function f y y 0 25 exp y 2 this motivates the name laplace model the variables y i z i ζ i where z i has a standard normal distribution and ζ i is a standard exponentially distributed variable the three dimensional u i are uniformly distributed in s the factors r i are defined by 9 r i ϑ s v 1 v i ϑ where v 1 v i are independent random variables that are uniformly distributed over the interval 0 1 and are independent of y i u i it can be shown that as the region s grows the sum in eq 8 converges to a homogeneous field with mean zero unit variance and the correlation as in eq 5 the field is called laplace moving average x l m a q finally the skewness of x l m a q is zero and its kurtosis can be described as the details are provided in appendix b 10 κ x

functions x i are defined by eq 8 the number n is random and poisson distributed with the expected value 12 n e n λ s the non negative constant λ is called the intensity of weather anomalies or unusual weather episodes it is assumed that n is independent of all other variables used to define the model in eq 11 in a previous work rychlik and mao 2018 has used a constant n n and the model was named the hybrid model in this study the poisson hybrid model is used to describe the wind speed variability in the arctic only at locations where the transformed gaussian model severely underestimates the frequency of high wind speeds in the model of eq 11 p is chosen such that v x p h q 1 the region s is chosen as described in section 4 2 of rychlik and mao 2018 it is to be large enough that s f q 2 d q 1 next suppose that λ or n is estimated from the expected value of n then the scale parameter ϑ can be estimated by the method of moments where kurtosis κ x p h is equal to the observed kurtosis of the transformed wind speed data the formula for computing p and ϑ is given as follows a sketch of the proof is given in appendix b 13 κ x p h 3 3 1 2 ϑ e 2 n ϑ 1 2 ϑ 6 ϑ e n ϑ 1 ϑ

e n λ s is chosen to minimize a suitably chosen distance between the computed and observed crossing frequencies in the transformed wind speed data of course the intensity of anomalies λ is estimated by n s 4 extreme wind speed and long term wind distributions the risk of experiencing a strong wind can be measured in several ways for example at a fixed location the fraction of time that the wind speed is above a threshold u e g 30 m s during a year is of interest this fraction can be evaluated from the so called long term wind distribution i e by computing p w u another important piece of information is the number of wind episodes storms of the wind speed being continually above the threshold u during a year this quantity is equal to the number of times that wind speed upcrosses the level u denoted by n u the yearly upcrossing rate is the expectation e n u given by rice s formula rice 1944 1945 yet another characteristic is the maximum wind speed occurring during a year here it is denoted by m the probability p m u is a measure of severity of wind climate and the so called 100 1000 year extreme return wind speed denoted by w 100 w 1000 respectively are severity indices the 100 year extreme wind is defined as a quantile of the distribution of m viz as a solution of 14 ℙ m w 100 1 100 an alternative definition of the 100 year wind speed is that it is the level that wind speed exceeds on average once per 100 years under the assumption that the local wind climate is stationary w 100 is the solution to 15 e n w 100 1 100 as shown in section 4 2 the two equations i e eqs 14 and eq 15 give practically the same values of 100 year extreme wind speed 4 1 long term distribution of wind speed at fixed locations since the variability of w depends on season to avoid ambiguity when discussing the distribution of w the time span and the region where the wind observations are used for model construction need to be clearly specified by shrinking the time span to a single moment t p and the geographic region to a location p the local distribution of w p g 1 m p σ p x p 0 0 0 1 a p can be estimated the long term distribution is the average of the distribution w p for example the yearly distribution of w at x p y p is given by 16 ℙ w w 0 1 ℙ w t p x p y p w d t p if w is described by the transformed gaussian model then 17 ℙ w p w φ g w a p m p σ p p t p x p y p where φ x is the cumulative distribution of a standard gaussian variable 4 2 yearly maximum distribution rice s method a classical approach to obtaining the distribution of yearly maximums m is to fit three parameters of the generalized extreme distribution gev to the observed yearly maximums as discussed in appendix d in the present study only 26 yearly maximums are available the estimates of the three parameters of gev are uncertain i e the confidence intervals of the 100 1000 year return values predicted by eq 14 are very wide therefore in this work the transformed gaussian model fitted to all available data combined with eq 15 is used to estimate the return values the needed expected upcrossing rates e n u are computed using the rice s formula rice 1944 1945 as shown in appendix a this approach named rice s method leads to smaller estimation errors however rice s method can be biased if the transformed gaussian model does not accurately describe data the rice s method was successfully used in rychlik et al 2011 mao and rychlik 2013 for 100 year prediction of significant wave height in the north atlantic in the following sections both eqs 14 and 15 are used to estimate the 100 year return wind speed first the return values are estimated using eq 15 where e n u is evaluated from the transformed gaussian model using rice s formula then the estimates are validated using the returned values derived from eq 14 where m is obtained from a region of 1 5 degrees of wind data and has a gev distribution fitted to 26 yearly maximums now if there are systematic differences between the two types of estimates in a larger region such differences will indicate that the return values evaluated using the transformed gaussian model are biased in that region remark note that 18 ℙ m u ℙ n u 0 e n u since for high values of u p w 0 u is often negligible hence return values obtained from eq 15 are higher than those obtained from eq 14 the difference can be large if crossings of high levels cluster however for the transformed gaussian model the number of high level crossings is approximately poisson distributed hence the 100 or 1000 year return values evaluated by eqs 14 and 15 are very close leadbetter 1983 4 3 estimates of extreme wind speed in the arctic to validate the above rice s method methods based on the univariate extreme value theory coles 2001 are used for example by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution to yearly maximum wind speeds at a fixed location the extreme wind speed estimated from the fitted gev distribution is used as a reference value for validating rice s method alternatively the peak over threshold pot method davison and smith 1990 could be used however a strong seasonal wind speed variation and correlation make the pot method very complex to use and less suitable to our validation purpose in fig 4 the 100 year extreme wind evaluated by the rice s method is compared to the estimated values obtained from the gev distribution fitted to the 26 yearly maximums the 100 year extreme wind speed computed by the transformed gaussian model with brown s transformation is smoother than that estimated by the gev distribution fitted to the data some of the difference between the statistically extreme predictions can be explained by statistical estimation errors however there are larger regions where the two estimates differ considerably e g along with greenland coast in laptev and beaufort seas and in some locations in siberia i e the transformed gaussian model does not fit the wind speed variability well in those regions the possible reasons for the estimation biases are investigated in the following section 5 validation of models of wind variation at the arctic three wind speed characteristics discussed in section 4 i e the upcrossings yearly frequencies e n u from eq 28 the long term ℙ w u from eq 16 and the probability ℙ m u that the yearly maximum exceeds a threshold u from eq 18 as well as those directly derived from the data are used to validate the proposed models for describing the wind speed variation in the arctic first the transformed gaussian model works well for most locations in the arctic for example fig 5 compares the values of the three wind characteristics that are computed and observed at the location 0 e 75 75 n in the greenland sea and location 171 75 w 72 75 n in the chukchi sea respectively in addition ℙ w u computed by the fitted weibull distribution and ℙ m u derived from the fitted gev in eq 34 are presented the agreement between the theoretical characteristics computed from the transformed gaussian model and empirical characteristics is good the weibull distribution fits well the data at location 0 e 75 75 n while the weibull model does not describe well the high wind speeds at location 171 75 w 72 75 n second there are also locations where the transformed gaussian model is not sufficiently accurate e g the model overestimates the frequencies along the east coast of greenland while underestimating those of wind at the laptev sea examples of two such locations are illustrated in fig 6 for the wind speed at the coast of greenland high winds occur quite frequently and are of similar size for the wind speed at the laptev sea high wind speed episodes are rare and the wind during the episodes is much stronger than that during normal weather these phenomena are presented as time series at the two locations in fig 7 these types of signals are difficult to model accurately with a transformed gaussian model using a superposition of exponential and winterstein s transformations the transformed gaussian model seems to work well at moderately high wind speeds but does not correctly predict the frequencies of extreme wind speeds this is because the extremes i e the tail types of wind distributions are defined by the extrapolation of transformation the extremes are outside the range of observed wind speeds and the tails of wind distributions determine when the proposed transformed gaussian model can be used for example at greenland locations the tails of wind distributions are very light but in the laptev sea the tails are heavier the winterstein s transformation results in exponential tails 5 1 regions of the validity of transformed gaussian models consequently the geographic locations will be classified into three types according to the following criterion the transformed gaussian method accurately approximates the frequency of strong winds type i but it underestimates type ii and overestimates type iii the frequency the classification is done by comparing the 1000 year extreme wind speed evaluated using the rice s method through the transformed gaussian model denoted by w 1000 t r g with the gev prediction of eq 36 denoted by w 1000 g e v these groups are presented as different markers for the entire arctic area in fig 8 more precisely for a given location if w 1000 g e v w 1000 t r g 8 m s the transformed gaussian model is suitable for describing the wind variation such locations e g the locations 0 e 75 75 n and 171 75 w 72 75 n in fig 5 are shown as blue dots in fig 8 and are classified as type i if w 1000 g e v w 1000 t r g 8 m s the transformed gaussian model underestimates the frequency of high wind speeds such locations e g the location 127 5 e 76 5 n shown in fig 6 are shown as red asterisks in fig 8 and are classified as type ii finally if w 1000 g e v w 1000 t r g 8 m s the model overestimates the frequency of high wind speeds such locations e g the location 16 5 w 73 5 n close to the coast of greenland are shown as green crosses in fig 8 and are classified as type iii in probability theory and statistics the generalized extreme value gev distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions developed within the extreme value theory to combine the gumbel c 0 fréchet c 0 and weibull families c 0 in eq 34 it is also known as type i ii and iii extreme value distributions in fact in the arctic region where the transformed gaussian model is applicable parameter c does not significantly differ from zero e g the gumbel distribution cannot be rejected type i in fig 8 the locations of type ii are similar because the fitted gev is of fréche type c 0 type ii gev in the laptev sea parameter c is often significantly negative as in the fréchet case finally at locations in a type iii region parameter c 0 e g the gev distribution is of type iii as well as illustrated in the bottom plot of fig 8 the classifications based on the gev and the transformed gaussian model give similar results the threshold 8 m s is chosen arbitrarily based on the practice that the difference of 8 m s for the 1000 year wind is very small from the engineering point of view a variable threshold that depends on location and the confidence interval for the shape parameter c could be used for a further detailed test however our goal is to have approximate classifications to limit the number of locations where the model has to be tested in detail the important criterion is to examine the clustering of locations of the same type because the model type in offshore areas may not change very rapidly it should be noted that the 1000 year extreme wind speed predicted by the fitted gev is uncertain and depends on the particular statistical method used for the distribution fitting e g the maximum likelihood method and probability weighted moments there is a risk of miss classification however if there are bigger regions clusters of type ii and iii their existence indicates that the transformed gaussian model is biased and another spatio temporal model should be used for the following analysis the arctic region where the transformed gaussian model underestimates the frequencies of high wind speeds is called the type ii region while the region of overestimation is called the type iii region for the type ii region the wind speed variation can be accurately described by the hybrid model as shown in fig 8 the laptev sea and the beaufort sea are type ii regions as discussed in section 5 2 on the other hand both type i and smaller type ii regions are included in the norwegian sea and the greenland sea except certain areas with some type iii locations close to the coast 5 2 the laptev sea and the beaufort sea the time series of wind speeds at a location at the laptev sea are presented in the bottom plot of fig 7 where the episodes storms of high speeds are rare furthermore the wind speed during such episodes is much higher than that during the normal weather the variation of such time series of wind speeds in particular at high wind speeds in the time series is not accurately described by the two transformed gaussian models brown s and modified winterstein s transformations or the weibull model in rychlik and mao 2018 a hybrid model is proposed to modify the transformed gaussian model by adding random components to the transformed gaussian field to represent events with extreme wind speeds the resulting random field is locally stationary and homogeneous in this study the model is further improved by considering the number of added components as a poisson process named the poisson hybrid model in this article it is used to describe the randomness of storm weather events i e the number of storm events at different locations among a large stationary spatial region is modelled by a poisson process fig 9 compares the wind characteristics obtained with the poisson hybrid model with those derived from the observed wind data two rather close locations in the laptev sea 127 5 e 76 5 n and 122 25 e 78 75 n are chosen the wind characteristics computed from the poisson hybrid model agree well with those derived from the observed data furthermore at both locations the weibull distribution underestimates the frequency of high wind speeds for these locations the fitted gev distribution is of type ii however parameter c is in both cases not significantly different from zero as wind speeds at the two locations are strongly correlated the simpler transformed gaussian model might be adequate for modelling the winds speeds at these locations similar results are presented in fig 10 where the accuracy of the poisson hybrid model and transformed gaussian model is demonstrated at a location in the beaufort sea 6 simulation of spatial and temporal wind speeds the simulation of wind speeds in both spatial and temporal domains is of special interest to practical engineering applications for example this proposed poisson hybrid model could be used to simulate wind conditions along arbitrary ship routes the simulated wind information is essential for estimating the payback times of wind assisted propulsion devices nelissen et al 2016 to be installed onboard ships and for assessing the safety of ships after installation based on such simulated wind information a ship could also choose to sail more economically to encounter more beneficial wind conditions along its routes furthermore wind field simulations provide important information regarding the choice and design of wind farms in specific regions the proposed poisson hybrid model can also be used to simulate artificial wind speeds in time and space viz w t p t x p x y p y m p σ p p x g q i 1 n x i q 1 a p an important feature of establishing the poisson hybrid model is to specify a region s p in which the extraordinary weather episodes are placed the region s p depends on the shape of the kernel f defined in eq 6 it should contain the location 0 0 0 and should be at least large enough that s p f q 2 d q 1 it means that extraordinary wind conditions with a center outside s p would not contribute to wind speed at p i e x i p 0 for p u i s p for completeness the following subsection briefly reviews the choice of s p in rychlik and mao 2018 using the average geometry size of a spatio temporal windy weather region 6 1 the region s at location p let windy weather be defined as x g t x y m p furthermore let τ be the average duration of uninterrupted windy weather at location p t p x p y p where t p is discretized by month for the estimation similarly let the average spatial extents of windy weather in the longitudinal and latitudinal directions be denoted by l x and l y respectively more precisely τ l x and l y are the average lengths of excursions above the median wind speed i e w m 1 a of processes x t x g t 0 0 x x x g 0 x 0 and x y x g 0 0 y respectively since x t x x and x y are standardized stationary gaussian processes with the correlation function given by eq 5 then by using rice s formula in eq 27 and theorem 7 6 given in lindgren 2013 the following relations can be obtained 19 τ π v x t v x t λ 11 1 2 l x π v x x v x x λ 22 1 2 l y π v x y v x y λ 33 1 2 where v x denotes the variance of random variable x the parameters can be fair approximations to the observed average sizes of windy weather regions as most of the time the hybrid model is generated using a gaussian field x g for an accurate estimation of the long term distributions or crossing rates at a fixed location p the following region is used 20 s p 1 75 τ 1 75 τ 1 75 l x 1 75 l x 1 75 l y 1 75 l y where the parameters τ l x and l y are scale parameters of kernel f q in eqs 6 and 19 while the constant 1 75 is chosen such that the integral s f q 2 d q 1 the typical value of s p 3 5 3 τ l x l y is approximately 8 10 4 hour deg 2 if wind speeds are considered at a collection of positions q i in the neighbourhood of p it could happen that extraordinary wind conditions centered outside s p could contribute to winds at some of q i consequently the region s has to be enlarged to 21 s i s q i 6 2 model parameters for a laptev sea location 130 5 e 75 n in december fig 11 presents the dynamics of the strongest wind storm in 1990 2015 at the laptev sea in the following the wind speeds in both spatial and temporal domains around location 130 5e 75 n in december are simulated by the poisson hybrid model and further compared to hindcast wind speed data first for the established poisson hybrid model its fitted parameters for december are a 0 46 m 2 2 σ 0 5 p 0 987 and n e n 4 based on the given n the parameters p and ϑ are computed by eq 13 because the kurtosis of the transformed wind speed at 3 24 is close to 3 the parameter ϑ 0 0065 is small the parameters defining the spatio temporal dependence defined in eq 19 are τ 1 69 days and l x 23 3 l y 7 8 degrees furthermore the matrix λ is almost diagonal i e the gradient components are almost uncorrelated and there are no systematic movements of windy weather regions if the spatio temporally homogeneous properties of w in a neighbourhood field of p are needed s p must be enlarged to contain the neighbourhood for example if a time series during december i e 720 h should be simulated then using eqs 20 and 21 the region can be enlarged to 22 s i s q i 360 1 75 τ 360 1 75 τ 1 75 l x 1 75 l x 1 75 l y 1 75 l y now let the number of extraordinary events in s be denoted by n it is a poisson distributed random number of wind anomalies placed at random in s and e n λ p s n here λ p is the intensity of extraordinary wind events estimated at location p in our example n n s s 24 25 furthermore ϑ 0 0045 and p 2 0 9626 6 3 simulation of time series temporal of wind speeds for location 130 5 e 75 n 26 independent time series of wind speeds in december are simulated by the hybrid model the time step is 6 h and the simulated results correspond to 26 years of data fig 12 presents the time series of wind speed at this location obtained from the extracted hindcast top plots simulated by the poisson hybrid model middle plots and simulated by the transformed gaussian model without adding the random components in eq 11 bottom plots the figure demonstrates that the hybrid model can simulate extreme windy episodes as observed in the hindcast data whereas the transformed gaussian model differs from the transformed hybrid one only on very few occasions to compare the time series for low and moderately high speeds these plots have been zoomed in and presented in the right plots of fig 12 it is shown that the simulated time series of wind speeds are smoother than the observed values this is caused by the simplicity of the chosen kernel a more complex kernel as described in rychlik 2015 and rychlik and mao 2014 could be used instead 6 4 simulation of time series temporal of spatial wind fields in this section wind speeds in both spatial and temporal domains around location 130 5e 75 n in december are simulated by the poisson hybrid model these should be compared to the hindcast wind speed data shown in fig 11 three surfaces 6 h apart of the wind fields in a rectangle of 18 degrees of longitude and 12 4 degrees of latitude centred at 130 5 e 75 n are simulated the spatial grid resolution is 0 5 similar to the previous section the region s where weather anomalies are placed should be enlarged to 23 s 6 1 75 τ 6 1 75 τ 9 1 75 l x 9 1 75 l x 6 2 1 75 l y 6 2 1 75 l y the weather anomalies that occurred outside the region will not contribute to the increase in high wind speeds in the considered spatio temporal neighbourhood of p the poisson number of weather anomalies in region s has a mean of n n s s p 4 10 8 using eq 13 with n replaced by n and the observed kurtosis of the transformed wind speed at 130 5 e 75 n in december results in the following new values of the parameters ϑ and p ϑ 0 0043 and p 2 0 959 fig 13 presents one example of wind fields simulated at 6 h intervals by the transformed gaussian model left plots and the poisson hybrid model right plots quite often simulations of wind fields by the poisson hybrid model coincide with the simulations by the transformed gaussian model similar to the left plots while from time to time the random functions x i q contribute to the variation of wind fields in the region as can be seen in the right plots importantly the observed frequency of upcrossings of high wind speeds simulated by the poisson hybrid model agrees well with that observed in the hindcast data 7 conclusions the applicability of the transformed gaussian model using the modified winterstein s transformation and the poisson hybrid model to describe the wind speed variability in offshore locations of the arctic region has been demonstrated by estimating the yearly long term wind speed distribution the distributions of yearly maximum wind speed and crossing intensities of wind speed at several locations the wind speed distribution computed by these models agrees well with empirical wind characteristics and distributions derived from the ecmwf hindcast wind database it is also shown that the transformed gaussian model using the brown s transformation is more suitable for inland locations the transformed gaussian field can be used for spatio temporal modelling of wind speed variation in approximately 90 of locations in the arctic seas it is suitable for all of the norwegian sea and barents sea the chukchi sea the east siberian sea and most of the greenland sea in the entire beaufort and laptev seas the transformed gaussian model underestimates the frequencies of strong winds because the wind speeds during rare storms are much higher than those occurring normally at those regions the fitted gev distributions have the parameter c 0 i e of type ii extreme distribution however parameter c is not significantly different from zero i e type i extreme gumbel distribution the transformed gaussian model also accurately models the wind speeds at the locations where the type i distribution is applicable at inland locations and along the greenland coast both the transformed gaussian model and the hybrid model severely overestimate the frequencies of strong winds at those locations the gev distribution is often of type iii i e c 0 at the examined locations parameter c is significantly larger than zero at almost all offshore locations the proposed spatio temporal models can be used to evaluate wind statistics and simulate wind fields at fixed locations those provide a means for predicting the frequency of extreme wind speeds that is often needed in safety analysis of maritime operations and for the planning of coastline protection finally it should be noted that the commonly used weibull model of wind speeds underestimates the probabilities of high wind speeds at many locations it is shown that these models can be used at most locations except the coast of greenland acknowledgments support from the chalmers areas of advance of ict energy and

greatly improved the paper appendix a rice s formula for expected number of u crossings consider a fixed location p t p x p y p for simplicity of notation let t t p and w t w t x p y p describe the wind speed at location p then the expected number of crossings of level u during one year is given by rice s formula rice 1944 1945 24 e n u 0 1 z f w t w t z u d z d t where w is the derivative of w t with respect to t the integral 25 μ p u z f w t w t z u d z is called the crossing intensity following the terms in eq 24 μ p u d t is equal to the expected number of crossings in the neighbourhood of t during an infinitesimal time interval d t rice s formula for the transformed gaussian model the assumption of local stationarity of the transformed using the brown s transformation gaussian model for wind speed means that locally w t p t x p x y p y m p σ p x g q 1 a q t x y where p t p x p y p since w crosses u at time t p only if x t x g t 0 0 crosses u a m p σ p at zero thus the intensity

28 e n u 0 5 0 1 μ t x p y p u d t the computation of the expected value of crossing intensity according to the hybrid model is presented in appendix a of rychlik and mao 2018 the methodology is directly applicable to computating the conditional expected number of crossings according to the poisson hybrid model given that the poisson number of unusual wind events n k then the unconditional expected number is computed using e n u k 0 e n u n k e λ s λ s k k appendix b proof of eq 13 for a poisson hybrid model consider the hybrid model with a fixed number of anomalies denoted by k mathematically we consider the properties of the poisson hybrid model with n k several elementary but lengthy derivations give the following formula for the kurtosis of x h 29 p 2 1 1 ϑ k k 0 30 κ x p

eq 32 since e n λ s n eq 13 follows appendix c comparison of the hybrid and poisson hybrid models the hybrid model x h and the poisson hybrid models x p h are closely related both are defined by eq 11 where parameter n is a fixed integer or random poisson distributed number respectively in the poisson hybrid model the expected value e n λ s where λ is the intensity of extraordinary weather obviously λ s does not need to be an integer number the parameters of both models except λ and n are estimated using the method of moments hence mean variance skewness and kurtosis of x p h and x h are equal however the parameters are usually different since they depends on λ and n most often the estimated n is not equal to λ s mainly due to that parameter n is a integer value but λ can be any non negative real number this will be illustrated in the following example where n is taking value n 1 and λ s is chosen within the interval 0 2 note that for n 0 and λ 0 both x h and x p h are equally gaussian distributed appendix c1 model and matlab scripts for simulating w x p h w x h the properties of the hybrid model and the matlab scripts to estimate parameters p and ϑ were presented in rychlik and mao 2018 appendix c here the same hybrid model is used the parameters m 9 m s σ 3 m s matrix λ and the size of the region s are chosen as in the following scripts the kurtosis of w is 12 and the number of extraordinary events in s is n 1 this gives ϑ 0 096 and p 0 955 as shown in rychlik and mao 2018 appendix c image 2 for completeness the scripts to evaluate the parameters ϑ and p in case of the poisson hybrid x p h when e n e n 1 9 are also presented as follows the algorithm for the evaluation is presented in appendix b for e n 1 9 the following scripts give ϑ 0 0724 and p 0 9379 image 3 finally the following scripts are given to simulate values from the poisson hybrid model w x p h when hybrid 0 in the script and from the hybrid model w x h otherwise image 4 appendix c2 comparisons of x p h x h distributions samples of 800 000 independent wind speeds are simulated from the poisson hybrid model x p h for various values of e n 0 2 the empirical distributions of wind speeds simulated from x p h are estimated and compared to the distributions of wind speeds simulated from the hybrid model x h with parameter n 1 the results are presented in fig 14 this example shows that the distributions of wind speeds simulated by x p h with e n 1 and x h with n 1 are very close as shown in fig 14 red and black dashed thick lines this could indicate that the simpler hybrid model is preferred than the more complex poisson hybrid model however by letting e n to vary around value 1 leads to a quite wide range of distributions which change smoothly from the gaussian case e n 0 and the hybrid case x h with n 1 consequently the poisson hybrid model gives a richer class of distributions to model wind speeds than the hybrid model it should also be noted that the frequency of extreme values wind speeds above 60 m s seems to be close for all the models those are defined by the kurtosis value the distributions p w w differ mostly in the range of wind speed 20 50 m s where the exceedance probabilities are between 10 3 and 10 5 as e n gets smaller the probabilities p w x get closer to the gaussian probabilities the exceedance probabilities of wind speeds in range 20 50 m s increases slowly with e n fig 14 comparison of exceedance probabilities p w x for wind speeds w simulated from the poisson hybrid model x p h with parameter e n 0 05 0 1 0 3 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 7

poisson hybrid model x p h with e n 1 the right plot is a zoom in of the left plot fig 14 appendix d the gev probability distribution the class of distributions parameterized by three parameters θ a b c where c is a shape parameter is called the generalized extreme value distribution class gev the distribution function in this class has a form 34 gev g x a b c exp 1 c x b a 1 c if c 0 exp exp x b a if c 0 where a is a scale parameter b a location parameter and x max 0 x consequently the shape parameter c determines the possible values of x the condition 1 c x b a means that 1 c x b a 0 and hence if c 0 the formula is valid for x b a c and if c 0 it is valid for x b a c the case c 0 is interpreted as the limit at c 0 for both distributions note that the gumbel distribution is a gev distribution with c 0 for a return period t the estimate of the return value x t is given by 35 x t b a ln ln 1 1 t if c 0 36 x t b a c 1 ln 1 1 t c if c 0

if and to what extend working on floating offshore wind turbines may be compromised due to extensive structural motion results show that weather windows for maintenance activities are reduced by up to 5 when adhering to guidelines suggesting limiting threshold values for acceleration exposure the corresponding potential financial losses materializing due to longer turbine unavailability after a fault are significant all the presented and discussed results underline the importance of considering motion criteria in the design phase of a new project a factor which is not included in design procedures today keywords floating offshore wind energy o m workability maintainability human exposure to motion whole body vibration 1 introduction the use of offshore wind energy resources is playing an increasingly important role in the development of a sustainable low emission future electricity supply corbetta et al 2015 conversion of the winds kinetic energy into electricity is done through a sequence of aerodynamic mechanical and electrical elements altogether referred to as a wind turbine wt burton et al 2011 the wt is mounted on a supporting structure comprised of a tower and a substructure either fixed to the seabed or kept in position by a mooring or tendon system wts installed in an offshore environment today rely mostly on proven substructure concepts predominantly comprised of monopiles jackets gravity based foundations or tripods the latter being applied in earlier wind farms lesny 2010 certain restrictions are limiting the application of those bottom fixed support structures the most important being the water depth at the individual site under consideration values of around 50 70 m set the upper economic feasibility limit for structures under development today cruz and atcheson 2016 fischer 2012 borisade and et al 2016 for sites located in deeper waters the application of floating substructure concepts is an alternative an area being elaborated on today in demonstrator and pre commercial projects the portfolio of concepts proposed is comprised of four floating substructure design classes fig 1 the main difference between these four design classes is their stabilization mechanism in the water i e how they achieve hydrostatic and hydrodynamic restoring generally the motion behaviour of all concepts is dependent on the individual design and based on trade offs between costs motion characteristics and many other factors in this section some general comments for each concept class and their typical motion characteristics are provided however this may significantly differ for individual designs the spar type structure is ballast stabilized this means that a relatively slender hollow structure is partly filled with a ballasting material in order to achieve a low centre of gravity below the centre of buoyancy and thus generate a counter moment to the heeling moment by the turbine thrust loading in operation typically spar substructures are rather insensitive to wave excitation due to their small waterplane area hydrodynamically transparent structure and exhibit relatively small motions the semi submersible is partly ballast and partly water plane area stabilized its motion behaviour is mainly governed by the column diameters their distances from each other the draft heave plates and its mass and inertia properties its motion characteristics can be adjusted by these parameters to match a desired behaviour typically they are designed such that the natural periods for the substructure rigid body motions are well above the spectral peak period of the waves leading to limited motions the barge concept is primarily water plane area stabilized a mechanism comparable to a ship the shallow draft generally leads to lower natural periods compared to a spar and semi submersible but still above the peak spectral wave period additionally barges may be equipped with features increasing the damping and reducing motions such as a moon pool or heave plates tension leg platforms tlps are tendon system stabilized with tensioned vertical synthetic steel wire or tubular steel tendons connected to anchors fixed to the seabed the tendons are under sufficiently high pre tension generated by the surplus buoyancy of the tlp hull cruz and atcheson 2016 to typically avoid slacking of the tendons under all conditions the natural periods of a tlp in pitch and roll are typically below the peak spectral wave period making them much stiffer systems with a dynamic behaviour similar to bottom fixed systems floating offshore wind turbine fowt systems show generally larger amplitude motions than bottom fixed structures understanding these motions is essential in order to be able to assess their potential implications towards safety human comfort and the general ability of technicians to perform works on the asset during maintenance works conducted by humans on the platform the wt rotor is in the parked position with blades pitched to reduce wind loading in this state the dynamic response of the fowt is predominantly excited by hydrodynamic loads whereas the dynamic response of fowts can generally be described as the interaction between the floating structure and its surrounding elements such as mooring lines or anchors on the one hand and the form and magnitude of hydrodynamic and aero servo elastic excitations on the other hand matha 2009 ongoing research activities in the field show a strong focus on enhancing the understanding of the structural response and dynamic behaviour of fowts in their various operating conditions the knowledge gained is subsequently used for the development of best practise design standards considering amongst others limiting motion criteria to be respected for operability of turbine components or loads acting on the substructure and its foundation as of today the research and development focus is only to a limited extent considering operations and maintenance o m of these structures some published works describing general floating wind specific o m implications are available santos et al 2016 brons illing 2015 other reports such as guanche et al 2016 and martini et al 2016 have investigated in detail the accessibility of the structures one major factor restricting o m activities in a marine environment however to the authors knowledge there is currently no study available addressing the potential implications that dynamic motion may have on personnel working on such structures this is assessed in the presented work 2 background 2 1 o m context the performance of operating assets may be evaluated based on several factors such as safety cost or availability the latter is a predominant measure of indicating the level of performance of offshore wind farms availability being defined as the ability to be in a state to perform as and when required under given conditions assuming that the necessary external resources are provided en 13306 2010 a high availability level is usually a primary objective in order to maximize revenues and yield a positive financial result availability depends on multiple factors that can be grouped into the three categories of reliability supportability and maintainability as briefly discussed below reliability defined as the ability of an item to perform a required function under given conditions for a given time interval en 13306 2010 in other words if an item were never to break reliability would be at 100 there is still significant uncertainty in offshore wind asset reliability as addressed in multiple publications faulstich et al 2011 tavner et al 2007 wilkinson et al 2010 carroll et al 2015 gintautas et al 2016 for context new offshore wind farms built today typically assume 95 availability in their service level agreements but actually achieve often 97 or more from the author s industry experience supportability defined as the ability of a maintenance organization to have the correct maintenance support at the necessary place to perform the required maintenance activity when required en 13306 2010 considering corrective operations this covers all activities which take place from occurrence of a fault until the actual repair or replacement activity is started with respect to the offshore wind industry supportability is to a large extent restricted by access limitations due to weather conditions but also the availability of suitable vessels and spare parts to carry out the maintenance activity nielsen and sørensen 2011 scheu et al 2012 irawan et al 2017 maintainability defined as the ability of an item under given conditions of use to be retained in or restored to a state in which it can perform a required function when maintenance is performed under given conditions and using stated procedures and resources en 13306 2010 in the offshore wind energy industry a good maintainability figure may be achieved by a modular design which allows for easy component replacements the basic mechanisms of reliability supportability and maintainability are illustrated below based on a simplified model valid for corrective maintenance activities in the field of bottom fixed offshore wind energy fig 2 taking a closer look into the supportability section it can be seen that one main part of it is the waiting time for the availability of required spare parts and vessels mobilization and logistics as well as a weather window being long enough to conduct all required tasks the following explanations are mostly related to restrictions related to a weather window the weather window required predominantly depends on the limits set for the vessel or helicopter accessing the asset and the type of repair or replacement required scheu et al 2012 there are three main means of transport used for accessing offshore wts today crew transport vessel ctv service operation vessel sov helicopter for ctvs and sovs the main criterion limiting access is the sea state ctvs operate up to significant wave heights of around 1 5 m sovs equipped with a motion compensated gangway enable personnel drop offs up to 4 5 m http www ampelmann nl systems https www siemens com stories cc en smooth service on the rough seas in other studies the sov type of vessel is referred to as a small accommodation vessel sav or mini daughter vessel sperstad and et al 2017 as per the author s best knowledge gained through extensive discussions with wind farm operators the highest significant wave height under which transfers to offshore wind turbines have been conducted to date is 3 5 m which has also been chosen as the upper feasibility level for all studies helicopters can operate independently from sea state conditions but are limited by wind speed visibility u s department of transportation 2012 and the motion of the floating structure with respect to the helicopter deck caap 92 4 0 2013 for the sake of simplification it is further distinguished between a major and a minor intervention activities involving large lifting operations such as a blade or transformer replacements are considered as major interventions small repairs not requiring large tools and cranes are considered as minor interventions major offshore lifts require regardless of acceptable sea state and visibility conditions more or less zero wind speed conditions as far as minor interventions are concerned it is usually assumed that a successful access manoeuvre guarantees a successful maintenance activity scheu et al 2012 even though it shall be noted that based on industry experience of the author and co authors this simplified assumption may be questioned in general however a failed activity would rather be related to an unsuccessful failure finding procedure missing tools or spare parts than to the influence that motions have on personnel working on the asset due to this observation the pure time of workable versus non workable conditions is assessed in this study independent of the respective task to be carried out this mechanism is indicatively illustrated below fig 3 a factor that has not specifically been addressed in research studies or other materials available to the public today is the way in which motion exposure may impact on personnel located on floating wind turbines whilst conducting maintenance works this is in the focus of the present paper and further discussed in the following sections 2 2 human response to vibration several reports address the impact that motion has on comfort but also on health and safety of personnel being exposed to such motion these effects are well described by griffin 1990 in his handbook of human vibration results of studies investigating general implications of exposure to motion maritime and coastguard agency 2009 classify effects into the following categories discomfort and adverse effects on performance general health and safety risk aggravation of pre existing injuries motion sickness low frequency motions mansfield 2005 suggests a classification of motions depending on their characteristics with respect to frequency and acceleration magnitude such a classification is required to understand which kind of phenomena might be relevant for a given case fig 4 presents an overall classification global motions experienced on floating offshore wts are typically located in the low frequency range below 1 hz this is an area in which nausea or sea motion sickness is relevant under certain conditions also when considering bottom fixed offshore wts the area around 1 hz may become important the respective phenomenon is the so called whole body vibration wbv higher frequency vibration may be experienced by personnel through hand transmitted vibration when using e g power tools during their works on the asset this study is focused on wbv and sea sickness and hand transmitted vibration is therefore not considered 2 3 assessment of motions there are several standards available today for assessing motions in different environments most relevant are the iso 2631 1 referred to in iso 2631 1 1997 and the iso 6897 referred to in iso 6897 1984 iso 2631 1 provides general guidance on assessing motions but provides limiting exposure values only for a frequency range of greater than 1 hz iso 6897 relies on the motion assessment in line with iso 2631 1 but provides more guidance on treating low frequency motion in the range of 0 063 hz 1 hz for measurement of motions root mean square r m s values are to be calculated with the following formula with x i representing the acceleration magnitude over n time steps it shall be noted that different standards require different frequency weighting and filtering techniques those have been applied during the post processing of the presented simulation studies however since the main results consider unweighted r m s values only further theoretical background of the band limiting low and high pass frequency filters acceleration velocity transition and upward step formulations are omitted in this paper for clarity please refer to iso 2631 1 for further details iso 2631 1 1997 1 r m s 1 n i 1 n x i 2 weighted means that those frequencies which are not relevant for the assessment are filtered out accelerations occurring during other more relevant frequencies are amplified iso 2631 1 suggests two methods for doing this method i the basic evaluation method relies on amplification factors to be applied at certain frequencies clause 6 in iso 2631 1 1997 method ii as described in annex a of the same standard relies on frequency weighting by parameterised transfer functions considering today s available computational capabilities the latter more advanced method can usually be applied it is chosen for all calculations presented in this paper for the analysis of the vibration behaviour over time a method from the railway industry described in bs en 12 299 bs en 12299 2009 suggests displaying the variation of the root mean square value over the time length of the signal the simulation or measuring time is divided into multiple small time windows for each window one r m s value is calculated caicedo et al 2012 use this method in the evaluation of the dynamics of civil structures and give suggestions regarding the length of the time windows the weighted r m s value shall subsequent to an on site measurement or the evaluation of a simulation time series be compared to exposure limit threshold levels those threshold limits suggest boundary conditions of personnel being exposed to certain specified conditions such as a maximum average acceleration over time iso 2631 1 suggests threshold values for frequencies above 1 hz as this is outside the expectable frequency range of the structures assessed in the present study those limits are not taken into consideration iso 6897 suggests threshold levels at different frequency acceleration combinations in this standard it is explicitly stated that floating offshore structures are not within the scope of the assessable working areas clause 1 2 note 3 whilst the procedures for measuring accelerations are well described it can be concluded that the guidance by standards for evaluating the impact of low frequency motions in terms of threshold values is very limited apart from the standard literature one publication from the nordic research collaboration nordforsk 1987 is used as a reference in several other studies this publication is practically oriented and presents limiting motion exposure criteria for different kinds of works on vessels it is amongst others referenced in buchner et al 2005 who present an assessment of the use of small tug boats for assisting liquefied natural gas carriers during berthing and departure operations smith and thomas 1989 refer to nordforsk in the course of a comparison study for motion criteria in naval missions dolinskaya et al 2009 assess ship route optimization under the consideration of operational constraints as referred to in nordforsk mathisen 2012 uses the nordforsk motion exposure limits to evaluate workability on a floating fish farm far offshore he further points out that currently used standards may be re thought when moving further off the shore due to their wide application and the comparable motion characteristics of vessels and fowts the motion criteria suggested by nordforsk have also been applied in the studies performed in the course of the present research project the values for un weighted r m s values are presented below table 1 the choice of an adequate limit value for the case of maintenance conditions depends on different factors and was made between the limits of intellectual work and transit passenger the intellectual work criterion from nordforsk originates from the long term tolerable limit value formulated by payne 1976 payne 1976 for work of a more demanding nature it is further described by the former iso 2631 3 1985 as reference value for half an hour exposure period for people unused to ship motions or for scientific personnel on ocean research vessels by hutchison and laible 1987 hutchison and laible 1987 this limit was taken into consideration because maintenance tasks failure finding inspections component exchange service place a high demand on the concentration and accuracy of the executing personnel to complete more complicated works however a workday offshore counts 12 h of which approximately 10 h are spent on wind turbines and 2 h on the transfer vessel depending on the distance to shore and the wind farm layout the fact that the intellectual work criterion applies to an half an hour exposure does from the author s perspective not reflect the reality adequately and does not sufficiently account for the importance of exposure duration for motion sickness as described by griffin 1990 and mansfield 2005 for this reason the transit passenger criterion was chosen because it is the close to the intellectual work criterion and according to the old iso 2631 3 1985 it applies to a two hours exposure period for people unused to ship motions the two hours do not meet the exposure time of maintenance personnel but are the longest period found within the nordforsk criteria this means that any situation in which the lateral acceleration is greater than 0 04 g the vertical acceleration is greater than 0 05 g or the roll inclination is greater than 2 5 is classified as non workable condition i e it is assumed that no works may be carried out in those conditions nordforsk draws the presented r m s limit values in table 1 from different sources the light manual work limit corresponds to the tolerable less than one hour criteria introduced by payne 1976 in 1976 and the intellectual work limit corresponds to the long term tolerable criteria respectively in his choice of motion criteria for naval vessels nordforsk does not emphasise the difference between frequency weighted and unweighted criteria as the iso 2631 1 iso 2631 1 1997 recommends applying a broad band filter on the acceleration time signal of the structure in order to reflect the human perception of motion the threshold values used to assess this signal also need to be weighted r m s acceleration values tracing back the thresholds of light manual work and intellectual work to payne 1976 showed that at least these two limit values are of unweighted nature no filter functions were thus applied on the resulting acceleration time signals in the main analysis of this paper 2 4 motion criteria and o m as described in the previous sections humans are limited in their ability to work in certain conditions if the conditions that a technician on a fowt is exposed to would not allow him or her to carry out works the downtime of the asset may increase it must be investigated whether or not the success criteria for offshore works assumed so far are still valid if technicians are exposed to significant motion limiting motion criteria are to be identified and assessed against expectable site conditions during maintenance works potentially identified motion criteria for work execution must be treated in the same way that weather windows are treated i e there may be times in which access is possible but the exposure to motion in the working area is unacceptable leading to an increased waiting time this mechanism is illustrated in fig 5 above the quantification of the delta in downtime highlighted with a grey background is the focus of the study documented in this paper a methodology for assessing this situation is suggested in the following sections it is followed by a presentation of results from simulation studies and their interpretation 3 methodology the following steps were undertaken through the application of the proposed methodology for workability assessment on floating offshore wind turbines further details of each step are provided below fig 6 step 1 encompasses the calculation of the geometric data of the wetted surface of the floating substructure under consideration i e a meshed surface geometry of the hull in the scope of this paper the substructure designs are pre defined and not specifically developed and designed for this study for more information on the design process reference is made to the design standard for fowt structures dnv os j103 2013 and its counterpart for bottom fixed applications dnvgl st 0126 2016 it shall be noted that the design for workability is currently not described in the referred standards in step 2 hydrodynamic parameters are calculated for the respective geometry file with a frequency domain boundary element potential flow based solver in this study the commercial wamit software is utilized to calculate first order wave force and motion transfer functions second order wave drift forces hydrostatic stiffness and radiation forces for the wetted area of the body these parameters describe the wave interactions with the floating platform in the frequency domain step 3 contains the simulation of the fowt under consideration this requires a definition of the environmental conditions in which the turbine will be operated and maintained as identified earlier the motion of the floater mainly depends on wave height and period under maintenance conditions in which the rotor is in a parked or idling position it is therefore appropriate to obtain the relevant information from hs tp scatter tables as usually available in a design basis document hs significant wave height tp wave peak period the structure is then in the aero servo hydro elastic simulation software exposed to the respective conditions for an interval of three hours plus ramp up time per sea state in order to let transients decay the simulation time of three hours is common practise in the offshore oil and gas industry and recommended by dnv rp c205 2007 and dnv rp h103 2011 for simulated irregular sea states the post processing is initiated in step 4 first the unfiltered acceleration time series of the full length of 11 100 s are extracted and prepared for subsequent analysis therefore the first 300 s are cut off and excluded from the post processing in order to minimize the effects of the initial simulation transients on the resulting load statistics accelerations are recorded in all six degrees of freedom of the floater movements illustrated generically for an arbitrary floating body in fig 7 below the accelerations in surge and sway directions are combined by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of both directions the resulting values describe the lateral displacement in space with the same procedure the roll and pitch rotational motions are combined into a resulting rotation yaw motions are not considered as their magnitudes are negligible under the investigated conditions heave motions are used as a direct single signal and they are not combined with other signals for processing the following formulas describe the ways in which lateral and rotational acceleration signals were combined 2 a l a t t a s w a y t 2 a s u r g e t 2 3 r r o t t r r o l l t 2 r p i t c h t 2 in step 5 the evaluation of acceleration profiles is split into different aspects three aspects are considered here namely general motion criteria motion sickness and whole body vibration for further details refer to section 2 2 each of the different phenomena is explained in steps 6 to 8 the assessment in step 6 is related to general motion criteria the assessment is following the methods presented in iso 2631 1 1997 i e calculating unweighted r m s values of the different acceleration components the time series of the acceleration signals are divided into bins of a fixed duration and a r m s acceleration value is calculated for each bin this method is known from railway applications and it allows an evaluation of the r m s accelerations along the route and to assign the values to their corresponding track section bs en 12299 2009 for the given problem it is of interest to observe the changes in the accelerations during the simulation time as a sensitivity study the bin size has been varied between 1 min 5 min 10 min and 20 min to observe how the length of the interval changes the r m s values of the peaks in each bin the recorded time step of the simulation should be at least four times the frequency of interest for the given problem frequencies are in a range up to around 0 5 hz therefore a minimum sampling frequency of 2 hz or 0 5 s is chosen fig 8 the acceleration r m s values are calculated for each exposure direction of interest within each bin the bin size represents the acceptance criterion for exposure time of a technician being located in the working area an exposure time of for instance one min means that one r m s value is calculated for each minute of the simulation the workability index changes with the bin size chosen the parameter must therefore be treated with care based on the studies referred to in section 2 3 a bin size of 10 min has been chosen caicedo et al 2012 a sensitivity analysis of different bin sizes has also been carried out in order to illustrate the effects within each bin the r m s value is calculated depending on the assessment method it is calculated either weighted or unweighted similarly to steps 7 and 8 as described below a histogram is produced based on the results it encompasses the expectable range and frequency of acceleration magnitudes during specific hs tp combinations for every direction lateral vertical and rotational the r m s values are compared to their specific r m s acceleration limits the percentage of occurrences outside the given limit values is denoted as a non workable condition the fraction of time in which the respective limiting motion exposure threshold is not exceeded is further denoted as the workability index wi 4 w i w o r k a b l e t i m e t o t a l d u r a t i o n the individual wis from the different directions are multiplied and provide the wi of the specific hs tp combination the wi is calculated for each point in the hs tp table of interest for a given site this process is illustrated below fig 9 for the further assessment the wis are related to time series in order to account for the number of occurrences of certain hs tp combinations the average wi is calculated from all individual wis time steps in which access is not given are excluded for this assessment in the example below the wave height boundary for access has been set to 2 m h table 2 step 7 and step 8 are conducted similarly to step 6 but with the main difference that the acceleration signal is filtered before assessing its properties the filtering is done in accordance with iso 2631 1 digital method per appendix a as referred to in iso 2631 1 1997 4 application and results the methodology suggested above has been applied in several case studies representing the technological state of the art the meteorological data is derived from the applications described in the lifes50 project as referred to in iberdrola ingeniería y construcción 2015 it encompasses the following sites shown in fig 10 the description of the 10 mw reference turbine used can be found in deliverable d3 2 2016 the detailed specifications of the spar concept can be found in the public report xue 2016 an in house developed 3 legged tension leg platform has been developed on the basis of wehmeyer wehmeyer et al 2015 and the publicly available definition by bachynski 2014 a simplified semi submersible concept from the developer olav olsen has been applied university of stuttgart 2018 as well as an in house conceptual design of a barge concept with the wt mounted on a centrally located transition piece the simulations of the four concepts were performed with a coupled aero servo hydro elastic simulation software sima which has an integrated simulation workbench for advanced analyses of marine operations and floating systems for the semi submersible the tlp and the spar concept riflex simo models are used which are based on a nonlinear finite element formulation and comprise an elastic tower the mooring systems in sima of the three concepts are represented by a dynamic mooring system model providing a sufficiently accurate behaviour of the mooring loads in the time domain the floater of the tlp and the semi submersible are elastic models the substructure of the spar is a rigid model from xue 2016 the program evaluates the motion response of these concepts through hydrodynamic parameters which are created by a wamit simulation all accelerations and rotations which are the basis of the results presented in this report have been calculated for the nacelle of the 10 mw wt mounted on the substructures sima is a proven software well tested in the oil and gas and offshore wind industry the accuracy of its hydrodynamic module has been validated in numerous benchmark studies and wave tank campaigns the aerodynamic forces on the blades tower nacelle and wind exposed parts of the substructure are neglected in this study because they are considered minor compared to the wave induced loads the blade pitch and generator torque controller is inactive in the simulations as the turbine is in locked mode in contrast to the other three substructures where the hydrodynamic coefficients are directly computed with wamit using the hull geometry files due to the lack of geometric data availability the barge model is based on response amplitude operators raos which have been linearised for typical sea states the mass of the tower and turbine are included in the raos the mooring line behaviour is not included their impact on the 1st order motions however is very low the raos for the pitch and roll motion are very sensitive to the exciting wave amplitude so that for predicted rotations above five degrees the sea state is out of range of applicability for the raos responses exceeding this limit have been excluded from the analysis the four different structures used are in the following denoted as design a design b design c and design d the focus of this paper is not to compare different substructure typologies but to suggest a procedure applicable to any type of structure and to determine the ranges of results which are to be expected for fowts it shall in that respect be noted that all results shown are based on models that have been provided by different developers making the results representative of the whole range of floating wind substructure classes all accelerations shown in this study are representing motion at the hub height of the turbine for all structures investigated this is the point at which the highest motion amplitude would be experienced and most of the maintenance tasks on a wind turbine are executed in the nacelle which is in close vicinity of the wind turbine hub other points may be of interest such as the tower base or a location within the floater the principles shown in this paper may be applied likewise to such 4 1 accessibility a number of different workability scenarios have been assessed in the course of this study for those it is required to determine accessibility at different sea states it is assumed here that access solely depends on the sea state in terms of the significant wave height i e a vessel approach is expected to be successful if the wave height during access lies below its upper threshold level as indicated in section 2 1 access of floating structures may also be restricted by other factors particularly the combination of wave height and frequency as further assessed in martini et al 2016 however the predominant restrictor is wave height and it is therefore considered an appropriate choice for assessing the given problem accessibility is further defined as the fraction of time in which an asset is accessible the respective values for different wave height boundary levels are shown in fig 11 below for all three sites under consideration it can clearly be seen that accessibility increases significantly with an increasing wave height boundary restriction furthermore it can be observed that accessibility varies considerably between the different sites this factor has a great impact on the o m strategy an area which is subject to various research but not in the focus of this study in the further assessment workability is always treated under consideration of the single access restrictions as described above 4 2 characterization of motion in the following acceleration magnitude frequency spectra are shown in order to classify typical motion characteristics of different fowt systems in accordance with mansfield s mansfield 2005 categories fig 4 the graphs shown in fig 12 contain accelerations weighted with the motion sickness weighting curve according to iso 2631 1 iso 2631 1 1997 the represented frequency spectra show the superposed spectra of the individual sea states up to a wave height of 3 5 m h the regarded sea states are the hs tp combinations which show for at least one of the three sites under consideration an occurrence rate greater than zero for lower limit wave heights below 3 5 m the shape of the frequency spectra is comparable to those shown here the magnitude of acceleration is lower the limit wave height can be chosen such that it represents the limiting significant wave height for the boat access of the platform it is noticeable that all expectable motions in the low frequency area are dominated by the motion sickness condition shown in fig 13 for this reason the iso 6897 is tested as the assessment standard despite its limitation to fixed offshore structures iso 6897 1984 4 3 assessment against iso 6897 fig 14 shows the threshold values suggested by iso 6897 iso 6897 1984 all expected horizontal motions during maintenance conditions are highlighted in grey and summarized from the four lateral frequency spectra of fig 12 the marked area represents the frequency motion response of the four concepts in the relevant sea states of the three reference locations it can be seen that all expectable motions are below the upper limit values for bottom fixed offshore structures the accelerations of the investigated concepts surpass however the average threshold and enter the area of perception of horizontal motion for humans even though this standard is excluding floating structures it is deemed a valid exercise to investigate the motion profile against it as there is little guidance for floating structures 4 4 assessment against nordforsk this case study covers the use of unweighted signals and the boundary conditions suggested by nordforsk 1987 i e step 6 of the variants presented in fig 6 the threshold level has for the present case been set to transit passenger see table 1 workability is expressed by the average workability index wi per site and structure and provided at different access wave height restrictions fig 15 design c only shows very limited motion above the threshold suggested in nordforsk 1987 design a b and d show under some conditions a wi below 1 the workability index varies to a large extent with an increasing access wave height boundary interestingly for the site in scotland design b shows an increasing wi at higher wave height access restriction this is due to the fact that the rarely occurring low sea states are causing unfavourable motions considering this design design d is performing better at lower sea states workability on this structure is slightly reduced at higher sea states from 2 m h onwards but as for design b workability is particularly bad during low sea states around 1 5 m which is the today most common access limit for ctvs in contrast to asset accessibility motion criteria play a role for o m activities during low as well as during higher sea states this finding is clearly counter intuitive as one may assume that working conditions are worse during high compared to low wave conditions the reason for this finding lies in the dynamic response of the floating structure which is not solely relying on wave heights but on a combination of all external influencing factors such as wind speed and turbulence intensity wave periods and direction current velocity profile and direction and other factors such as the accumulation of marine growth or ice formations consideration of these parameters is required in order to perform a solid motion assessment it shall be noted that the vast majority of non workable conditions is caused by translational accelerations rotational limits are exceeded in less than 5 of the cases 4 5 assessment of maxima against nordforsk the assessment described in section 4 4 has been repeated using a more conservative assumption for this not all accelerations occurring during a certain condition have been treated equally here more emphasis was given to local acceleration maxima a comparable approach has been presented by boggs 1997 the approach relies on assessing motions based on peak to peak maxima observed during a certain time interval applying this method would lead to very large accelerations which are from the author s perspective based on own experience and conversations with offshore technicians deemed to not adequately represent the circumstances during works on offshore wind turbines boggs 1997 supports the theory that a person is affected most by the largest individual peak cycles and tends to forget about lesser cycles further it is stated by cheung cheung and nakashima 2006 that vertical motions in a frequency range between 0 167 and 0 5 hz with higher magnitude provoke vomiting earlier than motions with a low magnitude here he refers to mccauley et al mccauley 1976 cheung further states that little is known about the effects of lateral oscillations except that severe translational oscillations for short vibration cycles can easily provoke vomiting to a person who has already succumbed to motion sickness considering the above the authors suggest to calculate the r m s values of maxima during specific time intervals the resulting values are not as high as peak to peak values but emphasise actually occurring peak accelerations more than the traditional r m s method this method is novel and should be supported by lab and or field testing campaigns in order to evaluate applicability further this is done for several time intervals in accordance with the assessment presented in section 4 6 absolute values are assessed in order to account for negative peaks the procedure is illustrated below in order to ease understanding fig 16 the impact of motions has been investigated similarly to the procedure applied in section 4 4 the corresponding workability indices for the different designs at the different sites are shown in fig 17 it can clearly be seen that the workability is affected on all structures and at all sites considering the amended r m s method just as before it is shown that workability and accessibility need to be treated with care i e it is not a given fact that workability is becoming worse during harsher conditions the response of the floater may show larger accelerations during lower sea states if the excitation happens at a frequency closer to the floaters natural frequency as described above this means that working conditions must be evaluated by considering all factors that potentially affect the dynamic response of the floater 4 6 influence of bin sizes as described in section 3 it is of high importance to set the acceptance criteria for the exposure time to the desired level this is expressed by the exposure duration resolution it represents the lower time limit from which the exposure to certain conditions is deemed relevant literature suggests using acceleration r m s values in bins of 10 min caicedo et al 2012 higher bin sizes can underestimate the peak values though the averaging effects of the r m s the sensitivity of the wi value and its spread is illustrated in fig 18 the figure shows all calculated wis all sites and floater concepts at different exposure time bin sizes using the traditional r m s calculation method the vertical axis represents the workability index and four different exposure duration resolutions are plotted on the horizontal axis 1 min 5 min 10 min 20 min the boxes frame the edges of the 25th and 75th percentiles and the central line in each box represents the median of the values obtained the whiskers are reaching out to the extreme values lowest and highest in each series and outliers are marked with a as per matlab standard data points are considered outliers if they are greater than q 3 w q 3 q 1 or less than q 1 w q 3 q 1 with w representing the maximum whisker length q 1 the 25th percentile and q 3 the 75th percentile matlab 2018a 2017 the wi is increasing by increasing the exposure duration the spread of wis decreases at greater magnitude this phenomenon has been observed throughout all sites and floater concepts similarly so that results can be shown in one figure the reason for an increasing wi with higher exposure duration resolutions can be explained by reflecting the way the index is calculated it represents the fracture of time during which the conditions on the assets allow for works to be conducted i e if the wi is zero no works are possible to be carried out considering the respective threshold level applied this is illustrated in fig 19 below the same threshold level is applied to the same acceleration time signal a shorter bin size is chosen for the figure on the left and a longer duration on the right side in the left figure the workability threshold level is exceeded during two time intervals leading to a wi of 0 75 when considering that the complete time series consists of eight segments on the right hand side a sufficient contribution of low accelerations are counteracting to the ones above the threshold so that the overall wi is one the impact of single short term phenomena is balanced out this also explains why the spread of results is decreasing for increasing wis the workability on all floaters is increasing with increasing bin size it converges to one if for instance a whole year of measurement data would be used as one single bin the wi would be one for all sites under consideration for a 20 min exposure duration resolution almost all structures would exceed the threshold only in a very limited amount of cases the respective outliers can be explained by the time shift that prevails when applying different bin sizes i e fig 18 reflects the overall trend with some exceptions due to the slightly different intervals assessed against the threshold criteria 5 conclusions the studies presented in this paper address an area which is of increasing importance to floating offshore wind developers operators financers insurers service providers and other stakeholders it addresses the safety and well being of the technicians working in the harsh offshore environment every day considering floating offshore wind technology one can easily imagine which motions technicians may be exposed to during rough sea states modern access technology such as motion compensated gangways allow for higher and higher waves during the personnel transfer to the structure as the first of its kind this paper presents a methodology to assess the influence of those motions on humans being located on the asset during maintenance activities the methodology suggested includes procedures described in international standards as well as practical books it is shown that the low frequency motion which is the predominant motion characteristic of floating wind assets is not covered in the required detail the vast majority of available literature addresses motions in frequency ranges above 1 hz the assets considered here are operating in a range up to 0 5 hz the lack of guidance by standards has led to the application of practical recommendations which have been applied in the ship fish farming military and other naval industries additionally it shall be noted that the proneness to sea sickness and other motion related responses by the human body are highly subjective whilst some technicians are able to work under highly severe conditions others may get sick already during low sea states only a large scale lab test or site investigation is considered appropriate in order to diminish this subjectivity aside of medical implications such a study could also investigate effects of motion exposure with respect to the duration and quality of maintenance tasks carried out under different conditions as well as the impact of duration and sequence of threshold exceeding situations on the respective results results show that the motion exposure limiting values applied for the assessment of the working environment during maintenance activities has an impact on the time in which those activities may be carried out the waiting time for a weather window may increase under certain sea states due to critical conditions for human comfort by that this paper suggests that the pure assumption of a successful completion of a maintenance task once access is enabled is not applicable for modern large scale floating offshore wind turbines in numbers up to 5 of the time in which an asset is accessible it should be noted that depending on the design this applies for wave heights between 1 5 m h and 3 5 m h accelerations are in a range which are unacceptable for technicians to carry out their work the potential production losses due to this situation are significant considering large offshore wind farms if more conservative assessment methodologies are applied those numbers increase accordingly for future work it is suggested that potential losses associated to the factor of workability are quantified more accurately considering different wind turbine sizes and park layouts a fundamental finding of this study is that workability is not necessarily becoming worse at higher sea states the response of the floater leading to high accelerations may even be more significant in low wave height and low frequency wave states during all sea states the exceedance of translational acceleration threshold values is predominant rotational accelerations are causing non workable conditions in less than 5 of all cases under the conditions studied all described phenomena lead to the recommendation that already in the design stage of a new project the influence of human comfort criteria must be taken into consideration the factors influencing workability are aside from the environmental conditions the structural design and more specifically the eigenfrequencies of the floating offshore wind turbine system the methodology suggested in this paper helps to assess how significant the influence of motion may be on o m activities acknowledgements this project has received funding from the european

23152,working on floating offshore wind turbines is a complex operation an important factor is the influence that the structural motion has on humans located on the asset in a harsh environment during maintenance activities and its implications towards personal safety human comfort and the ability to work for the research presented in this paper extensive simulation studies were conducted to assess if and to what extend working on floating offshore wind turbines may be compromised due to extensive structural motion results show that weather windows for maintenance activities are reduced by up to 5 when adhering to guidelines suggesting limiting threshold values for acceleration exposure the corresponding potential financial losses materializing due to longer turbine unavailability after a fault are significant all the presented and discussed results underline the importance of considering motion criteria in the design phase of a new project a factor which is not included in design procedures today keywords floating offshore wind energy o m workability maintainability human exposure to motion whole body vibration 1 introduction the use of offshore wind energy resources is playing an increasingly important role in the development of a sustainable low emission future electricity supply corbetta et al 2015 conversion of the winds kinetic energy into electricity is done through a sequence of aerodynamic mechanical and electrical elements altogether referred to as a wind turbine wt burton et al 2011 the wt is mounted on a supporting structure comprised of a tower and a substructure either fixed to the seabed or kept in position by a mooring or tendon system wts installed in an offshore environment today rely mostly on proven substructure concepts predominantly comprised of monopiles jackets gravity based foundations or tripods the latter being applied in earlier wind farms lesny 2010 certain restrictions are limiting the application of those bottom fixed support structures the most important being the water depth at the individual site under consideration values of around 50 70 m set the upper economic feasibility limit for structures under development today cruz and atcheson 2016 fischer 2012 borisade and et al 2016 for sites located in deeper waters the application of floating substructure concepts is an alternative an area being elaborated on today in demonstrator and pre commercial projects the portfolio of concepts proposed is comprised of four floating substructure design classes fig 1 the main difference between these four design classes is their stabilization mechanism in the water i e how they achieve hydrostatic and hydrodynamic restoring generally the motion behaviour of all concepts is dependent on the individual design and based on trade offs between costs motion characteristics and many other factors in this section some general comments for each concept class and their typical motion characteristics are provided however this may significantly differ for individual designs the spar type structure is ballast stabilized this means that a relatively slender hollow structure is partly filled with a ballasting material in order to achieve a low centre of gravity below the centre of buoyancy and thus generate a counter moment to the heeling moment by the turbine thrust loading in operation typically spar substructures are rather insensitive to wave excitation due to their small waterplane area hydrodynamically transparent structure and exhibit relatively small motions the semi submersible is partly ballast and partly water plane area stabilized its motion behaviour is mainly governed by the column diameters their distances from each other the draft heave plates and its mass and inertia properties its motion characteristics can be adjusted by these parameters to match a desired behaviour typically they are designed such that the natural periods for the substructure rigid body motions are well above the spectral peak period of the waves leading to limited motions the barge concept is primarily water plane area stabilized a mechanism comparable to a ship the shallow draft generally leads to lower natural periods compared to a spar and semi submersible but still above the peak spectral wave period additionally barges may be equipped with features increasing the damping and reducing motions such as a moon pool or heave plates tension leg platforms tlps are tendon system stabilized with tensioned vertical synthetic steel wire or tubular steel tendons connected to anchors fixed to the seabed the tendons are under sufficiently high pre tension generated by the surplus buoyancy of the tlp hull cruz and atcheson 2016 to typically avoid slacking of the tendons under all conditions the natural periods of a tlp in pitch and roll are typically below the peak spectral wave period making them much stiffer systems with a dynamic behaviour similar to bottom fixed systems floating offshore wind turbine fowt systems show generally larger amplitude motions than bottom fixed structures understanding these motions is essential in order to be able to assess their potential implications towards safety human comfort and the general ability of technicians to perform works on the asset during maintenance works conducted by humans on the platform the wt rotor is in the parked position with blades pitched to reduce wind loading in this state the dynamic response of the fowt is predominantly excited by hydrodynamic loads whereas the dynamic response of fowts can generally be described as the interaction between the floating structure and its surrounding elements such as mooring lines or anchors on the one hand and the form and magnitude of hydrodynamic and aero servo elastic excitations on the other hand matha 2009 ongoing research activities in the field show a strong focus on enhancing the understanding of the structural response and dynamic behaviour of fowts in their various operating conditions the knowledge gained is subsequently used for the development of best practise design standards considering amongst others limiting motion criteria to be respected for operability of turbine components or loads acting on the substructure and its foundation as of today the research and development focus is only to a limited extent considering operations and maintenance o m of these structures some published works describing general floating wind specific o m implications are available santos et al 2016 brons illing 2015 other reports such as guanche et al 2016 and martini et al 2016 have investigated in detail the accessibility of the structures one major factor restricting o m activities in a marine environment however to the authors knowledge there is currently no study available addressing the potential implications that dynamic motion may have on personnel working on such structures this is assessed in the presented work 2 background 2 1 o m context the performance of operating assets may be evaluated based on several factors such as safety cost or availability the latter is a predominant measure of indicating the level of performance of offshore wind farms availability being defined as the ability to be in a state to perform as and when required under given conditions assuming that the necessary external resources are provided en 13306 2010 a high availability level is usually a primary objective in order to maximize revenues and yield a positive financial result availability depends on multiple factors that can be grouped into the three categories of reliability supportability and maintainability as briefly discussed below reliability defined as the ability of an item to perform a required function under given conditions for a given time interval en 13306 2010 in other words if an item were never to break reliability would be at 100 there is still significant uncertainty in offshore wind asset reliability as addressed in multiple publications faulstich et al 2011 tavner et al 2007 wilkinson et al 2010 carroll et al 2015 gintautas et al 2016 for context new offshore wind farms built today typically assume 95 availability in their service level agreements but actually achieve often 97 or more from the author s industry experience supportability defined as the ability of a maintenance organization to have the correct maintenance support at the necessary place to perform the required maintenance activity when required en 13306 2010 considering corrective operations this covers all activities which take place from occurrence of a fault until the actual repair or replacement activity is started with respect to the offshore wind industry supportability is to a large extent restricted by access limitations due to weather conditions but also the availability of suitable vessels and spare parts to carry out the maintenance activity nielsen and sørensen 2011 scheu et al 2012 irawan et al 2017 maintainability defined as the ability of an item under given conditions of use to be retained in or restored to a state in which it can perform a required function when maintenance is performed under given conditions and using stated procedures and resources en 13306 2010 in the offshore wind energy industry a good maintainability figure may be achieved by a modular design which allows for easy component replacements the basic mechanisms of reliability supportability and maintainability are illustrated below based on a simplified model valid for corrective maintenance activities in the field of bottom fixed offshore wind energy fig 2 taking a closer look into the supportability section it can be seen that one main part of it is the waiting time for the availability of required spare parts and vessels mobilization and logistics as well as a weather window being long enough to conduct all required tasks the following explanations are mostly related to restrictions related to a weather window the weather window required predominantly depends on the limits set for the vessel or helicopter accessing the asset and the type of repair or replacement required scheu et al 2012 there are three main means of transport used for accessing offshore wts today crew transport vessel ctv service operation vessel sov helicopter for ctvs and sovs the main criterion limiting access is the sea state ctvs operate up to significant wave heights of around 1 5 m sovs equipped with a motion compensated gangway enable personnel drop offs up to 4 5 m http www ampelmann nl systems https www siemens com stories cc en smooth service on the rough seas in other studies the sov type of vessel is referred to as a small accommodation vessel sav or mini daughter vessel sperstad and et al 2017 as per the author s best knowledge gained through extensive discussions with wind farm operators the highest significant wave height under which transfers to offshore wind turbines have been conducted to date is 3 5 m which has also been chosen as the upper feasibility level for all studies helicopters can operate independently from sea state conditions but are limited by wind speed visibility u s department of transportation 2012 and the motion of the floating structure with respect to the helicopter deck caap 92 4 0 2013 for the sake of simplification it is further distinguished between a major and a minor intervention activities involving large lifting operations such as a blade or transformer replacements are considered as major interventions small repairs not requiring large tools and cranes are considered as minor interventions major offshore lifts require regardless of acceptable sea state and visibility conditions more or less zero wind speed conditions as far as minor interventions are concerned it is usually assumed that a successful access manoeuvre guarantees a successful maintenance activity scheu et al 2012 even though it shall be noted that based on industry experience of the author and co authors this simplified assumption may be questioned in general however a failed activity would rather be related to an unsuccessful failure finding procedure missing tools or spare parts than to the influence that motions have on personnel working on the asset due to this observation the pure time of workable versus non workable conditions is assessed in this study independent of the respective task to be carried out this mechanism is indicatively illustrated below fig 3 a factor that has not specifically been addressed in research studies or other materials available to the public today is the way in which motion exposure may impact on personnel located on floating wind turbines whilst conducting maintenance works this is in the focus of the present paper and further discussed in the following sections 2 2 human response to vibration several reports address the impact that motion has on comfort but also on health and safety of personnel being exposed to such motion these effects are well described by griffin 1990 in his handbook of human vibration results of studies investigating general implications of exposure to motion maritime and coastguard agency 2009 classify effects into the following categories discomfort and adverse effects on performance general health and safety risk aggravation of pre existing injuries motion sickness low frequency motions mansfield 2005 suggests a classification of motions depending on their characteristics with respect to frequency and acceleration magnitude such a classification is required to understand which kind of phenomena might be relevant for a given case fig 4 presents an overall classification global motions experienced on floating offshore wts are typically located in the low frequency range below 1 hz this is an area in which nausea or sea motion sickness is relevant under certain conditions also when considering bottom fixed offshore wts the area around 1 hz may become important the respective phenomenon is the so called whole body vibration wbv higher frequency vibration may be experienced by personnel through hand transmitted vibration when using e g power tools during their works on the asset this study is focused on wbv and sea sickness and hand transmitted vibration is therefore not considered 2 3 assessment of motions there are several standards available today for assessing motions in different environments most relevant are the iso 2631 1 referred to in iso 2631 1 1997 and the iso 6897 referred to in iso 6897 1984 iso 2631 1 provides general guidance on assessing motions but provides limiting exposure values only for a frequency range of greater than 1 hz iso 6897 relies on the motion assessment in line with iso 2631 1 but provides more guidance on treating low frequency motion in the range of 0 063 hz 1 hz for measurement of motions root mean square r m s values are to be calculated with the following formula with x i representing the acceleration magnitude over n time steps it shall be noted that different standards require different frequency weighting and filtering techniques those have been applied during the post processing of the presented simulation studies however since the main results consider unweighted r m s values only further theoretical background of the band limiting low and high pass frequency filters acceleration velocity transition and upward step formulations are omitted in this paper for clarity please refer to iso 2631 1 for further details iso 2631 1 1997 1 r m s 1 n i 1 n x i 2 weighted means that those frequencies which are not relevant for the assessment are filtered out accelerations occurring during other more relevant frequencies are amplified iso 2631 1 suggests two methods for doing this method i the basic evaluation method relies on amplification factors to be applied at certain frequencies clause 6 in iso 2631 1 1997 method ii as described in annex a of the same standard relies on frequency weighting by parameterised transfer functions considering today s available computational capabilities the latter more advanced method can usually be applied it is chosen for all calculations presented in this paper for the analysis of the vibration behaviour over time a method from the railway industry described in bs en 12 299 bs en 12299 2009 suggests displaying the variation of the root mean square value over the time length of the signal the simulation or measuring time is divided into multiple small time windows for each window one r m s value is calculated caicedo et al 2012 use this method in the evaluation of the dynamics of civil structures and give suggestions regarding the length of the time windows the weighted r m s value shall subsequent to an on site measurement or the evaluation of a simulation time series be compared to exposure limit threshold levels those threshold limits suggest boundary conditions of personnel being exposed to certain specified conditions such as a maximum average acceleration over time iso 2631 1 suggests threshold values for frequencies above 1 hz as this is outside the expectable frequency range of the structures assessed in the present study those limits are not taken into consideration iso 6897 suggests threshold levels at different frequency acceleration combinations in this standard it is explicitly stated that floating offshore structures are not within the scope of the assessable working areas clause 1 2 note 3 whilst the procedures for measuring accelerations are well described it can be concluded that the guidance by standards for evaluating the impact of low frequency motions in terms of threshold values is very limited apart from the standard literature one publication from the nordic research collaboration nordforsk 1987 is used as a reference in several other studies this publication is practically oriented and presents limiting motion exposure criteria for different kinds of works on vessels it is amongst others referenced in buchner et al 2005 who present an assessment of the use of small tug boats for assisting liquefied natural gas carriers during berthing and departure operations smith and thomas 1989 refer to nordforsk in the course of a comparison study for motion criteria in naval missions dolinskaya et al 2009 assess ship route optimization under the consideration of operational constraints as referred to in nordforsk mathisen 2012 uses the nordforsk motion exposure limits to evaluate workability on a floating fish farm far offshore he further points out that currently used standards may be re thought when moving further off the shore due to their wide application and the comparable motion characteristics of vessels and fowts the motion criteria suggested by nordforsk have also been applied in the studies performed in the course of the present research project the values for un weighted r m s values are presented below table 1 the choice of an adequate limit value for the case of maintenance conditions depends on different factors and was made between the limits of intellectual work and transit passenger the intellectual work criterion from nordforsk originates from the long term tolerable limit value formulated by payne 1976 payne 1976 for work of a more demanding nature it is further described by the former iso 2631 3 1985 as reference value for half an hour exposure period for people unused to ship motions or for scientific personnel on ocean research vessels by hutchison and laible 1987 hutchison and laible 1987 this limit was taken into consideration because maintenance tasks failure finding inspections component exchange service place a high demand on the concentration and accuracy of the executing personnel to complete more complicated works however a workday offshore counts 12 h of which approximately 10 h are spent on wind turbines and 2 h on the transfer vessel depending on the distance to shore and the wind farm layout the fact that the intellectual work criterion applies to an half an hour exposure does from the author s perspective not reflect the reality adequately and does not sufficiently account for the importance of exposure duration for motion sickness as described by griffin 1990 and mansfield 2005 for this reason the transit passenger criterion was chosen because it is the close to the intellectual work criterion and according to the old iso 2631 3 1985 it applies to a two hours exposure period for people unused to ship motions the two hours do not meet the exposure time of maintenance personnel but are the longest period found within the nordforsk criteria this means that any situation in which the lateral acceleration is greater than 0 04 g the vertical acceleration is greater than 0 05 g or the roll inclination is greater than 2 5 is classified as non workable condition i e it is assumed that no works may be carried out in those conditions nordforsk draws the presented r m s limit values in table 1 from different sources the light manual work limit corresponds to the tolerable less than one hour criteria introduced by payne 1976 in 1976 and the intellectual work limit corresponds to the long term tolerable criteria respectively in his choice of motion criteria for naval vessels nordforsk does not emphasise the difference between frequency weighted and unweighted criteria as the iso 2631 1 iso 2631 1 1997 recommends applying a broad band filter on the acceleration time signal of the structure in order to reflect the human perception of motion the threshold values used to assess this signal also need to be weighted r m s acceleration values tracing back the thresholds of light manual work and intellectual work to payne 1976 showed that at least these two limit values are of unweighted nature no filter functions were thus applied on the resulting acceleration time signals in the main analysis of this paper 2 4 motion criteria and o m as described in the previous sections humans are limited in their ability to work in certain conditions if the conditions that a technician on a fowt is exposed to would not allow him or her to carry out works the downtime of the asset may increase it must be investigated whether or not the success criteria for offshore works assumed so far are still valid if technicians are exposed to significant motion limiting motion criteria are to be identified and assessed against expectable site conditions during maintenance works potentially identified motion criteria for work execution must be treated in the same way that weather windows are treated i e there may be times in which access is possible but the exposure to motion in the working area is unacceptable leading to an increased waiting time this mechanism is illustrated in fig 5 above the quantification of the delta in downtime highlighted with a grey background is the focus of the study documented in this paper a methodology for assessing this situation is suggested in the following sections it is followed by a presentation of results from simulation studies and their interpretation 3 methodology the following steps were undertaken through the application of the proposed methodology for workability assessment on floating offshore wind turbines further details of each step are provided below fig 6 step 1 encompasses the calculation of the geometric data of the wetted surface of the floating substructure under consideration i e a meshed surface geometry of the hull in the scope of this paper the substructure designs are pre defined and not specifically developed and designed for this study for more information on the design process reference is made to the design standard for fowt structures dnv os j103 2013 and its counterpart for bottom fixed applications dnvgl st 0126 2016 it shall be noted that the design for workability is currently not described in the referred standards in step 2 hydrodynamic parameters are calculated for the respective geometry file with a frequency domain boundary element potential flow based solver in this study the commercial wamit software is utilized to calculate first order wave force and motion transfer functions second order wave drift forces hydrostatic stiffness and radiation forces for the wetted area of the body these parameters describe the wave interactions with the floating platform in the frequency domain step 3 contains the simulation of the fowt under consideration this requires a definition of the environmental conditions in which the turbine will be operated and maintained as identified earlier the motion of the floater mainly depends on wave height and period under maintenance conditions in which the rotor is in a parked or idling position it is therefore appropriate to obtain the relevant information from hs tp scatter tables as usually available in a design basis document hs significant wave height tp wave peak period the structure is then in the aero servo hydro elastic simulation software exposed to the respective conditions for an interval of three hours plus ramp up time per sea state in order to let transients decay the simulation time of three hours is common practise in the offshore oil and gas industry and recommended by dnv rp c205 2007 and dnv rp h103 2011 for simulated irregular sea states the post processing is initiated in step 4 first the unfiltered acceleration time series of the full length of 11 100 s are extracted and prepared for subsequent analysis therefore the first 300 s are cut off and excluded from the post processing in order to minimize the effects of the initial simulation transients on the resulting load statistics accelerations are recorded in all six degrees of freedom of the floater movements illustrated generically for an arbitrary floating body in fig 7 below the accelerations in surge and sway directions are combined by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of both directions the resulting values describe the lateral displacement in space with the same procedure the roll and pitch rotational motions are combined into a resulting rotation yaw motions are not considered as their magnitudes are negligible under the investigated conditions heave motions are used as a direct single signal and they are not combined with other signals for processing the following formulas describe the ways in which lateral and rotational acceleration signals were combined 2 a l a t t a s w a y t 2 a s u r g e t 2 3 r r o t t r r o l l t 2 r p i t c h t 2 in step 5 the evaluation of acceleration profiles is split into different aspects three aspects are considered here namely general motion criteria motion sickness and whole body vibration for further details refer to section 2 2 each of the different phenomena is explained in steps 6 to 8 the assessment in step 6 is related to general motion criteria the assessment is following the methods presented in iso 2631 1 1997 i e calculating unweighted r m s values of the different acceleration components the time series of the acceleration signals are divided into bins of a fixed duration and a r m s acceleration value is calculated for each bin this method is known from railway applications and it allows an evaluation of the r m s accelerations along the route and to assign the values to their corresponding track section bs en 12299 2009 for the given problem it is of interest to observe the changes in the accelerations during the simulation time as a sensitivity study the bin size has been varied between 1 min 5 min 10 min and 20 min to observe how the length of the interval changes the r m s values of the peaks in each bin the recorded time step of the simulation should be at least four times the frequency of interest for the given problem frequencies are in a range up to around 0 5 hz therefore a minimum sampling frequency of 2 hz or 0 5 s is chosen fig 8 the acceleration r m s values are calculated for each exposure direction of interest within each bin the bin size represents the acceptance criterion for exposure time of a technician being located in the working area an exposure time of for instance one min means that one r m s value is calculated for each minute of the simulation the workability index changes with the bin size chosen the parameter must therefore be treated with care based on the studies referred to in section 2 3 a bin size of 10 min has been chosen caicedo et al 2012 a sensitivity analysis of different bin sizes has also been carried out in order to illustrate the effects within each bin the r m s value is calculated depending on the assessment method it is calculated either weighted or unweighted similarly to steps 7 and 8 as described below a histogram is produced based on the results it encompasses the expectable range and frequency of acceleration magnitudes during specific hs tp combinations for every direction lateral vertical and rotational the r m s values are compared to their specific r m s acceleration limits the percentage of occurrences outside the given limit values is denoted as a non workable condition the fraction of time in which the respective limiting motion exposure threshold is not exceeded is further denoted as the workability index wi 4 w i w o r k a b l e t i m e t o t a l d u r a t i o n the individual wis from the different directions are multiplied and provide the wi of the specific hs tp combination the wi is calculated for each point in the hs tp table of interest for a given site this process is illustrated below fig 9 for the further assessment the wis are related to time series in order to account for the number of occurrences of certain hs tp combinations the average wi is calculated from all individual wis time steps in which access is not given are excluded for this assessment in the example below the wave height boundary for access has been set to 2 m h table 2 step 7 and step 8 are conducted similarly to step 6 but with the main difference that the acceleration signal is filtered before assessing its properties the filtering is done in accordance with iso 2631 1 digital method per appendix a as referred to in iso 2631 1 1997 4 application and results the methodology suggested above has been applied in several case studies representing the technological state of the art the meteorological data is derived from the applications described in the lifes50 project as referred to in iberdrola ingeniería y construcción 2015 it encompasses the following sites shown in fig 10 the description of the 10 mw reference turbine used can be found in deliverable d3 2 2016 the detailed specifications of the spar concept can be found in the public report xue 2016 an in house developed 3 legged tension leg platform has been developed on the basis of wehmeyer wehmeyer et al 2015 and the publicly available definition by bachynski 2014 a simplified semi submersible concept from the developer olav olsen has been applied university of stuttgart 2018 as well as an in house conceptual design of a barge concept with the wt mounted on a centrally located transition piece the simulations of the four concepts were performed with a coupled aero servo hydro elastic simulation software sima which has an integrated simulation workbench for advanced analyses of marine operations and floating systems for the semi submersible the tlp and the spar concept riflex simo models are used which are based on a nonlinear finite element formulation and comprise an elastic tower the mooring systems in sima of the three concepts are represented by a dynamic mooring system model providing a sufficiently accurate behaviour of the mooring loads in the time domain the floater of the tlp and the semi submersible are elastic models the substructure of the spar is a rigid model from xue 2016 the program evaluates the motion response of these concepts through hydrodynamic parameters which are created by a wamit simulation all accelerations and rotations which are the basis of the results presented in this report have been calculated for the nacelle of the 10 mw wt mounted on the substructures sima is a proven software well tested in the oil and gas and offshore wind industry the accuracy of its hydrodynamic module has been validated in numerous benchmark studies and wave tank campaigns the aerodynamic forces on the blades tower nacelle and wind exposed parts of the substructure are neglected in this study because they are considered minor compared to the wave induced loads the blade pitch and generator torque controller is inactive in the simulations as the turbine is in locked mode in contrast to the other three substructures where the hydrodynamic coefficients are directly computed with wamit using the hull geometry files due to the lack of geometric data availability the barge model is based on response amplitude operators raos which have been linearised for typical sea states the mass of the tower and turbine are included in the raos the mooring line behaviour is not included their impact on the 1st order motions however is very low the raos for the pitch and roll motion are very sensitive to the exciting wave amplitude so that for predicted rotations above five degrees the sea state is out of range of applicability for the raos responses exceeding this limit have been excluded from the analysis the four different structures used are in the following denoted as design a design b design c and design d the focus of this paper is not to compare different substructure typologies but to suggest a procedure applicable to any type of structure and to determine the ranges of results which are to be expected for fowts it shall in that respect be noted that all results shown are based on models that have been provided by different developers making the results representative of the whole range of floating wind substructure classes all accelerations shown in this study are representing motion at the hub height of the turbine for all structures investigated this is the point at which the highest motion amplitude would be experienced and most of the maintenance tasks on a wind turbine are executed in the nacelle which is in close vicinity of the wind turbine hub other points may be of interest such as the tower base or a location within the floater the principles shown in this paper may be applied likewise to such 4 1 accessibility a number of different workability scenarios have been assessed in the course of this study for those it is required to determine accessibility at different sea states it is assumed here that access solely depends on the sea state in terms of the significant wave height i e a vessel approach is expected to be successful if the wave height during access lies below its upper threshold level as indicated in section 2 1 access of floating structures may also be restricted by other factors particularly the combination of wave height and frequency as further assessed in martini et al 2016 however the predominant restrictor is wave height and it is therefore considered an appropriate choice for assessing the given problem accessibility is further defined as the fraction of time in which an asset is accessible the respective values for different wave height boundary levels are shown in fig 11 below for all three sites under consideration it can clearly be seen that accessibility increases significantly with an increasing wave height boundary restriction furthermore it can be observed that accessibility varies considerably between the different sites this factor has a great impact on the o m strategy an area which is subject to various research but not in the focus of this study in the further assessment workability is always treated under consideration of the single access restrictions as described above 4 2 characterization of motion in the following acceleration magnitude frequency spectra are shown in order to classify typical motion characteristics of different fowt systems in accordance with mansfield s mansfield 2005 categories fig 4 the graphs shown in fig 12 contain accelerations weighted with the motion sickness weighting curve according to iso 2631 1 iso 2631 1 1997 the represented frequency spectra show the superposed spectra of the individual sea states up to a wave height of 3 5 m h the regarded sea states are the hs tp combinations which show for at least one of the three sites under consideration an occurrence rate greater than zero for lower limit wave heights below 3 5 m the shape of the frequency spectra is comparable to those shown here the magnitude of acceleration is lower the limit wave height can be chosen such that it represents the limiting significant wave height for the boat access of the platform it is noticeable that all expectable motions in the low frequency area are dominated by the motion sickness condition shown in fig 13 for this reason the iso 6897 is tested as the assessment standard despite its limitation to fixed offshore structures iso 6897 1984 4 3 assessment against iso 6897 fig 14 shows the threshold values suggested by iso 6897 iso 6897 1984 all expected horizontal motions during maintenance conditions are highlighted in grey and summarized from the four lateral frequency spectra of fig 12 the marked area represents the frequency motion response of the four concepts in the relevant sea states of the three reference locations it can be seen that all expectable motions are below the upper limit values for bottom fixed offshore structures the accelerations of the investigated concepts surpass however the average threshold and enter the area of perception of horizontal motion for humans even though this standard is excluding floating structures it is deemed a valid exercise to investigate the motion profile against it as there is little guidance for floating structures 4 4 assessment against nordforsk this case study covers the use of unweighted signals and the boundary conditions suggested by nordforsk 1987 i e step 6 of the variants presented in fig 6 the threshold level has for the present case been set to transit passenger see table 1 workability is expressed by the average workability index wi per site and structure and provided at different access wave height restrictions fig 15 design c only shows very limited motion above the threshold suggested in nordforsk 1987 design a b and d show under some conditions a wi below 1 the workability index varies to a large extent with an increasing access wave height boundary interestingly for the site in scotland design b shows an increasing wi at higher wave height access restriction this is due to the fact that the rarely occurring low sea states are causing unfavourable motions considering this design design d is performing better at lower sea states workability on this structure is slightly reduced at higher sea states from 2 m h onwards but as for design b workability is particularly bad during low sea states around 1 5 m which is the today most common access limit for ctvs in contrast to asset accessibility motion criteria play a role for o m activities during low as well as during higher sea states this finding is clearly counter intuitive as one may assume that working conditions are worse during high compared to low wave conditions the reason for this finding lies in the dynamic response of the floating structure which is not solely relying on wave heights but on a combination of all external influencing factors such as wind speed and turbulence intensity wave periods and direction current velocity profile and direction and other factors such as the accumulation of marine growth or ice formations consideration of these parameters is required in order to perform a solid motion assessment it shall be noted that the vast majority of non workable conditions is caused by translational accelerations rotational limits are exceeded in less than 5 of the cases 4 5 assessment of maxima against nordforsk the assessment described in section 4 4 has been repeated using a more conservative assumption for this not all accelerations occurring during a certain condition have been treated equally here more emphasis was given to local acceleration maxima a comparable approach has been presented by boggs 1997 the approach relies on assessing motions based on peak to peak maxima observed during a certain time interval applying this method would lead to very large accelerations which are from the author s perspective based on own experience and conversations with offshore technicians deemed to not adequately represent the circumstances during works on offshore wind turbines boggs 1997 supports the theory that a person is affected most by the largest individual peak cycles and tends to forget about lesser cycles further it is stated by cheung cheung and nakashima 2006 that vertical motions in a frequency range between 0 167 and 0 5 hz with higher magnitude provoke vomiting earlier than motions with a low magnitude here he refers to mccauley et al mccauley 1976 cheung further states that little is known about the effects of lateral oscillations except that severe translational oscillations for short vibration cycles can easily provoke vomiting to a person who has already succumbed to motion sickness considering the above the authors suggest to calculate the r m s values of maxima during specific time intervals the resulting values are not as high as peak to peak values but emphasise actually occurring peak accelerations more than the traditional r m s method this method is novel and should be supported by lab and or field testing campaigns in order to evaluate applicability further this is done for several time intervals in accordance with the assessment presented in section 4 6 absolute values are assessed in order to account for negative peaks the procedure is illustrated below in order to ease understanding fig 16 the impact of motions has been investigated similarly to the procedure applied in section 4 4 the corresponding workability indices for the different designs at the different sites are shown in fig 17 it can clearly be seen that the workability is affected on all structures and at all sites considering the amended r m s method just as before it is shown that workability and accessibility need to be treated with care i e it is not a given fact that workability is becoming worse during harsher conditions the response of the floater may show larger accelerations during lower sea states if the excitation happens at a frequency closer to the floaters natural frequency as described above this means that working conditions must be evaluated by considering all factors that potentially affect the dynamic response of the floater 4 6 influence of bin sizes as described in section 3 it is of high importance to set the acceptance criteria for the exposure time to the desired level this is expressed by the exposure duration resolution it represents the lower time limit from which the exposure to certain conditions is deemed relevant literature suggests using acceleration r m s values in bins of 10 min caicedo et al 2012 higher bin sizes can underestimate the peak values though the averaging effects of the r m s the sensitivity of the wi value and its spread is illustrated in fig 18 the figure shows all calculated wis all sites and floater concepts at different exposure time bin sizes using the traditional r m s calculation method the vertical axis represents the workability index and four different exposure duration resolutions are plotted on the horizontal axis 1 min 5 min 10 min 20 min the boxes frame the edges of the 25th and 75th percentiles and the central line in each box represents the median of the values obtained the whiskers are reaching out to the extreme values lowest and highest in each series and outliers are marked with a as per matlab standard data points are considered outliers if they are greater than q 3 w q 3 q 1 or less than q 1 w q 3 q 1 with w representing the maximum whisker length q 1 the 25th percentile and q 3 the 75th percentile matlab 2018a 2017 the wi is increasing by increasing the exposure duration the spread of wis decreases at greater magnitude this phenomenon has been observed throughout all sites and floater concepts similarly so that results can be shown in one figure the reason for an increasing wi with higher exposure duration resolutions can be explained by reflecting the way the index is calculated it represents the fracture of time during which the conditions on the assets allow for works to be conducted i e if the wi is zero no works are possible to be carried out considering the respective threshold level applied this is illustrated in fig 19 below the same threshold level is applied to the same acceleration time signal a shorter bin size is chosen for the figure on the left and a longer duration on the right side in the left figure the workability threshold level is exceeded during two time intervals leading to a wi of 0 75 when considering that the complete time series consists of eight segments on the right hand side a sufficient contribution of low accelerations are counteracting to the ones above the threshold so that the overall wi is one the impact of single short term phenomena is balanced out this also explains why the spread of results is decreasing for increasing wis the workability on all floaters is increasing with increasing bin size it converges to one if for instance a whole year of measurement data would be used as one single bin the wi would be one for all sites under consideration for a 20 min exposure duration resolution almost all structures would exceed the threshold only in a very limited amount of cases the respective outliers can be explained by the time shift that prevails when applying different bin sizes i e fig 18 reflects the overall trend with some exceptions due to the slightly different intervals assessed against the threshold criteria 5 conclusions the studies presented in this paper address an area which is of increasing importance to floating offshore wind developers operators financers insurers service providers and other stakeholders it addresses the safety and well being of the technicians working in the harsh offshore environment every day considering floating offshore wind technology one can easily imagine which motions technicians may be exposed to during rough sea states modern access technology such as motion compensated gangways allow for higher and higher waves during the personnel transfer to the structure as the first of its kind this paper presents a methodology to assess the influence of those motions on humans being located on the asset during maintenance activities the methodology suggested includes procedures described in international standards as well as practical books it is shown that the low frequency motion which is the predominant motion characteristic of floating wind assets is not covered in the required detail the vast majority of available literature addresses motions in frequency ranges above 1 hz the assets considered here are operating in a range up to 0 5 hz the lack of guidance by standards has led to the application of practical recommendations which have been applied in the ship fish farming military and other naval industries additionally it shall be noted that the proneness to sea sickness and other motion related responses by the human body are highly subjective whilst some technicians are able to work under highly severe conditions others may get sick already during low sea states only a large scale lab test or site investigation is considered appropriate in order to diminish this subjectivity aside of medical implications such a study could also investigate effects of motion exposure with respect to the duration and quality of maintenance tasks carried out under different conditions as well as the impact of duration and sequence of threshold exceeding situations on the respective results results show that the motion exposure limiting values applied for the assessment of the working environment during maintenance activities has an impact on the time in which those activities may be carried out the waiting time for a weather window may increase under certain sea states due to critical conditions for human comfort by that this paper suggests that the pure assumption of a successful completion of a maintenance task once access is enabled is not applicable for modern large scale floating offshore wind turbines in numbers up to 5 of the time in which an asset is accessible it should be noted that depending on the design this applies for wave heights between 1 5 m h and 3 5 m h accelerations are in a range which are unacceptable for technicians to carry out their work the potential production losses due to this situation are significant considering large offshore wind farms if more conservative assessment methodologies are applied those numbers increase accordingly for future work it is suggested that potential losses associated to the factor of workability are quantified more accurately considering different wind turbine sizes and park layouts a fundamental finding of this study is that workability is not necessarily becoming worse at higher sea states the response of the floater leading to high accelerations may even be more significant in low wave height and low frequency wave states during all sea states the exceedance of translational acceleration threshold values is predominant rotational accelerations are causing non workable conditions in less than 5 of all cases under the conditions studied all described phenomena lead to the recommendation that already in the design stage of a new project the influence of human comfort criteria must be taken into consideration the factors influencing workability are aside from the environmental conditions the structural design and more specifically the eigenfrequencies of the floating offshore wind turbine system the methodology suggested in this paper helps to assess how significant the influence of motion may be on o m activities acknowledgements this project has received funding from the european

23153,the conventional mooring analysis considers the motion of the floater as a rigid body however as the dimension of the floater increases the elastic deflection of the floater may become significant which can have an impact on mooring tensions in this paper based on the three dimensional hydroelasticity and quasi static mooring analysis method a coupled numerical analysis method for a very large floating structure vlfs and mooring system is established the elastic deflection amplitudes and phases of various modes of a vlfs are first computed in regular waves in frequency domain these are then converted into time series for the specified real sea state and time domain simulations for the vessel s motion and mooring tension are performed in the time domain simulation the displacements at mooring connection points on the vessel include both the rigid motion and elastic deflection of the vessel a single vlfs module was analyzed together with a mooring system to demonstrate the procedure of the analysis furthermore a vlfs consists of three modules with a mooring system was also analyzed the calculation results match well with the data from model test which indicates the validity of the numerical method proposed and the computing program developed keywords mooring tension hydroelasticity elastic deflection static analysis 1 introduction hydroelasticity analysis of floating structure is attracting more attention as ships and offshore installations are developing towards unprecedented sizes and the structural elastic deflection is increasingly becoming important to the structural stress level and ultimately safety however in the analysis of the performance of a mooring system the commonly adopted method is to calculate the motion of the floating structure as a rigid body and the mooring line tension is calculated either in frequency domain or time domain on the basis of the rigid body motion of the floater for a vlfs the elastic deflection can cause the change of stress distribution within the structure and will also influence the mooring line tension due to the displacement and acceleration at the mooring connection points on the vessel however no previous studies have been seen on the impact of the elastic deflection of the floating structure on mooring tension for most conventional floating structures the elastic deflection excited by waves are usually very small and therefore it is acceptable to neglect its effect in the mooring analysis however as the floating structure becomes large enough e g over 300 m the elastic deflection may become important to the structural strength and mooring line tension mcloed 1918 firstly built the model of two dimensional quasi static analysis for flexible cables phillips 1949 initially did research on dynamic cable and walton and polachek 1959 introduced an innovative method to analyze dynamic character of mooring system very close to the method adopted at present based on the establishment of analysis method for mooring system by former researchers many previous studies have been conducted in the area of coupled analysis of the motion of floating structures and mooring tension in time domain a study by shivaji and sen 2015 evaluated motion responses of floating structure with linear and nonlinear mooring line stiffness using a three dimensional numerical wave tank approach in order to obtain the horizontal tension for each individual mooring line the nonlinear load excursion plot of the lines computed using catenary theory to determine linear and nonlinear line stiffness is prepared a truncated mooring system which could be a good replacement for the full depth mooring system assuming equivalent static stiffness and damping coefficients was designed by fan et al 2018 a research on the calculation method which can provide the time history of more realistic motion response and mooring tension was carried out by ran and kim 1997 and chen 2002 a full time domain analysis program of yang et al 2012 was used in the coupled dynamic analysis of offshore structures also on the basis of the sea keeping theory of ships and by applying frequency domain green s function time domain green s function and fast fourier transform method a computer program for ship motion simulation in time domain was developed by yuan 2011 the responses of a fpso and its mwa system under the combined wave wind and current conditions in time domain is characterized by fully coupled dynamic analysis method in the work of ji et al 2016 garrett 2005 introduced the analysis methods both in frequency domain and time domain which were verified by applying to a large floating platform there exists two numerical methods for the mooring lines such as the linear spring method and the nonlinear fem which were used by kim et al 2013 to compare the dynamic coupled behavior of floating structure and mooring system in time domain in the linear spring method spring constants are pre determined and in fem the nonlinear spring stiffnesses are computed through the minimum energy principle referring to dynamic analysis it is important to capture the evolution of the mooring dynamics for the prediction of the line tension especially for the high frequency motions as pointed by azcona et al 2017 the dynamic behaviors including inertia and hydrodynamic damping of the mooring line are considered by guo et al 2016 to compare the quasi static method with the nonlinear dynamic method the effects of stretch of mooring line in dynamics response of semi submersible platform are investigated by ghafari and dardel 2018 although there have been many research work conducted previously on the coupled analysis of floating structures and mooring systems very few literature have discussed the mooring system in connection to vlfss shimada and miyajima 2002 calculated the motion responses and mooring forces of a vlfs in time domain using the nonlinear mooring simulation program it demonstrated that the calculation code was useful for design of the mooring system for a vlfs fu 2005 compared the predicted nonlinear hydroelastic responses and mooring tensions of a moored floating structure with experimental data and discussed the reliability and accuracy of the analysis method the effectiveness of vertical elastic mooring lines modeled as vertical elastic springs in reducing hydroelastic responses was examined by nguyen et al 2018 in this paper a more comprehensive coupled analysis method is proposed which combines the frequency domain hydrodynamic and hydroelastic analyses time domain simulation of rigid body motion and elastic deflection and time domain quasi static mooring analysis in this method the elastic deflection of the floating structure is first computed in frequency domain in a form of response amplitude operators raos which are then converted into time domain responses for the given sea states the displacements of the mooring connection points on the floating structure are calculated in time domain as the sum of the rigid body motion and elastic deflection from which the mooring line tensions are calculated at each time step in a quasi static way i e by solving the catenary equation without considering the hydrodynamic and inertia forces on the mooring line an analysis example is presented in the paper for a vlfs deployed in a water of 400 m depth and the effect of elastic deflection on mooring line tension is discussed the paper also gives an example of numerical analysis in comparison with model test data for a three moduled vlfs which are connected in tandom by hinge like connectors which demonstrates the validity of the proposed analysis method 2 static analysis method for mooring line the mooring tension is calculated based on the catenary equation ong 2004 described the method in detail for solving the catenary equation referring to that thesis fig 1 shows the profile of a two dimensional mooring line the initial pretension is t f at the top point of the line the water depth or the depth of the anchor point is h and the origin of the coordinate system is placed at the touchdown point of the mooring line with z axe pointing upward and the arc length s starting from the touch point in this paper the mooring line is assumed to consist of only one component and the dynamic effects caused by the wave and current forces and mass inertia force are neglected referring to irvine 1981 an infinitely small element of mooring line is shown in fig 2 in the absence of fluid forces it is possible to resolve the forces acting normally and tangentially to the element to yield 1 d φ d s w t cos φ 2 d t d s w sin φ where t is element s tension w is submerged weight per unit length φ is the angle between the axial and horizontal directions when the water depth h and fairlead tension t f are known the following expressions can be derived 3 h t f w h 4 l h 2 t f ω h 1 5 x h w cosh 1 w h h 1 6 v w l where l is the length of the line in suspension under the given pretension t f x is the horizontal distance from touchdown point to fairlead and v is vertical force component at fairlead based on the static analysis method mentioned above a computer program for mooring tension analysis was developed and its validity was verified by conducting a test for a mooring line as suggested by brown and mavrakos 1999 which is shown in table 1 through static analysis the tension at mooring point is 70 41t and the angle of cable element at mooring point to free surface is 51 89 the results match well with that given by brown and mavrakos 1999 the geometrical sketch of mooring line is shown in fig 3 in which the horizontal ordinate is non dimensional 3 hydroelasticity equation of motion in frequency domain with the linear elastic assumption the structure will vibrate under the wave excitation forces around the equilibrium position with additional elastic deflection in the structural dynamic analysis using the finite element method the structure is discretized to a number of elements and on the basis of the equation of motion for each element the integrated form of the equation of motion for the whole structure can be derived which is expressed as 7 m u c u k u p f g where m c k u p f g are the total mass matrix total damping matrix total stiffness matrix total node displacement matrix distribution force matrix acting on structure lumped force matrix and volume force matrix respectively assuming the right hand side of eq 7 is zero an eigen analysis of the structure can be carried out to obtain its natural frequencies and vibration modes by considering the six degrees of freedom rigid body modes and those realistic elastic deflection modes the hydroelastic responses of the structure caused by wave excitation forces can be obtained assuming the total number of modes including both rigid body and elastic modes to be m the nodal vibration modes of the discrete system can be expressed as 8 d d 1 d 2 d r d m where d r r 1 m is the nodal displacement array of the r th vibration mode and the corresponding natural frequency is ω r for the rigid body motion the displacement at any point of the structure can be expressed as wu 1984 9 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 z z g y y g 1 0 0 z z g 0 x x g 0 1 0 y y g x x g 0 0 0 1 where x y z is the coordinate of a point on the structure and x g y g z g is the coordinate of the center of gravity of the structure using the modal superposition method the total nodal displacement matrix of the system is presented as 10 u d p r 1 m d r p r t where p is general principal coordinate matrix and p r t is the principal coordinate component corresponding to the r th mode multiplying both sides of eq 7 by d t and combining with eq 10 the discrete equation of motion in the form of principle coordinates for the structure is as follows 11 a p b p c p z δ q where 12 a d t m d b d t c d c d t k d z d t p δ d t f q d t g a is generalized mass matrix of structure b is generalized damping matrix c is generalized stiffness matrix z δ q are generalized distributed force on structure s surface generalized concentrated force and generalized body force 4 coupled equation of motion in time domain a time domain method is proposed in this paper for the coupled analysis of mooring system and floating structure with its elastic deflection included in this method a frequency domain 3d hydrodynamic and hydroelasticity analysis is performed first from which the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure and wave exciting forces are obtained on this basis the added mass and time delay function used in time domain motion equation are calculated through fourier inverse transformation and convolution integral the exciting forces are described in time domain simulation by regular wave superposition method combining responses of exciting forces in frequency and wave spectrum the mooring line tension can be calculated based on the position of floating structure at each time step then the position at next moment of floating structure forced by mooring line tension and fluid forces can be obtained by that cycle repeats we can get the motion of floating body and mooring line tension varying with time and the motion equation in time domain is shown as follows 13 m m x t t k t τ x τ d τ c x t f t f m o o r t in which m is generalized mass matrix m is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency k t τ is a retardation function c is hydrostatic stiffness matrix f t is generalized hydrodynamic force f m o o r t is the overall tension of mooring system in the time domain simulation the rigid body motion in 6 degrees of freedom is calculated first the elastic deflection raos at mooring connection point from frequency domain are then converted to a time series and added to the rigid body motion the combined displacement at each mooring connection point is used in the mooring tension calculation and thus the effect of the elastic deflection on mooring tension is taken into account although in theory the mooring tension will have an impact on the elastic deflection of the structure too this effect is believed to be insignificant when it is compared with the hydrodynamic force and therefore is neglected in the proposed method 5 time domain simulation of elastic deflections through modes superposition the frequency domain elastic deflections at mooring points can be expressed as eq 14 14 h r i ω j 1 m r j i p j re ω 2 j 1 m r j i p j im ω 2 where h r i ω is the elastic deflection at i th mooring point m is the total mode number including rigid body mode r j i ω is j th mode shape of i th mooring point p j re ω is the real part of the principle coordinate response of j th mode and p j im ω is the imaginary part in irregular waves the time domain expression of the mooring point displacement due to elastic deflection can be written as 15 f r i t l 1 n ζ l h r i ω l cos k l x cos θ l k l y sin θ l ω l t ε l ϕ l in above ζ l is the wave amplitude corresponding to l th frequency component in a wave spectrum ε l is a random phase angle for the l th frequency component ϕ l is the initial phase angle of the i th mooring point for the l th frequency component n is the number of frequency components in the wave spectrum based on the combined motion at each mooring connection point in eq 15 the mooring tension is calculated in time domain 6 mooring tension calculation for vlfs 6 1 single module of vlfs 6 1 1 particulars of the structure the structure adopted in this study is a semi submersible vlfs the detailed parameters are shown in table 2 and the model is shown in fig 4 the first four elastic mode shapes of this vlfs are displayed in fig 5 including one node torsion two node vertical bending three node vertical bending and two node torsion 6 1 2 parameters of mooring system the semi submersible type of vlfs is supposed to be deployed in the sea of water depth 400 m with a 6 4 catenary mooring system as shown in fig 6 in this study two cartesian coordinate systems are adopted one is reference coordinate and the other is body coordinate the reference coordinate is fixed with an origin in still water level these two coordinates coincide when the ship is at rest the wave direction is denoted as β equaling to 0 as wave propagates along positive x axis and 180 along opposite direction with regard to reference coordinate system the top connection positions of the 6 mooring groups are 7 m below the water surface each mooring group contains 4 mooring lines of identical properties the angle between the two neighboring mooring lines in the same group is 3 the length of each mooring line is 1450 m and the mooring radius is 1250 m when it is at the static equilibrium position in calm water the mooring line composition is shown in table 3 and the results of the static analysis for a single mooring line are shown in table 4 6 1 3 environmental conditions the motion responses of the vlfs module and the mooring tensions are calculated in time domain and nine environmental conditions including wind wave and current are considered in the analysis which are shown in table 5 the jonswap wave spectrum is used to describe the irregular incoming waves whose expression is shown in eq 15 where h 1 3 is significant wave height t p is spectral peak period γ is spectral peak enhancement factor which is assumed to be 3 3 in the analysis ω is wave circular frequency ω p is spectral peak frequency σ is peak shape parameter when ω ω p σ 0 07 when ω ω p σ 0 09 6 1 4 the effect of structural deflection on mooring tension it is a common practice in the mooring analysis for offshore floating structures to treat the floater as a rigid body as the elastic deflection of the structure is negligible in comparison with the rigid body motion however when the dimension of the floating structures increases to a certain level the structural deflection will become more obvious and its effect on mooring tension should be studied in this paper the elastic deflection of the vlfs is calculated and superimposed on the rigid body motion and the resultant motion of the vlfs is then taken into account in the calculation of the mooring line tension figs 7 9 show the comparison of the motions of the floater with and without the elastic deflection at the mooring connection points in ahead sea of hs 8 0 m and t p 9 0s in the longitudinal x direction and vertical z direction the influence of the elastic deflection on the mooring points can be observed and in the transverse direction y direction the elastic deflection can hardly be seen which is mainly due to the fact that the floater is in a head sea and the structure is symmetric about its central line the comparison of mooring tensions between the flexible and the rigid models of the module is given in fig 10 in which the influence of the elastic deflection on the mooring tensions can be observed the time domain results of the differences in mooring tension caused by the deflection effect denoted as d value are shown in figs 11 13 as shown in these figures the contribution of the elastic deflections of the vlfs on mooring line tension is mostly in the order of kn in the more severe sea states it can reach 16 kn the statistical results have also been shown in tables 6 8 the effect of floater s deflection on line tension is more obvious at zero degree direction than other two directions the statistical data of the d values are shown in tables 6 8 from which it can be seen that in general the significant d values increase with the sea state severity and they become smaller as the wave direction changes from 0 to 90 due to the smaller vertical elastic deflection excited by the wave forces as the wave direction changes from head sea towards beam sea 6 2 three modules of vlfs 6 2 1 details of the structure and mooring system the vlfs analyzed consists of three identical modules which is supposed to be deployed in an area of water depth 50 m the parameters of each module are the same as those listed in table 2 the coordinates defined method in fig 14 is identical to that in fig 6 with the origin set at the middle position of the whole structure each module has ten mooring lines and the layout of the mooring system is symmetrical about the central line of the structure as shown in fig 14 the top mooring connection points on the structure are 2 m above the base line of the vlfs all the mooring lines are of steel chains each line containing two segments with different properties the detailed parameters of the line properties are listed in table 9 6 2 2 comparison of results the jonswap wave spectrum with a gamma value of 2 0 is used to define the incident wave mooring line tensions from the model test were compared with the results from calculation in two different sea states as can be seen in the comparison shown in fig 15 and fig 16 the oscillation ranges of mooring tension of line1 are almost the same between the numerical results and model test but the tension from model test has high frequency components induced by dynamic responses of the mooring line which is not included in the numerical analysis due to the different random phases of the incident waves the tension time histories are not identical but their statistical properties are very close to each other the time histories of the differences between the total and average of line tensions obtained from analysis using the proposed method and traditional method are compared in fig 17 from which the influence of elastic deflection on mooring line tensions can be observed the difference between the maximum and minimum of mooring line tension marked by dashed line in fig 17 is 11 848t and is 15 044t marked by solid line it has increased 26 98 because of flexibility the time series of the motion responses of the first module of the vlfs in sway and heave are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 and in fig 20 and fig 21 the mooring tensions of line1 and line3 are displayed both the motion and mooring tension are calculated in a beam sea 7 conclusion based on the three dimensional hydroelastic analysis in frequency domain and quasi static mooring analysis a coupled time domain analysis method for floating structure and mooring system including the effect of elastic deflection of the structure is proposed in this paper in this method the elastic deflections of the floating structure in time domain is derived from the frequency domain hydroelasticity analysis and are then added to the rigid body motion at the mooring connection points so that the contribution of the elastic deflection to the mooring line tension is considered the hydroelastic responses of a single module vlfs with a mooring system were analyzed using the proposed method as an example and the impact of the structural elastic deflection on the mooring tension is demonstrated a three module vlfs with a mooring system was also analyzed in time domain using the proposed method and the motion and tension results were compared with the model test data although due to the high stiffness of the single vlfs module the elastic deflections at mooing connection points are only in the order of centimeters and their impact on the tension is very limited in this particular case however for those very large but less stiff vessels the elastic deflection may reach the order of meters in heavy seas and in this case its impact on the mooring tension will become more significant on the other hand the variation of mooring tension induced by high frequency elastic deflection may have an impact on the fatigue performances of mooring lines and vessel s structure at connection points which necessitates further research the method proposed in this paper will provide a useful tool to take the elastic deflection into consideration in the mooring tension analysis acknowledgments this work was supported by the ministry of science and technology with the research project no 2013cb36102 and the

23153,the conventional mooring analysis considers the motion of the floater as a rigid body however as the dimension of the floater increases the elastic deflection of the floater may become significant which can have an impact on mooring tensions in this paper based on the three dimensional hydroelasticity and quasi static mooring analysis method a coupled numerical analysis method for a very large floating structure vlfs and mooring system is established the elastic deflection amplitudes and phases of various modes of a vlfs are first computed in regular waves in frequency domain these are then converted into time series for the specified real sea state and time domain simulations for the vessel s motion and mooring tension are performed in the time domain simulation the displacements at mooring connection points on the vessel include both the rigid motion and elastic deflection of the vessel a single vlfs module was analyzed together with a mooring system to demonstrate the procedure of the analysis furthermore a vlfs consists of three modules with a mooring system was also analyzed the calculation results match well with the data from model test which indicates the validity of the numerical method proposed and the computing program developed keywords mooring tension hydroelasticity elastic deflection static analysis 1 introduction hydroelasticity analysis of floating structure is attracting more attention as ships and offshore installations are developing towards unprecedented sizes and the structural elastic deflection is increasingly becoming important to the structural stress level and ultimately safety however in the analysis of the performance of a mooring system the commonly adopted method is to calculate the motion of the floating structure as a rigid body and the mooring line tension is calculated either in frequency domain or time domain on the basis of the rigid body motion of the floater for a vlfs the elastic deflection can cause the change of stress distribution within the structure and will also influence the mooring line tension due to the displacement and acceleration at the mooring connection points on the vessel however no previous studies have been seen on the impact of the elastic deflection of the floating structure on mooring tension for most conventional floating structures the elastic deflection excited by waves are usually very small and therefore it is acceptable to neglect its effect in the mooring analysis however as the floating structure becomes large enough e g over 300 m the elastic deflection may become important to the structural strength and mooring line tension mcloed 1918 firstly built the model of two dimensional quasi static analysis for flexible cables phillips 1949 initially did research on dynamic cable and walton and polachek 1959 introduced an innovative method to analyze dynamic character of mooring system very close to the method adopted at present based on the establishment of analysis method for mooring system by former researchers many previous studies have been conducted in the area of coupled analysis of the motion of floating structures and mooring tension in time domain a study by shivaji and sen 2015 evaluated motion responses of floating structure with linear and nonlinear mooring line stiffness using a three dimensional numerical wave tank approach in order to obtain the horizontal tension for each individual mooring line the nonlinear load excursion plot of the lines computed using catenary theory to determine linear and nonlinear line stiffness is prepared a truncated mooring system which could be a good replacement for the full depth mooring system assuming equivalent static stiffness and damping coefficients was designed by fan et al 2018 a research on the calculation method which can provide the time history of more realistic motion response and mooring tension was carried out by ran and kim 1997 and chen 2002 a full time domain analysis program of yang et al 2012 was used in the coupled dynamic analysis of offshore structures also on the basis of the sea keeping theory of ships and by applying frequency domain green s function time domain green s function and fast fourier transform method a computer program for ship motion simulation in time domain was developed by yuan 2011 the responses of a fpso and its mwa system under the combined wave wind and current conditions in time domain is characterized by fully coupled dynamic analysis method in the work of ji et al 2016 garrett 2005 introduced the analysis methods both in frequency domain and time domain which were verified by applying to a large floating platform there exists two numerical methods for the mooring lines such as the linear spring method and the nonlinear fem which were used by kim et al 2013 to compare the dynamic coupled behavior of floating structure and mooring system in time domain in the linear spring method spring constants are pre determined and in fem the nonlinear spring stiffnesses are computed through the minimum energy principle referring to dynamic analysis it is important to capture the evolution of the mooring dynamics for the prediction of the line tension especially for the high frequency motions as pointed by azcona et al 2017 the dynamic behaviors including inertia and hydrodynamic damping of the mooring line are considered by guo et al 2016 to compare the quasi static method with the nonlinear dynamic method the effects of stretch of mooring line in dynamics response of semi submersible platform are investigated by ghafari and dardel 2018 although there have been many research work conducted previously on the coupled analysis of floating structures and mooring systems very few literature have discussed the mooring system in connection to vlfss shimada and miyajima 2002 calculated the motion responses and mooring forces of a vlfs in time domain using the nonlinear mooring simulation program it demonstrated that the calculation code was useful for design of the mooring system for a vlfs fu 2005 compared the predicted nonlinear hydroelastic responses and mooring tensions of a moored floating structure with experimental data and discussed the reliability and accuracy of the analysis method the effectiveness of vertical elastic mooring lines modeled as vertical elastic springs in reducing hydroelastic responses was examined by nguyen et al 2018 in this paper a more comprehensive coupled analysis method is proposed which combines the frequency domain hydrodynamic and hydroelastic analyses time domain simulation of rigid body motion and elastic deflection and time domain quasi static mooring analysis in this method the elastic deflection of the floating structure is first computed in frequency domain in a form of response amplitude operators raos which are then converted into time domain responses for the given sea states the displacements of the mooring connection points on the floating structure are calculated in time domain as the sum of the rigid body motion and elastic deflection from which the mooring line tensions are calculated at each time step in a quasi static way i e by solving the catenary equation without considering the hydrodynamic and inertia forces on the mooring line an analysis example is presented in the paper for a vlfs deployed in a water of 400 m depth and the effect of elastic deflection on mooring line tension is discussed the paper also gives an example of numerical analysis in comparison with model test data for a three moduled vlfs which are connected in tandom by hinge like connectors which demonstrates the validity of the proposed analysis method 2 static analysis method for mooring line the mooring tension is calculated based on the catenary equation ong 2004 described the method in detail for solving the catenary equation referring to that thesis fig 1 shows the profile of a two dimensional mooring line the initial pretension is t f at the top point of the line the water depth or the depth of the anchor point is h and the origin of the coordinate system is placed at the touchdown point of the mooring line with z axe pointing upward and the arc length s starting from the touch point in this paper the mooring line is assumed to consist of only one component and the dynamic effects caused by the wave and current forces and mass inertia force are neglected referring to irvine 1981 an infinitely small element of mooring line is shown in fig 2 in the absence of fluid forces it is possible to resolve the forces acting normally and tangentially to the element to yield 1 d φ d s w t cos φ 2 d t d s w sin φ where t is element s tension w is submerged weight per unit length φ is the angle between the axial and horizontal directions when the water depth h and fairlead tension t f are known the following expressions can be derived 3 h t f w h 4 l h 2 t f ω h 1 5 x h w cosh 1 w h h 1 6 v w l where l is the length of the line in suspension under the given pretension t f x is the horizontal distance from touchdown point to fairlead and v is vertical force component at fairlead based on the static analysis method mentioned above a computer program for mooring tension analysis was developed and its validity was verified by conducting a test for a mooring line as suggested by brown and mavrakos 1999 which is shown in table 1 through static analysis the tension at mooring point is 70 41t and the angle of cable element at mooring point to free surface is 51 89 the results match well with that given by brown and mavrakos 1999 the geometrical sketch of mooring line is shown in fig 3 in which the horizontal ordinate is non dimensional 3 hydroelasticity equation of motion in frequency domain with the linear elastic assumption the structure will vibrate under the wave excitation forces around the equilibrium position with additional elastic deflection in the structural dynamic analysis using the finite element method the structure is discretized to a number of elements and on the basis of the equation of motion for each element the integrated form of the equation of motion for the whole structure can be derived which is expressed as 7 m u c u k u p f g where m c k u p f g are the total mass matrix total damping matrix total stiffness matrix total node displacement matrix distribution force matrix acting on structure lumped force matrix and volume force matrix respectively assuming the right hand side of eq 7 is zero an eigen analysis of the structure can be carried out to obtain its natural frequencies and vibration modes by considering the six degrees of freedom rigid body modes and those realistic elastic deflection modes the hydroelastic responses of the structure caused by wave excitation forces can be obtained assuming the total number of modes including both rigid body and elastic modes to be m the nodal vibration modes of the discrete system can be expressed as 8 d d 1 d 2 d r d m where d r r 1 m is the nodal displacement array of the r th vibration mode and the corresponding natural frequency is ω r for the rigid body motion the displacement at any point of the structure can be expressed as wu 1984 9 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 z z g y y g 1 0 0 z z g 0 x x g 0 1 0 y y g x x g 0 0 0 1 where x y z is the coordinate of a point on the structure and x g y g z g is the coordinate of the center of gravity of the structure using the modal superposition method the total nodal displacement matrix of the system is presented as 10 u d p r 1 m d r p r t where p is general principal coordinate matrix and p r t is the principal coordinate component corresponding to the r th mode multiplying both sides of eq 7 by d t and combining with eq 10 the discrete equation of motion in the form of principle coordinates for the structure is as follows 11 a p b p c p z δ q where 12 a d t m d b d t c d c d t k d z d t p δ d t f q d t g a is generalized mass matrix of structure b is generalized damping matrix c is generalized stiffness matrix z δ q are generalized distributed force on structure s surface generalized concentrated force and generalized body force 4 coupled equation of motion in time domain a time domain method is proposed in this paper for the coupled analysis of mooring system and floating structure with its elastic deflection included in this method a frequency domain 3d hydrodynamic and hydroelasticity analysis is performed first from which the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure and wave exciting forces are obtained on this basis the added mass and time delay function used in time domain motion equation are calculated through fourier inverse transformation and convolution integral the exciting forces are described in time domain simulation by regular wave superposition method combining responses of exciting forces in frequency and wave spectrum the mooring line tension can be calculated based on the position of floating structure at each time step then the position at next moment of floating structure forced by mooring line tension and fluid forces can be obtained by that cycle repeats we can get the motion of floating body and mooring line tension varying with time and the motion equation in time domain is shown as follows 13 m m x t t k t τ x τ d τ c x t f t f m o o r t in which m is generalized mass matrix m is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency k t τ is a retardation function c is hydrostatic stiffness matrix f t is generalized hydrodynamic force f m o o r t is the overall tension of mooring system in the time domain simulation the rigid body motion in 6 degrees of freedom is calculated first the elastic deflection raos at mooring connection point from frequency domain are then converted to a time series and added to the rigid body motion the combined displacement at each mooring connection point is used in the mooring tension calculation and thus the effect of the elastic deflection on mooring tension is taken into account although in theory the mooring tension will have an impact on the elastic deflection of the structure too this effect is believed to be insignificant when it is compared with the hydrodynamic force and therefore is neglected in the proposed method 5 time domain simulation of elastic deflections through modes superposition the frequency domain elastic deflections at mooring points can be expressed as eq 14 14 h r i ω j 1 m r j i p j re ω 2 j 1 m r j i p j im ω 2 where h r i ω is the elastic deflection at i th mooring point m is the total mode number including rigid body mode r j i ω is j th mode shape of i th mooring point p j re ω is the real part of the principle coordinate response of j th mode and p j im ω is the imaginary part in irregular waves the time domain expression of the mooring point displacement due to elastic deflection can be written as 15 f r i t l 1 n ζ l h r i ω l cos k l x cos θ l k l y sin θ l ω l t ε l ϕ l in above ζ l is the wave amplitude corresponding to l th frequency component in a wave spectrum ε l is a random phase angle for the l th frequency component ϕ l is the initial phase angle of the i th mooring point for the l th frequency component n is the number of frequency components in the wave spectrum based on the combined motion at each mooring connection point in eq 15 the mooring tension is calculated in time domain 6 mooring tension calculation for vlfs 6 1 single module of vlfs 6 1 1 particulars of the structure the structure adopted in this study is a semi submersible vlfs the detailed parameters are shown in table 2 and the model is shown in fig 4 the first four elastic mode shapes of this vlfs are displayed in fig 5 including one node torsion two node vertical bending three node vertical bending and two node torsion 6 1 2 parameters of mooring system the semi submersible type of vlfs is supposed to be deployed in the sea of water depth 400 m with a 6 4 catenary mooring system as shown in fig 6 in this study two cartesian coordinate systems are adopted one is reference coordinate and the other is body coordinate the reference coordinate is fixed with an origin in still water level these two coordinates coincide when the ship is at rest the wave direction is denoted as β equaling to 0 as wave propagates along positive x axis and 180 along opposite direction with regard to reference coordinate system the top connection positions of the 6 mooring groups are 7 m below the water surface each mooring group contains 4 mooring lines of identical properties the angle between the two neighboring mooring lines in the same group is 3 the length of each mooring line is 1450 m and the mooring radius is 1250 m when it is at the static equilibrium position in calm water the mooring line composition is shown in table 3 and the results of the static analysis for a single mooring line are shown in table 4 6 1 3 environmental conditions the motion responses of the vlfs module and the mooring tensions are calculated in time domain and nine environmental conditions including wind wave and current are considered in the analysis which are shown in table 5 the jonswap wave spectrum is used to describe the irregular incoming waves whose expression is shown in eq 15 where h 1 3 is significant wave height t p is spectral peak period γ is spectral peak enhancement factor which is assumed to be 3 3 in the analysis ω is wave circular frequency ω p is spectral peak frequency σ is peak shape parameter when ω ω p σ 0 07 when ω ω p σ 0 09 6 1 4 the effect of structural deflection on mooring tension it is a common practice in the mooring analysis for offshore floating structures to treat the floater as a rigid body as the elastic deflection of the structure is negligible in comparison with the rigid body motion however when the dimension of the floating structures increases to a certain level the structural deflection will become more obvious and its effect on mooring tension should be studied in this paper the elastic deflection of the vlfs is calculated and superimposed on the rigid body motion and the resultant motion of the vlfs is then taken into account in the calculation of the mooring line tension figs 7 9 show the comparison of the motions of the floater with and without the elastic deflection at the mooring connection points in ahead sea of hs 8 0 m and t p 9 0s in the longitudinal x direction and vertical z direction the influence of the elastic deflection on the mooring points can be observed and in the transverse direction y direction the elastic deflection can hardly be seen which is mainly due to the fact that the floater is in a head sea and the structure is symmetric about its central line the comparison of mooring tensions between the flexible and the rigid models of the module is given in fig 10 in which the influence of the elastic deflection on the mooring tensions can be observed the time domain results of the differences in mooring tension caused by the deflection effect denoted as d value are shown in figs 11 13 as shown in these figures the contribution of the elastic deflections of the vlfs on mooring line tension is mostly in the order of kn in the more severe sea states it can reach 16 kn the statistical results have also been shown in tables 6 8 the effect of floater s deflection on line tension is more obvious at zero degree direction than other two directions the statistical data of the d values are shown in tables 6 8 from which it can be seen that in general the significant d values increase with the sea state severity and they become smaller as the wave direction changes from 0 to 90 due to the smaller vertical elastic deflection excited by the wave forces as the wave direction changes from head sea towards beam sea 6 2 three modules of vlfs 6 2 1 details of the structure and mooring system the vlfs analyzed consists of three identical modules which is supposed to be deployed in an area of water depth 50 m the parameters of each module are the same as those listed in table 2 the coordinates defined method in fig 14 is identical to that in fig 6 with the origin set at the middle position of the whole structure each module has ten mooring lines and the layout of the mooring system is symmetrical about the central line of the structure as shown in fig 14 the top mooring connection points on the structure are 2 m above the base line of the vlfs all the mooring lines are of steel chains each line containing two segments with different properties the detailed parameters of the line properties are listed in table 9 6 2 2 comparison of results the jonswap wave spectrum with a gamma value of 2 0 is used to define the incident wave mooring line tensions from the model test were compared with the results from calculation in two different sea states as can be seen in the comparison shown in fig 15 and fig 16 the oscillation ranges of mooring tension of line1 are almost the same between the numerical results and model test but the tension from model test has high frequency components induced by dynamic responses of the mooring line which is not included in the numerical analysis due to the different random phases of the incident waves the tension time histories are not identical but their statistical properties are very close to each other the time histories of the differences between the total and average of line tensions obtained from analysis using the proposed method and traditional method are compared in fig 17 from which the influence of elastic deflection on mooring line tensions can be observed the difference between the maximum and minimum of mooring line tension marked by dashed line in fig 17 is 11 848t and is 15 044t marked by solid line it has increased 26 98 because of flexibility the time series of the motion responses of the first module of the vlfs in sway and heave are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 and in fig 20 and fig 21 the mooring tensions of line1 and line3 are displayed both the motion and mooring tension are calculated in a beam sea 7 conclusion based on the three dimensional hydroelastic analysis in frequency domain and quasi static mooring analysis a coupled time domain analysis method for floating structure and mooring system including the effect of elastic deflection of the structure is proposed in this paper in this method the elastic deflections of the floating structure in time domain is derived from the frequency domain hydroelasticity analysis and are then added to the rigid body motion at the mooring connection points so that the contribution of the elastic deflection to the mooring line tension is considered the hydroelastic responses of a single module vlfs with a mooring system were analyzed using the proposed method as an example and the impact of the structural elastic deflection on the mooring tension is demonstrated a three module vlfs with a mooring system was also analyzed in time domain using the proposed method and the motion and tension results were compared with the model test data although due to the high stiffness of the single vlfs module the elastic deflections at mooing connection points are only in the order of centimeters and their impact on the tension is very limited in this particular case however for those very large but less stiff vessels the elastic deflection may reach the order of meters in heavy seas and in this case its impact on the mooring tension will become more significant on the other hand the variation of mooring tension induced by high frequency elastic deflection may have an impact on the fatigue performances of mooring lines and vessel s structure at connection points which necessitates further research the method proposed in this paper will provide a useful tool to take the elastic deflection into consideration in the mooring tension analysis acknowledgments this work was supported by the ministry of science and technology with the research project no 2013cb36102 and the

23154,compared to the case in still water a damaged ship flooding in waves can be more complex with more violent shaking and accompanied by wave breaking and splashing therefore in this work a numerical study regarding the damaged ship cabin flooding in transversal regular waves is carried out based on a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph method firstly the governing equation the fluid structure interface treatment the non reflection sponge layer boundary and the information extraction of particle flow field are discussed respectively then the numerical method is validated from two aspects the experiment of a damaged ship cabin flooding is carried out to test the accuracy of the fluid structure interaction model and a standard example is employed to validate the regular wave model furthermore the influences of transversal regular waves on the flooding of a damaged ship cabin are explored the openings at the broadside away from and towards the incident wave are considered the six degree of freedom 6 dof responses of the ship body to the incident waves are focused this study can provide references for the hydrodynamic performance of damaged ships and decision makings of the rescue after marine accident keywords damaged ship dynamic flooding sph transversal wave 6 dof response 1 introduction when a ship subjected to collision reef or underwater explosion a large breaking could be caused ming et al 2016 so the water under the waterline will gradually flood the damaged cabin in a minor case it may cause the hull shaking the buoyancy and stability decreasing and the internal structure damaged while in the serious case it may make the ship capsized or broken from the middle cross section it is significant to study the dynamic responses of the damaged ship in time domain the numerical tools with increasing complexity to simulate a damaged ship flooding can be divided into four main groups the first one is the quasi static methods which assume the water surface in the flooded cabin is static all the time ruponen et al 2007 santos and soares 2009 dankowski and krüger 2012 the flooding water in the cabin is always treated as the increase of displacement or the loss of buoyancy it is suitable for simulating the slow flooding process e g the progressive flooding however scholars gradually realized that the dynamic process of continuous flooding may be more dangerous so the second group is raised namely the lumped mass models with a moving plane water surface papanikolaou et al 2000 jasionowski 2001 spanos 2001 fujiwara and haraguchi 2005 manderbacka et al 2015 in this group the flooding water is regarded as a mass block connected with the hull by the spring with the lumped mass model the water surface is flat not always horizontal and can move accounting for the effect of flooding water motion therefore the force on the hull and the motion damping of the damaged ship could be obtained analytically because the sloshing of the flooding water is not taken into account many studies also employed the third group for the sloshing pressure such as the shallow water equation or the sloshing tank model santos and soares 2008 in this case the sloshing pressure of the flooding water is solved separately and loaded on the hull directly obviously though the dynamic motion of the flooding water is included the violent coupling between the ship hull and the flooding water is not considered adequately the nonlinear characteristics such as slamming splashing and so on should be considered therefore the fourth group i e computational fluid dynamics cfd codes such as vof sph mps etc are applied for simulating violent and complex flooding phenomena le touzé et al 2010 gao et al 2011 shen and vassalos 2011 hosseini 2012 souto iglesias et al 2014 besides the numerical tools some scholars also tried to understand the dynamic flooding process by experiments letizia et al 2004 lee et al 2007 ruponen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 acanfora and de luca 2016 cheng et al 2017 the motions of the damaged and intact ship can be compared and some details about the flow in the cabin and at the opening are captured many results have been demonstrated that the inflow and outflow of water at the opening and the water flow in the flooding cabin had great influences on the recovery moment of the hull letizia et al 2004 lee et al 2007 the ship rolling are mainly determined by the opening location rather than the size acanfora and de luca 2016 and the stability of a damaged ship with a broadside opening is worse but some parameters e g the sinking time are more favorable for rescue activities zhang et al 2013 cheng et al 2017 recently more and more researches are concentrated on the flooding of damaged ships in different waves because when the damaged ships floods in waves the process becomes more violent chan et al 2002 korkut et al 2004 2005 andrewartha et al 2008 the waves take great effects on the water flow process and further the ship responses especially for the rolling motion of the ship in transversal waves many methods are used to solve the wave force on the damaged ship for example the slicing method with the potential flow theory actually the flooding process of a damaged ship is a complex fluid structure interaction problem related to the external wave the hull and the sloshing in the cabin the problem is featured by breaking splashing and other nonlinear problems so it often encounters great challenges to solve such problems smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is a lagrangian particle method and it is very advantage of dealing with large deformation problems of free surface flow and fluid structure interaction campbell and vignjevicp m m s 2009 marrone et al 2011 gomez gesteira et al 2012 messahel and souli 2013 liu et al 2014 gui et al 2015 ren et al 2015 violeau and rogers 2016 ming et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wen and ren 2018 he et al 2018 until now there are few researches on simulating a damaged ship flooding using sph method some existing studies are restricted to the flooding of the ship cabin with a simple geometry and only several degrees of freedom are considered shen and vassalos 2011 zhang et al 2013 cheng et al 2017 skaar 2006 cao et al 2018 the coupling among the flooding water the wave and the ship hull needs to study in depth in this paper the weakly compressible sph wcsph method is applied to study the influences of transversal waves on the dynamic flooding process of a damaged ship cabin the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the three dimensional wcsph model is discussed colagrossi and landrini 2003 liu and liu 2003 in section 3 several examples and the results of model experiments are used to validate the accuracy of the fluid structure interaction model and the numerical wave model in section 4 the model of a damaged ship cabin flooding in transversal waves is established and then the 6 dof responses are studied in section 5 some important conclusions are enclosed 2 theoretical background the adaptive lagrangian particle method i e sph is applied to solve the complex interactions between the wave the hull and the sloshing based on the approximation of weakly compressible fluid marrone 2012 the wcsph model is discussed in this section in terms of governing equation fluid structure coupling interface etc 2 1 state equation of weakly compressible fluid water is undoubtedly compressible in nature however in computational fluid dynamics codes the compressibility is not considered under some cases in order to simplify problems most scholars believe that when the mach number is less than 0 1 the compressibility of water can be neglected when the mach number exceeds 0 1 it is necessary to consider the compressibility in the compressible or weakly compressible sph methods conservation equations are solved directly as an explicit solution its time marching scheme requires a stable time step δ t and it depends on the condition of courant fredrich levy morris et al 1997 considering the restrictions of particle acceleration viscous force and combined courant viscous force namely δ t min δ t f δ t υ δ t c they can be expressed respectively as follows 1 δ t f α f min i h i a i δ t υ α υ min i h i 2 υ δ t c α c min i h i c 0 where α f 0 25 α υ 0 125 α c 0 25 a is the particle acceleration υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient h is the smoothing length v and r are velocity and position vector i and j are a pair of interacting particles obviously the greater the sound speed the smaller the required stable time step because the real sound speed of water is about 1480 m s so it leads to a very small stable time step moreover the velocity of the global flow is finite in free surface flow problems so the mach number is often very small given this reason monaghan proposed the wcsph model monaghan 1994 by reducing the real speed of sound a proper artificial sound speed is used and thus a larger time step is obtained by the approximate incompressible condition one obtains 2 m a v c 0 0 1 so in order to satisfy this condition throughout the fluid domain it holds 3 c 0 10 max v this artificial sound speed can ensure an acceptable time step while guaranteeing the fluid flow characteristics the fluid with a modified sound speed is weakly compressible and the tait equation is commonly used to describe the relationship of pressure and density monaghan 1994 namely 4 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 ρ 0 is the density at p 0 for water γ 7 b is related to the sound speed which can be defined by the following relationship 5 c p ρ γ p b ρ substituting the initial state variables ρ 0 c 0 and p 0 into this equation one gets 6 b ρ 0 c 0 2 γ 2 2 sph equation for weakly compressible fluid when the peak pressure of weakly compressible fluid is below 1 gpa the effect of energy variation on flow characteristics can be neglected marrone 2012 the sph governing equations conserve the mass and momentum namely 7 d ρ i d t ρ i i v i 8 d v i d t g i i p ρ i in the framework of wcsph the above equation can be discretized as follows 9 d ρ i d t ρ i j

where i and j are a pair of interacting particles ρ p c v and r denote the density the pressure the sound speed the velocity and the position vector respectively g is the gravity acceleration and 9 81m s 2 is used the last term in the mass conservation equation indicates the density diffusion marrone et al 2011 which converges to 0 as the particle resolution is refined it not only preserves the mass conservation but suppresses the high frequency noises in the flow field the adjustable parameter ξ is 0 2 the last term of the momentum equation is the artificial viscosity monaghan and gingold 1983 which is different from the traditional viscosity term regarding the condition v j v i r j r i 0 it is more helpful to the stability even with a smaller coefficient ζ moreover it can be related to the physical viscosity with the equation ζ 2 υ d 2 h c 0 where d is the dimension for some violent case the real physical viscosity can be neglected and only the artificial viscosity term is considered the adjustable parameter ζ is selected as 0 005 w r h is the kernel function r r i r j and the improved gaussian function is used marrone 2012 its form is 13 w r h e r h 2 e δ h 2 2 π 0 δ r e r h 2 e δ h 2 d r α e r h 2 c r δ where the parameters are δ 3 h and c e 9 α h d π d 2 1 10 e 9 1 the improved function has almost identical shape with the original gaussian kernel function but it strictly guarantees the condition w g 0 on the boundary surface of the support domain meanwhile compared with the cubic spline function it is more smoothness the radius of the support domain 3 h is larger than that of cubic spline function 2 h therefore more particles are used for approximation so that the approximations have a better stability however a larger support domain also reduces the computational efficiency especially in 3d problems the computational complexity increases drastically smith et al 2003 the equation system of continuity equation momentum equation and the state equation is completely closed and three unknown parameters can be solved i e the density the velocity and the pressure thus the weakly compressible sph model for the fluid is established 2 3 treatment of fluid structure interface the flooding of a damaged ship is a transient and complicated process of fluid and structure interaction the fluid structure interface treatment is particularly critical for capturing the dynamic responses of the damaged ship during the interaction of fluid and structure the structure can be regarded as the boundary of fluid considering the curvature of structure boundary the treatment is not identical for the structure with a small curvature mirror particles can be used to satisfy the completeness of kernel function e g the dummy particle boundary adami et al 2012 however for the structure with a large curvature the arrangement of mirror particles becomes very difficult especially for a uniform arrangement in this case the structure boundary discretized into a layer of particles is warmly welcomed e g the normal flux method de leffe et al 2008 the projection boundary gong et al 2016 in this paper dummy particle boundary is used to model the ship cabin wall adami et al 2012 sun et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 because the improved gaussian kernel function is adopted if the smoothing length is 1 2 times of the particle spacing at least four layers of particles are needed to discretize the wall to guarantee the consistency of kernel function these wall particles b a b d v b d t are not solved by state of equation but interpolated from the surrounding fluid particles f therefore when taking into account the role of all fluid particles in the support domain and normalizing the kernel function one obtains 14 p b f w b f ρ f g a b r b r f p f f w b f this is the approximate pressure of the wall particles moreover through the state of equation of weakly compressible fluid the density of wall particles can be solved 15 ρ b ρ 0 p b b 1 1 γ through treatments mentioned above the information of dummy particles can be obtained from fluid particles in the support domain while inversely the approximation of fluid particles near the wall also considers the role of dummy particles in the support domain this treatment satisfies both the completeness of the kernel approximation near the boundary and the continuity conditions at the interface 2 4 non reflection sponge layer boundary sometimes the actual physical boundary is far away from the focused region thus we have to intercept a proportion of the domain centered by the focused region to simulate so as to reduce the numerical cost when pressure waves reach the boundary of computational domain they will be reflected so the pressure of the inner domain is affected therefore it is necessary to make the intercepting boundary no reflection at present there are several boundary treatments for non reflection such as the damping layer and the impedance matching layer but it seems like no ideal method of non reflection in sph method a damping layer with a thickness of d is always arranged outside the boundary i e sponge layer to suppress the reflection of pressure waves gong et al 2011 the mass conservation equation for particles in the sponger layer can be modified as follows 16 ρ n 1 ρ n ϑ d ρ n d t δ t where ϑ is the coefficient defined as follows 17 ϑ 1 a 0 9 b η 18 η z s z w d herein z s and z w are projection positions of particles in the layer and at the interface in the direction of the interface normal respectively the constant parameters are a 9 and b 50 obviously the treatment is very simple and only needs to lay some particles outside of the boundary to suppress the reflection of pressure waves however the computational costs are also increased especially for three dimensional problems the amount of particles for the layer is quite considerable 2 5 visualization of particle flow field sph is a purely lagrangian particle method it is difficult to extract all flow field characteristics from scattered particles especially for the data processing e g differential or integral also there are great difficulties to obtain envelope surface iso surface and render illumination and transparency etc however if the information of sph particles is interpolated to the background grid these operations will be more convenient and benefit the analysis of flow field characteristics as shown in fig 2 firstly we lay the background grids for the sph particle domain the grid size is same as the initial particle spacing then the background grid nodes are identified as color particles of flag 1 while sph particles are identified as color particles of flag 0 these two kinds of color particles are placed in a same domain for searching by means of the kernel function for a particle i the shape function is defined as 19 φ i j v j w i j flag i flag j where j is the particle with different colors in the support domain of particle i for a color particle i with flag 1 if φ i is solved the iso surface of φ i will be determined generally the color particle with φ i 0 5 is considered in the fluid domain the physical quantities of the particle are obtained from the neighboring sph particles by interpolating for example the quantity f of this particle can be obtained by 20 f i j f j v j w i j x i j φ i flag i 1 flag j 0 after determining the physical quantities of color particles with flag 1 the corresponding values of each grid node and element can be also obtained through the topological structure therefore the mapping between sph particles and background grids is realized because the spacing of sph particles and the size of background grids are same and both very small so the error of the interpolation result is very small fig 3 shows the post processing results of the dam breaking model the left column is the result displayed via sph particles whereas the right one is displayed by mapping the information from sph particles to the background grids it can be found that the flow information after interpolating from sph particles to the background grids is consistent the pressure contour and the deformation of free surface can be easily obtained this method is advantageous to extract and visualize the complex flow characteristics 3 numerical validation 3 1 experiment of a damaged ship cabin flooding this section aims to validate the fluid structure interaction model established in this paper through the model experiment of a damaged ship cabin flooding the layout of the experiment is shown in fig 4 the whole experiment device consists of a water tank two high speed cameras a ship model with three cabins and its balance installation etc as plotted in fig 4 the water tank is fabricated by transparent polymethyl methacrylate pmma which facilitates high speed camera capturing and recording the length width and height of the water tank are all 0 8m the height of the initial water surface is 0 6m the ship model is placed at the center of the tank and initially floats with a draught during the experiment two high speed cameras are placed on the front and the left side of the tank respectively to record the frontal and lateral images of the cabin flooding thus the datum of the translational and rotational motions can be extracted the ship model and the opening used in experiments are shown in fig 5 a the ship model has a length of 360 mm a width of 180 mm and a depth of 120 mm the internal and external diameters of the bilge arc are 18 mm and 30 mm respectively there are three cabins containing two watertight cabins and a flooded cabin with a side opening of 35 mm in diameter the wall thickness of this model is 12 mm and the displacement is 3 6 kg when initially placed in water it is fixed and balanced by a lightweight rope as presented in fig 5 b firstly the opening is sealed by a piece of thin film made from smooth hydrophobic material to prevent the water flow from entering when the experiment begins the rope is cut off simultaneously the film is pulled off quickly and thus the cabin begins to flood the exhaust vent with a diameter of 30 mm is opened at the top of cabin so as the effect of air flow can be avoid which has been tested in the following experiment fig 6 shows the comparisons between the numerical and the experimental results due to the center of the opening located at the waterline at the initial stage so the water begins to flow into the cabin through a partial section under the hydrostatic pressure the water passes through the opening and then flows towards the other broadside because the velocity is very slow so the water surface is regular and no air is involved however with the increase of the flooding water the cabin begins to drift and roll simultaneously the end of the flooding cabin gradually sinks fig 7 shows the time histories of the heaving and swaying of the gravity center respectively at the initial stage because the flooding is slow the vertical and transversal velocities of the ship model are relatively small however with the increasing of the flooding quantity the gravity center drops downward rapidly and the transversal drift also speeds up when the cabin is nearly flooded up with water the heaving and swaying motions tend to steady comparing the numerical and experimental results the overall trend is consistent but there are still some errors which are less than five percent the errors may be due to the disturbances in the release process and thus affect the model motions fig 8 presents the histories of pitching and yawing angles respectively because the flooding at the initial is slow the pitching and yawing moments caused by the flooding water are very small however with the increasing of the flooding water the model gradually tilts the water accumulation will aggravate the tilting process therefore both the angular acceleration and the angular velocity increase with the increase of pitching and yawing angles the balance reaches between the tilting and the recovering moment and the flooding quantity tends to steady the angular movement tends to stop during the whole process numerical results are very close to the experiment ones the error may be from the experiment tests and the air effects in the flooding process therefore the reliability of the present fluid structure interaction model is validated 3 2 numerical wave tank in order to investigate the response characteristics of a damaged ship flooding in waves the accuracy of the numerical wave tank is tested in this section the model experiment of a floating body moving in waves carried out by hadžić is used hadžić et al 2005 the experiment layout is plotted in fig 9 the floating body has a mass of 0 986 kg a density of 680kg m 3 and a rotary inertia of 14 kg cm 2 its side lengths are 0 10m and 0 05m the center of the body is 2 11m away from the flapping wavemaker which is placed on the left of the water domain the wavemaker rotates like the experiment by hadžić et al 2005 fig 10 shows the pressure field of the interactions between the wave and the floating body when the wavemaker rolls periodically a regular wave is produced and the body begins to move in waves the pressure field around the body is smooth fig 11 a shows the experimental and numerical results of the wave height at the point of 1 16m away from the wavemaker correspondingly the heaving motion of the floating body is presented in fig 11 b the sph results agree well with the experimental ones the error of wave height is less than one percent though there are some deviations of the heaving motion of floating body in time axis the amplitude is also very close the error may be from the difference between the 3d experiment and 2d numerical results though the 2d assumption had been validated in many published papers in summary this still indicates that the sph method established in this paper has a good accuracy when simulating the interactions between floating bodies and waves 4 results and discussions when a ship is damaged at sea it is difficult to avoid the invasion of waves the incident waves can change the hydrodynamic environment and thus the floating state of ships are changed in detail the waves may disturb the relative position between the opening and the waterline so that the process of flooding is affected according to the relative position between the opening and the waterline the flooding cabin can be divided into three types in the first type the opening is located under the water surface and the upper roof of the flooding cabin is watertight so the flooding quantity is constant and there is no free surface sloshing in the cabin in the second type the cabin is flooded due to some factors e g green water the internal and external liquids are not connected and the free surface sloshing formed in the third type the upper roof is above the water surface and there is free surface sloshing formed by the connected water in and out of the damaged cabin the coupling of the cabin the internal sloshing and the external waves is obvious in this section the last type of the flooding cabin is focused taking the damaged ship model with a broadside opening for an example the 3d sph method is applied to model the numerical wave tank and simulate the flooding process the opening away from and towards the incident wave is respectively considered and the response characteristics of the damaged ship model are studied a damaged ship model with three cabins of same sizes is established in fig 12 a there are two watertight cabins and a flooded cabin with a broadside opening of 1 2m in diameter it has a length l of 12m x direction a width b of 6m y direction and a depth d of 4m z direction the displacement is 149 kg with a draught of 2m the rotary inertias of the ship model about the principle axis in x y and z directions are i z 2 06 10 6 kg m 2 i y 2 32 10 6 kg m 2 i x 7 91 10 5 kg m 2 respectively the ship model is placed in a numerical wave tank with the sizes of x 20m y 30m z 6m as shown in fig 12 b the coordinate origin a lies at the corner point of the water domain the coordinates of the gravity center at the beginning are x g 10m y g 10m z g 6m the openings of 1 and 2 do not exist simultaneously the opening of 1 is towards the incident waves but away from the incident waves for the opening of 2 the model is released suddenly at the beginning and meanwhile the opening is opened the floating state with an initial draught of 2m begins to alter in order to better understand the wave effects the same ship cabin model is also placed in still water the flooding process is compared with that in waves in all the three cases the air is not modeled the water domains of still water and wave tank are respectively discretized into 1 820 566 and 5 322 565 particles and the ship model is represented by 89 435 particles the dummy particle boundary condition is applied the present program is paralleled by openmp command language and run on a dell workstation with 50 threads because it has to model the wave tank and overcome the wave reflection the particle number of the wave case increases greatly the cpu times is about 70 h for the case of flooding in still water and about 216 h for the case of flooding in waves the cpu time of the latter case is about 3 times that of the former case the relative position between the wave and the opening is considered the time history of the amplitude of the wavemaker is plotted in fig 13 the frequency and the amplitude of the flapping wavemaker are 0 36hz and 7 rad respectively for this water depth the regular waves will be produced with a wavelength of 14 3m and a wave height of 1 1m 4 1 flooding process of the opening away from the incident waves fig 14 shows the velocity field when the damaged ship model flooding with the opening away from the incident wave at the initial moment the model is placed in still water and the flooding process is very slow at t 2 5 s the regular waves produced by the wavemaker propagate to the ship model the flooding water in the cabin is very little and accumulated on the other side of the opening at t 10 s the whole model acts completely with the incident wave and rides on crest so the tilt angle changes greatly the end of the model far away from the flooding cabin is lifted and the immersion depth of the opening becomes larger so the flooding quantity and flooding speed increase obviously meanwhile due to the slamming of the waves on the model the breaking water splashes and drops down to the water surface and thus some uneven pits are produced as plotted in fig 14 c with the increase of flooding water at t 15 s the end of the flooding cabin sinks seriously and there are noticeable green waters on the deck see in fig 14 d the buoyancy and stability of the damaged cabin are reduced after t 20 s the whole model has undergone large tilt and drift motion and the vitality of the ship model is threatened greatly in this period the green water is not accumulated because of the watertight and flat deck until t 25 s the flooding cabin is almost filled up and the other end far away from the flooding cabin is almost raised up obviously the motion of the damaged model in waves is much more severe than that in still water 4 2 flooding process of the opening towards the incident waves the flooding process of the damaged ship model with the opening towards the incident waves is plotted in fig 15 before t 2 5 s the flooding process is similar to the case in still water when t 10 s the model is riding at the crest and the opening is exposed and lifted above the water surface therefore the flooding progress is stopped but the water sloshing in the cabin continues see in fig 15 c accompanied with the shaking of the cabin the end of the flooding cabin sinks a lot at t 15 s the first wave crest propagates past during this period the inclined hull seems like slipping down from the steep wave surface a larger yawing angle occurs due to the imbalance of the weight distribution along the hull length then the opening is immersed at the trough so the water flows into the cabin more rapidly under a higher pressure and the speed can be up to 12 m s at t 20 s the end of the flooding cabin is almost immersed in water and the motion of the cabin is violent until t 25 s the cabin is almost filled up and the end away from the opening is lifted the yawing angle is almost up to 60 during this period the incident waves make the cabin almost lose its vitality 4 3 comparison of the openings away from and towards the incident waves in order to give a global understanding of the cabin flooding and the ship responses the configurations of the coordinate system and the ship cabin model for the opening away from and towards the waves are respectively shown in fig 16 a and b an observed line along the length direction is selected the two endpoints of the line are located at the middle of the width for the case in still water the configuration is similar to fig 16 a except the incident waves fig 17 gives several typical instants of the cabin flooding process as we see the process of the water flooding the cabin before the arrival of the waves is similar the water flows through the partial section of the opening and impacts on the bottom of the cabin then it sloshes with the motion of the cabin and gradually accumulates at the lower corner see in fig 17 a when the waves arrive and interact with the model the flooding speed is changed for the case of the opening away from the waves the cabin is flooded rapidly while for the opening towards the waves the opening is lifted and the flooding progress is almost paused as shown in fig 17 b during this period the water surface inside and outside is connected and deforms drastically the free surface couples with the ship model violently with the sinking of the ship model the cabin with the opening away from the waves floods more water than the case with the opening towards the waves moreover the sloshing amplitude is very large and can touch the deck however the latter one has a larger yawing angle under the wave actions as plotted in fig 17 c finally see in fig 17 d both the cabins with different openings are mostly filled with water but the convection at the opening still takes place accompanied by the shaking of the ship model the motion of the observed line in different views for the flooding in still water is plotted in fig 18 where dx dy and dz indicate the displacements in the direction x y and z respectively the two ends of the cabin show different laws see in fig 18 a the flooding end is generally accompanied by a large amplitude motion and the opposite end shows a high frequency shaking due to the effect of the flooding water the end c of the flooding cabin drifts and sinks greatly and the end d tilts up slightly see in fig 18 b d the swaying amplitude of the end c is up to 0 4 times of the width and the sinking amplitude is larger than the module depth when the cabin tends to be filled up the shaking with a small amplitude and a large frequency takes place as plotted in fig 18 d overall the responses in still water are not violent and the motion amplitude is comparable to the principle dimension the motions of the observed line for the ship flooding with the opening away from and towards the waves are shown in fig 19 as we see in fig 19 a the amplitude of the ship motion becomes larger than the case of flooding in still water the end c of the flooding cabin gradually sinks into water while the other end d firstly moves steadily and then begins to shake with a high frequency when the water flooding progress tends to be slow before the arrival of the wave the ship responds to the flooding water with a smaller amplitude however when the wave acts on the ship model the ship model drifts a distance of about 2 times of the model width along the wave direction the cabin is rapidly flooded more water the end c sinks more for the case of the opening away from the incident waves and thus the model has a smaller yawing angle conversely the model of the opening towards the wave direction will be slowly flooded less water and forms a larger torque so the yawing angle is large when the wave crest passes the model the opening is located at the trough and the cabin begins to flood rapidly see in fig 19 c at the later stage when the cabin is almost filled up with water the yawing angle begins to recover see in fig 19 a b for the opening away from the waves the sinking speed of the flooding end c is larger and there are smaller shakes compared to the case of the opening towards the waves as plotted in fig 19 d fig 20 shows the history of the flooding quantity in cases of the opening away from and towards the incident waves respectively the flooding quantity q is normalized by the product of the water density and the principle dimensions of the ship model compared with the case of flooding in still water before t 8 s because the ship models are all placed in still water the water quantity flooding into the cabin is almost identical at t 10 s the waves interact with the ship model completely so the differences of the flooding quantity are made in the case of the opening away from the incident waves the depth of the opening immersing into water is larger than the other cases so the water floods more rapidly under the larger pressure difference see in curve 2 however for the case of the opening towards the incident waves the opening is lifted during this period so there are transient stagnation points in the flooding process which can be referred to the flat part of the curve 1 as the time goes by the flooding water increases continuously in the former case however in the latter case though the flooding water increases slowly at the early stage when the wave crest passes over the ship model the opening is located at the wave trough and flooded rapidly the flooding speed increases gradually and even exceeds the former case because the pressure difference at the opening is enhanced greatly the whole flooding process seems to be breathing and finally the cabin in this case is flooded into more water however for the case in still water the flooding water increases smoothly therefore the relative position between the wave and the opening has significant influences on the flooding process fig 21 shows the time history of the translational displacements of the barycenter during the cabin flooding they show similar tendencies for the cases of the opening away from and towards the incident waves except some differences of the amplitude at the same moment swaying motion to the side of the opening occurs at the initial stage but the amplitude is very small soon under the wave force the model begins to drift transversally along the incident wave direction and meanwhile accompanied with shaking around its dynamic balance position which can be accounted for the action of fluid particles moving in wave field because the slamming area of the model with the opening away from the incident wave is larger than the case of the opening towards the incident waves in addition the responses of the model induced by the flooding water will also partially counteract the swaying motion in the case of the opening towards the incident waves the opening 1 and oppositely aggravate it in the case of the opening away from the incident waves the opening 2 the swaying of the opening away from the wave case is slightly larger than the opening towards the wave case at the same moment for the heaving motion the amplitude of the three cases is very close before the arrival of the incident waves however some differences appear due to the impact of incident waves the ship model in waves will shake greatly while keep smooth in still water also the wave force changes the immersing depth of the opening and thus the flooding speed and flooding quantity are also changed in the case of the opening away from the incident waves the flooding speed and quantity are larger so under the wave action the amplitude of the heaving is also larger at the same moment in the case of the opening towards the wave the ship model almost heaves around the dynamic balance position which is close to the case in still water for the surging motion the ship model in still water and in waves moves to different directions before the wave arrival that is in still water the model moves towards the end of the flooding cabin due to the increase of the flooding water however in wave cases the model has a large yawing motion under the wave action and translates towards the end away from the flooding cabin when the opening is towards the incident waves the broadside with the opening is lifted so the flooding speed is slow and the quantity is small therefore a larger yawing motion is caused under the wave action contrarily the model with an opening away from the incident waves has a rapid flooding process and at the same time the flooding quantity and immersing depth is larger therefore this model is subjected to a larger water resistance and has a smaller yawing angle the surging motion is larger compared to the former case obviously the model does not completely move to the direction of the flooding end but responds to the coupling forces between the waves the sloshing and the damaged model there are multiple degrees of freedom obviously when the wave crest and trough alternately propagate over the model the flooding speed changes violently and thus causes the cabin shaking obviously fig 22 shows the time histories of the rotational angles of the damaged ship model in waves and in still water obviously when the flooding cabin is not affected by waves the responses of the three cases are similar however when the wave propagates to the model the angle increases and the differences occur for the opening away from the incident waves due to a large flooding quantity and speed at the same moment the pitching angle under the actions of wave and flooding water is larger than that in still water and that of the opening towards incident waves because the opening towards the waves is lifted when the model riding on the crest and a slow flooding speed takes place it has a smaller pitching angle at the late stage compared to the other two cases due to the internal sloshing and the external wave actions the pitching angle fluctuates continuously for the yawing motion in case of the model with an opening away from the incident waves the model will firstly revolve around the end of the flooding cabin counterclockwise and then rotate clockwise under the wave force because the counteract of flooding water and wave forces a smaller yawing angle occurs however in case of the model with an opening towards the incident waves the body rotates clockwise around the end of the flooding cabin continuously and thus a larger yawing angle is caused what s more different flooding speeds also make different weights and immersing depths of the flooding end thus the yawing torque and angle are also affected in this process the wave force plays a dominant role and finally the ship model yaws clockwise for the rolling motion the model firstly rolls to the side of the opening before the action of incident waves but begins to rotate repeatedly near the equilibrium position under the wave force and the maximum angle is up to 10 because of the superposition of the rolling velocities caused by the flooding water and by the wave action the rolling angle in the case of the opening away from the incident waves is larger than the case towards the incident waves relatively speaking the rotating responses of the damaged ship motion in the former case is more dangerous 5 conclusions in this paper a weakly compressible 3d sph method is applied to investigate the dynamic flooding process of a damaged ship cabin in waves firstly the governing equation the fluid structure interface treatment the non reflection sponger layer and the extraction and visualization of the flow field characteristics are respectively discussed then the results of a damaged cabin flooding experiment and the numerical wave tank are used to validate the accuracy of the present method furthermore the dynamic responses of a damaged ship model with three cabins subjected to transversal waves are studied when the waves slamming on the damaged ship the relative position between the opening and the water surface will be changed thus the flooding process of the cabin is disturbed generally the flooding end drifts with a large amplitude and the opposite end shakes with a high frequency simultaneously it may cause green waters on the deck and worsen the flooding environment compared to the case in still water the damaged ship model in waves will translate and rotate along with the wave propagation when the opening is away from the incident waves the depth of the opening immersing into water increases so under the environmental pressure the flooding speed and quantity become large and thus the flooding end sinks rapidly however for the opening towards the incident waves the opening is lifted thus the flooding speed decreases and sometimes even tends to zero the flooding progress becomes slow and a smaller flooding quantity occurs at the same moment when the wave crests and troughs alternatively pass the damaged ship model the coupling of the internal sloshing the external waves and the damaged ship becomes violent and the ship is flooded accompanied with continuous shaking the incident waves will aggravate the swaying heaving and surging of the damaged body with an opening away from the waves because of the force superposition of the wave slamming and water sloshing conversely they counteract each other for the flooding body with the opening towards the waves besides the ship model could rotate around the end of the flooding cabin the model with the opening away from the incident waves appears larger pitching and rolling angles compared to the case of the opening towards the waves especially the rolling motion is more violent as a result for a damaged ship in waves without water accumulation on deck the opening exposed to the incident wave direction may be preferred regarding the 6 dof motions acknowledgements this paper is supported by the national

23154,compared to the case in still water a damaged ship flooding in waves can be more complex with more violent shaking and accompanied by wave breaking and splashing therefore in this work a numerical study regarding the damaged ship cabin flooding in transversal regular waves is carried out based on a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph method firstly the governing equation the fluid structure interface treatment the non reflection sponge layer boundary and the information extraction of particle flow field are discussed respectively then the numerical method is validated from two aspects the experiment of a damaged ship cabin flooding is carried out to test the accuracy of the fluid structure interaction model and a standard example is employed to validate the regular wave model furthermore the influences of transversal regular waves on the flooding of a damaged ship cabin are explored the openings at the broadside away from and towards the incident wave are considered the six degree of freedom 6 dof responses of the ship body to the incident waves are focused this study can provide references for the hydrodynamic performance of damaged ships and decision makings of the rescue after marine accident keywords damaged ship dynamic flooding sph transversal wave 6 dof response 1 introduction when a ship subjected to collision reef or underwater explosion a large breaking could be caused ming et al 2016 so the water under the waterline will gradually flood the damaged cabin in a minor case it may cause the hull shaking the buoyancy and stability decreasing and the internal structure damaged while in the serious case it may make the ship capsized or broken from the middle cross section it is significant to study the dynamic responses of the damaged ship in time domain the numerical tools with increasing complexity to simulate a damaged ship flooding can be divided into four main groups the first one is the quasi static methods which assume the water surface in the flooded cabin is static all the time ruponen et al 2007 santos and soares 2009 dankowski and krüger 2012 the flooding water in the cabin is always treated as the increase of displacement or the loss of buoyancy it is suitable for simulating the slow flooding process e g the progressive flooding however scholars gradually realized that the dynamic process of continuous flooding may be more dangerous so the second group is raised namely the lumped mass models with a moving plane water surface papanikolaou et al 2000 jasionowski 2001 spanos 2001 fujiwara and haraguchi 2005 manderbacka et al 2015 in this group the flooding water is regarded as a mass block connected with the hull by the spring with the lumped mass model the water surface is flat not always horizontal and can move accounting for the effect of flooding water motion therefore the force on the hull and the motion damping of the damaged ship could be obtained analytically because the sloshing of the flooding water is not taken into account many studies also employed the third group for the sloshing pressure such as the shallow water equation or the sloshing tank model santos and soares 2008 in this case the sloshing pressure of the flooding water is solved separately and loaded on the hull directly obviously though the dynamic motion of the flooding water is included the violent coupling between the ship hull and the flooding water is not considered adequately the nonlinear characteristics such as slamming splashing and so on should be considered therefore the fourth group i e computational fluid dynamics cfd codes such as vof sph mps etc are applied for simulating violent and complex flooding phenomena le touzé et al 2010 gao et al 2011 shen and vassalos 2011 hosseini 2012 souto iglesias et al 2014 besides the numerical tools some scholars also tried to understand the dynamic flooding process by experiments letizia et al 2004 lee et al 2007 ruponen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 acanfora and de luca 2016 cheng et al 2017 the motions of the damaged and intact ship can be compared and some details about the flow in the cabin and at the opening are captured many results have been demonstrated that the inflow and outflow of water at the opening and the water flow in the flooding cabin had great influences on the recovery moment of the hull letizia et al 2004 lee et al 2007 the ship rolling are mainly determined by the opening location rather than the size acanfora and de luca 2016 and the stability of a damaged ship with a broadside opening is worse but some parameters e g the sinking time are more favorable for rescue activities zhang et al 2013 cheng et al 2017 recently more and more researches are concentrated on the flooding of damaged ships in different waves because when the damaged ships floods in waves the process becomes more violent chan et al 2002 korkut et al 2004 2005 andrewartha et al 2008 the waves take great effects on the water flow process and further the ship responses especially for the rolling motion of the ship in transversal waves many methods are used to solve the wave force on the damaged ship for example the slicing method with the potential flow theory actually the flooding process of a damaged ship is a complex fluid structure interaction problem related to the external wave the hull and the sloshing in the cabin the problem is featured by breaking splashing and other nonlinear problems so it often encounters great challenges to solve such problems smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is a lagrangian particle method and it is very advantage of dealing with large deformation problems of free surface flow and fluid structure interaction campbell and vignjevicp m m s 2009 marrone et al 2011 gomez gesteira et al 2012 messahel and souli 2013 liu et al 2014 gui et al 2015 ren et al 2015 violeau and rogers 2016 ming et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wen and ren 2018 he et al 2018 until now there are few researches on simulating a damaged ship flooding using sph method some existing studies are restricted to the flooding of the ship cabin with a simple geometry and only several degrees of freedom are considered shen and vassalos 2011 zhang et al 2013 cheng et al 2017 skaar 2006 cao et al 2018 the coupling among the flooding water the wave and the ship hull needs to study in depth in this paper the weakly compressible sph wcsph method is applied to study the influences of transversal waves on the dynamic flooding process of a damaged ship cabin the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the three dimensional wcsph model is discussed colagrossi and landrini 2003 liu and liu 2003 in section 3 several examples and the results of model experiments are used to validate the accuracy of the fluid structure interaction model and the numerical wave model in section 4 the model of a damaged ship cabin flooding in transversal waves is established and then the 6 dof responses are studied in section 5 some important conclusions are enclosed 2 theoretical background the adaptive lagrangian particle method i e sph is applied to solve the complex interactions between the wave the hull and the sloshing based on the approximation of weakly compressible fluid marrone 2012 the wcsph model is discussed in this section in terms of governing equation fluid structure coupling interface etc 2 1 state equation of weakly compressible fluid water is undoubtedly compressible in nature however in computational fluid dynamics codes the compressibility is not considered under some cases in order to simplify problems most scholars believe that when the mach number is less than 0 1 the compressibility of water can be neglected when the mach number exceeds 0 1 it is necessary to consider the compressibility in the compressible or weakly compressible sph methods conservation equations are solved directly as an explicit solution its time marching scheme requires a stable time step δ t and it depends on the condition of courant fredrich levy morris et al 1997 considering the restrictions of particle acceleration viscous force and combined courant viscous force namely δ t min δ t f δ t υ δ t c they can be expressed respectively as follows 1 δ t f α f min i h i a i δ t υ α υ min i h i 2 υ δ t c α c min i h i c 0 where α f 0 25 α υ 0 125 α c 0 25 a is the particle acceleration υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient h is the smoothing length v and r are velocity and position vector i and j are a pair of interacting particles obviously the greater the sound speed the smaller the required stable time step because the real sound speed of water is about 1480 m s so it leads to a very small stable time step moreover the velocity of the global flow is finite in free surface flow problems so the mach number is often very small given this reason monaghan proposed the wcsph model monaghan 1994 by reducing the real speed of sound a proper artificial sound speed is used and thus a larger time step is obtained by the approximate incompressible condition one obtains 2 m a v c 0 0 1 so in order to satisfy this condition throughout the fluid domain it holds 3 c 0 10 max v this artificial sound speed can ensure an acceptable time step while guaranteeing the fluid flow characteristics the fluid with a modified sound speed is weakly compressible and the tait equation is commonly used to describe the relationship of pressure and density monaghan 1994 namely 4 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 ρ 0 is the density at p 0 for water γ 7 b is related to the sound speed which can be defined by the following relationship 5 c p ρ γ p b ρ substituting the initial state variables ρ 0 c 0 and p 0 into this equation one gets 6 b ρ 0 c 0 2 γ 2 2 sph equation for weakly compressible fluid when the peak pressure of weakly compressible fluid is below 1 gpa the effect of energy variation on flow characteristics can be neglected marrone 2012 the sph governing equations conserve the mass and momentum namely 7 d ρ i d t ρ i i v i 8 d v i d t g i i p ρ i in the framework of wcsph the above equation can be discretized as follows 9 d ρ i d t ρ i j v j v i i w i j v j i 10 d v i d t g i j p j p i ρ i v j i w i j i 11 i ξ c 0 h i j ρ j ρ i r j r i r j r i 2 i w i j v j 12 i ζ h i j m j c i c j v j v i r j r i ρ i ρ j r j r i 2 0 01 h 2 i w i j where i and j are a pair of interacting particles ρ p c v and r denote the density the pressure the sound speed the velocity and the position vector respectively g is the gravity acceleration and 9 81m s 2 is used the last term in the mass conservation equation indicates the density diffusion marrone et al 2011 which converges to 0 as the particle resolution is refined it not only preserves the mass conservation but suppresses the high frequency noises in the flow field the adjustable parameter ξ is 0 2 the last term of the momentum equation is the artificial viscosity monaghan and gingold 1983 which is different from the traditional viscosity term regarding the condition v j v i r j r i 0 it is more helpful to the stability even with a smaller coefficient ζ moreover it can be related to the physical viscosity with the equation ζ 2 υ d 2 h c 0 where d is the dimension for some violent case the real physical viscosity can be neglected and only the artificial viscosity term is considered the adjustable parameter ζ is selected as 0 005 w r h is the kernel function r r i r j and the improved gaussian function is used marrone 2012 its form is 13 w r h e r h 2 e δ h 2 2 π 0 δ r e r h 2 e δ h 2 d r α e r h 2 c r δ where the parameters are δ 3 h and c e 9 α h d π d 2 1 10 e 9 1 the improved function has almost identical shape with the original gaussian kernel function but it strictly guarantees the condition w g 0 on the boundary surface of the support domain meanwhile compared with the cubic spline function it is more smoothness the radius of the support domain 3 h is larger than that of cubic spline function 2 h therefore more particles are used for approximation so that the approximations have a better stability however a larger support domain also reduces the computational efficiency especially in 3d problems the computational complexity increases drastically smith et al 2003 the equation system of continuity equation momentum equation and the state equation is completely closed and three unknown parameters can be solved i e the density the velocity and the pressure thus the weakly compressible sph model for the fluid is established 2 3 treatment of fluid structure interface the flooding of a damaged ship is a transient and complicated process of fluid and structure interaction the fluid structure interface treatment is particularly critical for capturing the dynamic responses of the damaged ship during the interaction of fluid and structure the structure can be regarded as the boundary of fluid considering the curvature of structure boundary the treatment is not identical for the structure with a small curvature mirror particles can be used to satisfy the completeness of kernel function e g the dummy particle boundary adami et al 2012 however for the structure with a large curvature the arrangement of mirror particles becomes very difficult especially for a uniform arrangement in this case the structure boundary discretized into a layer of particles is warmly welcomed e g the normal flux method de leffe et al 2008 the projection boundary gong et al 2016 in this paper dummy particle boundary is used to model the ship cabin wall adami et al 2012 sun et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 because the improved gaussian kernel function is adopted if the smoothing length is 1 2 times of the particle spacing at least four layers of particles are needed to discretize the wall to guarantee the consistency of kernel function these wall particles b a b d v b d t are not solved by state of equation but interpolated from the surrounding fluid particles f therefore when taking into account the role of all fluid particles in the support domain and normalizing the kernel function one obtains 14 p b f w b f ρ f g a b r b r f p f f w b f this is the approximate pressure of the wall particles moreover through the state of equation of weakly compressible fluid the density of wall particles can be solved 15 ρ b ρ 0 p b b 1 1 γ through treatments mentioned above the information of dummy particles can be obtained from fluid particles in the support domain while inversely the approximation of fluid particles near the wall also considers the role of dummy particles in the support domain this treatment satisfies both the completeness of the kernel approximation near the boundary and the continuity conditions at the interface 2 4 non reflection sponge layer boundary sometimes the actual physical boundary is far away from the focused region thus we have to intercept a proportion of the domain centered by the focused region to simulate so as to reduce the numerical cost when pressure waves reach the boundary of computational domain they will be reflected so the pressure of the inner domain is affected therefore it is necessary to make the intercepting boundary no reflection at present there are several boundary treatments for non reflection such as the damping layer and the impedance matching layer but it seems like no ideal method of non reflection in sph method a damping layer with a thickness of d is always arranged outside the boundary i e sponge layer to suppress the reflection of pressure waves gong et al 2011 the mass conservation equation for particles in the sponger layer can be modified as follows 16 ρ n 1 ρ n ϑ d ρ n d t δ t where ϑ is the coefficient defined as follows 17 ϑ 1 a 0 9 b η 18 η z s z w d herein z s and z w are projection positions of particles in the layer and at the interface in the direction of the interface normal respectively the constant parameters are a 9 and b 50 obviously the treatment is very simple and only needs to lay some particles outside of the boundary to suppress the reflection of pressure waves however the computational costs are also increased especially for three dimensional problems the amount of particles for the layer is quite considerable 2 5 visualization of particle flow field sph is a purely lagrangian particle method it is difficult to extract all flow field characteristics from scattered particles especially for the data processing e g differential or integral also there are great difficulties to obtain envelope surface iso surface and render illumination and transparency etc however if the information of sph particles is interpolated to the background grid these operations will be more convenient and benefit the analysis of flow field characteristics as shown in fig 2 firstly we lay the background grids for the sph particle domain the grid size is same as the initial particle spacing then the background grid nodes are identified as color particles of flag 1 while sph particles are identified as color particles of flag 0 these two kinds of color particles are placed in a same domain for searching by means of the kernel function for a particle i the shape function is defined as 19 φ i j v j w i j flag i flag j where j is the particle with different colors in the support domain of particle i for a color particle i with flag 1 if φ i is solved the iso surface of φ i will be determined generally the color particle with φ i 0 5 is considered in the fluid domain the physical quantities of the particle are obtained from the neighboring sph particles by interpolating for example the quantity f of this particle can be obtained by 20 f i j f j v j w i j x i j φ i flag i 1 flag j 0 after determining the physical quantities of color particles with flag 1 the corresponding values of each grid node and element can be also obtained through the topological structure therefore the mapping between sph particles and background grids is realized because the spacing of sph particles and the size of background grids are same and both very small so the error of the interpolation result is very small fig 3 shows the post processing results of the dam breaking model the left column is the result displayed via sph particles whereas the right one is displayed by mapping the information from sph particles to the background grids it can be found that the flow information after interpolating from sph particles to the background grids is consistent the pressure contour and the deformation of free surface can be easily obtained this method is advantageous to extract and visualize the complex flow characteristics 3 numerical validation 3 1 experiment of a damaged ship cabin flooding this section aims to validate the fluid structure interaction model established in this paper through the model experiment of a damaged ship cabin flooding the layout of the experiment is shown in fig 4 the whole experiment device consists of a water tank two high speed cameras a ship model with three cabins and its balance installation etc as plotted in fig 4 the water tank is fabricated by transparent polymethyl methacrylate pmma which facilitates high speed camera capturing and recording the length width and height of the water tank are all 0 8m the height of the initial water surface is 0 6m the ship model is placed at the center of the tank and initially floats with a draught during the experiment two high speed cameras are placed on the front and the left side of the tank respectively to record the frontal and lateral images of the cabin flooding thus the datum of the translational and rotational motions can be extracted the ship model and the opening used in experiments are shown in fig 5 a the ship model has a length of 360 mm a width of 180 mm and a depth of 120 mm the internal and external diameters of the bilge arc are 18 mm and 30 mm respectively there are three cabins containing two watertight cabins and a flooded cabin with a side opening of 35 mm in diameter the wall thickness of this model is 12 mm and the displacement is 3 6 kg when initially placed in water it is fixed and balanced by a lightweight rope as presented in fig 5 b firstly the opening is sealed by a piece of thin film made from smooth hydrophobic material to prevent the water flow from entering when the experiment begins the rope is cut off simultaneously the film is pulled off quickly and thus the cabin begins to flood the exhaust vent with a diameter of 30 mm is opened at the top of cabin so as the effect of air flow can be avoid which has been tested in the following experiment fig 6 shows the comparisons between the numerical and the experimental results due to the center of the opening located at the waterline at the initial stage so the water begins to flow into the cabin through a partial section under the hydrostatic pressure the water passes through the opening and then flows towards the other broadside because the velocity is very slow so the water surface is regular and no air is involved however with the increase of the flooding water the cabin begins to drift and roll simultaneously the end of the flooding cabin gradually sinks fig 7 shows the time histories of the heaving and swaying of the gravity center respectively at the initial stage because the flooding is slow the vertical and transversal velocities of the ship model are relatively small however with the increasing of the flooding quantity the gravity center drops downward rapidly and the transversal drift also speeds up when the cabin is nearly flooded up with water the heaving and swaying motions tend to steady comparing the numerical and experimental results the overall trend is consistent but there are still some errors which are less than five percent the errors may be due to the disturbances in the release process and thus affect the model motions fig 8 presents the histories of pitching and yawing angles respectively because the flooding at the initial is slow the pitching and yawing moments caused by the flooding water are very small however with the increasing of the flooding water the model gradually tilts the water accumulation will aggravate the tilting process therefore both the angular acceleration and the angular velocity increase with the increase of pitching and yawing angles the balance reaches between the tilting and the recovering moment and the flooding quantity tends to steady the angular movement tends to stop during the whole process numerical results are very close to the experiment ones the error may be from the experiment tests and the air effects in the flooding process therefore the reliability of the present fluid structure interaction model is validated 3 2 numerical wave tank in order to investigate the response characteristics of a damaged ship flooding in waves the accuracy of the numerical wave tank is tested in this section the model experiment of a floating body moving in waves carried out by hadžić is used hadžić et al 2005 the experiment layout is plotted in fig 9 the floating body has a mass of 0 986 kg a density of 680kg m 3 and a rotary inertia of 14 kg cm 2 its side lengths are 0 10m and 0 05m the center of the body is 2 11m away from the flapping wavemaker which is placed on the left of the water domain the wavemaker rotates like the experiment by hadžić et al 2005 fig 10 shows the pressure field of the interactions between the wave and the floating body when the wavemaker rolls periodically a regular wave is produced and the body begins to move in waves the pressure field around the body is smooth fig 11 a shows the experimental and numerical results of the wave height at the point of 1 16m away from the wavemaker correspondingly the heaving motion of the floating body is presented in fig 11 b the sph results agree well with the experimental ones the error of wave height is less than one percent though there are some deviations of the heaving motion of floating body in time axis the amplitude is also very close the error may be from the difference between the 3d experiment and 2d numerical results though the 2d assumption had been validated in many published papers in summary this still indicates that the sph method established in this paper has a good accuracy when simulating the interactions between floating bodies and waves 4 results and discussions when a ship is damaged at sea it is difficult to avoid the invasion of waves the incident waves can change the hydrodynamic environment and thus the floating state of ships are changed in detail the waves may disturb the relative position between the opening and the waterline so that the process of flooding is affected according to the relative position between the opening and the waterline the flooding cabin can be divided into three types in the first type the opening is located under the water surface and the upper roof of the flooding cabin is watertight so the flooding quantity is constant and there is no free surface sloshing in the cabin in the second type the cabin is flooded due to some factors e g green water the internal and external liquids are not connected and the free surface sloshing formed in the third type the upper roof is above the water surface and there is free surface sloshing formed by the connected water in and out of the damaged cabin the coupling of the cabin the internal sloshing and the external waves is obvious in this section the last type of the flooding cabin is focused taking the damaged ship model with a broadside opening for an example the 3d sph method is applied to model the numerical wave tank and simulate the flooding process the opening away from and towards the incident wave is respectively considered and the response characteristics of the damaged ship model are studied a damaged ship model with three cabins of same sizes is established in fig 12 a there are two watertight cabins and a flooded cabin with a broadside opening of 1 2m in diameter it has a length l of 12m x direction a width b of 6m y direction and a depth d of 4m z direction the displacement is 149 kg with a draught of 2m the rotary inertias of the ship model about the principle axis in x y and z directions are i z 2 06 10 6 kg m 2 i y 2 32 10 6 kg m 2 i x 7 91 10 5 kg m 2 respectively the ship model is placed in a numerical wave tank with the sizes of x 20m y 30m z 6m as shown in fig 12 b the coordinate origin a lies at the corner point of the water domain the coordinates of the gravity center at the beginning are x g 10m y g 10m z g 6m the openings of 1 and 2 do not exist simultaneously the opening of 1 is towards the incident waves but away from the incident waves for the opening of 2 the model is released suddenly at the beginning and meanwhile the opening is opened the floating state with an initial draught of 2m begins to alter in order to better understand the wave effects the same ship cabin model is also placed in still water the flooding process is compared with that in waves in all the three cases the air is not modeled the water domains of still water and wave tank are respectively discretized into 1 820 566 and 5 322 565 particles and the ship model is represented by 89 435 particles the dummy particle boundary condition is applied the present program is paralleled by openmp command language and run on a dell workstation with 50 threads because it has to model the wave tank and overcome the wave reflection the particle number of the wave case increases greatly the cpu times is about 70 h for the case of flooding in still water and about 216 h for the case of flooding in waves the cpu time of the latter case is about 3 times that of the former case the relative position between the wave and the opening is considered the time history of the amplitude of the wavemaker is plotted in fig 13 the frequency and the amplitude of the flapping wavemaker are 0 36hz and 7 rad respectively for this water depth the regular waves will be produced with a wavelength of 14 3m and a wave height of 1 1m 4 1 flooding process of the opening away from the incident waves fig 14 shows the velocity field when the damaged ship model flooding with the opening away from the incident wave at the initial moment the model is placed in still water and the flooding process is very slow at t 2 5 s the regular waves produced by the wavemaker propagate to the ship model the flooding water in the cabin is very little and accumulated on the other side of the opening at t 10 s the whole model acts completely with the incident wave and rides on crest so the tilt angle changes greatly the end of the model far away from the flooding cabin is lifted and the immersion depth of the opening becomes larger so the flooding quantity and flooding speed increase obviously meanwhile due to the slamming of the waves on the model the breaking water splashes and drops down to the water surface and thus some uneven pits are produced as plotted in fig 14 c with the increase of flooding water at t 15 s the end of the flooding cabin sinks seriously and there are noticeable green waters on the deck see in fig 14 d the buoyancy and stability of the damaged cabin are reduced after t 20 s the whole model has undergone large tilt and drift motion and the vitality of the ship model is threatened greatly in this period the green water is not accumulated because of the watertight and flat deck until t 25 s the flooding cabin is almost filled up and the other end far away from the flooding cabin is almost raised up obviously the motion of the damaged model in waves is much more severe than that in still water 4 2 flooding process of the opening towards the incident waves the flooding process of the damaged ship model with the opening towards the incident waves is plotted in fig 15 before t 2 5 s the flooding process is similar to the case in still water when t 10 s the model is riding at the crest and the opening is exposed and lifted above the water surface therefore the flooding progress is stopped but the water sloshing in the cabin continues see in fig 15 c accompanied with the shaking of the cabin the end of the flooding cabin sinks a lot at t 15 s the first wave crest propagates past during this period the inclined hull seems like slipping down from the steep wave surface a larger yawing angle occurs due to the imbalance of the weight distribution along the hull length then the opening is immersed at the trough so the water flows into the cabin more rapidly under a higher pressure and the speed can be up to 12 m s at t 20 s the end of the flooding cabin is almost immersed in water and the motion of the cabin is violent until t 25 s the cabin is almost filled up and the end away from the opening is lifted the yawing angle is almost up to 60 during this period the incident waves make the cabin almost lose its vitality 4 3 comparison of the openings away from and towards the incident waves in order to give a global understanding of the cabin flooding and the ship responses the configurations of the coordinate system and the ship cabin model for the opening away from and towards the waves are respectively shown in fig 16 a and b an observed line along the length direction is selected the two endpoints of the line are located at the middle of the width for the case in still water the configuration is similar to fig 16 a except the incident waves fig 17 gives several typical instants of the cabin flooding process as we see the process of the water flooding the cabin before the arrival of the waves is similar the water flows through the partial section of the opening and impacts on the bottom of the cabin then it sloshes with the motion of the cabin and gradually accumulates at the lower corner see in fig 17 a when the waves arrive and interact with the model the flooding speed is changed for the case of the opening away from the waves the cabin is flooded rapidly while for the opening towards the waves the opening is lifted and the flooding progress is almost paused as shown in fig 17 b during this period the water surface inside and outside is connected and deforms drastically the free surface couples with the ship model violently with the sinking of the ship model the cabin with the opening away from the waves floods more water than the case with the opening towards the waves moreover the sloshing amplitude is very large and can touch the deck however the latter one has a larger yawing angle under the wave actions as plotted in fig 17 c finally see in fig 17 d both the cabins with different openings are mostly filled with water but the convection at the opening still takes place accompanied by the shaking of the ship model the motion of the observed line in different views for the flooding in still water is plotted in fig 18 where dx dy and dz indicate the displacements in the direction x y and z respectively the two ends of the cabin show different laws see in fig 18 a the flooding end is generally accompanied by a large amplitude motion and the opposite end shows a high frequency shaking due to the effect of the flooding water the end c of the flooding cabin drifts and sinks greatly and the end d tilts up slightly see in fig 18 b d the swaying amplitude of the end c is up to 0 4 times of the width and the sinking amplitude is larger than the module depth when the cabin tends to be filled up the shaking with a small amplitude and a large frequency takes place as plotted in fig 18 d overall the responses in still water are not violent and the motion amplitude is comparable to the principle dimension the motions of the observed line for the ship flooding with the opening away from and towards the waves are shown in fig 19 as we see in fig 19 a the amplitude of the ship motion becomes larger than the case of flooding in still water the end c of the flooding cabin gradually sinks into water while the other end d firstly moves steadily and then begins to shake with a high frequency when the water flooding progress tends to be slow before the arrival of the wave the ship responds to the flooding water with a smaller amplitude however when the wave acts on the ship model the ship model drifts a distance of about 2 times of the model width along the wave direction the cabin is rapidly flooded more water the end c sinks more for the case of the opening away from the incident waves and thus the model has a smaller yawing angle conversely the model of the opening towards the wave direction will be slowly flooded less water and forms a larger torque so the yawing angle is large when the wave crest passes the model the opening is located at the trough and the cabin begins to flood rapidly see in fig 19 c at the later stage when the cabin is almost filled up with water the yawing angle begins to recover see in fig 19 a b for the opening away from the waves the sinking speed of the flooding end c is larger and there are smaller shakes compared to the case of the opening towards the waves as plotted in fig 19 d fig 20 shows the history of the flooding quantity in cases of the opening away from and towards the incident waves respectively the flooding quantity q is normalized by the product of the water density and the principle dimensions of the ship model compared with the case of flooding in still water before t 8 s because the ship models are all placed in still water the water quantity flooding into the cabin is almost identical at t 10 s the waves interact with the ship model completely so the differences of the flooding quantity are made in the case of the opening away from the incident waves the depth of the opening immersing into water is larger than the other cases so the water floods more rapidly under the larger pressure difference see in curve 2 however for the case of the opening towards the incident waves the opening is lifted during this period so there are transient stagnation points in the flooding process which can be referred to the flat part of the curve 1 as the time goes by the flooding water increases continuously in the former case however in the latter case though the flooding water increases slowly at the early stage when the wave crest passes over the ship model the opening is located at the wave trough and flooded rapidly the flooding speed increases gradually and even exceeds the former case because the pressure difference at the opening is enhanced greatly the whole flooding process seems to be breathing and finally the cabin in this case is flooded into more water however for the case in still water the flooding water increases smoothly therefore the relative position between the wave and the opening has significant influences on the flooding process fig 21 shows the time history of the translational displacements of the barycenter during the cabin flooding they show similar tendencies for the cases of the opening away from and towards the incident waves except some differences of the amplitude at the same moment swaying motion to the side of the opening occurs at the initial stage but the amplitude is very small soon under the wave force the model begins to drift transversally along the incident wave direction and meanwhile accompanied with shaking around its dynamic balance position which can be accounted for the action of fluid particles moving in wave field because the slamming area of the model with the opening away from the incident wave is larger than the case of the opening towards the incident waves in addition the responses of the model induced by the flooding water will also partially counteract the swaying motion in the case of the opening towards the incident waves the opening 1 and oppositely aggravate it in the case of the opening away from the incident waves the opening 2 the swaying of the opening away from the wave case is slightly larger than the opening towards the wave case at the same moment for the heaving motion the amplitude of the three cases is very close before the arrival of the incident waves however some differences appear due to the impact of incident waves the ship model in waves will shake greatly while keep smooth in still water also the wave force changes the immersing depth of the opening and thus the flooding speed and flooding quantity are also changed in the case of the opening away from the incident waves the flooding speed and quantity are larger so under the wave action the amplitude of the heaving is also larger at the same moment in the case of the opening towards the wave the ship model almost heaves around the dynamic balance position which is close to the case in still water for the surging motion the ship model in still water and in waves moves to different directions before the wave arrival that is in still water the model moves towards the end of the flooding cabin due to the increase of the flooding water however in wave cases the model has a large yawing motion under the wave action and translates towards the end away from the flooding cabin when the opening is towards the incident waves the broadside with the opening is lifted so the flooding speed is slow and the quantity is small therefore a larger yawing motion is caused under the wave action contrarily the model with an opening away from the incident waves has a rapid flooding process and at the same time the flooding quantity and immersing depth is larger therefore this model is subjected to a larger water resistance and has a smaller yawing angle the surging motion is larger compared to the former case obviously the model does not completely move to the direction of the flooding end but responds to the coupling forces between the waves the sloshing and the damaged model there are multiple degrees of freedom obviously when the wave crest and trough alternately propagate over the model the flooding speed changes violently and thus causes the cabin shaking obviously fig 22 shows the time histories of the rotational angles of the damaged ship model in waves and in still water obviously when the flooding cabin is not affected by waves the responses of the three cases are similar however when the wave propagates to the model the angle increases and the differences occur for the opening away from the incident waves due to a large flooding quantity and speed at the same moment the pitching angle under the actions of wave and flooding water is larger than that in still water and that of the opening towards incident waves because the opening towards the waves is lifted when the model riding on the crest and a slow flooding speed takes place it has a smaller pitching angle at the late stage compared to the other two cases due to the internal sloshing and the external wave actions the pitching angle fluctuates continuously for the yawing motion in case of the model with an opening away from the incident waves the model will firstly revolve around the end of the flooding cabin counterclockwise and then rotate clockwise under the wave force because the counteract of flooding water and wave forces a smaller yawing angle occurs however in case of the model with an opening towards the incident waves the body rotates clockwise around the end of the flooding cabin continuously and thus a larger yawing angle is caused what s more different flooding speeds also make different weights and immersing depths of the flooding end thus the yawing torque and angle are also affected in this process the wave force plays a dominant role and finally the ship model yaws clockwise for the rolling motion the model firstly rolls to the side of the opening before the action of incident waves but begins to rotate repeatedly near the equilibrium position under the wave force and the maximum angle is up to 10 because of the superposition of the rolling velocities caused by the flooding water and by the wave action the rolling angle in the case of the opening away from the incident waves is larger than the case towards the incident waves relatively speaking the rotating responses of the damaged ship motion in the former case is more dangerous 5 conclusions in this paper a weakly compressible 3d sph method is applied to investigate the dynamic flooding process of a damaged ship cabin in waves firstly the governing equation the fluid structure interface treatment the non reflection sponger layer and the extraction and visualization of the flow field characteristics are respectively discussed then the results of a damaged cabin flooding experiment and the numerical wave tank are used to validate the accuracy of the present method furthermore the dynamic responses of a damaged ship model with three cabins subjected to transversal waves are studied when the waves slamming on the damaged ship the relative position between the opening and the water surface will be changed thus the flooding process of the cabin is disturbed generally the flooding end drifts with a large amplitude and the opposite end shakes with a high frequency simultaneously it may cause green waters on the deck and worsen the flooding environment compared to the case in still water the damaged ship model in waves will translate and rotate along with the wave propagation when the opening is away from the incident waves the depth of the opening immersing into water increases so under the environmental pressure the flooding speed and quantity become large and thus the flooding end sinks rapidly however for the opening towards the incident waves the opening is lifted thus the flooding speed decreases and sometimes even tends to zero the flooding progress becomes slow and a smaller flooding quantity occurs at the same moment when the wave crests and troughs alternatively pass the damaged ship model the coupling of the internal sloshing the external waves and the damaged ship becomes violent and the ship is flooded accompanied with continuous shaking the incident waves will aggravate the swaying heaving and surging of the damaged body with an opening away from the waves because of the force superposition of the wave slamming and water sloshing conversely they counteract each other for the flooding body with the opening towards the waves besides the ship model could rotate around the end of the flooding cabin the model with the opening away from the incident waves appears larger pitching and rolling angles compared to the case of the opening towards the waves especially the rolling motion is more violent as a result for a damaged ship in waves without water accumulation on deck the opening exposed to the incident wave direction may be preferred regarding the 6 dof motions acknowledgements this paper is supported by the national
