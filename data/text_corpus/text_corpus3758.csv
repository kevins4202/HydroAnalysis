18790,dosing ferrous ions zvi fe2 combining with oxidants e g h2o2 zvi h2o2 sulfidation treatment s zvi and introducing a weak magnetic field zvi wmf have been widely used to enhance the performance of zerovalent iron zvi for reductive removal of contaminants taking se vi as a probe contaminant this study systematically compared the performances of different zvi systems i e zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf for contaminant removal all the four tested methods could greatly improve the performance of zvi for se vi removal se vi was removed by s zvi at s fe molar ratio of 0 05 with a much greater rate constant than other enhanced zvi technologies while the maximum amount of se vi removal was obtained in zvi fe2 system with fe2 applied at 0 5 mm among the four tested enhanced zvi technologies at initial ph 6 0 in addition se vi removal by zvi fe2 was least influenced by initial ph compared to the other tested enhanced zvi systems implying its good adaptability of ph the application of these tested methods could significantly increase the electron efficiency from 0 5 to 4 06 8 72 and fe2 application was much more efficient in enhancing the electron efficiency than the other three methods finally the perspective of these enhanced zvi technologies was compared in terms of their reactivity selectivity chemical cost and ph adaptability and some suggestions for their possible application were provided graphical abstract image 1 keywords zerovalent iron electron efficiency kinetics removal capacity reduction 1 introduction the application of microscale zerovalent iron zvi has proved to be an environmental friendly approach for reductive removal of a variety of contaminants such as halogenated organics nitroaromatics and oxyanions e g selenate selenite bromate perchlorate since zvi is readily available relatively inexpensive and nontoxic guan et al 2015 kanel et al 2005 liang et al 2013 litter et al 2010 liu et al 2016 zvi can be applied in groundwater remediation gillham and ohannesin 1994 matheson and tratnyek 1994 industrial wastewater treatment btatkeu k et al 2016 mantha et al 2001 as well as drinking water treatment lin and lin 2017 noubactep 2008 when zvi is used in groundwater remediation reactive lifetime and reactivity are two important factors affecting its successful application fan et al 2016b gu et al 2017 xie and cwiertny 2010 however the reaction of zvi with non target dissolved oxygen and water during groundwater remediation can reduce the selectivity and longevity of zvi fan et al 2016b a high reactivity of zvi towards target contaminant in wastewater and drinking water treatment is preferred because the volume of the reactor can be lowered once the reactivity of zvi is enhanced besides the reactivity of zvi the removal capacity of zvi for the target contaminant defined as the maximum amount of contaminant removed by zvi under specific reaction conditions is very critical for successful application of a zvi system in water and wastewater treatment qin et al 2017 increasing the removal capacity of zvi for target contaminant can decrease the cost of zvi and the subsequent sludge disposal cost when the target contaminant is removed by zvi via reduction the capacity of zvi is determined by both the selectivity or electron efficiency of zvi the ratio of the electrons accepted by target contaminants to all the electrons donated by fe0 and the utilization ratio ur of fe0 in zvi particles li et al 2018a qin et al 2017 zvi generally has low reactivity since it is covered with an intrinsic passive layer generated during the high temperature manufacturing process and has a relatively low specific surface area guan et al 2015 therefore many methods have been developed to improve the reactivity of zvi such as pretreatment of pristine zvi with magnetization li et al 2015 2017a or acid washing lin and lin 2017 increasing the specific surface area of zvi by fabricating nanoscale zvi nzvi li et al 2006 combining zvi with noble metals e g pd or pt to form bimetals he et al 2016 xu et al 2012 coupling zvi with chemicals various metal ions or oxidants guo et al 2016 li et al 2018b tang et al 2014a 2016 application of weak magnetic field wmf liang et al 2014a 2014b as well as sulfidation treatment of zvi fan et al 2017 li et al 2017b 2018a among these methods fe2 dosing oxidant application sulfidation and wmf superimposition have drawn a lot of attention because they are reported to be efficient environmental friendly cost effective and easily to be applied zhang and his colleagues are among the first to report the enhancing effect of fe2 on reductive removal of contaminant by zvi huang and zhang 2005 huang et al 2003 our previous study revealed that the application of 1 0 mm fe ii increased the electron selectivity of zvi toward se vi from 3 2 3 6 to 6 2 6 8 and enhanced the se vi removal capacity by 100 180 under aerobic conditions qin et al 2017 the studies of guo et al 2015 and li et al 2018b showed that applying strong oxidants such as h2o2 kmno4 and naclo could considerably accelerate the reductive removal of nitrate and selenite by zvi our previous studies revealed that the rate constants of metal loid s sequestration by pristine zvi or aged zvi could be increased by 1 3 383 7 folds due to the application of wmf li et al 2017c liang et al 2014b sun et al 2014 quite a few literature showed that sulfidation could lead to a dramatic increase in the reactivity and selectivity of nzvi under anaerobic conditions fan et al 2016a 2017 kim et al 2011 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and our previous study demonstrated that the reactivity and selectivity of zvi towards chromate under aerobic conditions could be also enhanced li et al 2018a although the influences of fe2 dosing oxidant application sulfidation and wmf superimposition on contaminants removal by zvi have been extensively investigated very few studies have compared the performance of these zvi enhancing techniques and most of these studies only employed the system of contaminants removal by zvi alone as the benchmark system for comparison different reaction conditions including the origins of zvi the properties and concentrations of contaminants ph as well as reaction atmosphere were employed in different literature for investigating the performance of these zvi enhancing methods which makes the direct comparison among these zvi enhancing methods difficult the comparison of these enhancing methods in terms of the reactivity selectivity and removal capacity of zvi towards target contaminant will definitely benefit the better application of zvi technology selenate similar to sulfate is hard to be removed by the conventional methods such as coagulation lime softening and adsorption zhang et al 2010 but it can be removed by zvi via reduction liang et al 2015 therefore taking se vi as a probe contaminant the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the kinetics of se vi removal by zvi coupled with four enhancing techniques fe2 application h2o2 dosing sulfidation wmf under various reaction conditions 2 determine the reactivity selectivity removal capacity and utilization ratio of zvi coupled with these enhancing techniques 3 systematically compare these four zvi enhancing techniques so as to provide some suggestions for application of zvi based technologies the results of this study will be important for the selection and application of enhanced zvi technologies in wastewater treatment and groundwater remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of analytical grade and all solutions were prepared with deionized di water from a milli q system zvi with a d50 of 46 2 Î¼m was purchased from alfa aesar chemical reagent company and used in this study s zvi was prepared following the ball milling method used in our previous study li et al 2018a and the details of preparing s zvi are presented in text s1 of the supporting information si the brunauer emmet teller bet surface areas of pristine zvi ball milled zvi without s and that with s were determined their scanning electron microscope sem images were collected and are present in fig s1 the details of the methods for bet surface area determination and sem images collection are presented in text s2 sodium selenate na2seo4 was supplied by the xiya reagent company all other chemical reagents were purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent company all chemicals were used as received stock solution of 1000 mg l se vi was prepared by dissolving na2seo4 in di water 2 2 experimental procedures all batch experiments were performed in a wide mouth bottle containing 500 ml working solution at 25 c and open to the air the working solution containing 30 mg l se vi and 1 0 mm nacl was freshly prepared for each batch test the solution was mixed at 400 rpm with a propeller agitator d2004w shanghai sile instrument co ltd to investigate the influence of fe2 application on se vi removal by zvi batch tests were initiated by adding 0 25 g zvi and different amounts of fecl2 4h2o simultaneously into the working solution similarly different amounts of h2o2 and 0 25 g zvi were simultaneously dosed into the working solution to determine the enhancing effect of h2o2 on se vi sequestration by zvi it should be noted that h2o2 was employed as a representative oxidant to determine the influence of oxidant application on the performance of zvi because h2o2 was inexpensive and environmental friendly to explore the behavior of se vi removal by s zvi batch experiments were performed by adding 0 25 g s zvi with different s fe molar ratios into the working solution for the experiments testing the behavior of se vi removal by zvi wmf an electromagnet electromagnet power supply model 7050 purchased from east changing technologies inc beijing was employed to supply uniform mf of different intensities the initial ph ph0 of the working solution was adjusted with hcl or naoh to pre determined values and no attempts were made to maintain ph constant during the experiment at fixed time intervals approximately 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and passed through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane filter and then acidified for analysis the reacted zvi particles after the batch tests were collected by vacuum filtration with 0 22 Î¼m membrane filters washed with di water freeze dried in vacuum and then preserved in a glove box for subsequent characterization each test was performed in duplicate and error bars in the figures show the standard deviations of test results 2 3 analytical methods ph of the working solution was monitored with commercial electrodes inesa phs 3c jbp 607 the concentrations of aqueous total se setot and total fe fetot were determined with an atomic absorption spectrometer thermo fisher scientific ice 3300 aas whereas the speciation of se iv and se vi in aqueous phase was determined with hplc icp ms agilent hplc 1200 icpms 7700 following a published method li et al 2008 the mass of fe0 in zvi samples was determined by measuring the volume of h2 yield for the samples dissolved in hcl of 6 0 mol l and the details of this method are presented in text s3 the dissolved fe2 concentration was determined with the ferrozine method on an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer purkinje tu 1902 at the wavelength of 510 nm x ray absorption fine structure xafs analyses were carried out to quantify the fractions of different iron hydro oxides in the solid phase and the details are summarized in text s4 the fractions of s ii s i s 0 and s vi in the solid phase and in the aqueous solution were determined with x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps and ion chromatography ic respectively the fractions of se 0 se iv and se vi in the solid phase were derived from the linear combination fitting lcf of the se k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra the details of these characterizing methods and the corresponding calculating methods are presented in text s5 and s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics and amounts of se vi removal in different processes and the corresponding zvi corrosion the kinetics of se vi removal in zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf processes at ph0 6 0 as functions of fe2 concentration h2o2 concentration s fe molar ratio and intensity of mf respectively are presented in fig s2 it was found that 4 1 of se vi was removed by zvi alone within 72 h without enhancing techniques compared to zvi used in our previous study d50 108 2 Î¼m qin et al 2017 zvi employed in this study d50 46 2 Î¼m had much smaller reactivity towards se vi obviously the reactivity of zvi samples from different origins was very different depending on many factors besides particle size which resulted in the difficulties in comparing the results from different studies consequently it was impossible to compare the performance of zvi coupled with different enhancing methods without employing well controlled reaction conditions upon the introduction of fe2 h2o2 or wmf into the zvi system or after the sulfidation treatment of zvi particles the removal of se vi was considerably accelerated and the amount of removed se vi at equilibrium was greatly increased which was consistent with the results reported in the literature li et al 2017b liang et al 2015 tang et al 2014b yang et al 2018 to better understand the influence of the four enhancing methods on the reactivity of zvi towards se vi removal the kinetics of se vi removal were simulated with pseudo first order rate law fig s3 and the obtained rate constants k obs were summarized in fig 1 it should be noted that the removal rates were quantified only using the initial portions of se vi removal data sets fig s3 since a tailing behavior was always involved in these reactions fig 1a and b depicted the variation of rate constants and quantity of se vi removed by zvi as a function of the dosed fe2 concentration at ph0 6 0 it was found that the se vi removal rate increased progressively from 0 004 h 1 to 0 078 h 1 with increasing the fe2 concentration from 0 1 mm to 4 0 mm the enhancing effect of fe2 may be associated with two reasons one is the ph drop due to fe2 application as shown in fig s4a ph of the system without adding fe2 rose from ph 6 0 to ph 7 0 and kept almost stable however ph value of the groups with fe2 application dropped progressively with time and the system dosed with more fe2 experienced a greater ph drop which should be ascribed to the ongoing hydrolysis of fe3 resulting from fe2 oxidation given that proton consumption was involved in zvi corrosion process the drop of solution ph would undoubtedly increase the zvi corrosion rate guan et al 2015 another cause for the improving effect of fe2 was the higher concentration of fe2 in the solution during se vi removal by zvi as depicted in fig s5 the concentration of fe2 remained in the solution increased when the dosage of fe2 was elevated it was well documented that the reductive removal of se vi by zvi was promoted by aqueous fe2 tang et al 2014a 2016 however the largest amount of se vi removal within 72 h was obtained when fe2 was applied at 0 5 mm and a drop or an elevation in fe2 dosage resulted in a decrease in se vi removal fig 1b 98 5 of dosed se vi 29 6 mg l could be removed by zvi within 72 h in the presence of 0 5 mm fe2 previous study also illustrated that negligible improvement was observed for se vi removal by zvi fe3o4 fe2 as fe2 dosage was increased from 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm but the authors did not investigate the influence of fe2 at higher concentration tang et al 2016 the influence of fe2 on the rate constants of se vi removal by zvi and the amount of se vi removed at equilibrium indicated that increasing fe2 increased reaction rate of non target substrates o2 and h with zvi concomitantly with that of se vi with zvi especially at fe2 was dosed at 1 0 4 0 mm when the elevation in the reaction rate of non target substrates o2 and h with zvi was larger than that of se vi with zvi the dosing of fe2 will result in a drop in the amount of se vi removed at equilibrium cl may play some roles in the observed enhancing effect because it was reported to be a zvi corrosion promoter sun et al 2016 and fecl2 was employed in this study thus to evaluate the effect of cl experiments with nacl as background electrolyte at different concentrations were conducted and the results were compared with that obtained in the presence of fecl2 as shown in fig s6 it was found that increasing the concentration of nacl from 1 0 mm to 2 0 mm had limited enhancing effect on se vi removal by pristine zvi suggesting that the improving effect of fecl2 0 5 mm on se vi removal was not ascribed to the increase in ionic strength but to the introduced fe2 cations as the dosage of h2o2 was increased from 0 2 mm to 2 0 mm the se vi removal rate in zvi h2o2 system increased progressively from 0 008 h 1 to 0 038 h 1 and it dropped gradually to 0 013 h 1 when h2o2 was further increased to 20 0 mm as illustrated in fig 1c furthermore the maximum removal of se vi within 72 h was 12 8 mg l when h2o2 was applied at 2 0 mm fig 1d the role of h2o2 was reported to enhance the reactivity of zvi through rapid corrosion of zvi surface and continuous activation of passive layer guo et al 2015 li et al 2018b ball milling without s resulted an increase in se vi removal within 72 h from 4 1 to 8 0 which may be ascribed to the increase in the bet surface area of zvi from 0 47 to 0 85 m2 g although s dosing s fe 0 05 had negligible influence on the surface area of ball milled zvi 28 5 41 1 of se vi could be sequestrated by s zvi within 6 h while no se vi could be removed after 6 h fig s2c therefore the improvement in se vi sequestration by s zvi compared to that by pristine zvi was mainly ascribed to the introduction of s in the ball milled zvi rather than the increase in surface area caused by ball milling to quantify the kinetics of se vi removal by s zvi pseudo first order rate law was used to simulate the initial portions of se vi removal data sets fig s3c and the corresponding rate constants are graphed in fig 1e as the s fe ratio increased from 0 02 to 0 05 the rate constant of se vi removal by s zvi elevated from 0 218 h 1 to 0 390 h 1 while further elevating the s fe ratio to 0 10 resulted in a slightly decreased se vi removal rate 0 293 h 1 the largest amount of se vi removal was also obtained at s fe ratio of 0 05 fig 1f indicating that the optimum s fe ratio was 0 05 our previous study also revealed the optimum cr vi removal by s zvi sample was observed at s fe molar ratio of 0 05 li et al 2018a the enhancing effect of sulfidation on se vi sequestration by zvi should be mainly attributed to the fes x layer on s zvi surface which facilitated the enrichment of se vi anions on s zvi surface because of its anions selective property and favored the electron transfer from fe0 core to se vi at the surface because of its role as efficient electron conductor li et al 2018a although se vi removal by zvi was greatly improved with the presence of wmf of different intensities the enhancing effect of wmf on se vi removal by zvi was strongly dependent on the mf intensity as shown in fig s2d and fig 1g and h the optimum removal of se vi removal by zvi was achieved at mf intensity of 5 mt with the initial rate constant being 0 12 h 1 and the amount of removed se vi at the end of 72 h being 15 4 mg l however a further increase or a drop at the mf intensity did not favor the removal of se vi this should be associated with the mechanisms of the enhancing effect of wmf on contaminants removal by zvi due to the ferromagnetic nature of zvi it becomes magnetized upon exposure to a magnetic field which leads to a strongly inhomogeneous field over the zvi particle surface liang et al 2014a being pulled by fÎ´b the paramagnetic fe2 generated in zvi corrosion tends to move along the magnetic lines to the place with higher magnetic field flux intensity thereby resulting in an uneven distribution of fe2 and eventually localized distribution of oxide films on zvi surface li et al 2017b sun et al 2018 therefore fÎ´b was increased at elevated mf intensity and mass transfer process was facilitated however the aggregation of zvi particles at high mf flux intensity could decrease the effective surface area thereby reduce the surface active sites necessary for the reaction to occur and negatively affect the performance of zvi for sequestrating contaminants li et al 2017a the data presented in fig 1 revealed that the most rapid se vi removal was achieved by s zvi at s fe molar ratio of 0 05 but the maximum amount of se vi removal was obtained in zvi fe2 system with fe2 applied at 0 5 mm at ph0 6 0 at the end of 72 h the maximum amount of se vi removed in zvi fe2 system was 2 40 folds of that removed by s zvi 2 31 folds of that removed by zvi h2o2 and 1 92 folds of that removed by zvi wmf under optimum conditions at ph0 6 0 the behavior of se vi removal in different processes should be heavily dependent on zvi corrosion to identify the evolution of zvi corrosion products during se vi removal the fe k edge exafs spectra of the zvi samples reacted with se vi at ph0 6 0 for different durations were recorded as shown in fig s7 lcf analysis was performed for the exafs spectra illustrated in fig s7 and the results are summarized in fig 2 although negligible se vi was removed by zvi alone within 72 h 52 4 of fe0 was transformed to Î³ fe2o3 and Î³ feooh at 48 h in this process indicating that the electrons provided by zvi were consumed predominantly by o2 and secondly by h all of the examined enhancing techniques accelerated zvi corrosion as revealed by the more rapid drop in the fraction of fe0 in the collected precipitates at different reaction durations with the presence of fe2 h2o2 or wmf or after sulfidation treatment compared to the bare zvi system the most rapid zvi corrosion was observed after sulfidation treatment s fe molar ratio of 0 05 since the fraction of fe0 in solid phase was the least at selected reaction time only 7 5 of fe in the collected precipitate was present as fe0 after 12 h reaction of s zvi with se vi in water and negligible fe0 was detected in se vi treated s zvi precipitates after 24 h therefore most of the removed se vi was achieved by s zvi within 6 h compared to the case of s zvi the corrosion of zvi in zvi fe2 system processed much more slowly manifested by the proportion of fe0 in the collected precipitates decreased from 46 4 in 4 h 27 6 in 24 h finally to 0 at 72 h which may be the reason for the continuous and progressive removal of se vi in zvi fe2 system nevertheless zvi coupled with h2o2 had a relatively low corrosion rate and the fraction of fe0 in the se vi treated zvi sample was high as 34 4 at the end of 72 h the predominant iron corrosion product was Î³ feooh at the later stage of reaction during se vi sequestration by s zvi zvi fe2 and zvi wmf by contrast Î³ fe2o3 was the major corrosion product in the se vi treated zvi and zvi h2o2 systems different corrosion products generated in different zvi systems may affect the subsequent zvi corrosion process contributing to the different zvi corrosion rates observed in different zvi systems 3 2 influence of initial ph on se vi removal in different processes the aforementioned results demonstrated the feasibility of the four tested methods zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf in increasing the reactivity of zvi considering ph is one of the most critical factors influencing contaminants removal by zvi additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the applicability of these four methods at different ph0 levels i e 4 5 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 fig s8 depicted the kinetics of se vi sequestration at different ph0 levels by zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf respectively and the initial reaction stages were simulated with pseudo first order rate law fig s9 compared to the case in zvi alone system se vi was removed with a much greater rate constant and more se vi was removed within 72 in the four tested systems at different ph0 levels as summarized in fig 3 specifically over the ph0 range of 4 5 9 0 the rate constants of se vi sequestration k obs and the amount of se vi removed within 72 h were increased by 3 2 35 4 times and 3 9 29 2 times for zvi fe2 6 1 13 9 times and 1 9 10 4 times for zvi h2o2 27 8 93 9 and 1 8 11 1 folds for s zvi 14 5 27 4 and 2 0 12 0 folds for zvi wmf respectively a closer inspection of the data present in fig 3 reveals that as ph0 increased from 4 5 to 9 0 k obs of se vi depletion and the amount of removed se vi within 72 h by zvi alone zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf decreased gradually it has been reported the reactivity of zvi drops with increasing ph due to the direct involvement of h in the corrosion reactions of fe0 and the mass transport limitations imposed by the precipitation of a passive film on the surface of zvi guan et al 2015 the better performance of zvi toward se vi removal at lower ph should be mainly ascribed to the acceleration of iron corrosion and dissolution of the passivated oxide layers on zvi surface while a high ph deteriorates the performance of zvi due to more mineral precipitation which inhibits the mass transfer sun et al 2016 on the other hand the removal rate of se vi in zvi fe2 system kept almost constant at ph0 4 5 9 0 more importantly the amount of se vi removed within 72 h in zvi fe2 system fell in the range of 21 6 29 9 mg l over the ph0 range of 4 5 9 0 which was much greater than those in zvi systems without enhancing techniques 0 9 7 7 mg l and in the other enhanced zvi systems 3 7 15 5 mg l the stable and efficient removal of se vi by zvi fe2 at ph0 4 5 9 0 was partly attributed to the relatively low ph level caused by fe2 dosing compared to those in other enhanced zvi systems fig s10 another reason may be the presence of fe2 in aqueous phase which was verified by the experiment results of se vi removal by zvi and zvi fe2 at ph 5 5 by adjusting with hcl naoh manually fig s11 fig 4 attempted to unravel the relationship between the amounts of se vi removed within 72 h and the initial pseudo first order rate constants of se vi sequestration in different enhanced zvi systems at ph0 4 5 9 0 obviously a larger initial removal rate did not necessarily lead to more se vi removal at the end of reaction for instance as illustrated in fig 4 sulfidation was most effective in increasing the rate of se vi removal by zvi among the four tested methods but much less se vi was removed by s zvi within 72 h compared to that in zvi fe2 system this suggested that sulfidation could not only dramatically enhance the rate of se vi removal by zvi but also greatly accelerated the side reactions between zvi and h h2o o2 resulting in the rapid exhaustion of zvi on the other hand the largest amount of se vi was removed in zvi fe2 system although the rates of se vi removal in this system were generally smaller than those in s zvi and zvi wmf systems compared to sulfidation treatment and fe2 application h2o2 and wmf application for enhancing se vi removal by zvi did not have distinct advantages with regard to both removal rate of se vi and the amount of removed se vi to better describe the different behaviors of se vi removal in different systems the utilization ratio of reductant urr electron efficiency of reductant eer and specific removal capacity src of different systems for se vi removal were evaluated which will be discussed in detail in the following section 3 3 the selectivity of zvi toward se vi removal eer defined as the percentage of electrons transferred to the target contaminant over the amount of electrons donated by zvi and other reductants if there are any is used to assess the selectivity of reductants toward target contaminant during reductive removal of contaminant by enhanced zvi system the electrons provided by s and dosed fe2 should also be taken into account where s zvi and zvi fe2 was employed molar quantities of s with various valence states in s zvi before and reaction with se vi were determined the method for determining the fractions of s ii s i s 0 and s vi is present in text s5 and the data are depicted in fig s12 the eer of bare zvi zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 and zvi wmf systems and s zvi for se vi sequestration can be calculated via equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 eer 2 n se iv 6 n se 0 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii 2 eer 2 n se iv 6 n se 0 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii 8 n s vi n s vi 2 n s 0 n s 0 n s i n s i where nse iv nse 0 nfe iii nfe ii ns vi ns 0 and ns i are the molar quantities of se iv se 0 fe iii fe ii s vi s 0 and s i in both solid and liquid phases at given reaction time respectively n fe iii n fe ii n s vi n s 0 and n s i stand for the molar quantities of fe iii fe ii s vi s 0 and s i in both solid and liquid phases before the reaction respectively obviously eer could reflect the ability of target contaminant to compete with h2o h o2 for electrons donated primarily by zvi and secondly by other reductants if there are any it should be specified that the eer values calculated using equations 1 and 2 are not the instantaneous electron efficiencies of zvi but are the mean values during the whole elapsed time utilization ratio of reductants urr describes the fraction of consumed reductants primarily fe0 and secondly fe2 and low valent s if there are any at given reaction time similar to the calculating method of eer the electrons provided by the low valent s and dosed fe2 should be taken into consideration to calculate urr of s zvi and zvi fe2 the urr of bare zvi zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 and zvi wmf systems and s zvi can be calculated via equations 3 and 4 respectively 3 urr 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii n fe ii 3 n fe 0 4 urr 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii 8 n s vi n s vi 2 n s 0 n s 0 n s i n s i n fe ii 3 n fe 0 6 n s 0 7 n s i 8 n s ii where n fe 0 and n s ii stand for the molar quantities of fe 0 and s ii in the zvi or s zvi samples before reaction respectively specific removal capacity src is defined as the ratio of the amount of removed se vi to the consumed fe0 and it can be calculated via equation 5 5 src n se removal n fe 0 n fe 0 where nfe 0 and nse removal are the molar quantities of fe 0 and sequestrated se at given reaction time respectively src indicates the capacity of consumed fe0 to remove pollutants regardless of the removal mechanism the calculation of src only considers the consumption of fe0 whereas the contribution of s and dosed fe2 is not taken into account if the target contaminant is removed by reduction and fe0 is the predominant electron donor src is proportional to eer in order to determine the amounts of se 0 se iv and se vi in solid phase se k edge xanes spectra of zvi samples reacted with se vi after different reaction durations were collected and lcf analysis was performed see details in text s6 and fig s13 as shown in fig 5 as the reaction time elapsed the amount of total se in the precipitate gradually ascended for all enhanced zvi systems and the removed se vi was mainly present as se 0 and se iv moreover the fractions of se iv and se vi in the precipitates dropped with reaction time while that of se 0 increased with reaction time which indicated that adsorption followed by reduction was the major mechanism of se vi removal by zvi at the end of 72 h se vi was completely reduced to se 0 and se iv in the collected precipitates in all four tested systems thus the removal mechanism of se vi in these four enhanced zvi systems was similar but the enhancing techniques affected the rates and amounts of se vi removal by zvi to determine the contents of fe 0 fe ii and fe iii in reacted zvi samples a digestion method with concentrated hcl text s3 was adopted and the results were summarized in tables s1 and s2 taking together the values of eer urr and src for different zvi systems were calculated and graphed in fig 6 it should be noted that the contribution of low valent s to the calculated eer and urr values of s zvi is minor as summarized in table s3 indicating that the predominant electron donor in s zvi is fe0 as demonstrated in fig 6a for all the tested enhanced zvi systems the values of urr were always larger than that of bare zvi at the same reaction time for example only 64 1 of fe0 in bare zvi system was oxidized within 48 h while 83 3 of reductant had been oxidized in s zvi within 24 h urr increased gradually with reaction time in all the four enhanced zvi systems indicating the continuous corrosion of zvi based on the extents in promoting urr these methods could be ranked in the order of s zvi zvi wmf zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 zvi from most to least enhanced the relatively low urr in zvi h2o2 system might be attributed to the side reactions between zvi and h2o2 ma et al 2016 as depicted in fig 6b the eer of bare zvi was determined to be as low as 0 5 at 48 h namely almost all of the electrons donated by zvi were consumed by non target h h2o o2 in contrast when the enhancing methods were applied the eer values were considerably increased for example the eer values of s zvi and zvi wmf systems elevated quickly to 4 23 and 4 03 within 12 h respectively which were greater than those of zvi fe2 and zvi h2o2 this trend was consistent with the fact that more se vi were removed by s zvi and zvi wmf within the initial 12 h as demonstrated in fig s2 the eer value of s zvi dropped slightly to 4 06 at 24 h which should be due to the little reduction of se vi but much oxidation of the residual fe0 during this period the eer values of zvi h2o2 and zvi wmf systems were very close at the end of 72 h and were 4 32 and 4 66 respectively the change of eer value of zvi fe2 with time was very different from those of other enhanced zvi systems which kept increasing during the whole reaction process and was as high as 8 72 at the end of 72 h highlighting its advantages in promoting the selectivity of zvi over the other three zvi systems as shown in figs s2 and 5 although less se vi was removed by zvi fe2 in the first 12 h than in the other three enhanced zvi systems the process of se vi sequestration and the conversion of adsorbed se vi to se iv se 0 continued until almost 100 se vi was removed at 72 h in zvi fe2 system the increase in eer value suggested that either the side reactions between zvi and h2o h o2 were retarded or the reaction of target contaminants reduction by zvi was promoted to a greater extent than that of non targets considering the zvi corrosion rate in the four enhanced zvi systems the observed elevation in eer arising from the application of enhancing techniques should be ascribed to the later however the exact mechanism involved in each enhancing strategy warrants further investigation fig 6c illustrated the evolution of src in different enhanced zvi systems with reaction time the src of s zvi was almost constant varying from 20 67 to 21 49 mmol se vi mol consumed fe0 during 2 h 24 h due to the rapid removal of se vi by s zvi although the src of zvi wmf system was much greater than that of zvi h2o2 system during the first 12 h they became very close hereafter comparing the data present in fig 6c and b the evolution of eer and src with time were very similar except for s zvi as shown in fig s14 there was a perfect correlation of src and eer for zvi wmf zvi fe2 and zvi h2o2 systems which should be due to the fact that reduction was the major mechanism of se vi removal and fe0 was the predominant electron donor 3 4 comprehensive comparison and cost analysis to select promising zvi technologies for real application many factors should be considered fig 7 summarizes the results of zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf for se vi sequestration it involves four categories of indicators the reactivity index including the amount of se vi removed within 72 h and se vi removal rate constants k obs the utilization index represented by urr at the end of reaction the selectivity index represented by eer and src of different enhanced zvi systems at the end of reaction the adaptability index manifested by the relative standard deviation rsd of removed se vi at ph0 4 5 9 0 except the adaptability index the other three indexes were obtained from the data of experiments conducted under the optimized enhancing conditions at ph0 6 0 fig 7 shows that se vi sequestration by zvi fe2 has advantages in most of aspects with large removal capacity and eer for se vi and good adaptability to ph the only disadvantage of zvi fe2 lies in its relatively slow reaction rate the only superiority of s zvi for se vi removal is that its larger reaction rate compared to the other three enhanced zvi systems sequestrating se vi with s zvi should be favorable under the situations where the footprint for water pollution control unit is limited however the merits of zvi wmf and zvi h2o2 are not obvious in terms of these parameters although the performance of zvi wmf is slightly better than zvi h2o2 considering all the indexes evaluated in this study with regard to real field applications the cost of investment and operation is obviously another key consideration providing a wmf with permanent magnets to enhance se vi removal by zvi needs no extra operation cost but the investment cost of permanent magnets as well as the reasonable design of reactors with wmf should be considered however the operation cost is elevated when the other three tested enhanced zvi technologies are performed in practice because extra reagents are needed according to the information provided at internet www alibaba com the prices of ferrous chloride tetrahydrate hydrogen peroxide and sulphur powder of industrial grade are in the range of 60 120 usd t 150 220 usd t and 130 180 usd t respectively here we define the cost of the material used to enhance se vi removal by zvi as follows 6 cost m p m se where m and mse represent the mass of the consumed material and the removed se and p stands for price of the material the chemical costs of fe2 h2o2 and sulfidation are 0 20 0 40 usd kg se 2 66 3 90 usd kg se and 0 15 0 21 usd kg se respectively considering the dosages of fe2 h2o2 and s used in this study h2o2 dosing is the most expensive among these enhancing methods for removing the same quantity of se vi but the merit of this technique is that h2o2 could decompose and there is no extra residual introduced by the material added the material cost of sulfidation is relatively low among these three zvi enhancing techniques but the energy input of the s zvi synthetic process arising from ball milling should not be ignored in the practical use although fe2 application is more expensive than sulfidation treatment it is much more easy to be realized in real practice than sulfidation treatment since fe2 can be directly dosed into the tank of removing se vi by zvi 4 conclusions the results of this study revealed that adding fe2 h2o2 dosing sulfidation and the superposition of wmf greatly enhanced se vi removal by zvi compared with zvi alone among these four enhanced zvi technologies zvi fe2 attained the largest amount of se vi sequestration whereas s zvi removed se vi with the largest reaction rate all of these enhancing techniques accelerated the corrosion of zvi which verified that the corrosion of zvi was a necessity and a manifestation of contaminants removal by zvi increasing ph resulted in a drop in the amount of se vi removed by zvi h2o2 zvi wmf and s zvi however the amount of se vi removed by zvi fe2 and the corresponding k obs changed slightly as ph0 ranged from 4 5 to 9 0 the se k edge xanes spectra analysis revealed that adsorption followed by reduction was the major mechanism of se vi removal by zvi in different enhanced zvi systems the four tested enhancing techniques did not change the removal mechanisms of se vi by zvi but affected the rates and amounts of se vi removal by zvi all of the four enhancing techniques increased urr eer and src of zvi considering the amount of removed se vi the urr of zvi at the end of reaction eer and src of zvi the adaptability over a wide ph range as well as the chemical cost zvi fe2 was superior to the other three tested enhanced zvi technologies the bottleneck of zvi fe2 technology lies in its relatively low reactivity toward se vi research is being carried out in our lab to enhance the reactivity of zvi fe2 system toward se vi and further study on pilot scale is necessary to examine the superiority of zvi fe2 system for se vi removal moreover the feasibility of employing fe2 to enhance the performance of zvi should also be examined with zvi of different

18790,dosing ferrous ions zvi fe2 combining with oxidants e g h2o2 zvi h2o2 sulfidation treatment s zvi and introducing a weak magnetic field zvi wmf have been widely used to enhance the performance of zerovalent iron zvi for reductive removal of contaminants taking se vi as a probe contaminant this study systematically compared the performances of different zvi systems i e zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf for contaminant removal all the four tested methods could greatly improve the performance of zvi for se vi removal se vi was removed by s zvi at s fe molar ratio of 0 05 with a much greater rate constant than other enhanced zvi technologies while the maximum amount of se vi removal was obtained in zvi fe2 system with fe2 applied at 0 5 mm among the four tested enhanced zvi technologies at initial ph 6 0 in addition se vi removal by zvi fe2 was least influenced by initial ph compared to the other tested enhanced zvi systems implying its good adaptability of ph the application of these tested methods could significantly increase the electron efficiency from 0 5 to 4 06 8 72 and fe2 application was much more efficient in enhancing the electron efficiency than the other three methods finally the perspective of these enhanced zvi technologies was compared in terms of their reactivity selectivity chemical cost and ph adaptability and some suggestions for their possible application were provided graphical abstract image 1 keywords zerovalent iron electron efficiency kinetics removal capacity reduction 1 introduction the application of microscale zerovalent iron zvi has proved to be an environmental friendly approach for reductive removal of a variety of contaminants such as halogenated organics nitroaromatics and oxyanions e g selenate selenite bromate perchlorate since zvi is readily available relatively inexpensive and nontoxic guan et al 2015 kanel et al 2005 liang et al 2013 litter et al 2010 liu et al 2016 zvi can be applied in groundwater remediation gillham and ohannesin 1994 matheson and tratnyek 1994 industrial wastewater treatment btatkeu k et al 2016 mantha et al 2001 as well as drinking water treatment lin and lin 2017 noubactep 2008 when zvi is used in groundwater remediation reactive lifetime and reactivity are two important factors affecting its successful application fan et al 2016b gu et al 2017 xie and cwiertny 2010 however the reaction of zvi with non target dissolved oxygen and water during groundwater remediation can reduce the selectivity and longevity of zvi fan et al 2016b a high reactivity of zvi towards target contaminant in wastewater and drinking water treatment is preferred because the volume of the reactor can be lowered once the reactivity of zvi is enhanced besides the reactivity of zvi the removal capacity of zvi for the target contaminant defined as the maximum amount of contaminant removed by zvi under specific reaction conditions is very critical for successful application of a zvi system in water and wastewater treatment qin et al 2017 increasing the removal capacity of zvi for target contaminant can decrease the cost of zvi and the subsequent sludge disposal cost when the target contaminant is removed by zvi via reduction the capacity of zvi is determined by both the selectivity or electron efficiency of zvi the ratio of the electrons accepted by target contaminants to all the electrons donated by fe0 and the utilization ratio ur of fe0 in zvi particles li et al 2018a qin et al 2017 zvi generally has low reactivity since it is covered with an intrinsic passive layer generated during the high temperature manufacturing process and has a relatively low specific surface area guan et al 2015 therefore many methods have been developed to improve the reactivity of zvi such as pretreatment of pristine zvi with magnetization li et al 2015 2017a or acid washing lin and lin 2017 increasing the specific surface area of zvi by fabricating nanoscale zvi nzvi li et al 2006 combining zvi with noble metals e g pd or pt to form bimetals he et al 2016 xu et al 2012 coupling zvi with chemicals various metal ions or oxidants guo et al 2016 li et al 2018b tang et al 2014a 2016 application of weak magnetic field wmf liang et al 2014a 2014b as well as sulfidation treatment of zvi fan et al 2017 li et al 2017b 2018a among these methods fe2 dosing oxidant application sulfidation and wmf superimposition have drawn a lot of attention because they are reported to be efficient environmental friendly cost effective and easily to be applied zhang and his colleagues are among the first to report the enhancing effect of fe2 on reductive removal of contaminant by zvi huang and zhang 2005 huang et al 2003 our previous study revealed that the application of 1 0 mm fe ii increased the electron selectivity of zvi toward se vi from 3 2 3 6 to 6 2 6 8 and enhanced the se vi removal capacity by 100 180 under aerobic conditions qin et al 2017 the studies of guo et al 2015 and li et al 2018b showed that applying strong oxidants such as h2o2 kmno4 and naclo could considerably accelerate the reductive removal of nitrate and selenite by zvi our previous studies revealed that the rate constants of metal loid s sequestration by pristine zvi or aged zvi could be increased by 1 3 383 7 folds due to the application of wmf li et al 2017c liang et al 2014b sun et al 2014 quite a few literature showed that sulfidation could lead to a dramatic increase in the reactivity and selectivity of nzvi under anaerobic conditions fan et al 2016a 2017 kim et al 2011 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and our previous study demonstrated that the reactivity and selectivity of zvi towards chromate under aerobic conditions could be also enhanced li et al 2018a although the influences of fe2 dosing oxidant application sulfidation and wmf superimposition on contaminants removal by zvi have been extensively investigated very few studies have compared the performance of these zvi enhancing techniques and most of these studies only employed the system of contaminants removal by zvi alone as the benchmark system for comparison different reaction conditions including the origins of zvi the properties and concentrations of contaminants ph as well as reaction atmosphere were employed in different literature for investigating the performance of these zvi enhancing methods which makes the direct comparison among these zvi enhancing methods difficult the comparison of these enhancing methods in terms of the reactivity selectivity and removal capacity of zvi towards target contaminant will definitely benefit the better application of zvi technology selenate similar to sulfate is hard to be removed by the conventional methods such as coagulation lime softening and adsorption zhang et al 2010 but it can be removed by zvi via reduction liang et al 2015 therefore taking se vi as a probe contaminant the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the kinetics of se vi removal by zvi coupled with four enhancing techniques fe2 application h2o2 dosing sulfidation wmf under various reaction conditions 2 determine the reactivity selectivity removal capacity and utilization ratio of zvi coupled with these enhancing techniques 3 systematically compare these four zvi enhancing techniques so as to provide some suggestions for application of zvi based technologies the results of this study will be important for the selection and application of enhanced zvi technologies in wastewater treatment and groundwater remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of analytical grade and all solutions were prepared with deionized di water from a milli q system zvi with a d50 of 46 2 Î¼m was purchased from alfa aesar chemical reagent company and used in this study s zvi was prepared following the ball milling method used in our previous study li et al 2018a and the details of preparing s zvi are presented in text s1 of the supporting information si the brunauer emmet teller bet surface areas of pristine zvi ball milled zvi without s and that with s were determined their scanning electron microscope sem images were collected and are present in fig s1 the details of the methods for bet surface area determination and sem images collection are presented in text s2 sodium selenate na2seo4 was supplied by the xiya reagent company all other chemical reagents were purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent company all chemicals were used as received stock solution of 1000 mg l se vi was prepared by dissolving na2seo4 in di water 2 2 experimental procedures all batch experiments were performed in a wide mouth bottle containing 500 ml working solution at 25 c and open to the air the working solution containing 30 mg l se vi and 1 0 mm nacl was freshly prepared for each batch test the solution was mixed at 400 rpm with a propeller agitator d2004w shanghai sile instrument co ltd to investigate the influence of fe2 application on se vi removal by zvi batch tests were initiated by adding 0 25 g zvi and different amounts of fecl2 4h2o simultaneously into the working solution similarly different amounts of h2o2 and 0 25 g zvi were simultaneously dosed into the working solution to determine the enhancing effect of h2o2 on se vi sequestration by zvi it should be noted that h2o2 was employed as a representative oxidant to determine the influence of oxidant application on the performance of zvi because h2o2 was inexpensive and environmental friendly to explore the behavior of se vi removal by s zvi batch experiments were performed by adding 0 25 g s zvi with different s fe molar ratios into the working solution for the experiments testing the behavior of se vi removal by zvi wmf an electromagnet electromagnet power supply model 7050 purchased from east changing technologies inc beijing was employed to supply uniform mf of different intensities the initial ph ph0 of the working solution was adjusted with hcl or naoh to pre determined values and no attempts were made to maintain ph constant during the experiment at fixed time intervals approximately 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and passed through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane filter and then acidified for analysis the reacted zvi particles after the batch tests were collected by vacuum filtration with 0 22 Î¼m membrane filters washed with di water freeze dried in vacuum and then preserved in a glove box for subsequent characterization each test was performed in duplicate and error bars in the figures show the standard deviations of test results 2 3 analytical methods ph of the working solution was monitored with commercial electrodes inesa phs 3c jbp 607 the concentrations of aqueous total se setot and total fe fetot were determined with an atomic absorption spectrometer thermo fisher scientific ice 3300 aas whereas the speciation of se iv and se vi in aqueous phase was determined with hplc icp ms agilent hplc 1200 icpms 7700 following a published method li et al 2008 the mass of fe0 in zvi samples was determined by measuring the volume of h2 yield for the samples dissolved in hcl of 6 0 mol l and the details of this method are presented in text s3 the dissolved fe2 concentration was determined with the ferrozine method on an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer purkinje tu 1902 at the wavelength of 510 nm x ray absorption fine structure xafs analyses were carried out to quantify the fractions of different iron hydro oxides in the solid phase and the details are summarized in text s4 the fractions of s ii s i s 0 and s vi in the solid phase and in the aqueous solution were determined with x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps and ion chromatography ic respectively the fractions of se 0 se iv and se vi in the solid phase were derived from the linear combination fitting lcf of the se k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra the details of these characterizing methods and the corresponding calculating methods are presented in text s5 and s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics and amounts of se vi removal in different processes and the corresponding zvi corrosion the kinetics of se vi removal in zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf processes at ph0 6 0 as functions of fe2 concentration h2o2 concentration s fe molar ratio and intensity of mf respectively are presented in fig s2 it was found that 4 1 of se vi was removed by zvi alone within 72 h without enhancing techniques compared to zvi used in our previous study d50 108 2 Î¼m qin et al 2017 zvi employed in this study d50 46 2 Î¼m had much smaller reactivity towards se vi obviously the reactivity of zvi samples from different origins was very different depending on many factors besides particle size which resulted in the difficulties in comparing the results from different studies consequently it was impossible to compare the performance of zvi coupled with different enhancing methods without employing well controlled reaction conditions upon the introduction of fe2 h2o2 or wmf into the zvi system or after the sulfidation treatment of zvi particles the removal of se vi was considerably accelerated and the amount of removed se vi at equilibrium was greatly increased which was consistent with the results reported in the literature li et al 2017b liang et al 2015 tang et al 2014b yang et al 2018 to better understand the influence of the four enhancing methods on the reactivity of zvi towards se vi removal the kinetics of se vi removal were simulated with pseudo first order rate law fig s3 and the obtained rate constants k obs were summarized in fig 1 it should be noted that the removal rates were quantified only using the initial portions of se vi removal data sets fig s3 since a tailing behavior was always involved in these reactions fig 1a and b depicted the variation of rate constants and quantity of se vi removed by zvi as a function of the dosed fe2 concentration at ph0 6 0 it was found that the se vi removal rate increased progressively from 0 004 h 1 to 0 078 h 1 with increasing the fe2 concentration from 0 1 mm to 4 0 mm the enhancing effect of fe2 may be associated with two reasons one is the ph drop due to fe2 application as shown in fig s4a ph of the system without adding fe2 rose from ph 6 0 to ph 7 0 and kept almost stable however ph value of the groups with fe2 application dropped progressively with time and the system dosed with more fe2 experienced a greater ph drop which should be ascribed to the ongoing hydrolysis of fe3 resulting from fe2 oxidation given that proton consumption was involved in zvi corrosion process the drop of solution ph would undoubtedly increase the zvi corrosion rate guan et al 2015 another cause for the improving effect of fe2 was the higher concentration of fe2 in the solution during se vi removal by zvi as depicted in fig s5 the concentration of fe2 remained in the solution increased when the dosage of fe2 was elevated it was well documented that the reductive removal of se vi by zvi was promoted by aqueous fe2 tang et al 2014a 2016 however the largest amount of se vi removal within 72 h was obtained when fe2 was applied at 0 5 mm and a drop or an elevation in fe2 dosage resulted in a decrease in se vi removal fig 1b 98 5 of dosed se vi 29 6 mg l could be removed by zvi within 72 h in the presence of 0 5 mm fe2 previous study also illustrated that negligible improvement was observed for se vi removal by zvi fe3o4 fe2 as fe2 dosage was increased from 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm but the authors did not investigate the influence of fe2 at higher concentration tang et al 2016 the influence of fe2 on the rate constants of se vi removal by zvi and the amount of se vi removed at equilibrium indicated that increasing fe2 increased reaction rate of non target substrates o2 and h with zvi concomitantly with that of se vi with zvi especially at fe2 was dosed at 1 0 4 0 mm when the elevation in the reaction rate of non target substrates o2 and h with zvi was larger than that of se vi with zvi the dosing of fe2 will result in a drop in the amount of se vi removed at equilibrium cl may play some roles in the observed enhancing effect because it was reported to be a zvi corrosion promoter sun et al 2016 and fecl2 was employed in this study thus to evaluate the effect of cl experiments with nacl as background electrolyte at different concentrations were conducted and the results were compared with that obtained in the presence of fecl2 as shown in fig s6 it was found that increasing the concentration of nacl from 1 0 mm to 2 0 mm had limited enhancing effect on se vi removal by pristine zvi suggesting that the improving effect of fecl2 0 5 mm on se vi removal was not ascribed to the increase in ionic strength but to the introduced fe2 cations as the dosage of h2o2 was increased from 0 2 mm to 2 0 mm the se vi removal rate in zvi h2o2 system increased progressively from 0 008 h 1 to 0 038 h 1 and it dropped gradually to 0 013 h 1 when h2o2 was further increased to 20 0 mm as illustrated in fig 1c furthermore the maximum removal of se vi within 72 h was 12 8 mg l when h2o2 was applied at 2 0 mm fig 1d the role of h2o2 was reported to enhance the reactivity of zvi through rapid corrosion of zvi surface and continuous activation of passive layer guo et al 2015 li et al 2018b ball milling without s resulted an increase in se vi removal within 72 h from 4 1 to 8 0 which may be ascribed to the increase in the bet surface area of zvi from 0 47 to 0 85 m2 g although s dosing s fe 0 05 had negligible influence on the surface area of ball milled zvi 28 5 41 1 of se vi could be sequestrated by s zvi within 6 h while no se vi could be removed after 6 h fig s2c therefore the improvement in se vi sequestration by s zvi compared to that by pristine zvi was mainly ascribed to the introduction of s in the ball milled zvi rather than the increase in surface area caused by ball milling to quantify the kinetics of se vi removal by s zvi pseudo first order rate law was used to simulate the initial portions of se vi removal data sets fig s3c and the corresponding rate constants are graphed in fig 1e as the s fe ratio increased from 0 02 to 0 05 the rate constant of se vi removal by s zvi elevated from 0 218 h 1 to 0 390 h 1 while further elevating the s fe ratio to 0 10 resulted in a slightly decreased se vi removal rate 0 293 h 1 the largest amount of se vi removal was also obtained at s fe ratio of 0 05 fig 1f indicating that the optimum s fe ratio was 0 05 our previous study also revealed the optimum cr vi removal by s zvi sample was observed at s fe molar ratio of 0 05 li et al 2018a the enhancing effect of sulfidation on se vi sequestration by zvi should be mainly attributed to the fes x layer on s zvi surface which facilitated the enrichment of se vi anions on s zvi surface because of its anions selective property and favored the electron transfer from fe0 core to se vi at the surface because of its role as efficient electron conductor li et al 2018a although se vi removal by zvi was greatly improved with the presence of wmf of different intensities the enhancing effect of wmf on se vi removal by zvi was strongly dependent on the mf intensity as shown in fig s2d and fig 1g and h the optimum removal of se vi removal by zvi was achieved at mf intensity of 5 mt with the initial rate constant being 0 12 h 1 and the amount of removed se vi at the end of 72 h being 15 4 mg l however a further increase or a drop at the mf intensity did not favor the removal of se vi this should be associated with the mechanisms of the enhancing effect of wmf on contaminants removal by zvi due to the ferromagnetic nature of zvi it becomes magnetized upon exposure to a magnetic field which leads to a strongly inhomogeneous field over the zvi particle surface liang et al 2014a being pulled by fÎ´b the paramagnetic fe2 generated in zvi corrosion tends to move along the magnetic lines to the place with higher magnetic field flux intensity thereby resulting in an uneven distribution of fe2 and eventually localized distribution of oxide films on zvi surface li et al 2017b sun et al 2018 therefore fÎ´b was increased at elevated mf intensity and mass transfer process was facilitated however the aggregation of zvi particles at high mf flux intensity could decrease the effective surface area thereby reduce the surface active sites necessary for the reaction to occur and negatively affect the performance of zvi for sequestrating contaminants li et al 2017a the data presented in fig 1 revealed that the most rapid se vi removal was achieved by s zvi at s fe molar ratio of 0 05 but the maximum amount of se vi removal was obtained in zvi fe2 system with fe2 applied at 0 5 mm at ph0 6 0 at the end of 72 h the maximum amount of se vi removed in zvi fe2 system was 2 40 folds of that removed by s zvi 2 31 folds of that removed by zvi h2o2 and 1 92 folds of that removed by zvi wmf under optimum conditions at ph0 6 0 the behavior of se vi removal in different processes should be heavily dependent on zvi corrosion to identify the evolution of zvi corrosion products during se vi removal the fe k edge exafs spectra of the zvi samples reacted with se vi at ph0 6 0 for different durations were recorded as shown in fig s7 lcf analysis was performed for the exafs spectra illustrated in fig s7 and the results are summarized in fig 2 although negligible se vi was removed by zvi alone within 72 h 52 4 of fe0 was transformed to Î³ fe2o3 and Î³ feooh at 48 h in this process indicating that the electrons provided by zvi were consumed predominantly by o2 and secondly by h all of the examined enhancing techniques accelerated zvi corrosion as revealed by the more rapid drop in the fraction of fe0 in the collected precipitates at different reaction durations with the presence of fe2 h2o2 or wmf or after sulfidation treatment compared to the bare zvi system the most rapid zvi corrosion was observed after sulfidation treatment s fe molar ratio of 0 05 since the fraction of fe0 in solid phase was the least at selected reaction time only 7 5 of fe in the collected precipitate was present as fe0 after 12 h reaction of s zvi with se vi in water and negligible fe0 was detected in se vi treated s zvi precipitates after 24 h therefore most of the removed se vi was achieved by s zvi within 6 h compared to the case of s zvi the corrosion of zvi in zvi fe2 system processed much more slowly manifested by the proportion of fe0 in the collected precipitates decreased from 46 4 in 4 h 27 6 in 24 h finally to 0 at 72 h which may be the reason for the continuous and progressive removal of se vi in zvi fe2 system nevertheless zvi coupled with h2o2 had a relatively low corrosion rate and the fraction of fe0 in the se vi treated zvi sample was high as 34 4 at the end of 72 h the predominant iron corrosion product was Î³ feooh at the later stage of reaction during se vi sequestration by s zvi zvi fe2 and zvi wmf by contrast Î³ fe2o3 was the major corrosion product in the se vi treated zvi and zvi h2o2 systems different corrosion products generated in different zvi systems may affect the subsequent zvi corrosion process contributing to the different zvi corrosion rates observed in different zvi systems 3 2 influence of initial ph on se vi removal in different processes the aforementioned results demonstrated the feasibility of the four tested methods zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf in increasing the reactivity of zvi considering ph is one of the most critical factors influencing contaminants removal by zvi additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the applicability of these four methods at different ph0 levels i e 4 5 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 fig s8 depicted the kinetics of se vi sequestration at different ph0 levels by zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf respectively and the initial reaction stages were simulated with pseudo first order rate law fig s9 compared to the case in zvi alone system se vi was removed with a much greater rate constant and more se vi was removed within 72 in the four tested systems at different ph0 levels as summarized in fig 3 specifically over the ph0 range of 4 5 9 0 the rate constants of se vi sequestration k obs and the amount of se vi removed within 72 h were increased by 3 2 35 4 times and 3 9 29 2 times for zvi fe2 6 1 13 9 times and 1 9 10 4 times for zvi h2o2 27 8 93 9 and 1 8 11 1 folds for s zvi 14 5 27 4 and 2 0 12 0 folds for zvi wmf respectively a closer inspection of the data present in fig 3 reveals that as ph0 increased from 4 5 to 9 0 k obs of se vi depletion and the amount of removed se vi within 72 h by zvi alone zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf decreased gradually it has been reported the reactivity of zvi drops with increasing ph due to the direct involvement of h in the corrosion reactions of fe0 and the mass transport limitations imposed by the precipitation of a passive film on the surface of zvi guan et al 2015 the better performance of zvi toward se vi removal at lower ph should be mainly ascribed to the acceleration of iron corrosion and dissolution of the passivated oxide layers on zvi surface while a high ph deteriorates the performance of zvi due to more mineral precipitation which inhibits the mass transfer sun et al 2016 on the other hand the removal rate of se vi in zvi fe2 system kept almost constant at ph0 4 5 9 0 more importantly the amount of se vi removed within 72 h in zvi fe2 system fell in the range of 21 6 29 9 mg l over the ph0 range of 4 5 9 0 which was much greater than those in zvi systems without enhancing techniques 0 9 7 7 mg l and in the other enhanced zvi systems 3 7 15 5 mg l the stable and efficient removal of se vi by zvi fe2 at ph0 4 5 9 0 was partly attributed to the relatively low ph level caused by fe2 dosing compared to those in other enhanced zvi systems fig s10 another reason may be the presence of fe2 in aqueous phase which was verified by the experiment results of se vi removal by zvi and zvi fe2 at ph 5 5 by adjusting with hcl naoh manually fig s11 fig 4 attempted to unravel the relationship between the amounts of se vi removed within 72 h and the initial pseudo first order rate constants of se vi sequestration in different enhanced zvi systems at ph0 4 5 9 0 obviously a larger initial removal rate did not necessarily lead to more se vi removal at the end of reaction for instance as illustrated in fig 4 sulfidation was most effective in increasing the rate of se vi removal by zvi among the four tested methods but much less se vi was removed by s zvi within 72 h compared to that in zvi fe2 system this suggested that sulfidation could not only dramatically enhance the rate of se vi removal by zvi but also greatly accelerated the side reactions between zvi and h h2o o2 resulting in the rapid exhaustion of zvi on the other hand the largest amount of se vi was removed in zvi fe2 system although the rates of se vi removal in this system were generally smaller than those in s zvi and zvi wmf systems compared to sulfidation treatment and fe2 application h2o2 and wmf application for enhancing se vi removal by zvi did not have distinct advantages with regard to both removal rate of se vi and the amount of removed se vi to better describe the different behaviors of se vi removal in different systems the utilization ratio of reductant urr electron efficiency of reductant eer and specific removal capacity src of different systems for se vi removal were evaluated which will be discussed in detail in the following section 3 3 the selectivity of zvi toward se vi removal eer defined as the percentage of electrons transferred to the target contaminant over the amount of electrons donated by zvi and other reductants if there are any is used to assess the selectivity of reductants toward target contaminant during reductive removal of contaminant by enhanced zvi system the electrons provided by s and dosed fe2 should also be taken into account where s zvi and zvi fe2 was employed molar quantities of s with various valence states in s zvi before and reaction with se vi were determined the method for determining the fractions of s ii s i s 0 and s vi is present in text s5 and the data are depicted in fig s12 the eer of bare zvi zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 and zvi wmf systems and s zvi for se vi sequestration can be calculated via equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 eer 2 n se iv 6 n se 0 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii 2 eer 2 n se iv 6 n se 0 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii 8 n s vi n s vi 2 n s 0 n s 0 n s i n s i where nse iv nse 0 nfe iii nfe ii ns vi ns 0 and ns i are the molar quantities of se iv se 0 fe iii fe ii s vi s 0 and s i in both solid and liquid phases at given reaction time respectively n fe iii n fe ii n s vi n s 0 and n s i stand for the molar quantities of fe iii fe ii s vi s 0 and s i in both solid and liquid phases before the reaction respectively obviously eer could reflect the ability of target contaminant to compete with h2o h o2 for electrons donated primarily by zvi and secondly by other reductants if there are any it should be specified that the eer values calculated using equations 1 and 2 are not the instantaneous electron efficiencies of zvi but are the mean values during the whole elapsed time utilization ratio of reductants urr describes the fraction of consumed reductants primarily fe0 and secondly fe2 and low valent s if there are any at given reaction time similar to the calculating method of eer the electrons provided by the low valent s and dosed fe2 should be taken into consideration to calculate urr of s zvi and zvi fe2 the urr of bare zvi zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 and zvi wmf systems and s zvi can be calculated via equations 3 and 4 respectively 3 urr 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii n fe ii 3 n fe 0 4 urr 3 n fe iii n fe iii 2 n fe ii n fe ii 8 n s vi n s vi 2 n s 0 n s 0 n s i n s i n fe ii 3 n fe 0 6 n s 0 7 n s i 8 n s ii where n fe 0 and n s ii stand for the molar quantities of fe 0 and s ii in the zvi or s zvi samples before reaction respectively specific removal capacity src is defined as the ratio of the amount of removed se vi to the consumed fe0 and it can be calculated via equation 5 5 src n se removal n fe 0 n fe 0 where nfe 0 and nse removal are the molar quantities of fe 0 and sequestrated se at given reaction time respectively src indicates the capacity of consumed fe0 to remove pollutants regardless of the removal mechanism the calculation of src only considers the consumption of fe0 whereas the contribution of s and dosed fe2 is not taken into account if the target contaminant is removed by reduction and fe0 is the predominant electron donor src is proportional to eer in order to determine the amounts of se 0 se iv and se vi in solid phase se k edge xanes spectra of zvi samples reacted with se vi after different reaction durations were collected and lcf analysis was performed see details in text s6 and fig s13 as shown in fig 5 as the reaction time elapsed the amount of total se in the precipitate gradually ascended for all enhanced zvi systems and the removed se vi was mainly present as se 0 and se iv moreover the fractions of se iv and se vi in the precipitates dropped with reaction time while that of se 0 increased with reaction time which indicated that adsorption followed by reduction was the major mechanism of se vi removal by zvi at the end of 72 h se vi was completely reduced to se 0 and se iv in the collected precipitates in all four tested systems thus the removal mechanism of se vi in these four enhanced zvi systems was similar but the enhancing techniques affected the rates and amounts of se vi removal by zvi to determine the contents of fe 0 fe ii and fe iii in reacted zvi samples a digestion method with concentrated hcl text s3 was adopted and the results were summarized in tables s1 and s2 taking together the values of eer urr and src for different zvi systems were calculated and graphed in fig 6 it should be noted that the contribution of low valent s to the calculated eer and urr values of s zvi is minor as summarized in table s3 indicating that the predominant electron donor in s zvi is fe0 as demonstrated in fig 6a for all the tested enhanced zvi systems the values of urr were always larger than that of bare zvi at the same reaction time for example only 64 1 of fe0 in bare zvi system was oxidized within 48 h while 83 3 of reductant had been oxidized in s zvi within 24 h urr increased gradually with reaction time in all the four enhanced zvi systems indicating the continuous corrosion of zvi based on the extents in promoting urr these methods could be ranked in the order of s zvi zvi wmf zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 zvi from most to least enhanced the relatively low urr in zvi h2o2 system might be attributed to the side reactions between zvi and h2o2 ma et al 2016 as depicted in fig 6b the eer of bare zvi was determined to be as low as 0 5 at 48 h namely almost all of the electrons donated by zvi were consumed by non target h h2o o2 in contrast when the enhancing methods were applied the eer values were considerably increased for example the eer values of s zvi and zvi wmf systems elevated quickly to 4 23 and 4 03 within 12 h respectively which were greater than those of zvi fe2 and zvi h2o2 this trend was consistent with the fact that more se vi were removed by s zvi and zvi wmf within the initial 12 h as demonstrated in fig s2 the eer value of s zvi dropped slightly to 4 06 at 24 h which should be due to the little reduction of se vi but much oxidation of the residual fe0 during this period the eer values of zvi h2o2 and zvi wmf systems were very close at the end of 72 h and were 4 32 and 4 66 respectively the change of eer value of zvi fe2 with time was very different from those of other enhanced zvi systems which kept increasing during the whole reaction process and was as high as 8 72 at the end of 72 h highlighting its advantages in promoting the selectivity of zvi over the other three zvi systems as shown in figs s2 and 5 although less se vi was removed by zvi fe2 in the first 12 h than in the other three enhanced zvi systems the process of se vi sequestration and the conversion of adsorbed se vi to se iv se 0 continued until almost 100 se vi was removed at 72 h in zvi fe2 system the increase in eer value suggested that either the side reactions between zvi and h2o h o2 were retarded or the reaction of target contaminants reduction by zvi was promoted to a greater extent than that of non targets considering the zvi corrosion rate in the four enhanced zvi systems the observed elevation in eer arising from the application of enhancing techniques should be ascribed to the later however the exact mechanism involved in each enhancing strategy warrants further investigation fig 6c illustrated the evolution of src in different enhanced zvi systems with reaction time the src of s zvi was almost constant varying from 20 67 to 21 49 mmol se vi mol consumed fe0 during 2 h 24 h due to the rapid removal of se vi by s zvi although the src of zvi wmf system was much greater than that of zvi h2o2 system during the first 12 h they became very close hereafter comparing the data present in fig 6c and b the evolution of eer and src with time were very similar except for s zvi as shown in fig s14 there was a perfect correlation of src and eer for zvi wmf zvi fe2 and zvi h2o2 systems which should be due to the fact that reduction was the major mechanism of se vi removal and fe0 was the predominant electron donor 3 4 comprehensive comparison and cost analysis to select promising zvi technologies for real application many factors should be considered fig 7 summarizes the results of zvi fe2 zvi h2o2 s zvi and zvi wmf for se vi sequestration it involves four categories of indicators the reactivity index including the amount of se vi removed within 72 h and se vi removal rate constants k obs the utilization index represented by urr at the end of reaction the selectivity index represented by eer and src of different enhanced zvi systems at the end of reaction the adaptability index manifested by the relative standard deviation rsd of removed se vi at ph0 4 5 9 0 except the adaptability index the other three indexes were obtained from the data of experiments conducted under the optimized enhancing conditions at ph0 6 0 fig 7 shows that se vi sequestration by zvi fe2 has advantages in most of aspects with large removal capacity and eer for se vi and good adaptability to ph the only disadvantage of zvi fe2 lies in its relatively slow reaction rate the only superiority of s zvi for se vi removal is that its larger reaction rate compared to the other three enhanced zvi systems sequestrating se vi with s zvi should be favorable under the situations where the footprint for water pollution control unit is limited however the merits of zvi wmf and zvi h2o2 are not obvious in terms of these parameters although the performance of zvi wmf is slightly better than zvi h2o2 considering all the indexes evaluated in this study with regard to real field applications the cost of investment and operation is obviously another key consideration providing a wmf with permanent magnets to enhance se vi removal by zvi needs no extra operation cost but the investment cost of permanent magnets as well as the reasonable design of reactors with wmf should be considered however the operation cost is elevated when the other three tested enhanced zvi technologies are performed in practice because extra reagents are needed according to the information provided at internet www alibaba com the prices of ferrous chloride tetrahydrate hydrogen peroxide and sulphur powder of industrial grade are in the range of 60 120 usd t 150 220 usd t and 130 180 usd t respectively here we define the cost of the material used to enhance se vi removal by zvi as follows 6 cost m p m se where m and mse represent the mass of the consumed material and the removed se and p stands for price of the material the chemical costs of fe2 h2o2 and sulfidation are 0 20 0 40 usd kg se 2 66 3 90 usd kg se and 0 15 0 21 usd kg se respectively considering the dosages of fe2 h2o2 and s used in this study h2o2 dosing is the most expensive among these enhancing methods for removing the same quantity of se vi but the merit of this technique is that h2o2 could decompose and there is no extra residual introduced by the material added the material cost of sulfidation is relatively low among these three zvi enhancing techniques but the energy input of the s zvi synthetic process arising from ball milling should not be ignored in the practical use although fe2 application is more expensive than sulfidation treatment it is much more easy to be realized in real practice than sulfidation treatment since fe2 can be directly dosed into the tank of removing se vi by zvi 4 conclusions the results of this study revealed that adding fe2 h2o2 dosing sulfidation and the superposition of wmf greatly enhanced se vi removal by zvi compared with zvi alone among these four enhanced zvi technologies zvi fe2 attained the largest amount of se vi sequestration whereas s zvi removed se vi with the largest reaction rate all of these enhancing techniques accelerated the corrosion of zvi which verified that the corrosion of zvi was a necessity and a manifestation of contaminants removal by zvi increasing ph resulted in a drop in the amount of se vi removed by zvi h2o2 zvi wmf and s zvi however the amount of se vi removed by zvi fe2 and the corresponding k obs changed slightly as ph0 ranged from 4 5 to 9 0 the se k edge xanes spectra analysis revealed that adsorption followed by reduction was the major mechanism of se vi removal by zvi in different enhanced zvi systems the four tested enhancing techniques did not change the removal mechanisms of se vi by zvi but affected the rates and amounts of se vi removal by zvi all of the four enhancing techniques increased urr eer and src of zvi considering the amount of removed se vi the urr of zvi at the end of reaction eer and src of zvi the adaptability over a wide ph range as well as the chemical cost zvi fe2 was superior to the other three tested enhanced zvi technologies the bottleneck of zvi fe2 technology lies in its relatively low reactivity toward se vi research is being carried out in our lab to enhance the reactivity of zvi fe2 system toward se vi and further study on pilot scale is necessary to examine the superiority of zvi fe2 system for se vi removal moreover the feasibility of employing fe2 to enhance the performance of zvi should also be examined with zvi of different

18791,dissolved organic nitrogen don formed by microbial metabolism in wastewater treatment processes adversely impacts wastewater reuse and receiving waters quality and microbial metabolism is greatly influenced by temperatures however little is known about the effect of microorganisms on don and bioavailable don abdon formation under low temperatures in this study six reactors were operated at low 8 c and 15 c and room 25 c temperatures to evaluate the relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and don and abdon results showed that don and abdon concentrations significantly increased at low temperatures p 0 05 t test don formation was significantly correlated to microbial activity only with adenosine triphosphate negative r 0 64 and polysaccharide positive r 0 61 as key indicators however abdon formation was influenced by both microbial activity polysaccharide triphenyltetrazolium chloride dehydrogenases adenosine triphosphate and microbial community structure short term tests using the biomass from six reactors were performed at room temperature to further validate the relationship the distinct differences between these results provide a basis

2006 causing a concern with the precursors of disinfection by products and membrane fouling pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 moreover a considerable portion of don bioavailable don abdon can be easily utilized by alga and bacteria which can support eutrophication in receiving waters eom et al 2017 less don and abdon in effluent is therefore desirable to minimize the negative impact on reused wastewater and receiving water quality in mwwtps effluent don consists of influent derived and microorganism derived nitrogenous compounds pehlivanoglu mantas et al 2006 sattayatewa et al 2009 compared to influent derived don which is refractory during biological treatment microorganism derived don produced during the treatment processes is liable to vary in different operational parameters and engineering conditions sattayatewa et al 2009 moreover protein and amino acids as major components of microorganism derived don are readily bioavailable with greater potential to stimulate algal growth jarusutthirak and amy 2007 hu et al 2018b several studies have found that some forms of microorganism derived don such as soluble microbial products smps can be minimized by process parameters ni et al 2010 xu et al 2011 simsek et al 2016 xu et al 2011 identified temperature as the most influential parameter for smps formation and suggested an optimal strategy for a minimum smp formation in a lab scale activated sludge as system however relatively little is known about how to modulate don and abdon formation due to a paucity of information regarding the formation of don and abdon in biotreatment temperature is a key and uncontrollable operational parameter in mwwtps impacting microbial metabolism and microbial communities czerwionka et al 2012 he et al 2018 in as systems low temperatures are problematic to the biological nitrogen removal processes young et al 2017 this issue has been extensively investigated with results demonstrating that the changes of enzymatic activity and microbial community composition are significant contributors to depressed dissolved inorganic nitrogen din removal under cold conditions yang et al 2007 he et al 2016 young et al 2017 traditionally effluent don was believed to be fully nonbiodegradable and hence would not be utilized as a nutrient source for aquatic plant species simsek et al 2013 thus less attention has been given to don and abdon versus din under low temperatures evidence from a study found that don concentrations varied with seasonal temperature fluctuation in a full scale wastewater treatment plant hu et al 2017 but this study simply focused on monitoring the variation of effluent don the causes of effluent don instability have not been clearly identified thus appropriate solutions have not yet been suggested to reduce effluent don under cold conditions nitrogen removal in an as system relies on microorganism and microbial communities significantly vary with temperatures moll et al 1999 the symbiotic relationship among diverse nitrifiers is thought to be responsible for the stabilization nitrification at seasonal temperature variation young et al 2017 however previous studies are limited to monitoring shifts of microbial communities with temperature in nitrogen removal systems shahzad et al 2015 hulsen et al 2016 he et al 2018 microbial community compositions related to don formation have not been characterized a few studies have identified phylogenetic groups of heterotrophic bacteria assimilating smps by nitrifying bacteria kindaichi et al 2004 bae et al 2015 consequently it is expected that microbial communities can associate with the formation of don microbial activity plays a vital role in microbial metabolisms and biotransformation of organic compounds barker and stuckey 1999 as a source of and a sink for don bacteria can excrete enzymes that regulate nitrogen transport and catabolism chubukov et al 2014 in response to environmental stress such as low temperatures microbes can directly release don due to autolysis which occurs when microorganisms produce enzymes that destroy their own cell membranes sipler et al 2015 the variation of enzymes regulates microbial growth and cell lysis involving the excretion of don therefore the core of the formation of don in an as system also depends on the association between don and microbial activity with respect to enzymes in the metabolic processes less work has been carried out on a complete picture of the relationship between microbes and don and abdon versus din the relationship between microbes and effluent equality such as effluent don is crucial for engineering operations in mwwtps for instance operational parameters control provides cost efficient din removal under low temperatures which can be readily manipulated to improve effluent quality in terms of the association between microbial function and communities and din removal however knowledge on the relationship between microbes and don and abdon formation under low temperatures has not been established to date our understanding of how microbes interact don and abdon is the first step to improve effluent quality of mwwtps and protect receiving waters thus the relationship between microbes and don and abdon should be evaluated to provide a basis on the mechanism of don and abdon production for further control strategies don and abdon formed during biological wastewater treatment processes can originate from biomass growth and cell lysis the organic aggregates bound by extracellular polymeric substances eps are known to form don and abdon through the mineralization sheng et al 2010 in response to cold stress some microbes release don and abdon as the result of enzyme decomposition such as dehydrogenases and the cell membranes breakdowns sipler and bronk 2015 these bioprocesses are driven by adenosine triphosphate atp which emerges as a key modulator in the metabolic network chubukov et al 2014 in this study we investigated don and abdon formation microbial community compositions and key indicators correlated with metabolisms such as atp and dehydrogenases the relationship between microbial activity and microbial communities and don and abdon formation under cold conditions is evaluated by long term parent reactors under low 8 c and 15 c and room temperatures 25 c this relationship is further validated by short term batch tests using the biomass from the parent reactors this study can provide useful information for further wastewater treatment strategies on nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of parent reactors and samples collection six parent sequencing batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 2 l were conducted for cultivating the as the reactors were maintained sequentially with a 12 h cycle of 4 h denitrification following 6 h nitrification and 2 h settling sun et al 2017 the low temperatures of 8 c and 15 c play important roles in nitrogen cycle in mwwtps pang et al 2015 young et al 2017 therefore duplicate sbrs were established for low temperature groups 8 c and 15 c to simulate the cold stress and room temperature groups 25 c as control the six sbrs were set at a solids retention time srt of 20 days to ensure optimum conditions for nitrifiers chen et al 2012 there was no recirculation resulting in hydraulic retention time hrt being the same as srt and the operational time was at least 3 srts to reach steady state simsek et al 2016 the desired srts of six parent reactors were maintained by controlling of sludge wasted from the reactors at the end of nitrification in each cycle jarusutthirak and amy 2007 the withdrawal amount was equal to 100 ml d sludge was taken from a full scale mwwtp in nanjing china and was used as inoculum prior to the experiments the sludge was washed three times with tap water and three times with milli q water to remove external soluble substances the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss

filtrating colloidal materials and suspended solid in effluent makinia et al 2011 czerwionka et al 2012 and the filtate was stored at 4 c until analysis effluent was collected and analyzed for don and abdon every five days after the six reactors became stable all of the samples were run in triplicate 2 2 don and its bioavailability determination samples were analyzed for total dissolved nitrogen tdn and the sum of din species no3 no2 and nh4 don was calculated by subtracting din from tdn eq 1 saunders et al 2017 the bioavailability of don abdon don was evaluated in a 14 day algal bioassay

incubate 100 ml filtered samplers in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask this approach can imitate the actual behavior of the microorganism in receiving waters and nutrient recycling and eutrophication by algal

bioassay by adding the inoculum to the milli q water and treating it in accordance with the sample eq 2 don bioavailability can be calculated by the ratio of abdon to don eq 3 1 don mg l tdn no3 n no2

microbial activity microbial community and the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures the tests were performed using the biomass collected from the low and room temperature parent reactors at the steady state of six parent reactors short term tests were performed at room temperature 25 c method s3 for each batch tests synthetic wastewater was added to the same volume of the mixed liquor from a parent reactor in a beaker and the initial concentrations of cod ammonia and tp were the same as the influent of six parent reactors microbial activity tests with the same approaches in the parent reactors were performed for each short term batch reactors to understand the different roles of microbial activity and microbial communities on the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures 2 4 microbial activity test 2 4 1 adenosine triphosphate atp in as determination the concentration of atp in as was measured using the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega

york was conducted for t test analysis of variance anova and pearson s correlation analysis accepting p value of 0 05 as indication significance principal component analysis pca was used to identify dominant patterns in microbial communities at different temperatures and convert possible correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated variables for subsequent analysis of the correlation relationship the paleontological statistics software past version 3 01 was used for the pca and canoco 4 5 was used for redundancy analysis rda 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance at different temperatures stable performance was achieved in six parent reactors the mlss and ph reached constant values at 8 c 15 c and 25 c fig s1 the low and room temperature reactors achieved stable cod removal efficiencies 90 98 and complete ammonia removal over 60 d prior to when short term tests were operated fig s2 further no accumulation of nitrite was observed in either reactor indicating complete nitrification under three temperatures effluent tdn concentrations were slightly higher in the low temperature than the room temperature parent reactors with average tdn removal efficiencies of 65 4 at 8 c 80 6 at 15 c and 85 5 at 25 c fig s3 nitrogen removal in as system may be due to nitrogen assimilation and denitrification stadler and love 2016 with respect to tdn average removal efficiencies were lower at low than room temperature parent reactors indicating cold conditions influence nitrogen removal efficiency 3 2 don abdon and don bioavailability under different temperatures long term low temperature conditions had a significant effect on effluent din as well as on don and abdon produced in as fig s3 and fig 1 higher concentrations of tdn don and abdon were determined in low versus room temperature conditions fig 1 in long term tests effluent don in parent reactors at 25 c 0 90 0 11 mg l was significantly lower than that at 15 c 1 10 0 13 mg l p 0 05 and at 8 c 1 17 0 12 mg l p 0 05 t test fig 1 abdon produced by microbes showed increasing trends with temperature decreasing and was significantly higher in low temperature groups compared to the control p 0 05 t test fig 1 previous studies have found that nitrogen removal processes are commonly depressed under low temperature conditions pang et al 2015 hulsen et al 2016 in this study these results showed that low temperature growth conditions not only resulted in poor removal efficiency of din but also higher effluent don and abdon concentrations the bioavailability of don in long term tests significantly increased as temperature decreased from 25 c to 8 c p 0 05 anova fig 1 ranging from 56 at 25 c to 66 at 8 c the values of don bioavailability were mostly in accordance to those 18 61 reported by sattayatewa et al 2009 and hu et al 2018a our results support that don bioavailability is sensitive with temperature changes fig 1 indicating that nitrogenous organic compounds are changed under low temperatures previous studies have demonstrated the potential of bacteria to excrete don by membrane transport and through cell lysis sipler and bronk 2015 a portion of don excreted by microbes is postulated to be in equilibrium with as organisms under stressful conditions or during bacterial growth furthermore nitrogenous compounds derived from smps readily stimulate algal growth liu et al 2011 smps as a part of effluent don for mwwtps are released into the effluent through substrate metabolism and microbial decay sattayatewa et al 2009 xu et al 2011 temperature identified as a key factor in mwwtps plays an important role in microbial metabolisms and the production of nitrogenous organics such as smps xu et al 2011 therefore the collective results suggest that higher concentrations of don derived from as system under low temperatures could be contributed to the variations in microbial metabolisms this also could be the reason why higher effluent don bioavailability was observed at low temperatures 3 3 relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and don under different temperatures the key indicators correlated with metabolisms such as atp and dehydrogenases were used to represent microbial activity pearson s correlation analysis is used to evaluate the covariation across variables of microbial activity and don formation under low temperatures and the influential degrees of variables of microbial activity on don formation as expected reduced activity was observed with respect to the results of atp sour and dehydrogenases don formation was significantly positively correlated with ps r 0 61 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with atp r 0 64 p 0 05 fig 2 a but not with other indicators of microbial activity r 0 6 or p 0 05 fig 2a atp showed the most significant effect on don formation under cold conditions when compared to all of indicators followed by ps in terms of the value of correlation coefficients this result indicates that the processes associated with the changes of atp and ps may result in an increase in the formation of don the links between atp ps and don formation under low temperatures could be due to several factors first don formation may be involved in the release of nitrogenous organics after cell lysis a reduced atp concentration in low temperatures implies the increase of cell lysis with the release of nitrogenous organics previous studies have demonstrated that cellular debris after cell lysis are composed of nitrogenous organics such as proteins and amino acids hammes et al 2010 kujawinski 2011 this is consistent with our postulation additionally another possible explanation for the relationship is the equilibrium of cell in response to stressful conditions previous studies found that microorganisms can excrete soluble nitrogenous organics across cell membrane to establish the equilibrium barker and stuckey 1999 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 for the association of ps and don an alternative explanation is that ps as a component of eps and eps can be released from microbial aggregates contributing to effluent don don is a complex and heterogenous mixture of compounds including urea proteins nucleic acids and humic substances pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 moreover almost 70 of the don is unidentifiable pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the formation of don in an as system can be affected through the changes of any components of don such as amino acids and urea thus theoretically don is not necessarily linear correlated with pn while reduced values of dehydrogenases and sour were observed they did not significantly or strongly associate with don under low temperatures this may be due to the difference of bioprocesses contributing to don formation microbial variability across three temperatures was captured by sequences assigning at the phylum level and pca pc1 88 7 variance explained and pc2 8 0 variance explained fig s6 and s8 by pearson s correlation analysis the interconnections between don and microbial community structure were established in terms of classified bacterium from plfa analysis and bacterial phyla pc1 and pc2 from 16s rrna gene sequencing fig 2a the results showed that under low temperatures the formation of don was not significantly related to microbial community composition regardless of the taxonomy of communities r 0 6 or p 0 05 it is important to note the differences in the relationship between microbial activity microbial community structure and don the correlation coefficients imply that the influential priorities of microbial activity are greater than microbial community structure few studies have investigated the impact of microorganisms on don under stressful conditions in mwwtps but a research on don in the natural environment indicates that this discrepancy may attribute to the regulation of microbes kujawinski 2011 microbes excrete organic compounds as metabolites during microbial growth and cell lysis that in turn can be assimilated by cells microorganisms at low temperatures tend to in equilibrium with environmental conditions by excretion and assimilation the correlated coefficient may overlook the dynamic changes resulting in no significant correlation between the communities and don formation thus further analysis is needed to validate the relationship between microbes and don 3 4 relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and abdon under different temperatures pearson s correlation analysis revealed strong and significant associations between microbial activity microbial community structure and abdon under low temperatures fig 2b ps and effluent abdon were positively correlated under low temperature conditions r 0 74 p 0 05 fig 2b moreover this result is consistent with the relationship between ps and don fig 2a significant negative correlations were found between abdon and atp r 0 68 p 0 05 ttc dha r 0 71 p 0 05 and pc1 r 0 73 p 0 05 with the other indicators exhibiting less significant or less weak correlation with effluent abdon r 0 6 or p 0 05 these results suggest that the formation of abdon is not only related to microbial activity but also to microbial communities fig 2b furthermore only a subset of indicators significantly associated with abdon production and their influential priorities on abdon formation were ps pc1 microbial communities ttc dha atp ps and atp were more significantly and strongly correlated with abdon than don fig 2 the significant relationship between ps and don and abdon is supported by the fact that nitrogenous organics are released after the breakdown of the barriers formed from various ps furthermore ps can provide additional enzymatic capacity to digest macromolecular nitrogenous organics flemming 2016 sheng et al 2010 similarly the abdon formation can be contributed to the reduced microbial activity driven by low temperatures ttc dha closely associates with oxidative phosphorylation process and atp is identified as an energy rich metabolic compound and both ttc dha and atp reflected microbial activity hammes et al 2010 liu et al 2014 furthermore atp plays a central role in the nitrogen cycle in mwwtps the formation of nitrogenous organics in nitrogen catabolism is mostly mediated by atp which is the thermodynamic driving force of all cellular processes chubukov et al 2014 temperature is a limiting condition it will slow metabolic activity and accelerate the death of some bacteria resulting in increased concentrations of abdon in effluent due to cell lysis for the negative correlation between microbial communities and abdon rda was used to determine the significant environmental parameters shaping microbial communities and the dominated bacteria affecting the formation of abdon the relationship was captured by two rd modes rd1 54 3 variance explained and rd2 0 1 variance explained both significant at a p 0 05 level fig 3 symbol size of each circle symbols indicates the sum of relative abundance of microbes at phylum level in samples a separation of microbes was observed in rd1 axis in which microbes in the orange and blue shadow were positively correlated with rd1 and negatively correlated with rd1 respectively especially proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes not only positively associated with abdon but also dominated in all of samples implying these bacteria had a significant effect in promoting the formation of abdon conversely tm7 dominated in as system displaying a negative correlation with abdon the bioprocesses in different microorganisms could be various and a set of microbes can have particular preferred organics involving specific bioprocesses chubukov et al 2014 various molecular characteristics of abdon excreted by microorganisms may result in the different contributions of microbes at the phylum level to abdon formation despite the differences in the relationship between microbial communities and don and abdon the correlation of microbial activity and don and abdon are similar the correlation coefficients indicate that microbial activity is more closely correlated to abdon atp r 0 68 ps r 0 74 versus don atp r 0 64 ps r 0 61 an alternative hypothesis for the results is that major nitrogenous organics produced in microbial metabolism under non steady state conditions are composed of low molecular compounds such as proteins amino acids and other small molecules which are identified as components of abdon hu et al 2018a this postulation is also consistent with a study that showed smps produced in a bench scale sbr consisted of more molecular weight 1 kda 30 50 versus molecular weight 1 kda 25 45 contents jarusutthirak and amy 2007 taken together these results illustrate that the community undergoes a physiological and structural variation with low temperature conditions and the microbial activity differences may outplay phylogenetic groupings in don and abdon formation 3 5 short term test on the relationship between microbes and the formation of don and abdon driven by low temperatures the relationship between microbes and don and abdon was established by pearson s analysis in long term tests however a bias may exist in established relationship as the correlation relationship is based only on p value and r value to rule out the presence of overestimation by the relationship and further confirm the linkages between microbes and the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures the short term tests were performed at 25 c by taking mixed liquor from six parent reactors this experimental design resulted in the batch tests having the same microbial communities as those in long term tests according to the result of batch tests no significant difference was observed between effluent don of parent biomass at three temperatures room temperature 0 89 0 15 mg l 15 c 0 89 0 15 mg l and 8 c 0 91 0 16 mg l p 0 05 t test fig 4 similarly abdon concentrations and don bioavailability were comparable between the low and room temperature parent biomass in batch tests p 0 05 t test fig 4 furthermore the results of microbial activity tests in batch tests observed no significant differences of atp ps ttc dhc and sour in low and room temperatures parent reactor biomass p 0 05 anova fig 5 similar effluent quality and microbial activity were observed at room temperature batch conditions regardless of parent reactor biomass it identifies the significant impacts of microbial activity on the formation of don and abdon from low to room temperatures however the impacts of low temperatures on don and abdon via shifts of microbial community structure were not showed the results are consistent with the aforementioned relationship between don and microbial communities but they are in conflict with the evaluated relationship between abdon and microbial communities the discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that the influential priorities of the indicators are microbial activity microbial community structure despite the strong correlation between the communities and abdon as observed in long term tests the effect of microbial community structure on abdon was not found in short term tests it is a possible explanation that the effect of physiological alterations may outplay phylogenetic groupings on abdon formation 3 6 implications of the relationship between microbes and don and abdon under low temperatures the more stringent discharge standard for nitrogen removal requires the improvement of effluent quality with respect to don several studies have focused on the advanced treatment of don such as coagulation lee and westerhoff 2006 and powdered activated carbon adsorption chen et al 2011 the mwwtps tend to upgrading reconstruction but the switching from conventional treatment to advanced treatments would significantly increase investments costs and the risk of secondary pollution suitable and cost efficient approaches to reduce effluent don and abdon is therefore necessary previous studies have identified that some microorganism derived don are liable to reduce by operational parameters in mwwtps xu et al 2011 simsek et al 2016 it suggests that controlling operational parameter can decrease effluent don but there is a paucity of the fundamental information on the strategy to control don and abdon our study shows that don formation strongly associates with microbial activity atp and ps and abdon formation is strongly correlated to both microbial activity and microbial communities ps pc1 ttc dha atp fig 2 the influential priorities as the media of operational parameters and effluent don and abdon can be useful to control the formation of don and abdon at low temperatures for instance many alternatives e g hrt taimur khan et al 2013 and srt al halbouni et al 2008 can be applied to reducing don production which is strongly relative to ps in eps in addition our results highlight that there are distinct differences between the effect of microbes on don and abdon formation suggesting that the strategy of effluent nitrogen controlling needs to consider effluent don and abdon separately under low temperatures more feasible strategies on controlling effluent nitrogen can be designed with regard to the effluent with different don bioavailability for example when abdon plays in point source in the discharges of nitrogen the decrease of abdon can have more positive effects on meeting the requirement of the strict standards requirements we can decrease aeration in terms of the association of aeration and eps menniti and morgenroth 2010 and subsequently control the formation of abdon by the relationship between microbes and abdon due to the influential priorities of microbes on abdon for the effluents with low ratios of abdon reducing don is preferred over controlling abdon under low temperatures in the context of the most significant influential factors on don the operational parameters involving the increasing of atp can be considered to modulate the response of don to atp under low temperatures thus future research focusing on the strategy of reducing don and abdon could be important on this topic the results of this study will be benefit to optimize operation in mwwtps to minimize effluent don and abdon under cold conditions furthermore the detail of how to manipulate operation in mwwtps with the holistic approach are required with further study 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the formation of don and abdon under different temperatures and evaluated the relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and don and abdon at three temperatures 8 c 15 c and 25 c in the as system the following conclusions can be drawn from this study operation at low temperature 8 c and 15 c during long term tests can exacerbate the formation of don and abdon than that at room temperatures 25 c effluent don and abdon significantly increase under low temperature versus room temperature conditions p 0 05 t test statistical analysis indicates that microbial activity especially atp and ps is more strongly correlated to don formation under low temperatures the formation of abdon can significantly associate with both microbial activity and microbial community structure the influential priorities of variables on abdon formation are ps pc1 ttc dha atp distinct differences exist between the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures which may provide a basis for considering them separately in the strategy of improving water quality and safety under low temperatures notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the

18791,dissolved organic nitrogen don formed by microbial metabolism in wastewater treatment processes adversely impacts wastewater reuse and receiving waters quality and microbial metabolism is greatly influenced by temperatures however little is known about the effect of microorganisms on don and bioavailable don abdon formation under low temperatures in this study six reactors were operated at low 8 c and 15 c and room 25 c temperatures to evaluate the relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and don and abdon results showed that don and abdon concentrations significantly increased at low temperatures p 0 05 t test don formation was significantly correlated to microbial activity only with adenosine triphosphate negative r 0 64 and polysaccharide positive r 0 61 as key indicators however abdon formation was influenced by both microbial activity polysaccharide triphenyltetrazolium chloride dehydrogenases adenosine triphosphate and microbial community structure short term tests using the biomass from six reactors were performed at room temperature to further validate the relationship the distinct differences between these results provide a basis

2006 causing a concern with the precursors of disinfection by products and membrane fouling pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 moreover a considerable portion of don bioavailable don abdon can be easily utilized by alga and bacteria which can support eutrophication in receiving waters eom et al 2017 less don and abdon in effluent is therefore desirable to minimize the negative impact on reused wastewater and receiving water quality in mwwtps effluent don consists of influent derived and microorganism derived nitrogenous compounds pehlivanoglu mantas et al 2006 sattayatewa et al 2009 compared to influent derived don which is refractory during biological treatment microorganism derived don produced during the treatment processes is liable to vary in different operational parameters and engineering conditions sattayatewa et al 2009 moreover protein and amino acids as major components of microorganism derived don are readily bioavailable with greater potential to stimulate algal growth jarusutthirak and amy 2007 hu et al 2018b several studies have found that some forms of microorganism derived don such as soluble microbial products smps can be minimized by process parameters ni et al 2010 xu et al 2011 simsek et al 2016 xu et al 2011 identified temperature as the most influential parameter for smps formation and suggested an optimal strategy for a minimum smp formation in a lab scale activated sludge as system however relatively little is known about how to modulate don and abdon formation due to a paucity of information regarding the formation of don and abdon in biotreatment temperature is a key and uncontrollable operational parameter in mwwtps impacting microbial metabolism and microbial communities czerwionka et al 2012 he et al 2018 in as systems low temperatures are problematic to the biological nitrogen removal processes young et al 2017 this issue has been extensively investigated with results demonstrating that the changes of enzymatic activity and microbial community composition are significant contributors to depressed dissolved inorganic nitrogen din removal under cold conditions yang et al 2007 he et al 2016 young et al 2017 traditionally effluent don was believed to be fully nonbiodegradable and hence would not be utilized as a nutrient source for aquatic plant species simsek et al 2013 thus less attention has been given to don and abdon versus din under low temperatures evidence from a study found that don concentrations varied with seasonal temperature fluctuation in a full scale wastewater treatment plant hu et al 2017 but this study simply focused on monitoring the variation of effluent don the causes of effluent don instability have not been clearly identified thus appropriate solutions have not yet been suggested to reduce effluent don under cold conditions nitrogen removal in an as system relies on microorganism and microbial communities significantly vary with temperatures moll et al 1999 the symbiotic relationship among diverse nitrifiers is thought to be responsible for the stabilization nitrification at seasonal temperature variation young et al 2017 however previous studies are limited to monitoring shifts of microbial communities with temperature in nitrogen removal systems shahzad et al 2015 hulsen et al 2016 he et al 2018 microbial community compositions related to don formation have not been characterized a few studies have identified phylogenetic groups of heterotrophic bacteria assimilating smps by nitrifying bacteria kindaichi et al 2004 bae et al 2015 consequently it is expected that microbial communities can associate with the formation of don microbial activity plays a vital role in microbial metabolisms and biotransformation of organic compounds barker and stuckey 1999 as a source of and a sink for don bacteria can excrete enzymes that regulate nitrogen transport and catabolism chubukov et al 2014 in response to environmental stress such as low temperatures microbes can directly release don due to autolysis which occurs when microorganisms produce enzymes that destroy their own cell membranes sipler et al 2015 the variation of enzymes regulates microbial growth and cell lysis involving the excretion of don therefore the core of the formation of don in an as system also depends on the association between don and microbial activity with respect to enzymes in the metabolic processes less work has been carried out on a complete picture of the relationship between microbes and don and abdon versus din the relationship between microbes and effluent equality such as effluent don is crucial for engineering operations in mwwtps for instance operational parameters control provides cost efficient din removal under low temperatures which can be readily manipulated to improve effluent quality in terms of the association between microbial function and communities and din removal however knowledge on the relationship between microbes and don and abdon formation under low temperatures has not been established to date our understanding of how microbes interact don and abdon is the first step to improve effluent quality of mwwtps and protect receiving waters thus the relationship between microbes and don and abdon should be evaluated to provide a basis on the mechanism of don and abdon production for further control strategies don and abdon formed during biological wastewater treatment processes can originate from biomass growth and cell lysis the organic aggregates bound by extracellular polymeric substances eps are known to form don and abdon through the mineralization sheng et al 2010 in response to cold stress some microbes release don and abdon as the result of enzyme decomposition such as dehydrogenases and the cell membranes breakdowns sipler and bronk 2015 these bioprocesses are driven by adenosine triphosphate atp which emerges as a key modulator in the metabolic network chubukov et al 2014 in this study we investigated don and abdon formation microbial community compositions and key indicators correlated with metabolisms such as atp and dehydrogenases the relationship between microbial activity and microbial communities and don and abdon formation under cold conditions is evaluated by long term parent reactors under low 8 c and 15 c and room temperatures 25 c this relationship is further validated by short term batch tests using the biomass from the parent reactors this study can provide useful information for further wastewater treatment strategies on nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of parent reactors and samples collection six parent sequencing batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 2 l were conducted for cultivating the as the reactors were maintained sequentially with a 12 h cycle of 4 h denitrification following 6 h nitrification and 2 h settling sun et al 2017 the low temperatures of 8 c and 15 c play important roles in nitrogen cycle in mwwtps pang et al 2015 young et al 2017 therefore duplicate sbrs were established for low temperature groups 8 c and 15 c to simulate the cold stress and room temperature groups 25 c as control the six sbrs were set at a solids retention time srt of 20 days to ensure optimum conditions for nitrifiers chen et al 2012 there was no recirculation resulting in hydraulic retention time hrt being the same as srt and the operational time was at least 3 srts to reach steady state simsek et al 2016 the desired srts of six parent reactors were maintained by controlling of sludge wasted from the reactors at the end of nitrification in each cycle jarusutthirak and amy 2007 the withdrawal amount was equal to 100 ml d sludge was taken from a full scale mwwtp in nanjing china and was used as inoculum prior to the experiments the sludge was washed three times with tap water and three times with milli q water to remove external soluble substances the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration was kept at about 3000 mg l and the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 5 by nahco3 and 1 mol l hcl the sbrs were fed with a synthetic wastewater at chemical oxygen demand cod of 300 mg l ammonium of 20 mg l total phosphorus tp of 3 5 mg l and trace nutrients influent details are provided in supporting information si the 0 45 Î¼m pore size gf f glass fiber filter was used for filtrating colloidal materials and suspended solid in effluent makinia et al 2011 czerwionka et al 2012 and the filtate was stored at 4 c until analysis effluent was collected and analyzed for don and abdon every five days after the six reactors became stable all of the samples were run in triplicate 2 2 don and its bioavailability determination samples were analyzed for total dissolved nitrogen tdn and the sum of din species no3 no2 and nh4 don was calculated by subtracting din from tdn eq 1 saunders et al 2017 the bioavailability of don abdon don was evaluated in a 14 day algal bioassay according to the study of liu et al 2011 nitrate free samples were obtained by using an ion exchange dowex 1 8 chloride form resin sigma aldrich america pretreatment method sattayatewa et al 2009 all of the bioassay was used 1 5 ml of algal seeds selenastrum capricornutum obtained from the fachb collection chinese academy of sciences and 1 0 ml mixed culture bacterial collected from mwwtps to incubate 100 ml filtered samplers in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask this approach can imitate the actual behavior of the microorganism in receiving waters and nutrient recycling and eutrophication by algal and bacterium simsek et al 2016 abdon procedure proceeded by calculating the change of don in the sample before donbi and after incubation doni while a control donf and donbf was conducted for each bioassay by adding the inoculum to the milli q water and treating it in accordance with the sample eq 2 don bioavailability can be calculated by the ratio of abdon to don eq 3 1 don mg l tdn no3 n no2

don in the sample before and after incubation and don in the control before and after incubation 2 3 short term batch tests the short term tests were conducted to identify the relationship between microbial activity microbial community and the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures the tests were performed using the biomass collected from the low and room temperature parent reactors at the steady state of six parent reactors short term tests were performed at room temperature 25 c method s3 for each batch tests synthetic wastewater was added to the same volume of the mixed liquor from a parent reactor in a beaker and the initial concentrations of cod ammonia and tp were the same as the influent of six parent reactors microbial activity tests with the same approaches in the parent reactors were performed for each short term batch reactors to understand the different roles of microbial activity and microbial communities on the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures 2 4 microbial activity test 2 4 1 adenosine triphosphate atp in as determination the concentration of atp in as was measured using the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega

measurement the sour was measured by placing 100 ml as with 200 ml synthetic sewage saturating in air in a 300 ml vial a polarographic oxygen probe mettler toledo america was moved slowly down into

york was conducted for t test analysis of variance anova and pearson s correlation analysis accepting p value of 0 05 as indication significance principal component analysis pca was used to identify dominant patterns in microbial communities at different temperatures and convert possible correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated variables for subsequent analysis of the correlation relationship the paleontological statistics software past version 3 01 was used for the pca and canoco 4 5 was used for redundancy analysis rda 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance at different temperatures stable performance was achieved in six parent reactors the mlss and ph reached constant values at 8 c 15 c and 25 c fig s1 the low and room temperature reactors achieved stable cod removal efficiencies 90 98 and complete ammonia removal over 60 d prior to when short term tests were operated fig s2 further no accumulation of nitrite was observed in either reactor indicating complete nitrification under three temperatures effluent tdn concentrations were slightly higher in the low temperature than the room temperature parent reactors with average tdn removal efficiencies of 65 4 at 8 c 80 6 at 15 c and 85 5 at 25 c fig s3 nitrogen removal in as system may be due to nitrogen assimilation and denitrification stadler and love 2016 with respect to tdn average removal efficiencies were lower at low than room temperature parent reactors indicating cold conditions influence nitrogen removal efficiency 3 2 don abdon and don bioavailability under different temperatures long term low temperature conditions had a significant effect on effluent din as well as on don and abdon produced in as fig s3 and fig 1 higher concentrations of tdn don and abdon were determined in low versus room temperature conditions fig 1 in long term tests effluent don in parent reactors at 25 c 0 90 0 11 mg l was significantly lower than that at 15 c 1 10 0 13 mg l p 0 05 and at 8 c 1 17 0 12 mg l p 0 05 t test fig 1 abdon produced by microbes showed increasing trends with temperature decreasing and was significantly higher in low temperature groups compared to the control p 0 05 t test fig 1 previous studies have found that nitrogen removal processes are commonly depressed under low temperature conditions pang et al 2015 hulsen et al 2016 in this study these results showed that low temperature growth conditions not only resulted in poor removal efficiency of din but also higher effluent don and abdon concentrations the bioavailability of don in long term tests significantly increased as temperature decreased from 25 c to 8 c p 0 05 anova fig 1 ranging from 56 at 25 c to 66 at 8 c the values of don bioavailability were mostly in accordance to those 18 61 reported by sattayatewa et al 2009 and hu et al 2018a our results support that don bioavailability is sensitive with temperature changes fig 1 indicating that nitrogenous organic compounds are changed under low temperatures previous studies have demonstrated the potential of bacteria to excrete don by membrane transport and through cell lysis sipler and bronk 2015 a portion of don excreted by microbes is postulated to be in equilibrium with as organisms under stressful conditions or during bacterial growth furthermore nitrogenous compounds derived from smps readily stimulate algal growth liu et al 2011 smps as a part of effluent don for mwwtps are released into the effluent through substrate metabolism and microbial decay sattayatewa et al 2009 xu et al 2011 temperature identified as a key factor in mwwtps plays an important role in microbial metabolisms and the production of nitrogenous organics such as smps xu et al 2011 therefore the collective results suggest that higher concentrations of don derived from as system under low temperatures could be contributed to the variations in microbial metabolisms this also could be the reason why higher effluent don bioavailability was observed at low temperatures 3 3 relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and don under different temperatures the key indicators correlated with metabolisms such as atp and dehydrogenases were used to represent microbial activity pearson s correlation analysis is used to evaluate the covariation across variables of microbial activity and don formation under low temperatures and the influential degrees of variables of microbial activity on don formation as expected reduced activity was observed with respect to the results of atp sour and dehydrogenases don formation was significantly positively correlated with ps r 0 61 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with atp r 0 64 p 0 05 fig 2 a but not with other indicators of microbial activity r 0 6 or p 0 05 fig 2a atp showed the most significant effect on don formation under cold conditions when compared to all of indicators followed by ps in terms of the value of correlation coefficients this result indicates that the processes associated with the changes of atp and ps may result in an increase in the formation of don the links between atp ps and don formation under low temperatures could be due to several factors first don formation may be involved in the release of nitrogenous organics after cell lysis a reduced atp concentration in low temperatures implies the increase of cell lysis with the release of nitrogenous organics previous studies have demonstrated that cellular debris after cell lysis are composed of nitrogenous organics such as proteins and amino acids hammes et al 2010 kujawinski 2011 this is consistent with our postulation additionally another possible explanation for the relationship is the equilibrium of cell in response to stressful conditions previous studies found that microorganisms can excrete soluble nitrogenous organics across cell membrane to establish the equilibrium barker and stuckey 1999 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 for the association of ps and don an alternative explanation is that ps as a component of eps and eps can be released from microbial aggregates contributing to effluent don don is a complex and heterogenous mixture of compounds including urea proteins nucleic acids and humic substances pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 moreover almost 70 of the don is unidentifiable pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the formation of don in an as system can be affected through the changes of any components of don such as amino acids and urea thus theoretically don is not necessarily linear correlated with pn while reduced values of dehydrogenases and sour were observed they did not significantly or strongly associate with don under low temperatures this may be due to the difference of bioprocesses contributing to don formation microbial variability across three temperatures was captured by sequences assigning at the phylum level and pca pc1 88 7 variance explained and pc2 8 0 variance explained fig s6 and s8 by pearson s correlation analysis the interconnections between don and microbial community structure were established in terms of classified bacterium from plfa analysis and bacterial phyla pc1 and pc2 from 16s rrna gene sequencing fig 2a the results showed that under low temperatures the formation of don was not significantly related to microbial community composition regardless of the taxonomy of communities r 0 6 or p 0 05 it is important to note the differences in the relationship between microbial activity microbial community structure and don the correlation coefficients imply that the influential priorities of microbial activity are greater than microbial community structure few studies have investigated the impact of microorganisms on don under stressful conditions in mwwtps but a research on don in the natural environment indicates that this discrepancy may attribute to the regulation of microbes kujawinski 2011 microbes excrete organic compounds as metabolites during microbial growth and cell lysis that in turn can be assimilated by cells microorganisms at low temperatures tend to in equilibrium with environmental conditions by excretion and assimilation the correlated coefficient may overlook the dynamic changes resulting in no significant correlation between the communities and don formation thus further analysis is needed to validate the relationship between microbes and don 3 4 relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and abdon under different temperatures pearson s correlation analysis revealed strong and significant associations between microbial activity microbial community structure and abdon under low temperatures fig 2b ps and effluent abdon were positively correlated under low temperature conditions r 0 74 p 0 05 fig 2b moreover this result is consistent with the relationship between ps and don fig 2a significant negative correlations were found between abdon and atp r 0 68 p 0 05 ttc dha r 0 71 p 0 05 and pc1 r 0 73 p 0 05 with the other indicators exhibiting less significant or less weak correlation with effluent abdon r 0 6 or p 0 05 these results suggest that the formation of abdon is not only related to microbial activity but also to microbial communities fig 2b furthermore only a subset of indicators significantly associated with abdon production and their influential priorities on abdon formation were ps pc1 microbial communities ttc dha atp ps and atp were more significantly and strongly correlated with abdon than don fig 2 the significant relationship between ps and don and abdon is supported by the fact that nitrogenous organics are released after the breakdown of the barriers formed from various ps furthermore ps can provide additional enzymatic capacity to digest macromolecular nitrogenous organics flemming 2016 sheng et al 2010 similarly the abdon formation can be contributed to the reduced microbial activity driven by low temperatures ttc dha closely associates with oxidative phosphorylation process and atp is identified as an energy rich metabolic compound and both ttc dha and atp reflected microbial activity hammes et al 2010 liu et al 2014 furthermore atp plays a central role in the nitrogen cycle in mwwtps the formation of nitrogenous organics in nitrogen catabolism is mostly mediated by atp which is the thermodynamic driving force of all cellular processes chubukov et al 2014 temperature is a limiting condition it will slow metabolic activity and accelerate the death of some bacteria resulting in increased concentrations of abdon in effluent due to cell lysis for the negative correlation between microbial communities and abdon rda was used to determine the significant environmental parameters shaping microbial communities and the dominated bacteria affecting the formation of abdon the relationship was captured by two rd modes rd1 54 3 variance explained and rd2 0 1 variance explained both significant at a p 0 05 level fig 3 symbol size of each circle symbols indicates the sum of relative abundance of microbes at phylum level in samples a separation of microbes was observed in rd1 axis in which microbes in the orange and blue shadow were positively correlated with rd1 and negatively correlated with rd1 respectively especially proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes not only positively associated with abdon but also dominated in all of samples implying these bacteria had a significant effect in promoting the formation of abdon conversely tm7 dominated in as system displaying a negative correlation with abdon the bioprocesses in different microorganisms could be various and a set of microbes can have particular preferred organics involving specific bioprocesses chubukov et al 2014 various molecular characteristics of abdon excreted by microorganisms may result in the different contributions of microbes at the phylum level to abdon formation despite the differences in the relationship between microbial communities and don and abdon the correlation of microbial activity and don and abdon are similar the correlation coefficients indicate that microbial activity is more closely correlated to abdon atp r 0 68 ps r 0 74 versus don atp r 0 64 ps r 0 61 an alternative hypothesis for the results is that major nitrogenous organics produced in microbial metabolism under non steady state conditions are composed of low molecular compounds such as proteins amino acids and other small molecules which are identified as components of abdon hu et al 2018a this postulation is also consistent with a study that showed smps produced in a bench scale sbr consisted of more molecular weight 1 kda 30 50 versus molecular weight 1 kda 25 45 contents jarusutthirak and amy 2007 taken together these results illustrate that the community undergoes a physiological and structural variation with low temperature conditions and the microbial activity differences may outplay phylogenetic groupings in don and abdon formation 3 5 short term test on the relationship between microbes and the formation of don and abdon driven by low temperatures the relationship between microbes and don and abdon was established by pearson s analysis in long term tests however a bias may exist in established relationship as the correlation relationship is based only on p value and r value to rule out the presence of overestimation by the relationship and further confirm the linkages between microbes and the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures the short term tests were performed at 25 c by taking mixed liquor from six parent reactors this experimental design resulted in the batch tests having the same microbial communities as those in long term tests according to the result of batch tests no significant difference was observed between effluent don of parent biomass at three temperatures room temperature 0 89 0 15 mg l 15 c 0 89 0 15 mg l and 8 c 0 91 0 16 mg l p 0 05 t test fig 4 similarly abdon concentrations and don bioavailability were comparable between the low and room temperature parent biomass in batch tests p 0 05 t test fig 4 furthermore the results of microbial activity tests in batch tests observed no significant differences of atp ps ttc dhc and sour in low and room temperatures parent reactor biomass p 0 05 anova fig 5 similar effluent quality and microbial activity were observed at room temperature batch conditions regardless of parent reactor biomass it identifies the significant impacts of microbial activity on the formation of don and abdon from low to room temperatures however the impacts of low temperatures on don and abdon via shifts of microbial community structure were not showed the results are consistent with the aforementioned relationship between don and microbial communities but they are in conflict with the evaluated relationship between abdon and microbial communities the discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that the influential priorities of the indicators are microbial activity microbial community structure despite the strong correlation between the communities and abdon as observed in long term tests the effect of microbial community structure on abdon was not found in short term tests it is a possible explanation that the effect of physiological alterations may outplay phylogenetic groupings on abdon formation 3 6 implications of the relationship between microbes and don and abdon under low temperatures the more stringent discharge standard for nitrogen removal requires the improvement of effluent quality with respect to don several studies have focused on the advanced treatment of don such as coagulation lee and westerhoff 2006 and powdered activated carbon adsorption chen et al 2011 the mwwtps tend to upgrading reconstruction but the switching from conventional treatment to advanced treatments would significantly increase investments costs and the risk of secondary pollution suitable and cost efficient approaches to reduce effluent don and abdon is therefore necessary previous studies have identified that some microorganism derived don are liable to reduce by operational parameters in mwwtps xu et al 2011 simsek et al 2016 it suggests that controlling operational parameter can decrease effluent don but there is a paucity of the fundamental information on the strategy to control don and abdon our study shows that don formation strongly associates with microbial activity atp and ps and abdon formation is strongly correlated to both microbial activity and microbial communities ps pc1 ttc dha atp fig 2 the influential priorities as the media of operational parameters and effluent don and abdon can be useful to control the formation of don and abdon at low temperatures for instance many alternatives e g hrt taimur khan et al 2013 and srt al halbouni et al 2008 can be applied to reducing don production which is strongly relative to ps in eps in addition our results highlight that there are distinct differences between the effect of microbes on don and abdon formation suggesting that the strategy of effluent nitrogen controlling needs to consider effluent don and abdon separately under low temperatures more feasible strategies on controlling effluent nitrogen can be designed with regard to the effluent with different don bioavailability for example when abdon plays in point source in the discharges of nitrogen the decrease of abdon can have more positive effects on meeting the requirement of the strict standards requirements we can decrease aeration in terms of the association of aeration and eps menniti and morgenroth 2010 and subsequently control the formation of abdon by the relationship between microbes and abdon due to the influential priorities of microbes on abdon for the effluents with low ratios of abdon reducing don is preferred over controlling abdon under low temperatures in the context of the most significant influential factors on don the operational parameters involving the increasing of atp can be considered to modulate the response of don to atp under low temperatures thus future research focusing on the strategy of reducing don and abdon could be important on this topic the results of this study will be benefit to optimize operation in mwwtps to minimize effluent don and abdon under cold conditions furthermore the detail of how to manipulate operation in mwwtps with the holistic approach are required with further study 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the formation of don and abdon under different temperatures and evaluated the relationship between microbial activity microbial communities and don and abdon at three temperatures 8 c 15 c and 25 c in the as system the following conclusions can be drawn from this study operation at low temperature 8 c and 15 c during long term tests can exacerbate the formation of don and abdon than that at room temperatures 25 c effluent don and abdon significantly increase under low temperature versus room temperature conditions p 0 05 t test statistical analysis indicates that microbial activity especially atp and ps is more strongly correlated to don formation under low temperatures the formation of abdon can significantly associate with both microbial activity and microbial community structure the influential priorities of variables on abdon formation are ps pc1 ttc dha atp distinct differences exist between the formation of don and abdon under low temperatures which may provide a basis for considering them separately in the strategy of improving water quality and safety under low temperatures notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the

18792,while harvested rainwater can serve as an alternative water supply microbial contaminants within the collection system can negatively affect water quality here we investigated the impact of roofing material on the microbial quality of rainwater freshly harvested from pilot scale roofs concrete tile cool green galvalume metal and asphalt fiberglass shingle the microbial quality of freshly harvested rainwater from six rain events over two years was analyzed by high throughput sequencing and culture dependent and independent techniques the concentrations of total coliform were significantly different among rainwaters harvested from the various roofing materials p value 0 05 however the fecal coliform concentrations and the copy numbers of enterococcus 23s rrna genes and total bacteria 16s rrna genes did not vary by type of roofing material in a statistically significant way potential human pathogens such as legionella escherichia coli o157 h7 shiga toxin producing escherichia coli and adenovirus were detected at least once in rainwater harvested from the different roofing materials even though the lowest occurrence of those potential human pathogens was noted from the metal roof also substantial variation in the microbial communities from the different roofing materials was observed at the family and genus levels these results demonstrate that the type of roofing material affects the microbial quality of freshly harvested rainwater indicating that the choice of roofing material could shape the microbial community structure entering a rainwater storage tank given that detection of potential pathogens in the freshly harvested rainwater also differed between roofing materials the type of roofing used to capture rainwater needs to be considered in rainwater harvesting system design particularly if the water is intended for potable use graphical abstract image 1 keywords rainwater harvesting microbial community microbial source tracking waterborne pathogen pcr high throughput sequencing 1 introduction rainwater harvesting rwh has received significant attention as a supplement to traditional freshwater supplies for potable and non potable uses kim et al 2016 lye 2009 rozos and makropoulos 2012 the suitability of harvested rainwater for a particular application depends on its physical chemical and microbiological qualities which can be impacted by the type of roofing material used in the catchment lee et al 2012 mendez et al 2011 van der sterren et al 2013 a recent survey of rainwater harvesters in the u s showed that the most common roofing materials in rwh applications are composite asphalt shingle and metal thomas et al 2014 some studies have shown that rainwater harvested from metal roofs contains lower concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib as compared to rainwater harvested from other roofing materials lee et al 2012 mendez et al 2011 while this and other basic differences in the microbiological quality of rainwater harvested from various roofing materials have been noted mendez et al 2011 the literature does not contain a detailed study of the impact of roofing material on the microbial community of harvested rainwater catchment surfaces can be directly exposed to sources of fecal contamination such as birds and small mammals therefore the concentrations of fib often have been used to assess the microbiological quality of harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2012 despins et al 2009 kim and han 2011 lee et al 2012 it also has been shown that harvested rainwater contains potential human pathogens such as campylobacter spp campylobacter jejuni legionella pneumophila and salmonella spp ahmed et al 2008 2011a 2012 however the concentration of fib and the occurrence of potential human pathogens generally do not correlate in harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2008 kim et al 2016 thus the utility of traditional fib as indicators of microbial water quality in rwh systems has been questioned just as fib use has been questioned for the evaluation of recreational water quality savichtcheva and okabe 2006 bacteroides has been suggested as an alternative indicator of fecal contamination from warm blooded animals for harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2008 recently microbial source tracking mst has been applied to rainwater harvesting systems and showed that the human specific bacteroides hf183 marker commonly occurs in gutter debris waso et al 2016 and in tank water waso et al 2016 2018 these same studies also demonstrated the presence of adenovirus waso et al 2016 2018 in gutter debris and tank water a few studies have employed traditional tools such as culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge to examine the bacterial community of harvested rainwater and have found phylogenetically diverse microbial communities in rainwater storage tanks evans et al 2007 2009 kim and han 2011 broad sequencing of the bacterial community in rainwater has been performed in only a few studies ahmed et al 2017 chidamba and korsten 2015 the microbial diversity and richness observed in rainwater tanks were not significantly different between urban areas and peri urban areas ahmed et al 2017 but high throughput sequencing revealed the presence of diverse potential pathogenic genera in rainwater tanks ahmed et al 2017 chidamba and korsten 2015 to our knowledge the effect of the type of roofing material on microbiological water quality and community composition in freshly harvested rainwater has not been thoroughly examined in the current study rainwaters were freshly harvested from five different types of roofing material and were interrogated for microbiological water quality and community composition the objectives of this study were as follows i to investigate the occurrence of selected bacteria amoebae and viruses some of which are potential human pathogens from rainwater freshly harvested from different roofing materials ii to describe bacterial community structure using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and iii to examine potential sources of fecal contamination in harvested rainwater using host associated genetic markers while the current study is focused on the quality of freshly harvested rainwater it should be noted that many rainwater harvesters utilize first flush diversion storage filtration and or disinfection to render the rainwater suitable for a particular use including potable use thomas et al 2014 2 materials and methods study site and pilot scale roofs rainwater was harvested from five pilot scale roofs concrete tile concrete an acrylic surfaced 2 ply atactic polypropylene modified bituminous membrane cool unfertilized green green galvalume coated steel metal and asphalt fiberglass

a passive sampling device was installed at each pilot scale roof as described previously mendez et al 2011 briefly a pvc insert was placed in the gutter of each roof which directed the first flush rainwater to a sterile 2 l glass bottle and subsequent rainwater to a sterile 10 l polypropylene container a sterile polyethylene funnel 46 cm inner diameter was used to collect ambient rainwater i e rainwater that had no roofing contact in a sterile 10 l polypropylene tank rainwater samples were collected during six rain events culture based enumeration of fib total and fecal coliform in ambient

nonparametric spearman rank correlation was used to examine the correlation between the concentrations of culturable fib and specific genetic marker concentrations e g enterococcus bacteroidales

coli legionella free living amoebae and adenovirus and the concentration of fib culturable or measured with genetic markers the kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance was used to compare concentrations of culturable fib and genetic markers for fib among rainwaters harvested from different roofing materials for samples with non detects of culturable fib the limit of detection 1 colony

ambient no direct contact with the roof rainwater were assessed using culture based methods of the 36 samples 30 harvested rainwater and 6 ambient rainwater samples collected over six rain events 92 were positive for total coliform and 89 were positive for fecal coliform respectively the concentrations of total coliform and fecal coliform varied by orders of magnitude in the ambient rainwater and harvested rainwater across the six events we performed kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance to evaluate the concentration of total and fecal coliform in harvested rainwater samples from different roofing materials the total coliform concentrations in rainwater were significantly different among the roofing materials p value 0 05 the median concentration of total coliform was highest in rainwater collected from the shingle roof 3 6 x 103 colony forming units cfu 100 ml and lowest in rainwater collected from the green roof 3 3 x102 cfu 100 ml followed by the metal roof 1 1 x 103 cfu 100 ml although the kruskal wallis analysis showed that the fecal coliform concentrations in the harvested rainwater were not significantly different among the roofing materials p value 0 05 the fecal coliform in the rainwater harvested from the green roof had the lowest median concentration the concentrations of genetic markers for fib including enterococcus host associated bacteroidales universal bacteroidales bacuni ucd the bacteroides spp allbac and for total bacteria 16s rrna gene were determined by qpcr in harvested rainwater enterococcus was detected in 61 of the rainwater samples fig 2 the qpcr assays for universal bacteroidales bacuni ucd which targets all bacteroidales regardless of the fecal source and cow dog and human associated bacteroidales were non detects in all harvested rainwater samples data not shown but the other qpcr assay for the bacteroides spp allbac showed detections in 63 of the harvested rainwater samples fig 2 the kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance test showed no significant difference among the rainwaters harvested from the various roofing materials with respect to their concentrations of genetic markers for enterococcus and bacteroides in fig 2 the average total bacteria 16s rrna gene concentrations were 5 26 109 gene copy number 100 ml in harvested rainwater indicating the high abundance of bacteria in harvested rainwater nonparametric spearman rank correlations were conducted to examine the correlation between the concentrations of culturable fib and genetic markers for enterococcus and bacteroides total coliform concentrations were positively correlated with the concentrations of both bacteroides and enterococcus in harvested rainwater spearman s rank correlation coefficient r 0 64 p value 0 05 see table 1 3 2 genetic markers for potential pathogens free living amoebae and viruses in rainwater harvested from different roofing materials genetic markers for selected potential pathogens free living amoebae and viruses were assayed by qpcr positive results from qpcr were confirmed by end point pcr and sequencing to verify the target gene identity e coli o157 e coli stx1 and adenovirus were detected only once in the harvested rainwater samples while e coli stx2 and legionella occurred more frequently in the harvested rainwater samples table 2 e coli stx2 was detected in rainwater harvested from the metal and shingle roofs and legionella was detected in rainwater harvested from the green concrete and cool roofs as compared to potential pathogens and viruses free living amoebae occurred more frequently in the harvested rainwater samples the collective occurrence of potential bacterial pathogens free living amoebae and viruses in harvested rainwater follow in order from highest to lowest concrete green cool shingle and metal roofs followed by ambient rainwater table 2 binary logistic regressions were utilized to examine the correlation between the concentration of fib by culture or molecular based methods and the presence of selected organisms in harvested rainwater none of the fib were significantly correlated with all of the selected organisms however a few individual correlations were noted table 2 shows evidence of a correlation between the presence of e coli stx2 and the concentration of total coliform p value 0 039 and fecal coliform p value 0 024 the concentration of bacteroides shows correlation with the presence of legionella p value 0 03 3 3 microbial community in rainwater harvested from different roofing materials we investigated the microbial community in ambient rainwater and rainwater harvested from different roofing materials quality filtering recovered an average number of 5139 reads per sample with an average read length of 420 bp thirteen phyla were recovered from the rainwater samples with proteobacteria being the dominant phylum for rainwater harvested from all roofing materials accounting for 61 97 of the otus detected in fig 3 a the second most common phylum was bacteroidetes in the ambient rainwater and rainwater harvested from the green and shingle roofs the microbial communities also were examined at the family and genus levels and substantial variation among the microbial communities was observed fig s1 the microbial communities of rainwater harvested from the cool and green roofs were dominated by betaproteobacteria with a majority belonging to oxalobacteraceae and comamonadaceae at the family level fig s1 methylobacteriaceae of the alphaproteobacteria dominated the microbial community in rainwater harvested from the shingle roof and enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae dominated the microbial community in rainwater harvested from the metal roof at the genus level methylobacterium and pseudomonas were most frequently detected in rainwater harvested from the cool and shingle roofs whereas janthinobacterium and spirosoma both genera of gram negative soil bacteria were the dominant genera in rainwater harvested from the green roof also the nitrite oxidizing genus nitrospira 1 25 relative abundance was detected in rainwater harvested from the metal roof which contained a higher nitrite concentration in its harvested rainwater as compared to rainwater harvested from other roofing materials in our previous study mendez et al 2011 the genera present only in harvested rainwater i e not found in ambient rainwater include williamsia nocardia granulicatella and methylosinus for the concrete roof pantoea for the green and shingle roofs and gallionella for the metal roof the otus and diversity indices for the microbial communities in ambient and harvested rainwater are shown in fig 3b the highest number of unique otus was observed in ambient rainwater and the lowest number was found in the rainwater harvested from shingle roof fig 3b the shannon diversity index indicates the highest diversity in the ambient rainwater sample followed by in descending order rainwater harvested from the green concrete metal shingle and cool roofs chao1 and abundance based coverage estimators ace also indicate that the ambient rainwater sample showed the highest diversity followed by the rainwater harvested from the green roof the inverse of simpson s original index invsimpson showed that the ambient rainwater the concrete and green roofs had diverse microbial communities the shared otus between the ambient rainwater and the rainwater harvested from the different roofing materials was calculated suggesting that a major fraction of the microbial community in harvested rainwater originates outside of the ambient rainwater itself table s2 4 discussion microbial water quality and microbial communities in rainwater harvested from five different roofing materials were examined by culture based and molecular methods for six rain events over two years most previous studies have investigated microbial water quality in rainwater storage tanks where the sampled water has an unknown residence time however only a few studies have examined the microbial quality of ambient rainwater and rainwater freshly harvested from roofs dobrowsky et al 2017 gikas and tsihrintzis 2017 mendez et al 2011 in this study we examined the concentration of fib and the occurrence of free living amoebae and potential human pathogens viruses and bacteria in ambient rainwater and rainwater freshly harvested from co located pilot roofs constructed with five different roofing materials the occurrence of potential pathogens was different among rainwaters harvested from different roofing materials suggesting that the type of roofing material exerts a selective pressure on the microbial community additionally the abundance of certain microorganisms in the harvested rainwaters was higher than that in ambient rainwater i e no direct contact with the roof for instance the concentration of bacteroides and enterococcus were lower and often non detected in ambient water shiga toxin genes stx1 and stx2 were detected in 19 of the harvested rainwater samples e coli producing a shiga like toxin especially serotype o157 is an important emerging human pathogen in water heijnen and medema 2006 interestingly we detected adenovirus dna once and only in rainwater harvested from the concrete roof adenoviruses are important human pathogens that are responsible for enteric illnesses as well as for respiratory and eye infections jiang 2006 it has been reported that human adenovirus has been detected up to 52 of harvested rainwater tanks waso et al 2016 2018 in contrast to previous studies which frequently detected adenovirus in rainwater storage tanks waso et al 2016 2018 adenovirus was detected rarely in our freshly harvested rainwater samples suggesting that sediments in rainwater tanks may harbor adenovirus as virus adsorption to sediment has been shown to greatly increase survival time the presence of non enteric potential human pathogens such as legionella spp in rainwater harvesting systems has been reported in the united states australia and new zealand ahmed et al 2010a 2010b kim et al 2016 lye 2002 simmons et al 2008 in our study seven out of thirty six rainwater samples were positive for legionella free living amoebae act as environmental reservoirs for legionella aiding in the propagation and distribution of legionella in our study legionella always co occurred with free living amoebae suggesting that amoebae could be acting as legionella reservoirs in these systems greub and raoult 2004 since most amoebae are known to be disinfection resistant loret et al 2008 multiple treatment barriers e g filtration and disinfection are strongly recommended for treatment of harvested rainwater for potable use thus properly designed storage tanks and treatment systems are necessary for harvested rainwater to be used for potable purposes kim et al 2016 lye 2009 our study aimed to identify potential human pathogens and to examine microbial community structure in rainwaters freshly harvested from different roofing materials understanding the impact of roofing material on microbial community structure and the presence of potential human pathogens in harvested rainwater will provide insight into the design of rainwater harvesting catchments as well as to guide disinfection strategies the number of otus observed sobs the chao estimator and the shannon index for the microbial communities in ambient and harvested rainwater demonstrated that the type of roofing material affected microbial diversity fig 3b the microbial community of the ambient rainwater is highly diverse and substantially different in composition as compared to the microbial communities of the harvested rainwaters the major bacterial phyla detected in the harvested rainwater in the current study were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes this microbial distribution is similar to that reported in previous studies of rainwater harvesting systems using cultivated isolates dgge and high throughput sequencing ahmed et al 2017 evans et al 2009 kim and han 2011 an increase in the relative abundance of the proteobacteria phylum in harvested rainwater as compared to ambient rainwater implies that the roofing materials could offer favorable niches for proteobacteria the most abundant and frequently detected taxa included burkholderiales sphingobacteriales and pseudomonadales which are similar to the taxa reported previously from cultivated isolates in rainwater storage tanks evans et al 2009 although relative abundances at the phylum level were similar to those found in a previous study where high throughput amplicon sequencing was applied ahmed et al 2017 our study showed differences at the family level as compared to ahmed et al 2017 we found methylobacteriaceae oxalobacteraceae pseudomonadaceae and comamonadaceae to be the most abundant families in freshly harvested rainwater while comamonadaceae and planctomycetaceae were the most abundant families in aged rainwater tank samples ahmed et al 2017 several problems associated with using fib to indicate human health risk are known including the weak correlation between fib and the presence of particular pathogens and the lack of indication of the source of the fecal contamination savichtcheva and okabe 2006 alternatively the application of pcr based methods has been used to identify fecal pollution and specific pathogens in surface water and rainwater ahmed et al 2008 2011b 2012 kaushik and balasubramanian 2012 layton et al 2006 our data show a correlation between total or fecal coliform concentrations and the presence of e coli stx2 p value 0 05 table 2 which makes sense because e coli is a subset of the total and fecal coliform more broadly and consistent with previous reports ahmed et al 2008 lye 2002 our results demonstrate that culture based and q pcr methods for fib provide an inadequate assessment of the overall microbial quality of rainwater due to the poor correlation between those fib and a suite of potential human pathogens e coli o157 e coli stx1 and adenovirus therefore a suitable bacterial indicator assay still needs to be developed for harvested rainwater culturable fib and mst markers have been applied to investigate presence or quantity of pathogens and their fecal sources in harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2011b 2014 2017 waso et al 2016 2018 for instance some studies have shown the presence of the human associated bacteroides hf183 marker and possum fecal dna in rainwater tanks ahmed et al 2016 dobrowsky et al 2017 waso et al 2016 2018 in our study only two of six ambient rainwater samples i e rainwater that had no contact with roofing materials were positive for the allbac marker targeting bacteroides while rainwaters harvested from all five roofing materials were positive for this marker suggesting that this contamination originates from direct fecal deposition to the roof or dry atmospheric deposition rather than from wet atmospheric deposition rainfall the fraction of the genus bacteroides present in the overall bacterial community of harvested rainwater was low 0 0001 with an average of 104 gc 100 ml for the genus bacteroides and an average of 1010 gc 100 ml for bacteria in our study fig 2 similarly our 16s rrna gene sequencing results demonstrated that the order of bacteroidales was rare in all harvested rainwater samples data not shown thus our data suggest that the use of the bacuni bacteroidales and allbac markers might be insufficient to discern fecal contamination in harvested rainwater samples due to their low abundance relative to other bacteria present in the harvested rainwater and poor correlations with potential human pathogens table 2 5 conclusion the microbial communities in harvested rainwater were different from that of ambient rainwater and varied as a function of the type of roofing material suggesting that choice of roofing material could shape the microbial community structure entering a rainwater storage tank given that rainwater harvested from the metal roof showed the lowest occurrence of potential bacterial and viral pathogens among the tested roofing materials metal roofing materials could be recommended as one way to positively affect the microbial community structure of freshly harvested rainwater the concentration of culturable fecal indicator in freshly harvested rainwater was not clearly correlated with the presence of potential pathogens such as legionella spp pathogenic e coli and adenovirus suggesting that development of a more suitable bacterial indicator is needed to monitor microbial water quality in rainwater harvesting systems the selection of an appropriate roofing material for rainwater catchment is an important first step in the design of a roof harvested rainwater system given the microbial diversity present in freshly harvested rainwater a multi barrier treatment strategy and maintenance practices appropriate for the intended use of the harvested rainwater are needed to ensure the long term success of harvested rainwater systems

18792,while harvested rainwater can serve as an alternative water supply microbial contaminants within the collection system can negatively affect water quality here we investigated the impact of roofing material on the microbial quality of rainwater freshly harvested from pilot scale roofs concrete tile cool green galvalume metal and asphalt fiberglass shingle the microbial quality of freshly harvested rainwater from six rain events over two years was analyzed by high throughput sequencing and culture dependent and independent techniques the concentrations of total coliform were significantly different among rainwaters harvested from the various roofing materials p value 0 05 however the fecal coliform concentrations and the copy numbers of enterococcus 23s rrna genes and total bacteria 16s rrna genes did not vary by type of roofing material in a statistically significant way potential human pathogens such as legionella escherichia coli o157 h7 shiga toxin producing escherichia coli and adenovirus were detected at least once in rainwater harvested from the different roofing materials even though the lowest occurrence of those potential human pathogens was noted from the metal roof also substantial variation in the microbial communities from the different roofing materials was observed at the family and genus levels these results demonstrate that the type of roofing material affects the microbial quality of freshly harvested rainwater indicating that the choice of roofing material could shape the microbial community structure entering a rainwater storage tank given that detection of potential pathogens in the freshly harvested rainwater also differed between roofing materials the type of roofing used to capture rainwater needs to be considered in rainwater harvesting system design particularly if the water is intended for potable use graphical abstract image 1 keywords rainwater harvesting microbial community microbial source tracking waterborne pathogen pcr high throughput sequencing 1 introduction rainwater harvesting rwh has received significant attention as a supplement to traditional freshwater supplies for potable and non potable uses kim et al 2016 lye 2009 rozos and makropoulos 2012 the suitability of harvested rainwater for a particular application depends on its physical chemical and microbiological qualities which can be impacted by the type of roofing material used in the catchment lee et al 2012 mendez et al 2011 van der sterren et al 2013 a recent survey of rainwater harvesters in the u s showed that the most common roofing materials in rwh applications are composite asphalt shingle and metal thomas et al 2014 some studies have shown that rainwater harvested from metal roofs contains lower concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib as compared to rainwater harvested from other roofing materials lee et al 2012 mendez et al 2011 while this and other basic differences in the microbiological quality of rainwater harvested from various roofing materials have been noted mendez et al 2011 the literature does not contain a detailed study of the impact of roofing material on the microbial community of harvested rainwater catchment surfaces can be directly exposed to sources of fecal contamination such as birds and small mammals therefore the concentrations of fib often have been used to assess the microbiological quality of harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2012 despins et al 2009 kim and han 2011 lee et al 2012 it also has been shown that harvested rainwater contains potential human pathogens such as campylobacter spp campylobacter jejuni legionella pneumophila and salmonella spp ahmed et al 2008 2011a 2012 however the concentration of fib and the occurrence of potential human pathogens generally do not correlate in harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2008 kim et al 2016 thus the utility of traditional fib as indicators of microbial water quality in rwh systems has been questioned just as fib use has been questioned for the evaluation of recreational water quality savichtcheva and okabe 2006 bacteroides has been suggested as an alternative indicator of fecal contamination from warm blooded animals for harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2008 recently microbial source tracking mst has been applied to rainwater harvesting systems and showed that the human specific bacteroides hf183 marker commonly occurs in gutter debris waso et al 2016 and in tank water waso et al 2016 2018 these same studies also demonstrated the presence of adenovirus waso et al 2016 2018 in gutter debris and tank water a few studies have employed traditional tools such as culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge to examine the bacterial community of harvested rainwater and have found phylogenetically diverse microbial communities in rainwater storage tanks evans et al 2007 2009 kim and han 2011 broad sequencing of the bacterial community in rainwater has been performed in only a few studies ahmed et al 2017 chidamba and korsten 2015 the microbial diversity and richness observed in rainwater tanks were not significantly different between urban areas and peri urban areas ahmed et al 2017 but high throughput sequencing revealed the presence of diverse potential pathogenic genera in rainwater tanks ahmed et al 2017 chidamba and korsten 2015 to our knowledge the effect of the type of roofing material on microbiological water quality and community composition in freshly harvested rainwater has not been thoroughly examined in the current study rainwaters were freshly harvested from five different types of roofing material and were interrogated for microbiological water quality and community composition the objectives of this study were as follows i to investigate the occurrence of selected bacteria amoebae and viruses some of which are potential human pathogens from rainwater freshly harvested from different roofing materials ii to describe bacterial community structure using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and iii to examine potential sources of fecal contamination in harvested rainwater using host associated genetic markers while the current study is focused on the quality of freshly harvested rainwater it should be noted that many rainwater harvesters utilize first flush diversion storage filtration and or disinfection to render the rainwater suitable for a particular use including potable use thomas et al 2014 2 materials and methods study site and pilot scale roofs rainwater was harvested from five pilot scale roofs concrete tile concrete an acrylic surfaced 2 ply atactic polypropylene modified bituminous membrane cool unfertilized green green galvalume coated steel metal and asphalt fiberglass shingle shingle at the lady bird johnson wildflower center in austin texas detailed descriptions of these pilot scale roofs have been published previously mendez et al 2011 rainwater sample collection a passive sampling device was installed at each pilot scale roof as described previously mendez et al 2011 briefly a pvc insert was placed in the gutter of each roof which directed the first flush rainwater to a sterile 2 l glass bottle and subsequent rainwater to a sterile 10 l polypropylene container a sterile polyethylene funnel 46 cm inner diameter was used to collect ambient rainwater i e rainwater that had no roofing contact in a sterile 10 l polypropylene tank rainwater samples were collected during six rain events culture based enumeration of fib total and fecal coliform in ambient

performed using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier with clustering at 97 sequence identity the alignment was performed with the pynast algorithm against the greengenes reference dataset after rarefying the number of reads to that of the lowest sample alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using the default recommendations for qiime parameters statistical analysis the nonparametric spearman rank correlation was used to examine the correlation between the concentrations of culturable fib and specific genetic marker concentrations e g enterococcus bacteroidales

coli legionella free living amoebae and adenovirus and the concentration of fib culturable or measured with genetic markers the kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance was used to compare concentrations of culturable fib and genetic markers for fib among rainwaters harvested from different roofing materials for samples with non detects of culturable fib the limit of detection 1 colony

ambient no direct contact with the roof rainwater were assessed using culture based methods of the 36 samples 30 harvested rainwater and 6 ambient rainwater samples collected over six rain events 92 were positive for total coliform and 89 were positive for fecal coliform respectively the concentrations of total coliform and fecal coliform varied by orders of magnitude in the ambient rainwater and harvested rainwater across the six events we performed kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance to evaluate the concentration of total and fecal coliform in harvested rainwater samples from different roofing materials the total coliform concentrations in rainwater were significantly different among the roofing materials p value 0 05 the median concentration of total coliform was highest in rainwater collected from the shingle roof 3 6 x 103 colony forming units cfu 100 ml and lowest in rainwater collected from the green roof 3 3 x102 cfu 100 ml followed by the metal roof 1 1 x 103 cfu 100 ml although the kruskal wallis analysis showed that the fecal coliform concentrations in the harvested rainwater were not significantly different among the roofing materials p value 0 05 the fecal coliform in the rainwater harvested from the green roof had the lowest median concentration the concentrations of genetic markers for fib including enterococcus host associated bacteroidales universal bacteroidales bacuni ucd the bacteroides spp allbac and for total bacteria 16s rrna gene were determined by qpcr in harvested rainwater enterococcus was detected in 61 of the rainwater samples fig 2 the qpcr assays for universal bacteroidales bacuni ucd which targets all bacteroidales regardless of the fecal source and cow dog and human associated bacteroidales were non detects in all harvested rainwater samples data not shown but the other qpcr assay for the bacteroides spp allbac showed detections in 63 of the harvested rainwater samples fig 2 the kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance test showed no significant difference among the rainwaters harvested from the various roofing materials with respect to their concentrations of genetic markers for enterococcus and bacteroides in fig 2 the average total bacteria 16s rrna gene concentrations were 5 26 109 gene copy number 100 ml in harvested rainwater indicating the high abundance of bacteria in harvested rainwater nonparametric spearman rank correlations were conducted to examine the correlation between the concentrations of culturable fib and genetic markers for enterococcus and bacteroides total

table 1 3 2 genetic markers for potential pathogens free living amoebae and viruses in rainwater harvested from different roofing materials genetic markers for selected potential pathogens free living amoebae and viruses were assayed by qpcr positive results from qpcr were confirmed by end point pcr and sequencing to verify the target gene identity e coli o157 e coli stx1 and adenovirus were detected only once in the harvested rainwater samples while e coli stx2 and legionella occurred more frequently in the harvested rainwater samples table 2 e coli stx2 was detected in rainwater harvested from the metal and shingle roofs and legionella was detected in rainwater harvested from the green concrete and cool roofs as compared to potential pathogens and viruses free living amoebae occurred more frequently in the harvested rainwater samples the collective occurrence of potential bacterial pathogens free living amoebae and viruses in harvested rainwater follow in order from highest to lowest concrete green cool shingle and metal roofs followed by ambient rainwater table 2 binary logistic regressions were utilized to examine the correlation between the concentration of fib by culture or molecular based methods and the presence of selected organisms in harvested rainwater none of the fib were significantly correlated with all of the selected organisms however a few individual correlations were noted table 2 shows evidence of a correlation between the presence of e coli stx2 and the concentration of total coliform p value 0 039 and fecal coliform p value 0 024 the concentration of bacteroides shows correlation with the presence of legionella p value 0 03 3 3 microbial community in rainwater harvested from different roofing materials we investigated the microbial community in ambient rainwater and rainwater harvested from different roofing materials quality filtering recovered an average number of 5139 reads per sample with an average read length of 420 bp thirteen phyla were recovered from the rainwater samples with proteobacteria being the dominant phylum for rainwater harvested from all roofing materials accounting for 61 97 of the otus detected in fig 3 a the second most common phylum was bacteroidetes in the ambient rainwater and rainwater harvested from the green and shingle roofs the microbial communities also were examined at the family and genus levels and substantial variation among the microbial communities was observed fig s1 the microbial communities of rainwater harvested from the cool and green roofs were dominated by betaproteobacteria with a majority belonging to oxalobacteraceae and comamonadaceae at the family level fig s1 methylobacteriaceae of the alphaproteobacteria dominated the microbial community in

rainwater harvested from the green concrete metal shingle and cool roofs chao1 and abundance based coverage estimators ace also indicate that the ambient rainwater sample showed the highest diversity followed by the rainwater harvested from the green roof the inverse of simpson s original index invsimpson showed that the ambient rainwater the concrete and green roofs had diverse microbial communities the shared otus between the ambient rainwater and the rainwater harvested from the different roofing materials was calculated suggesting that a major fraction of the microbial community in harvested rainwater originates outside of the ambient rainwater itself table s2 4 discussion microbial water quality and microbial communities in rainwater harvested from five different roofing

harvested rainwater ahmed et al 2011b 2014 2017 waso et al 2016 2018 for instance some studies have shown the presence of the human associated bacteroides hf183 marker and possum fecal dna in rainwater tanks ahmed et al 2016 dobrowsky et al 2017 waso et al 2016 2018 in our study only two of six ambient rainwater samples i e rainwater that had no contact with roofing materials were positive for the allbac marker targeting bacteroides while rainwaters harvested from all five roofing materials were positive for this marker suggesting that this contamination originates from direct fecal deposition to the roof or dry atmospheric deposition rather than from wet atmospheric deposition rainfall the fraction of the genus bacteroides present in the overall bacterial community of harvested rainwater was low 0 0001 with an average of 104 gc 100 ml for the genus bacteroides and an average of 1010 gc 100 ml for bacteria in our study fig 2 similarly our 16s rrna gene sequencing results demonstrated that the order of bacteroidales was rare in all harvested rainwater samples data not shown thus our data suggest that the use of the bacuni bacteroidales and allbac markers might be insufficient to discern fecal contamination in harvested rainwater samples due to their low abundance relative to other bacteria present in the harvested rainwater and poor correlations with potential human pathogens table 2 5 conclusion the microbial communities in harvested rainwater were different from that of ambient rainwater and varied as a function of the type of roofing material suggesting that choice of roofing material could shape the microbial community structure entering a rainwater storage tank given that rainwater harvested from the metal roof showed the lowest occurrence of potential bacterial and viral pathogens among the tested roofing materials metal roofing materials could be recommended as one way to positively affect the microbial community structure of freshly harvested rainwater the concentration of culturable fecal indicator in freshly harvested rainwater was not clearly correlated with the presence of potential pathogens such as legionella spp pathogenic e coli and adenovirus suggesting that development of a more suitable bacterial indicator is needed to monitor microbial water quality in rainwater harvesting systems the selection of an appropriate roofing material for rainwater catchment is an important first step in the design of a roof harvested rainwater system given the microbial diversity present in freshly harvested rainwater a multi barrier treatment strategy and maintenance practices appropriate for the intended use of the harvested rainwater are needed to ensure the long term success of harvested rainwater systems

18793,we investigated how the degradation of 7 14c bap aged in sediments by h2o2 treatment was influenced by the chemical structures compositions and microporosity of sedimentary organic carbon soc unstable oc usoc stable oc stoc mineral protected oc moc and chemically resistant oc roc fractions were fractionated the chemical structures and microporosity of the roc fractions were characterized by 13c solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and co2 adsorption technique respectively a first order two compartment kinetics model described the degradation process very well r 2 0 980 the bap degradation ratios increased with the increasing usoc contents and decreased with the increasing roc contents the bap parent compound in the aqueous solution was almost completely degraded the considerable portions of oxidized intermediates were detected in different soc fractions which represented either oxidized intermediates or parent compounds the very good multivariate regressions among the degradation kinetics parameters soc structures and micropore volumes demonstrated that roc bulk aliphatic moieties and microporosity played crucial roles in protecting sorbed bap from being degraded by h2o2 the results showed that roc aliphatic moieties and microporosity played vital roles in bap degradation process in sediments during h2o2 treatment which is reported for the first time in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords 7 14c benzo a pyrene degradation hydrogen peroxide aliphatic carbon microporosity 1 introduction benzo a pyrene bap a representative high molecular weight hmw polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs is of highly environmental concern in contaminated sediments due to its notorious carcinogenicity bioaccumulation potential and persistence rentz et al 2008 bioremediation has been widely accepted as a viable treatment technique for the treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated sediments wilson and jones 1993 but bioremediation of hmw pahs such as bap has demonstrated only partial success due to their high recalcitrance juhasz and naidu 2000 hydrogen peroxide when catalyzed by soluble ferrous ions or naturally occurring sediment minerals generates strong relatively nonspecific oxidant hydroxyl radicals which can then react with most organic compounds huang et al 1993 mikutta et al 2006 it also can be applied to the remediation of contaminated solid matrices such as soils or sediments jonsson et al 2007 neyens and baeyens 2003 watts et al 1999 2002 in addition fenton oxidation is a process that can be used in conjunction with bioremediation techniques to either pretreat pahs into more biodegradable compounds or as a post treatment of pahs residues martens and jr 1995 nam et al 2001 the chemical structures and microporosity of sedimentary organic carbon soc in sediments strongly influence the sorption desorption and chemical degradation of hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs pignatello and xing 1996 ran et al 2007a xing and pignatello 1997 the sorption of hocs in amorphous rubbery domains is linear and fast xing 2001 whereas that in condensed glassy domains is nonlinear slow and strong pignatello 1998 song et al 2002 xing et al 1996 it is still debatable on the relative importance of aromatic and aliphatic carbon structures of soc on the sorption desorption and chemical degradation of hocs chefetz and xing 2009 moreover the role of micropores on the sorption and desorption of hocs by different soc has recently been demonstrated suggesting that micropore filling significantly dominates sorption and desorption of hocs in sediments han et al 2014 huang et al 2017 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 but the relationships among the microporosity soc structure and bap oxidation kinetics have rarely been reported sedlak and andren 1994 reported that sorption of pcbs to particles resulted in decreased hoc removal rates under h2o2 treatment the magnitude of this effect would likely depend upon the relationship between the rates of adsorption desorption and oh reactions westerhoff et al 1999 firstly reported that the aliphatic structure of dissolved organic matter dom reacted with oh more slowly than the aromatic moiety such as protonated and alkyl substituted aromatic carbon did oh preferentially attacked aromatic structures but it attacked aliphatic structures such as alkyl c moieties less efficiently the 14c isotope tracing technique has been well used to investigate the effect of soc heterogeneity on the chemical degradation of pollutants sun et al 2014 as well 14c labeled 7 carbon bap bay region labeled structure has been used to investigate the reduction of bap carcinogenicity boonchan et al 2000 dingyi ye et al 2006 rentz et al 2008 moreover solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy has been used to provide a basis for inferring the molecular structure in oc fractions mao et al 2002 however it is noted that nmr spectroscopy remains underutilized in studies of marine sediments hedges et al 2001 2002 and is not yet used to investigate the resistant oc in different sediments in this study we employed nmr techniques 14c isotope tracing technique and an updated co2 gas adsorption technique to examine the relationship of oxidation and other alterations in soc structure and the degradation of 14c bap by h2o2 treatment in sediments which generated valuable information that could be used to guide future remediation efforts in contaminated sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and sediment collection 7 14c benzo a pyrene 26 6 mci mmol 95 radiochemical activity and 97 chemical purity and non labeled bap analytical grade purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa all the chemical reagents used in this study were chromatographic or analytical grades 2 2 sediment collection the sediments were collected from xinfengjiang reservoir the pearl river estuary to the continental shelves in the northern south china sea by using a box sampler one sediment sample x1 was collected from the xinfengjiang reservoir in january 2012 two a1 a4 from the pearl river estuary in january 2012 and four e2 e3 e4 and e5 from the northern south china sea in may 2012 the sampling details were described in the supplemental data and fig s1 all the samples were frozen upon reception in the laboratory for the storage before their use the samples were freeze dried ground sieved through an 80 mesh 0 178 mm sieve there were no detachable bap residues in sediments 2 3 sediment spiking with bap and aging sediment spiking with bap and aging were based on the method by huang et al 2017 the spiked bap concentration in the sediment was 500 ng g including 50 ng g of 14c bap and 450 ng g of non radioactive labeled bap the aging treatments were detailed in the supplemental data the relative standard deviation of radioactivity for sediment replicates ranged from 1 40 to 3 65 indicating that bap was homogeneously distributed in the spiked samples 2 4 degradation experiments the degradation experiment was performed in a 25 ml glass incubation vial which was sealed with a rubber stopper the flow chart of degradation experiment is shown in fig s2 the reaction system contained 0 5 g dw of a given spiked sediment 5 ml of 1 m h2o2 no iron amendment and a mercury chloride solution 50 g l which was added to inhibit microbial activities the bottles were incubated in a shaker under the condition of 120 rpm 25 c and in the dark at the time intervals of 1 2 6 12 24 48 96 192 288 384 and 408 h the radioactivity of each fraction degradation to 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues fractions of the reaction system was measured the radioactivity of 14co2 at 408 h was defined as the maximum degradation of bap the 14co2 contents released in the reaction system were trapped by 1 0 ml of naoh in a 2 5 ml glass vial which was suspended below the bottle stopper liu et al 2013 shan et al 2011 the radioactivity in the naoh trap was determined by liquid scintillation counter lsc perking elmer usa see the supplemental data the water layer was decanted from the sediment after centrifugation 2000 g 10min and determined for radioactivity by lsc see the supplemental data the remaining sediment was extracted with 10 ml of methanol twice and 10 ml of ethyl acetate once by using a sonicator hechuang china 20 khz 15 min and centrifugation 2000 g 10 min the supernatants extracts were combined and the radioactivity was measured by the lsc the supplemental data the radioactivity in water and organic solvent extracts were considered as water soluble residues and extractable residues respectively the radioactivity remained in the sediment after the exhaustive extraction with organic solvents was defined as bound residue which was measured by the model 307 sample oxidizer perking elmer usa and lsc see the supplemental data for the above experiments three parallel treatments were used and control treatments were carried out by using deionized water rather than h2o2 no significant degradation of 14c bap was observed in the control treatments residual contents of parent compound bap in aqueous solutions and the extracts were measured by using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc lc 20a shimadzu japan fitted with uv vis detector and inertsil ods sp reverse phase column 150 cm 4 6 mm x 5 mm the injection volume was 10 Î¼l 75 methanol 25 water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the total analytical time and retention time of bap was 15 min and 9 5 min respectively the wavelengths of uv for the detector were 254 nm 2 5 isolation of organic matter of different stability in this study the residual oc remaining after the treatment with h2o2 was defined as the stable oc stoc fig s3 briefly 40 g of a given air dried sediment reacted with 400 ml of 1 m h2o2 the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 20 min and the residue was washed and freeze dried to obtain the h2o2 treated sample hs which was defined as stable oc stoc the oc content of unstable oc usoc was calculated by subtracting the oc content of stoc from the toc content in the original sample os afterwards the hs sample was subsequently extracted with 1 n hcl and 10 hf and the residual oc remaining after the treatment was defined as chemically resistant oc roc the amount of hcl hf extractable oc mineral protected oc moc was calculated by subtracting the oc content of the chemically resistant oc roc from the stoc fraction the oc contents of toc stoc and roc were measured by an elementar vario eliii elemental analyzer elementar germany 2 6 chemical structures and microporosity of the soc fractions since roc was more concentrated than the original sediment oc and the oc contents of roc met the oc requirement for 13c solid state nmr analysis the roc fractions were characterized by 13c solid state nmr briefly solid state nmr experiments were performed on a bruker avance iii 400 spectrometer bruker germany operating at 400 mhz 1h and 100 mhz 13c frequencies hu et al 2000 mao et al 2002 the 13c chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane using the coo resonance of glycine in the Î± modification at 176 46 ppm as a secondary reference the techniques included 13c cross polarization total sideband suppression cpmas toss and cp toss plus dipolar dephasing cpmas toss dd the spectra were measured at a spinning speed of 5 khz the number of scans for the cpmas toss and cpmas toss dd experiments for the roc samples were between 4096 and 12 288 the assignments were as follows 0 45 ppm alkyl c 45 60 ppm o ch3 nch 60 95 ppm alkyl c o 95 110 ppm o c o anomeric c 110 145 ppm aromatic c 145 165 ppm aromatic c o 165 190 ppm coo n c o and 190 210 ppm ketone aldehyde the cp technique has inherent drawbacks and is not quantitative with the low cp efficiency for non protonated carbons and mobile groups cao et al 2013 thus we corrected the cp mas data based on the method of huang et al 2017 fig s4 the co2 isotherms of the os and roc fractions were determined at 273 k between 1 10 6 and 0 03 relative pressure by using a micromeritics asap 2460 surface area and porosity analyzer the co2 isotherms were interpreted by using the dubinin radushkevich dr equation for estimating the specific surface area micropore volume and pore size distribution in the os and roc ran et al 2013 the micropore volume of organic matter was corrected by subtracting n2 vo value from co2 vo value 2 7 estimation of ferrous ions minerals and hydroxyl radicals divalent iron ions can react with ferrozine to form a magenta complex which has a maximum absorption peak at 562 nm and be detected stookey 1970 viollier et al 2000 the compositions and contents of the minerals in sediments were measured in olympus x ray powder diffraction xrd analyzer with cokÎ± radiation and the powder was analyzed from 5 to 55 2Î¸ su et al 2012 since the hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous solution could be captured by salicylic acid concentrations of hydroxyl radical were estimated by using the pink product of salicylic acid reacting with oh halliwell 1978 the products were quantified by spectrophotometry at the wave length of 510 nm 2 8 determination of radioactivity and data analysis radioactivity was quantified by lsc with a detection limit of about 0 5 bq the quench on radioactivity was corrected by external standards and the chemiluminescence in the samples was negligible the chemical degradation of hocs from soils or sediments was usually characterized by a rapid process and followed by a slow process flotron et al 2005 so the degradation percentages of 14c bap in the sediments were fitted to the first order two compartment kinetics model 1 st s 0 f rap 1 e k rap t f slow 1 e kslow t where st is the degradation percentages of bap in the sediments at time t h s0 is the initial radioactivity of 14c bap frap and fslow are the rapid and slow degradation fractions respectively k rap h 1 and k slow h 1 are the corresponding rate constants of rapid and slow degradation fractions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation of oc fractions the oc contents and percentages of each fraction isolated from the sediment samples are presented in table s1 in the sediments the amounts of the bulk oc ranged from 1 71 to 8 91 g kg 1 sediment the oc contents of usoc ranging from 0 38 to 6 75 g kg 1 sediment accounted for 5 52 75 8 of the bulk oc and the oc contents of stoc represented 24 2 94 5 of the bulk oc the moc contents released from the hydrofluoric acid treatment accounted for 4 30 34 80 of the bulk oc in addition the oc contents of roc varied widely among the sediment samples ranging from 0 78 to 4 99 g kg 1 sediment which were close to those observed in sediments 0 4 6 5 g kg 1sediment mikutta et al 2006 the oc contents of roc in this investigation accounted for 8 8 72 4 of the bulk oc the relative contribution of uoc moc and roc to total oc varied in different sediments fig 1 a the usoc bulk gradually decreased but the roc bulk gradually increased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 e4 and e5 where usoc bulk or roc bulk means the oc contents of usoc or roc in the bulk table s1 helfrich et al 2007 reported that h2o2 and na2s2o8 treatments preferred to remove young oc and thus isolated older and more stable oc fractions ran et al 2007b also noted that the acid insoluble fraction of sediments contained considerable ancient carbon soc can become condensed and recalcitrant residues after h2o2 oxidation garbarini and lion 1986 isaacson and frink 1984 which have a high affinity for hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs cuypers et al 2000 young and weber 1995 3 2 characteristic functional groups and microporosity of the roc fractions 13c cp toss nmr and cp toss dd nmr experiments were performed for the roc components in a1 a4 e3 e4 and e5 sediments but not for the sample e2 due to its low organic carbon content in this study dipolar dephasing was also used to study the chemical structures of the roc fractions in detail the corresponding 13c cp toss dd spectra thick lines fig 2 solely exhibited the signals of non protonated carbon and mobile groups including rotating ch3 groups which had reduced c h dipolar coupling due to their fast motions the thin lines in fig 2 of the 13c solid state nmr spectra for the roc fractions represented 13c cp toss nmr spectra of all c the integration results are shown in table 1 the roc fractions consisted of ch2 n 6 57 14 1 alkyl c 25 5 52 5 och3 nch 8 86 11 3 o alkyl 12 2 19 1 aromatic c 20 7 42 0 and coo nc o 3 60 9 33 the aromatic carbon percentages farom and aliphatic carbon percentages faliph which were corrected based on huang et al 2017 ranged from 37 39 to 57 27 and from 32 0 to 52 4 respectively table 1 the faliph values gradually increased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e3 e4 and e5 while the farom values showed just the opposite trend ran et al 2007a also found that the faliph of nonhydrolyzable carbon isolated from soc gradually increased from inland soils and reverine sediments to pearl river estuary sediments but the farom values had the opposite trend surface analysis was performed for the os and roc fractions of the samples a1 a4 e2 e3 e4 and e5 the dr equation was well fitted to the co2 adsorption isotherms r2 0 990 fig s5 the micropore volumes vo and specific surface areas ssa were calculated and presented in table s2 the vo values in the roc fractions ranged from 8 13 to 15 0 Î¼l g and their ssa values from 20 3 to 37 5 m2 g in addition micropore volumes smaller than 0 70 nm were dominant fig s6 accounting for 76 4 86 0 and 75 8 84 3 of accumulative pore volumes ranging from 0 to 1 10 nm for roc fractions linear regression analysis showed that the vo bulk were highly significantly related to the oc contents of roc fig s7a where vo bulk mean that micropore volumes estimated from the roc fractions for the bulk samples figs s7 b c showed that the vo bulk values were significantly correlated with the faliph c and alkyl c suggesting that microporosity in the roc fractions predominantly originated from aliphatic moieties 3 3 contents of ferrous ion the mineral and hydroxyl radical the ferrous ion contents and the compositions and contents of minerals in each sediment were measured it was found that the contents of ferrous ion in the sediments ranged from 2 34 to 35 20 Î¼mol g the ferrous ion concentrations gradually decreased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 fig s8a while the dominant mineral in the sediments studied was quartz the contents of quartz gradually decreased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 but the contents of illite albite and calcite were just opposite fig s8b table s3 in addition the contents of hydroxyl radicals were measured from absorbance for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with salicylic acid fig 1d showed the kinetic curves for the amounts of hydroxyl radical generated under the same conditions as those of the bap degradation experiment the hydroxyl radical generation rates of a1 a4 and e5 samples were significantly faster than those of e2 e3 and e4 and reached the approximate equilibrium at 48 h which was related to the rates of formation and consumption of hydroxyl radicals during the oxidation of soc fractions however after 144 h it was found that the contents of oh for each of a1 a4 e4 and e5 sediments were only slightly higher than those of e2 or e3 sediments the above observation also indicated that there was not any significantly positive relationship between the ferrous ion contents and the production of hydroxyl radicals in the investigated sediments 3 4 degradation kinetics of bap bap degradation conversion of 14c labeled 7 carbon to 14co2 is likely to reduce carcinogenicity by disrupting the bay region structure rentz et al 2008 so in the present study the degradation kinetic curves of 7 14c bap in different sediments were plotted to reflect the efficiency of bap removal and degradation fig 1b the degradation kinetics data of bap were described using a two compartment model in the first phase frap the degradation rate was rapid followed by a second phase fslow with slower rate the results showed that all the r 2 values were higher than 0 99 suggesting that the two compartment first order kinetic model well described the degradation kinetics of bap in the seven sediments the rate constants and contribution fractions of the individual degradation compartments are given in table 2 it was found that 0 22 48 0 of 14c bap was degraded within 24 h and 1 42 87 2 of 14c bap was degraded within 408 h in the sediments the maximum degradation of bap of 14c bap and the frap fractions gradually decreased from the estuarine samples to the marine samples in contrast fslow gradually increased from the estuarine to marine sediments table 2 the maximum degradation of bap by microorganisms and chemical oxidation using different reaction conditions in previous investigations were variable juhasz and naidu 2000 keum et al 2017 sakulthaew et al 2014 watts et al 2002 the rate constants in first phase krap ranged from 0 007 to 0 063 h 1 which were much slower than those observed from the reaction of bap in aqueous solutions krap ranging from 0 24 h 1 to 32 34 h 1 flotron et al 2005 suggesting that sediments containing rich soc led to a slower oxidation huang et al 2017 investigated the desorption rates of bap krap 0 032 0 055 h 1 in similar estuarine sediments which were quite close to the degradation rates of bap krap 0 041 0 063 h 1 in the estuarine sediments x1 a1 a4 in this study these facts indicated that the desorption rates of bap were the critical factor controlling its oxidative degradation in sediments 3 5 bap degradation processes during h2o2 treatment the distribution of bap and its oxidized intermediates after 408 h were monitored by using 14c labeled and hplc analyses residual amounts of parent compounds bap in water soluble residues and extractable residues were determined by hplc respectively the radioactivity of 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues fractions were measured respectively table s4 the result showed that the total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 94 15 to 98 44 the radioactive products in extractable residues water soluble residues and bound residues included either oxidized intermediates or parent compounds it was found that almost no parent compound was present in the water soluble residues but 4 1 57 56 of the parent compound was present in extractable residues table s5 fig s9 this observation suggested that the bap parent compounds desorbed into the aqueous solution were degraded below detection limits moreover the percentages of radioactive intermediates in water soluble residues and extractable residues were calculated by subtracting the percentages of parent compounds from radioactive products the results showed that the oxidized intermediates in water soluble residues and in extractable residues accounted for 4 07 20 32 and 1 3 15 8 of total bap radiocarbon activity respectively table 3 furthermore 4 3 30 58 of radioactivity was detected in bound residues and represented either oxidized intermediates covalently bound to soc or parent compound sequestered in soc it was noted that the spiked bap in the e5 sample showed the lowest degradation percent and the highest bound residual percent while the x1 and a1 samples showed higher degradation percentages and lower bound residual percentages we assumed that this phenomenon may be related to the difference in organic matter types and or inorganic minerals in the samples it is noted that the h2o2 treatment would destroy the secondary minerals such as fe and mn oxides in the sediments mikutta et al 2005 finally the bap intermediates in water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues will be investigated in our future work 3 6 factors affecting maximum degradation of bap in sediments the ferrous ion contents in the sediments of this study did not affect the total amounts of hydroxyl radical generation during the treatment process fig 1d fig s8a moreover in our preliminary test we also investigated the effect of fe2 ions of different doses on bap degradation the supplemental fe2 ranging from 0 mm to 50 mm only elevated the bap degradation ratios by an average of 3 87 for the investigated sediments fig s10 the above observation indicated that the content of ferrous ion in the sediment was not a key factor in the degradation of bap furthermore fig 3 showed that the maximum degradation of bap increased with the increasing oc contents of usoc and the decreasing oc contents of roc these highly significant correlations suggested that bap sorbed in usoc was readily degraded but sorbed in roc was poorly oxidized by h2o2 jonsson et al 2007 indicated that the degradability of hmw pahs was highly affected by the amount of degraded soc under the h2o2 attack fig 1c showed that for the water soluble residue fraction its radioactivity increased rapidly to 26 and then decreased rapidly to 3 40 after 384 h the rapid increase of radioactivity at first in the aqueous phase was probably due to that the usoc was rapidly degraded by h2o2 and then released its adsorbed 14c bap or 14c byproduct into the aqueous phase as 14c bap or 14c by product in the aqueous phase continued to be degraded the radioactivity in the aqueous phase began to decrease cuypers et al 2002 also reported that pahs sorbed in amorphous rubbery soc were readily degraded whereas pahs sorbed in condensed glassy soc were poorly degraded in order to estimate the critical factors the multivariate regressions among frap fslow roc bulk x1 and usoc bulk x2 were conducted the results gave the following equations 2 frap 1 098 x1 0 165 x2 r 2 0 951 p 0 05 3 fslow 1 057 x1 0 128x2 r 2 0 943 p 0 05 the relative contribution of roc bulk usoc bulk to frap and fslow is as follows roc bulk usoc bulk the above equations demonstrated that roc bulk was a more critical factor in the bap degradation kinetics in the sediments 3 7 effect of roc structures on the bap degradation in order to estimate the effect of the roc chemical structures during the degradation process linear regression analysis was performed between bap degradation kinetic parameters and functional groups in the roc fractions the correlations among the degradation parameters frap k rap fslow and k slow faliph bulk farom bulk alkyl c bulk and arom c c bulk are listed in table s6 where faliph bulk farom bulk alkyl c bulk and arom c c bulk indicates the contents of aliphatic c aromatic c alkyl c and arom c c derived from the roc fractions for the bulk sediments the maximum degradation of bap at 408 h was significantly and negatively correlated with the faliph bulk r 2 0 769 p 0 05 fig s11a and significantly and positively correlated with the farom bulk r 2 0 747 p 0 05 fig s11d moreover the alkyl c bulk and ch2 n c bulk in the aliphatic c showed a negative correlation r 2 0 725 p 0 05 r 2 0 707 p 0 07 respectively with the maximum degradation of bap figs s11b c but the arom c c bulk and arom c o bulk in the aromatic c showed a positive correlation r 2 0 862 p 0 05 r 2 0 754 p 0 05 respectively with the maximum degradation of bap figs s11e f furthermore the bap maximum degradation of bap increased as the farom bulk increased and faliph bulk decreased it was also found that the faliph bulk and alkyl c bulk were significantly negatively related to frap r 2 0 884 p 0 05 r 2 0 797 p 0 05 respectively but significantly positively related to fslow r 2 0 883 p 0 05 r 2 0 807 p 0 05 respectively fig 4 a d farom bulk and arom c c bulk were significantly positively related to frap r 2 0 934 p 0 05 r 2 0 880 p 0 05 respectively but significantly and negatively related to fslow r 2 0 937 p 0 05 r 2 0 882 p 0 05 respectively fig 4e h these above phenomena are related to the fact that hydroxyl radicals are more easily to attack the aromatic structures in soc than the aliphatic c structures there were evidences that oh radicals preferentially attacked aromatic compounds for example aliphatic structures of natural organic matter nom reacted more slowly with oh radicals than aromatic moieties did and oh radicals preferentially attacked aromatic compounds mikutta et al 2005 westerhoff et al 1999 the aliphatic hydrocarbons c5 c8 were more chemical resistant than aromatic compounds in the study on jet fuel contaminated sediments by using h2o2 treatment and the general order of reactivity of organic compounds was aromatic ch2 co cooh peyton 1993 xie and barcelona 2003 therefore during the h2o2 chemical degradation process the aromatic c structure was easily degraded by h2o2 leading to the release and degradation of sorbed bap in the investigated sediments conversely the aliphatic c was difficult to be degraded by h2o2 protecting the sorbed bap from being mineralized by h2o2 3 8 effect of microporosity on the bap degradation the relationships among the fitted kinetic parameters frap fslow the micropore volumes were analyzed linear correlation analysis showed that the vo bulk were significantly and negatively related to frap r 2 0 738 p 0 05 but significantly and positively related to fslow r 2 0 784 p 0 05 fig s12 suggesting that vo bulk hindered the degradation of bap the highly hydrophobic bap sorbed in the roc micropores was not readily released and mineralized the above observation is consistent with other investigations for example the hydroxyl radicals are usually generated in aqueous solution during fenton s oxidation process in a solid solution system flotron et al 2005 the half life of the hydroxyl radicals is very short 10 4s particle associated hocs is incapable of reacting with aqueous phase oh sedlak and andren 1994 hence the micropores in roc played a crucial role in protecting sorbed bap from being degraded by hydroxyl radicals 4 conclusion we investigated the feasibility of the degradation of 7 14c bap by h2o2 treatment in different sediments and for the first time the effect of the soc fractions chemical structures and microporosity on the maximum degradation of bap it was found that the ferrous ions in the sediments were not the key factor affecting the maximum degradation of bap the usoc and aromatic c structures were more easily degraded by h2o2 leading to the release and degradation of sorbed bap in the sediments but the roc and the aliphatic c were hardly degraded by h2o2 protecting the sorbed bap from being degraded by h2o2 this investigation indicated that the bap parent compound desorbed into the aqueous solution were degraded below detection limits the oxidized intermediates in water soluble residues and in extractable residues accounted for 4 07 20 32 and 1 3 15 8 of total bap radioactivity respectively 4 3 30 58 of total bap radioactivity was detected in bound residues and represented either oxidized intermediates covalently bound to soc or parent compounds sequestered in soc the contribution of roc was greater than that of usoc in the degradation kinetics parameters of bap highly hydrophobic bap sorbed in the roc micropores was not readily released and degraded the

18793,we investigated how the degradation of 7 14c bap aged in sediments by h2o2 treatment was influenced by the chemical structures compositions and microporosity of sedimentary organic carbon soc unstable oc usoc stable oc stoc mineral protected oc moc and chemically resistant oc roc fractions were fractionated the chemical structures and microporosity of the roc fractions were characterized by 13c solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and co2 adsorption technique respectively a first order two compartment kinetics model described the degradation process very well r 2 0 980 the bap degradation ratios increased with the increasing usoc contents and decreased with the increasing roc contents the bap parent compound in the aqueous solution was almost completely degraded the considerable portions of oxidized intermediates were detected in different soc fractions which represented either oxidized intermediates or parent compounds the very good multivariate regressions among the degradation kinetics parameters soc structures and micropore volumes demonstrated that roc bulk aliphatic moieties and microporosity played crucial roles in protecting sorbed bap from being degraded by h2o2 the results showed that roc aliphatic moieties and microporosity played vital roles in bap degradation process in sediments during h2o2 treatment which is reported for the first time in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords 7 14c benzo a pyrene degradation hydrogen peroxide aliphatic carbon microporosity 1 introduction benzo a pyrene bap a representative high molecular weight hmw polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs is of highly environmental concern in contaminated sediments due to its notorious carcinogenicity bioaccumulation potential and persistence rentz et al 2008 bioremediation has been widely accepted as a viable treatment technique for the treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated sediments wilson and jones 1993 but bioremediation of hmw pahs such as bap has demonstrated only partial success due to their high recalcitrance juhasz and naidu 2000 hydrogen peroxide when catalyzed by soluble ferrous ions or naturally occurring sediment minerals generates strong relatively nonspecific oxidant hydroxyl radicals which can then react with most organic compounds huang et al 1993 mikutta et al 2006 it also can be applied to the remediation of contaminated solid matrices such as soils or sediments jonsson et al 2007 neyens and baeyens 2003 watts et al 1999 2002 in addition fenton oxidation is a process that can be used in conjunction with bioremediation techniques to either pretreat pahs into more biodegradable compounds or as a post treatment of pahs residues martens and jr 1995 nam et al 2001 the chemical structures and microporosity of sedimentary organic carbon soc in sediments strongly influence the sorption desorption and chemical degradation of hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs pignatello and xing 1996 ran et al 2007a xing and pignatello 1997 the sorption of hocs in amorphous rubbery domains is linear and fast xing 2001 whereas that in condensed glassy domains is nonlinear slow and strong pignatello 1998 song et al 2002 xing et al 1996 it is still debatable on the relative importance of aromatic and aliphatic carbon structures of soc on the sorption desorption and chemical degradation of hocs chefetz and xing 2009 moreover the role of micropores on the sorption and desorption of hocs by different soc has recently been demonstrated suggesting that micropore filling significantly dominates sorption and desorption of hocs in sediments han et al 2014 huang et al 2017 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 but the relationships among the microporosity soc structure and bap oxidation kinetics have rarely been reported sedlak and andren 1994 reported that sorption of pcbs to particles resulted in decreased hoc removal rates under h2o2 treatment the magnitude of this effect would likely depend upon the relationship between the rates of adsorption desorption and oh reactions westerhoff et al 1999 firstly reported that the aliphatic structure of dissolved organic matter dom reacted with oh more slowly than the aromatic moiety such as protonated and alkyl substituted aromatic carbon did oh preferentially attacked aromatic structures but it attacked aliphatic structures such as alkyl c moieties less efficiently the 14c isotope tracing technique has been well used to investigate the effect of soc heterogeneity on the chemical degradation of pollutants sun et al 2014 as well 14c labeled 7 carbon bap bay region labeled structure has been used to investigate the reduction of bap carcinogenicity boonchan et al 2000 dingyi ye et al 2006 rentz et al 2008 moreover solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy has been used to provide a basis for inferring the molecular structure in oc fractions mao et al 2002 however it is noted that nmr spectroscopy remains underutilized in studies of marine sediments hedges et al 2001 2002 and is not yet used to investigate the resistant oc in different sediments in this study we employed nmr techniques 14c isotope tracing technique and an updated co2 gas adsorption technique to examine the relationship of oxidation and other alterations in soc structure and the degradation of 14c bap by h2o2 treatment in sediments which generated valuable information that could be used to guide future remediation efforts in contaminated sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and sediment collection 7 14c benzo a pyrene 26 6 mci mmol 95 radiochemical activity and 97 chemical purity and non labeled bap analytical grade purity 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa all the chemical reagents used in this study were chromatographic or analytical grades 2 2 sediment collection the sediments were collected from xinfengjiang reservoir the pearl river estuary to the continental shelves in the northern south china sea by using a box sampler one sediment sample x1 was collected from the xinfengjiang reservoir in january 2012 two a1 a4 from the pearl river estuary in january 2012 and four e2 e3 e4 and e5 from the northern south china sea in may 2012 the sampling details were described in the supplemental data and fig s1 all the samples were frozen upon reception in the laboratory for the storage before their use the samples were freeze dried ground sieved through an 80 mesh 0 178 mm sieve there were no detachable bap residues in sediments 2 3 sediment spiking with bap and aging sediment spiking with bap and aging were based on the method by huang et al 2017 the spiked bap concentration in the sediment was 500 ng g including 50 ng g of 14c bap and 450 ng g of non radioactive labeled bap the aging treatments were detailed in the supplemental data the relative standard deviation of radioactivity for sediment replicates ranged from 1 40 to 3 65 indicating that bap was homogeneously distributed in the spiked samples 2 4 degradation experiments the degradation experiment was performed in a 25 ml glass incubation vial which was sealed with a rubber stopper the flow chart of degradation experiment is shown in fig s2 the reaction system contained 0 5 g dw of a given spiked sediment 5 ml of 1 m h2o2 no iron amendment and a mercury chloride solution 50 g l which was added to inhibit microbial activities the bottles were incubated in a shaker under the condition of 120 rpm 25 c and in the dark at the time intervals of 1 2 6 12 24 48 96 192 288 384 and 408 h the radioactivity of each fraction degradation to 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues fractions of the reaction system was measured the radioactivity of 14co2 at 408 h was defined as the maximum degradation of bap the 14co2 contents released in the reaction system were trapped by 1 0 ml of naoh in a 2 5 ml glass vial which was suspended below the bottle stopper liu et al 2013 shan et al 2011 the radioactivity in the naoh trap was determined by liquid scintillation counter lsc perking elmer usa see the supplemental data the water layer was decanted from the sediment after centrifugation 2000 g 10min and determined for radioactivity by lsc see the supplemental data the remaining sediment was extracted with 10 ml of methanol twice and 10 ml of ethyl acetate once by using a sonicator hechuang china 20 khz 15 min and centrifugation 2000 g 10 min the supernatants extracts were combined and the radioactivity was measured by the lsc the supplemental data the radioactivity in water and organic solvent extracts were considered as water soluble residues and extractable residues respectively the radioactivity remained in the sediment after the exhaustive extraction with organic solvents was defined as bound residue which was measured by the model 307 sample oxidizer perking elmer usa and lsc see the supplemental data for the above experiments three parallel treatments were used and control treatments were carried out by using deionized water rather than h2o2 no significant degradation of 14c bap was observed in the control treatments residual contents of parent compound bap in aqueous solutions and the extracts were measured by using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc lc 20a shimadzu japan fitted with uv vis detector and inertsil ods sp reverse phase column 150 cm 4 6 mm x 5 mm the injection volume was 10 Î¼l 75 methanol 25 water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the total analytical time and retention time of bap was 15 min and 9 5 min respectively the wavelengths of uv for the detector were 254 nm 2 5 isolation of organic matter of different stability in this study the residual oc remaining after the treatment with h2o2 was defined as the stable oc stoc fig s3 briefly 40 g of a given air dried sediment reacted with 400 ml of 1 m h2o2 the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 20 min and the residue was washed and freeze dried to obtain the h2o2 treated sample hs which was defined as stable oc stoc the oc content of unstable oc usoc was calculated by subtracting the oc content of stoc from the toc content in the original sample os afterwards the hs sample was subsequently extracted with 1 n hcl and 10 hf and the residual oc remaining after the treatment was defined as chemically resistant oc roc the amount of hcl hf extractable oc mineral protected oc moc was calculated by subtracting the oc content of the chemically resistant oc roc from the stoc fraction the oc contents of toc stoc and roc were measured by an elementar vario eliii elemental analyzer elementar germany 2 6 chemical structures and microporosity of the soc fractions since roc was more concentrated than the original sediment oc and the oc contents of roc met the oc requirement for 13c solid state nmr analysis the roc fractions were characterized by 13c solid state nmr briefly solid state nmr experiments were performed on a bruker avance iii 400 spectrometer bruker germany operating at 400 mhz 1h and 100 mhz 13c frequencies hu et al 2000 mao et al 2002 the 13c chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane using the coo resonance of glycine in the Î± modification at 176 46 ppm as a secondary reference the techniques included 13c cross polarization total sideband suppression cpmas toss and cp toss plus dipolar dephasing cpmas toss dd the spectra were measured at a spinning speed of 5 khz the number of scans for the cpmas toss and cpmas toss dd experiments for the roc samples were between 4096 and 12 288 the assignments were as follows 0 45 ppm alkyl c 45 60 ppm o ch3 nch 60 95 ppm alkyl c o 95 110 ppm o c o anomeric c 110 145 ppm aromatic c 145 165 ppm aromatic c o 165 190 ppm coo n c o and 190 210 ppm ketone aldehyde the cp technique has inherent drawbacks and is not quantitative with the low cp efficiency for non protonated carbons and mobile groups cao et al 2013 thus we corrected the cp mas data based on the method of huang et al 2017 fig s4 the co2 isotherms of the os and roc fractions were determined at 273 k between 1 10 6 and 0 03 relative pressure by using a micromeritics asap 2460 surface area and porosity analyzer the co2 isotherms were interpreted by using the dubinin radushkevich dr equation for estimating the specific surface area micropore volume and pore size distribution in the os and roc ran et al 2013 the micropore volume of organic matter was corrected by subtracting n2 vo value from co2 vo value 2 7 estimation of ferrous ions minerals and hydroxyl radicals divalent iron ions can react with ferrozine to form a magenta complex which has a maximum absorption peak at 562 nm and be detected stookey 1970 viollier et al 2000 the compositions and contents of the minerals in sediments were measured in olympus x ray powder diffraction xrd analyzer with cokÎ± radiation and the powder was analyzed from 5 to 55 2Î¸ su et al 2012 since the hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous solution could be captured by salicylic acid concentrations of hydroxyl radical were estimated by using the pink product of salicylic acid reacting with oh halliwell 1978 the products were quantified by spectrophotometry at the wave length of 510 nm 2 8 determination of radioactivity and data analysis radioactivity was quantified by lsc with a detection limit of about 0 5 bq the quench on radioactivity was corrected by external standards and the chemiluminescence in the samples was negligible the chemical degradation of hocs from soils or sediments was usually characterized by a rapid process and followed by a slow process flotron et al 2005 so the degradation percentages of 14c bap in the sediments were fitted to the first order two compartment kinetics model 1 st s 0 f rap 1 e k rap t f slow 1 e kslow t where st is the degradation percentages of bap in the sediments at time t h s0 is the initial radioactivity of 14c bap frap and fslow are the rapid and slow degradation fractions respectively k rap h 1 and k slow h 1 are the corresponding rate constants of rapid and slow degradation fractions respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation of oc fractions the oc contents and percentages of each fraction isolated from the sediment samples are presented in table s1 in the sediments the amounts of the bulk oc ranged from 1 71 to 8 91 g kg 1 sediment the oc contents of usoc ranging from 0 38 to 6 75 g kg 1 sediment accounted for 5 52 75 8 of the bulk oc and the oc contents of stoc represented 24 2 94 5 of the bulk oc the moc contents released from the hydrofluoric acid treatment accounted for 4 30 34 80 of the bulk oc in addition the oc contents of roc varied widely among the sediment samples ranging from 0 78 to 4 99 g kg 1 sediment which were close to those observed in sediments 0 4 6 5 g kg 1sediment mikutta et al 2006 the oc contents of roc in this investigation accounted for 8 8 72 4 of the bulk oc the relative contribution of uoc moc and roc to total oc varied in different sediments fig 1 a the usoc bulk gradually decreased but the roc bulk gradually increased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 e4 and e5 where usoc bulk or roc bulk means the oc contents of usoc or roc in the bulk table s1 helfrich et al 2007 reported that h2o2 and na2s2o8 treatments preferred to remove young oc and thus isolated older and more stable oc fractions ran et al 2007b also noted that the acid insoluble fraction of sediments contained considerable ancient carbon soc can become condensed and recalcitrant residues after h2o2 oxidation garbarini and lion 1986 isaacson and frink 1984 which have a high affinity for hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs cuypers et al 2000 young and weber 1995 3 2 characteristic functional groups and microporosity of the roc fractions 13c cp toss nmr and cp toss dd nmr experiments were performed for the roc components in a1 a4 e3 e4 and e5 sediments but not for the sample e2 due to its low organic carbon content in this study dipolar dephasing was also used to study the chemical structures of the roc fractions in detail the corresponding 13c cp toss dd spectra thick lines fig 2 solely exhibited the signals of non protonated carbon and mobile groups including rotating ch3 groups which had reduced c h dipolar coupling due to their fast motions the thin lines in fig 2 of the 13c solid state nmr spectra for the roc fractions represented 13c cp toss nmr spectra of all c the integration results are shown in table 1 the roc fractions consisted of ch2 n 6 57 14 1 alkyl c 25 5 52 5 och3 nch 8 86 11 3 o alkyl 12 2 19 1 aromatic c 20 7 42 0 and coo nc o 3 60 9 33 the aromatic carbon percentages farom and aliphatic carbon percentages faliph which were corrected based on huang et al 2017 ranged from 37 39 to 57 27 and from 32 0 to 52 4 respectively table 1 the faliph values gradually increased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e3 e4 and e5 while the farom values showed just the opposite trend ran et al 2007a also found that the faliph of nonhydrolyzable carbon isolated from soc gradually increased from inland soils and reverine sediments to pearl river estuary sediments but the farom values had the opposite trend surface analysis was performed for the os and roc fractions of the samples a1 a4 e2 e3 e4 and e5 the dr equation was well fitted to the co2 adsorption isotherms r2 0 990 fig s5 the micropore volumes vo and specific surface areas ssa were calculated and presented in table s2 the vo values in the roc fractions ranged from 8 13 to 15 0 Î¼l g and their ssa values from 20 3 to 37 5 m2 g in addition micropore volumes smaller than 0 70 nm were dominant fig s6 accounting for 76 4 86 0 and 75 8 84 3 of accumulative pore volumes ranging from 0 to 1 10 nm for roc fractions linear regression analysis showed that the vo bulk were highly significantly related to the oc contents of roc fig s7a where vo bulk mean that micropore volumes estimated from the roc fractions for the bulk samples figs s7 b c showed that the vo bulk values were significantly correlated with the faliph c and alkyl c suggesting that microporosity in the roc fractions predominantly originated from aliphatic moieties 3 3 contents of ferrous ion the mineral and hydroxyl radical the ferrous ion contents and the compositions and contents of minerals in each sediment were measured it was found that the contents of ferrous ion in the sediments ranged from 2 34 to 35 20 Î¼mol g the ferrous ion concentrations gradually decreased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 fig s8a while the dominant mineral in the sediments studied was quartz the contents of quartz gradually decreased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 but the contents of illite albite and calcite were just opposite fig s8b table s3 in addition the contents of hydroxyl radicals were measured from absorbance for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with salicylic acid fig 1d showed the kinetic curves for the amounts of hydroxyl radical generated under the same conditions as those of the bap degradation experiment the hydroxyl radical generation rates of a1 a4 and e5 samples were significantly faster than those of e2 e3 and e4 and reached the approximate equilibrium at 48 h which was related to the rates of formation and consumption of hydroxyl radicals during the oxidation of soc fractions however after 144 h it was found that the contents of oh for each of a1 a4 e4 and e5 sediments were only slightly higher than those of e2 or e3 sediments the above observation also indicated that there was not any significantly positive relationship between the ferrous ion contents and the production of hydroxyl radicals in the investigated sediments 3 4 degradation kinetics of bap bap degradation conversion of 14c labeled 7 carbon to 14co2 is likely to reduce carcinogenicity by disrupting the bay region structure rentz et al 2008 so in the present study the degradation kinetic curves of 7 14c bap in different sediments were plotted to reflect the efficiency of bap removal and degradation fig 1b the degradation kinetics data of bap were described using a two compartment model in the first phase frap the degradation rate was rapid followed by a second phase fslow with slower rate the results showed that all the r 2 values were higher than 0 99 suggesting that the two compartment first order kinetic model well described the degradation kinetics of bap in the seven sediments the rate constants and contribution fractions of the individual degradation compartments are given in table 2 it was found that 0 22 48 0 of 14c bap was degraded within 24 h and 1 42 87 2 of 14c bap was degraded within 408 h in the sediments the maximum degradation of bap of 14c bap and the frap fractions gradually decreased from the estuarine samples to the marine samples in contrast fslow gradually increased from the estuarine to marine sediments table 2 the maximum degradation of bap by microorganisms and chemical oxidation using different reaction conditions in previous investigations were variable juhasz and naidu 2000 keum et al 2017 sakulthaew et al 2014 watts et al 2002 the rate constants in first phase krap ranged from 0 007 to 0 063 h 1 which were much slower than those observed from the reaction of bap in aqueous solutions krap ranging from 0 24 h 1 to 32 34 h 1 flotron et al 2005 suggesting that sediments containing rich soc led to a slower oxidation huang et al 2017 investigated the desorption rates of bap krap 0 032 0 055 h 1 in similar estuarine sediments which were quite close to the degradation rates of bap krap 0 041 0 063 h 1 in the estuarine sediments x1 a1 a4 in this study these facts indicated that the desorption rates of bap were the critical factor controlling its oxidative degradation in sediments 3 5 bap degradation processes during h2o2 treatment the distribution of bap and its oxidized intermediates after 408 h were monitored by using 14c labeled and hplc analyses residual amounts of parent compounds bap in water soluble residues and extractable residues were determined by hplc respectively the radioactivity of 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues fractions were measured respectively table s4 the result showed that the total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 94 15 to 98 44 the radioactive products in extractable residues water soluble residues and bound residues included either oxidized intermediates or parent compounds it was found that almost no parent compound was present in the water soluble residues but 4 1 57 56 of the parent compound was present in extractable residues table s5 fig s9 this observation suggested that the bap parent compounds desorbed into the aqueous solution were degraded below detection limits moreover the percentages of radioactive intermediates in water soluble residues and extractable residues were calculated by subtracting the percentages of parent compounds from radioactive products the results showed that the oxidized intermediates in water soluble residues and in extractable residues accounted for 4 07 20 32 and 1 3 15 8 of total bap radiocarbon activity respectively table 3 furthermore 4 3 30 58 of radioactivity was detected in bound residues and represented either oxidized intermediates covalently bound to soc or parent compound sequestered in soc it was noted that the spiked bap in the e5 sample showed the lowest degradation percent and the highest bound residual percent while the x1 and a1 samples showed higher degradation percentages and lower bound residual percentages we assumed that this phenomenon may be related to the difference in organic matter types and or inorganic minerals in the samples it is noted that the h2o2 treatment would destroy the secondary minerals such as fe and mn oxides in the sediments mikutta et al 2005 finally the bap intermediates in water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues will be investigated in our future work 3 6 factors affecting maximum degradation of bap in sediments the ferrous ion contents in the sediments of this study did not affect the total amounts of hydroxyl radical generation during the treatment process fig 1d fig s8a moreover in our preliminary test we also investigated the effect of fe2 ions of different doses on bap degradation the supplemental fe2 ranging from 0 mm to 50 mm only elevated the bap degradation ratios by an average of 3 87 for the investigated sediments fig s10 the above observation indicated that the content of ferrous ion in the sediment was not a key factor in the degradation of bap furthermore fig 3 showed that the maximum degradation of bap increased with the increasing oc contents of usoc and the decreasing oc contents of roc these highly significant correlations suggested that bap sorbed in usoc was readily degraded but sorbed in roc was poorly oxidized by h2o2 jonsson et al 2007 indicated that the degradability of hmw pahs was highly affected by the amount of degraded soc under the h2o2 attack fig 1c showed that for the water soluble residue fraction its radioactivity increased rapidly to 26 and then decreased rapidly to 3 40 after 384 h the rapid increase of radioactivity at first in the aqueous phase was probably due to that the usoc was rapidly degraded by h2o2 and then released its adsorbed 14c bap or 14c byproduct into the aqueous phase as 14c bap or 14c by product in the aqueous phase continued to be degraded the radioactivity in the aqueous phase began to decrease cuypers et al 2002 also reported that pahs sorbed in amorphous rubbery soc were readily degraded whereas pahs sorbed in condensed glassy soc were poorly degraded in order to estimate the critical factors the multivariate regressions among frap fslow roc bulk x1 and usoc bulk x2 were conducted the results gave the following equations 2 frap 1 098 x1 0 165 x2 r 2 0 951 p 0 05 3 fslow 1 057 x1 0 128x2 r 2 0 943 p 0 05 the relative contribution of roc bulk usoc bulk to frap and fslow is as follows roc bulk usoc bulk the above equations demonstrated that roc bulk was a more critical factor in the bap degradation kinetics in the sediments 3 7 effect of roc structures on the bap degradation in order to estimate the effect of the roc chemical structures during the degradation process linear regression analysis was performed between bap degradation kinetic parameters and functional groups in the roc fractions the correlations among the degradation parameters frap k rap fslow and k slow faliph bulk farom bulk alkyl c bulk and arom c c bulk are listed in table s6 where faliph bulk farom bulk alkyl c bulk and arom c c bulk indicates the contents of aliphatic c aromatic c alkyl c and arom c c derived from the roc fractions for the bulk sediments the maximum degradation of bap at 408 h was significantly and negatively correlated with the faliph bulk r 2 0 769 p 0 05 fig s11a and significantly and positively correlated with the farom bulk r 2 0 747 p 0 05 fig s11d moreover the alkyl c bulk and ch2 n c bulk in the aliphatic c showed a negative correlation r 2 0 725 p 0 05 r 2 0 707 p 0 07 respectively with the maximum degradation of bap figs s11b c but the arom c c bulk and arom c o bulk in the aromatic c showed a positive correlation r 2 0 862 p 0 05 r 2 0 754 p 0 05 respectively with the maximum degradation of bap figs s11e f furthermore the bap maximum degradation of bap increased as the farom bulk increased and faliph bulk decreased it was also found that the faliph bulk and alkyl c bulk were significantly negatively related to frap r 2 0 884 p 0 05 r 2 0 797 p 0 05 respectively but significantly positively related to fslow r 2 0 883 p 0 05 r 2 0 807 p 0 05 respectively fig 4 a d farom bulk and arom c c bulk were significantly positively related to frap r 2 0 934 p 0 05 r 2 0 880 p 0 05 respectively but significantly and negatively related to fslow r 2 0 937 p 0 05 r 2 0 882 p 0 05 respectively fig 4e h these above phenomena are related to the fact that hydroxyl radicals are more easily to attack the aromatic structures in soc than the aliphatic c structures there were evidences that oh radicals preferentially attacked aromatic compounds for example aliphatic structures of natural organic matter nom reacted more slowly with oh radicals than aromatic moieties did and oh radicals preferentially attacked aromatic compounds mikutta et al 2005 westerhoff et al 1999 the aliphatic hydrocarbons c5 c8 were more chemical resistant than aromatic compounds in the study on jet fuel contaminated sediments by using h2o2 treatment and the general order of reactivity of organic compounds was aromatic ch2 co cooh peyton 1993 xie and barcelona 2003 therefore during the h2o2 chemical degradation process the aromatic c structure was easily degraded by h2o2 leading to the release and degradation of sorbed bap in the investigated sediments conversely the aliphatic c was difficult to be degraded by h2o2 protecting the sorbed bap from being mineralized by h2o2 3 8 effect of microporosity on the bap degradation the relationships among the fitted kinetic parameters frap fslow the micropore volumes were analyzed linear correlation analysis showed that the vo bulk were significantly and negatively related to frap r 2 0 738 p 0 05 but significantly and positively related to fslow r 2 0 784 p 0 05 fig s12 suggesting that vo bulk hindered the degradation of bap the highly hydrophobic bap sorbed in the roc micropores was not readily released and mineralized the above observation is consistent with other investigations for example the hydroxyl radicals are usually generated in aqueous solution during fenton s oxidation process in a solid solution system flotron et al 2005 the half life of the hydroxyl radicals is very short 10 4s particle associated hocs is incapable of reacting with aqueous phase oh sedlak and andren 1994 hence the micropores in roc played a crucial role in protecting sorbed bap from being degraded by hydroxyl radicals 4 conclusion we investigated the feasibility of the degradation of 7 14c bap by h2o2 treatment in different sediments and for the first time the effect of the soc fractions chemical structures and microporosity on the maximum degradation of bap it was found that the ferrous ions in the sediments were not the key factor affecting the maximum degradation of bap the usoc and aromatic c structures were more easily degraded by h2o2 leading to the release and degradation of sorbed bap in the sediments but the roc and the aliphatic c were hardly degraded by h2o2 protecting the sorbed bap from being degraded by h2o2 this investigation indicated that the bap parent compound desorbed into the aqueous solution were degraded below detection limits the oxidized intermediates in water soluble residues and in extractable residues accounted for 4 07 20 32 and 1 3 15 8 of total bap radioactivity respectively 4 3 30 58 of total bap radioactivity was detected in bound residues and represented either oxidized intermediates covalently bound to soc or parent compounds sequestered in soc the contribution of roc was greater than that of usoc in the degradation kinetics parameters of bap highly hydrophobic bap sorbed in the roc micropores was not readily released and degraded the understanding of the above mechanism will help us to remedy contaminated sediments with bap and other pahs and evaluate their risk bioavailability and fate declaration of interest statement the

18794,a large portion of the toxic effects observed in surface waters cannot be attributed to compounds regularly measured by water authorities hence there is an urgent need for an effect based monitoring strategy that employs bioassays to identify environmental risks the aim of the present study was to perform an effect based nationwide water quality assessment to identify ecotoxicological risks in a wide variety of surface waters at 45 locations silicone rubbers and polar organic chemical integrative samplers were exposed to surface water for 6 weeks alongside the passive samplers an in situ daphnid test was performed subsequent to field exposure accumulated compounds were extracted from the passive samplers after which a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays was exposed to the extracts the bioassay battery was selected such that it could identify the risks posed by a wide range of chemical pollutants and their transformation products while simultaneously allowing for targeted identification of groups of compounds that cause specific effects bioassay responses were compared to effect based trigger values to identify potential ecotoxicological risks at the investigated locations responses were observed in all bioassays and trigger values were exceeded in 9 out of the 21 applied assays allowing for ranking of the investigated locations based on ecotoxicological risks no relationship between land use and the identification of ecotoxicological risks was observed based on the results considerations regarding future improvements of effect based monitoring are given it is concluded that effect based water quality assessment allowed prioritization of sites based on ecotoxicological risks identified the presence of hazardous compounds regardless of being listed as priority substances and meanwhile could prevent costly chemical analysis at sites with low ecotoxicological risks graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutants bioassay battery passive sampling water framework directive water monitoring 1 introduction according to the european union eu water framework directive wfd the european parliament and the council of the european union 2013 chemical water quality is determined by monitoring surface waters for the presence of 45 groups of priority substances however the use of many of these compounds is restricted or banned and as a result concentrations of priority substances in european waters are decreasing altenburger et al 2015 fliedner et al 2016 simultaneously industries have switched to a plethora of alternative compounds which may enter the aquatic environment hence the priority substances list is outdated as the selected compounds are frequently absent nowadays while the compounds present are not listed as priority substances busch et al 2016 schriks et al 2010a schwarzenbach et al 2006 consequently when toxic effects are observed in surface waters these can often not be attributed to compounds measured by water authorities altenburger et al 2015 neale et al 2015 risks of pollutants to freshwater ecosystems are thus caused by mixtures of a myriad of un known unregulated and unmonitored compounds daughton 2005 understanding of these risks requires a paradigm shift that allows for new holistic monitoring methods that do not solely depend on chemical analysis of priority substances but contrastingly consider biological effects first hamers et al 2018 leusch et al 2014 van der oost et al 2017a b therefore there is a need for an effect based monitoring strategy that employs bioassays to identify environmental risk brack et al 2017 wernersson et al 2015 bioassay responses to surface water samples are caused by the combined action of mixtures of all bioavailable un known compounds and their metabolites present thereby overcoming the limitations posed by chemical analysis of a limited number of target compounds brack et al 2017 neale et al 2015 indeed the applicability and reproducibility of a battery of bioassays to identify ecotoxicity in regular water quality monitoring has been shown in recent years blackwell et al 2019 di paolo et al 2016 hamers et al 2018 jia et al 2015 leusch et al 2014 novÃ¡k et al 2018 van der oost et al 2017a the ecotoxicity profiles of the surface water samples that are generated by such a bioassay battery allow for calculation and ranking of a cumulative ecotoxicological risk for the selected locations subsequently at locations where risks are identified it becomes relevant to investigate the drivers of the observed effects the aim of the present study was therefore to identify ecotoxicological risks in an effect based nationwide water quality assessment in a wide variety of surface waters in the netherlands the success of effect monitoring relies largely on the ease of use endpoint specificity and scale of the used bioassays as well as on the ability to interpret the measured responses to ensure sensitivity to a wide range of potential stressors while still providing specific endpoint sensitivity the present study employed a previously successfully implemented bioassay battery including in situ whole organism assays as well as laboratory based whole organism in vivo and mechanism specific in vitro assays van der oost et al 2017a adverse effects in the whole organism assays point to general toxic pressure and represent a high ecological relevance in vitro or small scale in vivo assays that target highly specific molecular initiating events allow for focused identification and subsequent confirmation of groups of toxic compounds brack et al 2016 escher et al 2018 neale et al 2017 the identification of ecotoxicological risks from bioassay battery responses follows from the comparison of bioanalytical signals to previously determined thresholds defined as effect based trigger values ebt that differentiate between acceptable and poor water quality tang et al 2013 recently van der oost et al 2017b and escher et al 2018 derived ebts for a variety of bioassays commonly applied in surface water quality assessment an additional limitation of the present chemical water quality assessment is that grab sampling is commonly used for surface water sample collection yet concentrations of compounds typically vary over time and therefore grab sampling only provides a snapshot of the chemical make up of a water body jones et al 2015 passive sampling can overcome these limitations by exposing a sorbent to the target environment for several weeks to months accumulating compounds from the water over time vrana et al 2005 in this way passive sampling integrates fluctuations in compound concentrations in time and simultaneously enriches surface water samples to an extent that bio analytical detection limits become very low current limitations of passive sampling in water quality assessment are the compound selectivity of the receiving phase and the challenge of precisely determining the sampled volume of water roll and halden 2016 nonetheless the advantages of passive sampling compared to grab sampling outweigh its disadvantages and passive sampling is increasingly applied as a valuable tool in the monitoring of environmental contaminants hence the combination of passive sampling and effect monitoring allows for time integrated and reliable surface water quality assessment that considers effects of all sampled un known compounds regardless of priority lists in the present study silicone rubber sr and polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis passive samplers were applied at 45 surface water locations alongside the passive samplers an in situ daphnid test was performed subsequent to field exposure accumulated compounds were extracted from the passive samplers after which a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays was exposed to the extracts bioassay responses were compared to effect based trigger values to identify potential ecotoxicological risks at the investigated locations finally responses were related to surrounding land use water body morphology and wfd ecological water quality assessment scores 2 material methods 2 1 sampling sites sampling sites were selected in collaboration with 12 dutch waterboards and the dutch national water authority sites were classified based on the major surrounding land use or potential source of pollution when classification of a location was not possible due to the diffuse or variable nature of contamination it was assigned to the category complex this resulted in the classification of 45 surface water locations into six categories fig s1 reference n 5 urban n 7 wastewater treatment plant effluent impacted wwtp n 7 horticulture n 7 mixed agriculture agri mix n 7 and complex n 12 2 2 deployment extraction and estimating sampled volumes of passive samplers 2 2 1 passive sampling devices silicone rubber sr sheets with a weight of 20 g per set of six sheets spiked with performance reference compounds prcs were obtained from deltares utrecht the netherlands and applied for the sampling of nonpolar compounds pocis containing 0 22 g oasis hlb sorbent were obtained from exposmeter tavelsjÃ¶ sweden and applied for the sampling of compounds in the more polar range no sampler pre treatment was required and the samplers were transported to the study sites in their original airtight packaging 2 2 2 field deployment of passive samplers sr sheets and pocis were deployed simultaneously at each sampling location in cages to attach and protect the passive samplers during the exposure period cages were secured to the bottom or to the embankment to avoid loss of samplers and to ensure permanent inundation per location six sr sheets and four pocis were exposed for a period of six wk after exposure the samplers were transported to the laboratory and stored at 20 c until extraction 2 2 3 extraction of silicone rubber sr sheets were cut into small pieces and put in precleaned thimbles of a tecator soxtec avanti 2050 extraction system extractions were performed in 80 ml of a meoh acetonitrile 1 2 v v mixture with boiling stones the extraction program was as follows 120 min boiling at 180 c 30 min rinsing 5 min recovery and 1 min drying cooled extracts were filtered over glass fiber filters and collected in 250 ml glass bottles extraction jars were rinsed twice with 10 ml of extraction mixture extracts were evaporated by turbovap ii zymark at 45 c to approximately 5 ml transferred quantitatively rinsed twice with 5 ml extraction mixture to 15 ml conical tubes evaporated under nitrogen and finally the end volumes were filled up to exactly 10 ml with extraction mixture 2 2 4 extraction of pocis to enable elution the sorbent between the pocis membranes was transferred quantitatively into an empty solid phase extraction spe column with a polyethylene frit columns were dried under vacuum extraction followed by centrifugation 2000 rpm 15 min under nitrogen flow dry spe columns were eluted three times with 3 ml of acetone with 5 min equilibration time between elutions eluates were collected in 10 ml conical tubes and the end volumes were filled up to exactly 10 ml with acetone 2 2 5 estimation of sampled water volumes 2 2 5 1 silicone rubber sr sheets were spiked with prcs with a wide hydrophobicity range biphenyl d10 and polychlorinated biphenyl pcb congeners 1 2 3 10 14 21 30 50 55 78 104 145 and 204 that do not occur in dutch surface waters for prc chemical analysis sr extracts were transferred to petroleum ether by adding 2 ml extract to 40 ml petroleum ether and concentrated with kuderna danish at 80 c the petroleum ether extract was cleaned up with aluminium oxide and silica gel column chromatography the cleaned extract was evaporated to exactly 2 ml and analysed with an agilent 7890 triple quadrupole gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms ms equipped with edwards pump quantification was performed using an external calibration series of 6 concentrations the rate of prc dissipation was used to calculate the exchange rates rs values in l day of the samplers booij and smedes 2010 subsequently 50 of this calculated rs was used as a provisional estimation of the average extracted water volume per day as described by van der oost et al 2017a 2 2 5 2 pocis while standardized protocols for the determination of sampled volume of passive samplers have been described for nonpolar samplers no such consensus has yet been reached for polar passive samplers harman et al 2011 this is partly due to the different nature of polar and nonpolar passive samplers and the processes that hence dictate the uptake of polar compounds in passive samplers harman et al 2012 sampling rates for polar compound uptake in pocis in stagnant to near stagnant water have been reported in the range from 0 001 to 2 46 l day with an average sampling rate of 0 18 l day harman et al 2012 hence to compare bioassay effects between sites in the present study the same estimated average sampled volume of 0 18 l day was applied to determine the concentration factor of all field deployed pocis 2 3 bioassay battery whole organism bioassays and antibiotics waterscan assays were performed at the waterproef laboratory edam the netherlands in vitro calux assays were performed at the biodetection systems laboratories amsterdam the netherlands passive sampling extracts were converted to other solvents before exposure in the bioassays more information on bioassay analytical details and solvent transfer is given in the supplementary information pages s2 5 an overview of the employed bioassays their endpoints and their respective units of effect expression and ebts is given in table 1 2 3 1 daphnia in situ exposure daphnids were exposed to the surface water at 33 of the 45 study sites in glass jars field exposure was carried out during the first or second week of the passive sampler deployment the survival of the in situ exposed daphnids was recorded after 1 wk of exposure an observed mortality of 20 was used as trigger value for potential ecological effects van der oost et al 2017b 2 3 2 whole organism bioassays for the whole organism bioassays sr passive sampler extracts were subjected to three bioassays as these whole organism bioassays have no specific target compound group toxicity is expressed as toxic units tu rather than reference compound equivalents herein one tu represents the dilution at which the extract causes 50 effect for the respective endpoint of the test ec50 2 3 2 1 daphnia 48 h immobilization the daphnia 48 h immobilization assay was performed according to the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd standard 202 oecd environmental health and safety 2004 with reduced test volumes ec50 values volume percentage were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with a log logistic model by the statistical program spss ibm analytics bioassays were considered valid if 90 of the daphnids in the negative controls were mobile at the end of the test 2 3 2 2 algatox the inhibition of algal growth was determined according to oecd standard 201 oecd environmental health and safety 2006 with reduced test volumes based on peterson et al 2005 after 72 h exponential algal growth curves were determined to assess the percentage of growth inhibition compared to controls algal growth rate in the controls was required to reach 0 92 d according to the oecd standard the ec50 values were calculated using sigmoidal dose response curves with variable slopes 2 3 2 3 microtox the microtox test was performed by exposing the bioluminescent marine bacterium aliivibrio fischeri to a dilution range of the passive sampler extracts toxicity was determined by quantifying inhibition of the luminescence produced by a fischeri exposed to the extracts after 5 15 and 30 min of exposure microtox omni software version 1 18 was used for determination of the tu values 2 3 3 calux assays passive sampler extracts were analysed by a panel of in vitro calux bioassays specific calux assays were performed on either polar or non polar extracts as suggested by van der oost et al 2017a sr extracts were subjected to dr pah pparÎ³ nrf2 pxr and p53 with and without s9 metabolism assays and pocis extracts were subjected to erÎ± anti ar and gr assays according to previously described protocols hamers et al 2006 murk et al 1996 sonneveld et al 2004 van der linden et al 2008 the dr calux assay was performed without a sulfuric acid clean up step to eliminate pahs and isolate the dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls to rule out confounding influences cells were also monitored for cytotoxicity which resulted in additional data for cytotoxicity caused by both polar and non polar passive sampler extracts the effects of the extracts were expressed as bioanalytical equivalents beqs of the reference compounds table 1 2 3 4 antibiotics activity assay activities of 5 classes of antibiotics in the pocis extracts were determined with the waterscan assay obtained from rikilt wageningen the netherlands the test system comprised 5 plates details outlined in pikkemaat et al 2008 tetracyclines t quinolones q Î² lactams and macrolides b m sulphonamides s and aminoglycosides a after incubation of the test plates antibiotic activities were estimated and expressed as beq concentrations of the reference compounds table 1 2 4 data analysis bioassay effects were expressed as beq l by using the estimated sampled water volumes of the respective passive samplers to determine the concentration factor of the used extracts subsequently bioassay effects were compared to previously defined ebts ebts from escher et al 2018 were utilized when available and when the used reference compounds matched those applied in the current study this was the case for the pah anti ar and er calux assays for all other applied bioassays ebts from van der oost et al 2017b were used table 1 average numbers of ebt exceedances per land use category were tested for equality of variances using a f test and subsequently differences between land use were tested for significance using a two sample t test assuming equal variances Î± 0 05 statistical analyses were performed in excel for mac version 16 microsoft multivariate analysis was applied to gain insight in the relationship between the surrounding land use water type and ecological water quality and the bioanalytical responses only the tests that showed a response above the respective ebt were included the total bioanalytical dataset consisted of 9 responding bioassays and 45 locations alongside this response matrix two location variables were included in the multivariate analysis a measure of ecological quality expressed as wfd ecological quality assessment scores for macrofauna eqr mafa obtained from the dutch waterboards and the water type of the locations expressed as ditch pond or lake for lentic waters and stream channel or river for lotic waters missing values in the dataset were substituted with the average response value for each bioassay to minimise their effect on multivariate analysis outcome bioassay responses were transformed to a logarithmic scale and the resulting dataset was ordinated by redundancy analyses rda in canoco 4 2 for windows ter braak 1990 1988 the data analyses are fully described by verdonschot and ter braak 1994 an unrestricted permutation test was used to test the validity of the total ordination as described by ter braak 1990 and verdonschot and ter braak 1994 3 results 3 1 bioassay battery responses to passive sampler extracts passive samplers for polar and non polar compounds were successfully exposed at 45 surface water locations during extraction pocis extracts were lost for three sampling locations resulting in an incomplete dataset for these locations therefore these locations were excluded from the comparison of ebt exceedances per location all bioassays met their respective validity criteria responses were observed in all 21 bioassays but for each bioassay there were clear differences in the strength of the responses between the locations a representative example of the 21 bioassays is given in fig 1 which depicts the estrogen receptor er calux responses to the pocis extracts er responses were observed at all but one location with only a non detect at one of the reference locations the intensity of the response was highly variable for the different locations per land use with the highest response at one of the urban locations on average the highest responses were observed at urban 0 40 ng eeq l complex 0 38 eeq l and wwtp 0 36 eeq l locations while the lowest responses were observed at the reference locations 0 13 eeq l this is also reflected by the percentage of ebt exceedances per land use category where ebt exceedance for the er calux assay was observed at the majority of urban 71 complex 89 and wwtp 86 locations while the ebt was exceeded at 40 of the reference locations responses in the other 20 bioassays are listed in table s1 this information was subsequently used to calculate the number of ebt exceedances per location 3 2 effect based trigger value exceedances per location all locations caused the exceedance of at least one ebt in the bioassay battery the sum of ebt exceedances per location and the resulting average number of ebt exceedances per land use category are depicted in fig 2 the variation between locations within a land use category was largest for horticultural locations while urban locations showed the most consistent number of responses above the ebt per location the lowest average number of ebt exceedances was observed at reference locations 2 and the highest number of ebt exceedances were observed at urban 3 wwtp 3 9 complex 3 4 and horticulture 3 4 locations including one location with seven ebt exceedances in the latter however only at wwtp locations the average number of ebt exceedances was significantly higher than at the reference p 0 01 and mixed agriculture p 0 05 locations the sum of ebt exceedances per site allowed for the ranking of sites based on ecotoxicological risk where the sites with the highest number of ebt exceedances are assumed to be at the highest risk of surface water pollution table s1 ebt exceedances were observed for 9 out of the 21 applied bioassays for the in situ daphnia test and for 8 in vitro calux assays performed with both non polar and polar extracts 3 3 ecotoxicological risk identification next a heat map was constructed that visualizes the percentage of the investigated locations with ebt exceedance per land use category fig 3 interestingly the ebt for the pah calux assay was exceeded at all the investigated locations and hence this assay did not allow for differentiation in ecotoxicological effect identification between locations or land uses reference locations showed the lowest percentage of ebt exceedances however ecotoxicological risk was not completely absent with responses in pah nrf2 pxr and er calux tests at urban locations ecotoxicological risks were driven most strongly by pxr er and anti ar activity at wwtp locations the most profound contribution to ecotoxicological risks was caused by pxr and er activity a less frequent but nonetheless substantial contribution to ecotoxicological risks was observed for nrf2 and anti ar activity similarly for horticultural locations ecotoxicological risks were most frequently caused by pxr and er with a contribution of er and anti ar activity however risk indication was also frequently observed in the daphnia in situ test and polar extracts from horticultural locations were the only samples to cause cytotoxicity above the ebt for mixed agricultural locations risks were most frequently caused by er activity with less frequent contributions of pxr and anti ar notably mixed agricultural locations were the only ones to cause ebt exceeding pparÎ³ activity complex locations also showed ebt exceedances most frequently for pxr and er with less frequent exceedances for anti ar activity and the daphnia in situ test dr activity above the ebt was observed only at wwtp and complex locations 3 4 response frequency per bioassay responses of all bioassays were summarized to gain insight into which assays responded most frequently to the passive sampler extracts and were hence the main determinants of the detection of ecotoxicological risks fig 4 bioassay signals were categorized as no response or a response below or above the ebt of that test the frequency of effect detection in the bioassays ranged from largely no response 96 of locations for the algatox assay to responses above the ebt at all locations for the pah calux assay the pah pxr nrf2 and dr calux assays showed a response at all locations however with a varying frequency of responses above the ebt with the most striking result for the pah calux assay for which the ebt was exceeded at all the investigated locations nine out of the battery of 21 bioassays showed responses above the ebt figs 3 and 4 the other 12 assays gave no response above their ebt out of these nine showed no bioanalytical response at all at more than 50 of the investigated locations these were the gr calux and the five antibiotics assays which were exposed to the polar passive sampler extracts and the whole organism daphniatox and algatox and the in vitro p53 calux assay with s9 metabolism exposed to the non polar extracts 3 5 multivariate analysis the ordination result of the rda with land use as explaining variable is presented as a correlation biplot of bioassay responses land use and environmental quality scores fig s1 the rda revealed no significant variables in the dataset hence land use water type and the ecological quality score did not explain the variation observed in the bioassay battery responses 4 discussion 4 1 effect based identification of ecotoxicological risks in the present study an effect based nationwide water quality assessment to identify ecotoxicological risks was performed effects were observed in all bioassays and ebt exceedances were observed for 9 out of the 21 bioassays the sum of ebt exceedances per site allowed for the ranking of sites based on ecotoxicological risk rather than on the presence of a limited number of target compounds hamers et al 2018 which can be considered as a proof of principle of effect based water quality assessment subsequently at locations where risks were identified it becomes relevant to investigate the drivers of the observed effects the bioassays that showed responses above ebts in the present study and hence allowed the identification of ecotoxicological risks were the dr pah pparÎ³ nrf2 and pxr calux assays for non polar extracts the er anti ar and cytotoxicity calux assays for polar extracts and the in situ daphnia assay this is partly in line with previous findings by escher et al 2014 and van der oost et al 2017a that identified high responses of in vitro assays for amongst others pah nrf2 pxr and er and anti ar activity in surface water following from the observed calux responses in the present study risks were caused by both polar and non polar organic extracts several of these tests indicated risks at the majority of the studied locations most notably the pah calux which indicated ecotoxicological risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah at all sites this can in part be explained by the atmospheric origin of pah loading to aquatic systems causing the presence of pahs even at locations with very limited anthropogenic pollution manoli and samara 1999 interestingly however this was not the case for dioxins which also partly find their way to the aquatic environment through atmospheric deposition kulkarni et al 2008 in the present study risk of dioxins was only observed for wwtp and complex locations and infrequently at both as for both groups of compounds the ultimate environmental sink is the sediment which was not examined in the present study this difference may be explained by the current emissions which in europe are more strongly regulated for dioxins and more common for pahs kulkarni et al 2008 manoli and samara 1999 the pah and dr calux assays both target aryl hydrocarbon receptor binding yet after different exposure times 4 vs 24 h respectively which affects the in vitro metabolization of pahs pieterse et al 2013 since in the present study water extracts subjected to the dr calux assay were not treated with a sulfuric acid clean up step to eliminate pahs and isolate the dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls responses in the dr calux assay may be caused by stable pahs that were not metabolized during the 24 h exposure thus had the extracts been cleaned up with sulfuric acid the three samples that showed ebt exceedance in the dr assay may well have lost their activity due to destruction of stable pahs this strengthens the observation that ecotoxicological risks in the investigated surface waters are much more common for pahs than for dioxins besides the ubiquity of pahs in surface waters the detection of ecotoxicological risk also depends on the ebt value used for this specific test in the case of the pah calux assay this ebt value was obtained from the study by escher et al 2018 in which ebts were derived by read across from existing eu wfd environmental quality standards eqs this resulted in an ebt value of 6 21 ng benzo a pyrene equivalents beq per litre which is substantially lower than the ebt of 150 ng beq l derived by van der oost et al 2017b had we applied the latter the resulting detection of ecotoxicological risk caused by toxic pah concentrations in surface water would have been markedly less dramatic and would have resulted in an ebt exceedance at only a single location however the study by escher et al 2018 based their ebt on existing eqs values about which a european wide consensus exists and which reliably indicates ecotoxicological risks to aquatic communities hence the dramatic ebt exceedance observed here may identify a serious risk posed by pahs in the majority of waterbodies even at locations with very few other anthropogenic pollution sources nonetheless the profound influence of the value of the ebt for each bioassay on the detection of ecotoxicological risks should not be underestimated this underlines the need for a standard procedure and consensus on ebt derivation and values for the successful application of effect based monitoring strategies in water quality assessment 4 2 identification of location and land use specific ecotoxicological risks although several unique responses for the different land use and bioassay combinations were observed no land use specific responses or patterns became apparent and only small differences in ebt exceedances between land use types were found this observation was corroborated by the outcome of the multivariate analysis which revealed no significant effect of land use on the bioassay battery responses the selected locations appear to suffer from the presence of complex mixtures of micropollutants frequently caused by the same drivers hence to identify pollution source specific drivers of ecotoxicological risks in future research locations should be selected that better represent a single pollution source and that are more morphologically and biogeochemically similar to exclude confounding effects yet at the same time these findings also confirm the complex nature of surface water pollution in large river deltas this raises the question if categorizing sites into land use types is appropriate at all and if alternatively sampling sites may better be considered independent stochastic draws of diffuse pollution covering the industrialized world when applying that paradigm in the present study several discriminating bioassays allowed for the identification of locations at risk from chemical stressors and for the ranking and subsequent prioritization of the locations that were at the highest risk from micropollutants 4 3 considerations for improved effect based monitoring ebt exceedances were observed for 9 out of the applied 21 bioassays indicating that 12 bioassays were less effective in elucidating ecotoxicological risks at the studied locations the bioassays that were not discriminating for ecotoxicological risks were the in vivo whole organism bioassays the antibiotics assays and the p53 with and without s9 metabolism gr and cytotoxicity for non polar compounds calux assays 4 3 1 p53 and cytotoxicity calux assays the p53 and cytotoxicity calux assays indicate risks at a high organisational level caused by all compounds in a water sample escher et al 2018 van der linden et al 2014 van der oost et al 2017b hence signals above the ebt in these assays would imply far stretching ecological effects in the field maltby 1999 therefore although these tests did not respond frequently or severely to surface water passive sampler extracts in the present study the inclusion of such tests in future bioassay batteries is recommended given their ecological relevance yet the inclusion of s9 metabolism in the p53 test can be debated the s9 metabolism in this assay can elucidate the enzymatic activation of mutagenicity in the sample however given the time integrative nature of passive sampling six weeks in the present study metabolism and activation of more toxic or persistent metabolites is expected to occur in the field rather than in the laboratory and the added value of in vitro metabolization is negligible this was also illustrated by the much lower p53 test response after s9 metabolism in the present study hence the p53 assay without s9 metabolism should be sufficient to assess mutagenicity of surface water samples in monitoring strategies that apply passive sampling techniques 4 3 2 whole organism bioassays for the whole organism bioassays it can be argued that more sensitive alternatives should be developed and applied for example the algatox assay showed no response to surface water extracts from approximately 95 of the locations in the present study this is unexpected as herbicides that are the major target compound group of this bioassay are the most frequently detected pesticide group in european surface waters booij et al 2015 schreiner et al 2016 recent work has shown that fluorescence based algal bioassays are efficient and effective in the assessment of toxicity to primary producers in regionwide screening efforts de baat et al 2018 novÃ¡k et al 2018 sjollema et al 2014 hence in the future replacement of the algatox assay with fluorescence based algal bioassays may result in more effective assessment of risks to primary producers in effect based monitoring finally the applicability of the in situ daphnia assay in micropollutant effect monitoring should be questioned although it was responsive and discriminating in the present and previous studies van der oost et al 2017a it is nearly impossible to determine the contribution of micropollutants to the observed mortality exposure of daphnids in the field for seven days gives rise to a multitude of confounding factors including oxygen dynamics food availability ph salinity and temperature and unless the effects of these on daphnid mortality can be fully excluded the outcome of the test cannot be considered indicative of micropollutant risk in surface water nonetheless the added value of in situ or active biomonitoring approaches in water quality assessment strategies should not be underestimated as they represent the most realistic exposure scenario available in the effect based toolbox recently promising strategies to differentiate between the effects of chemical exposure and confounding factors in active biomonitoring with invertebrates were described e g brettschneider et al 2019 4 3 3 antibiotics and gr calux assays the antibiotics and gr calux assays target specific groups of compounds and their inclusion in bioassay batteries is only justified when there is an assumable occurrence and risk of these groups of compounds glucocorticoids mainly find their way into surface waters through industrial and hospital effluents glucocorticoid concentrations in such effluents are high but decrease substantially after wastewater treatment schriks et al 2010b van der linden et al 2008 hence application of the gr calux assay in surface water monitoring is only marginally relevant as the risk of glucocorticoids in surface waters is expected to be negligible therefore this test can be omitted in future bioassay batteries to save costs or be replaced with a more relevant endpoint to surface water toxicity like the anti pr calux assay for which a recently defined ebt value is available escher et al 2018 contrasting to glucocorticoids antibiotics are ubiquitous in nw european surface waters they reach surface waters through diffuse input from the general public and the agri food sector giving rise to surface water concentrations that are expected to cause risks to bacteria fungi and microalgae hernando et al 2006 kÃ¼mmerer 2009 zhou et al 2019 hence risks of antibiotics in the here tested surface waters are assumable and the lack of effects above the ebt for the antibiotics assays in the present study is therefore unexpected given the low responsiveness of the here applied waterscan antibiotics assay pikkemaat et al 2008 and the ubiquity of antibiotics in surface waters there is evidently a need for a more sensitive detection method for antibiotics residues a potentially suitable alternative is the use of whole cell based biosensors in which similar to calux assays receptor binding mediated bioluminescence detects antibiotics activity at a sublethal level virolainen and karp 2014 however this method is yet to be applied as bioanalytical tool in surface water antibiotics screening 4 3 4 sediments and metals as of yet successful effect based monitoring efforts have been focused mainly on pollution of surface waters by organic compounds altenburger et al 2019 hamers et al 2018 van der oost et al 2017b while relatively little attention has been given to the inclusion of sediments as a relevant source of impaired ecological surface water quality sediments are the largest chemical repositories on earth where harmful compounds accumulate thereby representing a significant threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems burton 2013 despite their relevant role in aquatic ecosystem health sediments are often overlooked and understudied in regular water quality assessment strategies like the wfd borja et al 2004 metal pollution is another relevant source of impaired ecological surface water quality that is currently largely overlooked in effect based monitoring efforts metal pollution can have severe detrimental effects on water quality owing to its toxicity frequency and abundance armitage et al 2007 sin et al 2001 only very rarely have the effects of metal pollution on aquatic ecosystems been studied using a combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical tools roig et al 2011 given the relevance of these pollution sources to aquatic ecosystem health the development of integrative strategies that include the effect based assessment of metal pollution as well as sediment quality would be a valuable addition to future research efforts 4 4 conclusions scientists and water authorities together are faced with the challenge of the increasing complexity of pollution in surface waters and how to make the impact of this pollution on aquatic ecosystems measurable traditional chemical target analysis of a limited selection of pollutants has lost its relevance fortunately the current availability and future development of a wide variety of alternative tools in the form of effect based methods allows for a holistic interpretation of the harmful effects of all chemicals present in surface waters without individual identification of the causing compounds it is likely that the debate on the most efficient and effective combination of effect based tools in bioassay batteries a conclusive approach to ebt derivation as well as the regionwide implementation of the resulting monitoring strategies will be ongoing for some time to come yet at present there is no practical limitation to the application of effect based water quality assessment methods in regular water quality monitoring at a region or

18794,a large portion of the toxic effects observed in surface waters cannot be attributed to compounds regularly measured by water authorities hence there is an urgent need for an effect based monitoring strategy that employs bioassays to identify environmental risks the aim of the present study was to perform an effect based nationwide water quality assessment to identify ecotoxicological risks in a wide variety of surface waters at 45 locations silicone rubbers and polar organic chemical integrative samplers were exposed to surface water for 6 weeks alongside the passive samplers an in situ daphnid test was performed subsequent to field exposure accumulated compounds were extracted from the passive samplers after which a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays was exposed to the extracts the bioassay battery was selected such that it could identify the risks posed by a wide range of chemical pollutants and their transformation products while simultaneously allowing for targeted identification of groups of compounds that cause specific effects bioassay responses were compared to effect based trigger values to identify potential ecotoxicological risks at the investigated locations responses were observed in all bioassays and trigger values were exceeded in 9 out of the 21 applied assays allowing for ranking of the investigated locations based on ecotoxicological risks no relationship between land use and the identification of ecotoxicological risks was observed based on the results considerations regarding future improvements of effect based monitoring are given it is concluded that effect based water quality assessment allowed prioritization of sites based on ecotoxicological risks identified the presence of hazardous compounds regardless of being listed as priority substances and meanwhile could prevent costly chemical analysis at sites with low ecotoxicological risks graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutants bioassay battery passive sampling water framework directive water monitoring 1 introduction according to the european union eu water framework directive wfd the european parliament and the council of the european union 2013 chemical water quality is determined by monitoring surface waters for the presence of 45 groups of priority substances however the use of many of these compounds is restricted or banned and as a result concentrations of priority substances in european waters are decreasing altenburger et al 2015 fliedner et al 2016 simultaneously industries have switched to a plethora of alternative compounds which may enter the aquatic environment hence the priority substances list is outdated as the selected compounds are frequently absent nowadays while the compounds present are not listed as priority substances busch et al 2016 schriks et al 2010a schwarzenbach et al 2006 consequently when toxic effects are observed in surface waters these can often not be attributed to compounds measured by water authorities altenburger et al 2015 neale et al 2015 risks of pollutants to freshwater ecosystems are thus caused by mixtures of a myriad of un known unregulated and unmonitored compounds daughton 2005 understanding of these risks requires a paradigm shift that allows for new holistic monitoring methods that do not solely depend on chemical analysis of priority substances but contrastingly consider biological effects first hamers et al 2018 leusch et al 2014 van der oost et al 2017a b therefore there is a need for an effect based monitoring strategy that employs bioassays to identify environmental risk brack et al 2017 wernersson et al 2015 bioassay responses to surface water samples are caused by the combined action of mixtures of all bioavailable un known compounds and their metabolites present thereby overcoming the limitations posed by chemical analysis of a limited number of target compounds brack et al 2017 neale et al 2015 indeed the applicability and reproducibility of a battery of bioassays to identify ecotoxicity in regular water quality monitoring has been shown in recent years blackwell et al 2019 di paolo et al 2016 hamers et al 2018 jia et al 2015 leusch et al 2014 novÃ¡k et al 2018 van der oost et al 2017a the ecotoxicity profiles of the surface water samples that are generated by such a bioassay battery allow for calculation and ranking of a cumulative ecotoxicological risk for the selected locations subsequently at locations where risks are identified it becomes relevant to investigate the drivers of the observed effects the aim of the present study was therefore to identify ecotoxicological risks in an effect based nationwide water quality assessment in a wide variety of surface waters in the netherlands the success of effect monitoring relies largely on the ease of use endpoint specificity and scale of the used bioassays as well as on the ability to interpret the measured responses to ensure sensitivity to a wide range of potential stressors while still providing specific endpoint sensitivity the present study employed a previously successfully implemented bioassay battery including in situ whole organism assays as well as laboratory based whole organism in vivo and mechanism specific in vitro assays van der oost et al 2017a adverse effects in the whole organism assays point to general toxic pressure and represent a high ecological relevance in vitro or small scale in vivo assays that target highly specific molecular initiating events allow for focused identification and subsequent confirmation of groups of toxic compounds brack et al 2016 escher et al 2018 neale et al 2017 the identification of ecotoxicological risks from bioassay battery responses follows from the comparison of bioanalytical signals to previously determined thresholds defined as effect based trigger values ebt that differentiate between acceptable and poor water quality tang et al 2013 recently van der oost et al 2017b and escher et al 2018 derived ebts for a variety of bioassays commonly applied in surface water quality assessment an additional limitation of the present chemical water quality assessment is that grab sampling is commonly used for surface water sample collection yet concentrations of compounds typically vary over time and therefore grab sampling only provides a snapshot of the chemical make up of a water body jones et al 2015 passive sampling can overcome these limitations by exposing a sorbent to the target environment for several weeks to months accumulating compounds from the water over time vrana et al 2005 in this way passive sampling integrates fluctuations in compound concentrations in time and simultaneously enriches surface water samples to an extent that bio analytical detection limits become very low current limitations of passive sampling in water quality assessment are the compound selectivity of the receiving phase and the challenge of precisely determining the sampled volume of water roll and halden 2016 nonetheless the advantages of passive sampling compared to grab sampling outweigh its disadvantages and passive sampling is increasingly applied as a valuable tool in the monitoring of environmental contaminants hence the combination of passive sampling and effect monitoring allows for time integrated and reliable surface water quality assessment that considers effects of all sampled un known compounds regardless of priority lists in the present study silicone rubber sr and polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis passive samplers were applied at 45 surface water locations alongside the passive samplers an in situ daphnid test was performed subsequent to field exposure accumulated compounds were extracted from the passive samplers after which a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays was exposed to the extracts bioassay responses were compared to effect based trigger values to identify potential ecotoxicological risks at the investigated locations finally responses were related to surrounding land use water body morphology and wfd ecological water quality assessment scores 2 material methods 2 1 sampling sites sampling sites were selected in collaboration with 12 dutch waterboards and the dutch national water authority sites were classified based on the major surrounding land use or potential source of pollution when classification of a location was not possible due to the diffuse or variable nature of contamination it was assigned to the category complex this resulted in the classification of 45 surface water locations into six categories fig s1 reference n 5 urban n 7 wastewater treatment plant effluent impacted wwtp n 7 horticulture n 7 mixed agriculture agri mix n 7 and complex n 12 2 2 deployment extraction and estimating sampled volumes of passive samplers 2 2 1 passive sampling devices silicone rubber sr sheets with a weight of 20 g per set of six sheets spiked with performance reference compounds prcs were obtained from deltares utrecht the netherlands and applied for the sampling of nonpolar compounds pocis containing 0 22 g oasis hlb sorbent were obtained from exposmeter tavelsjÃ¶ sweden and applied for the sampling of compounds in the more polar range no sampler pre treatment was required and the samplers were transported to the study sites in their original airtight packaging 2 2 2 field deployment of passive samplers sr sheets and pocis were deployed simultaneously at each sampling location in cages to attach and protect the passive samplers during the exposure period cages were secured to the bottom or to the embankment to avoid loss of samplers and to ensure permanent inundation per location six sr sheets and four pocis were exposed for a period of six wk after exposure the samplers were transported to the laboratory and stored at 20 c until extraction 2 2 3 extraction of silicone rubber sr sheets were cut into small pieces and put in precleaned thimbles of a tecator soxtec avanti 2050 extraction system extractions were performed in 80 ml of a meoh acetonitrile 1 2 v v mixture with boiling stones the extraction program was as follows 120 min boiling at 180 c 30 min rinsing 5 min recovery and 1 min drying cooled extracts were filtered over glass fiber filters and collected in 250 ml glass bottles extraction jars were rinsed twice with 10 ml of extraction mixture extracts were evaporated by turbovap ii zymark at 45 c to approximately 5 ml transferred quantitatively rinsed twice with 5 ml extraction mixture to 15 ml conical tubes evaporated under nitrogen and finally the end volumes were filled up to exactly 10 ml with extraction mixture 2 2 4 extraction of pocis to enable elution the sorbent between the pocis membranes was transferred quantitatively into an empty solid phase extraction spe column with a polyethylene frit columns were dried under vacuum extraction followed by centrifugation 2000 rpm 15 min under nitrogen flow dry spe columns were eluted three times with 3 ml of acetone with 5 min equilibration time between elutions eluates were collected in 10 ml conical tubes and the end volumes were filled up to exactly 10 ml with acetone 2 2 5 estimation of sampled water volumes 2 2 5 1 silicone rubber sr sheets were spiked with prcs with a wide hydrophobicity range biphenyl d10 and polychlorinated biphenyl pcb congeners 1 2 3 10 14 21 30 50 55 78 104 145 and 204 that do not occur in dutch surface waters for prc chemical analysis sr extracts were transferred to petroleum ether by adding 2 ml extract to 40 ml petroleum ether and concentrated with kuderna danish at 80 c the petroleum ether extract was cleaned up with aluminium oxide and silica gel column chromatography the cleaned extract was evaporated to exactly 2 ml and analysed with an agilent 7890 triple quadrupole gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms ms equipped with edwards pump quantification was performed using an external calibration series of 6 concentrations the rate of prc dissipation was used to calculate the exchange rates rs values in l day of the samplers booij and smedes 2010 subsequently 50 of this calculated rs was used as a provisional estimation of the average extracted water volume per day as described by van der oost et al 2017a 2 2 5 2 pocis while standardized protocols for the determination of sampled volume of passive samplers have been described for nonpolar samplers no such consensus has yet been reached for polar passive samplers harman et al 2011 this is partly due to the different nature of polar and nonpolar passive samplers and the processes that hence dictate the uptake of polar compounds in passive samplers harman et al 2012 sampling rates for polar compound uptake in pocis in stagnant to near stagnant water have been reported in the range from 0 001 to 2 46 l day with an average sampling rate of 0 18 l day harman et al 2012 hence to compare bioassay effects between sites in the present study the same estimated average sampled volume of 0 18 l day was applied to determine the concentration factor of all field deployed pocis 2 3 bioassay battery whole organism bioassays and antibiotics waterscan assays were performed at the waterproef laboratory edam the netherlands in vitro calux assays were performed at the biodetection systems laboratories amsterdam the netherlands passive sampling extracts were converted to other solvents before exposure in the bioassays more information on bioassay analytical details and solvent transfer is given in the supplementary information pages s2 5 an overview of the employed bioassays their endpoints and their respective units of effect expression and ebts is given in table 1 2 3 1 daphnia in situ exposure daphnids were exposed to the surface water at 33 of the 45 study sites in glass jars field exposure was carried out during the first or second week of the passive sampler deployment the survival of the in situ exposed daphnids was recorded after 1 wk of exposure an observed mortality of 20 was used as trigger value for potential ecological effects van der oost et al 2017b 2 3 2 whole organism bioassays for the whole organism bioassays sr passive sampler extracts were subjected to three bioassays as these whole organism bioassays have no specific target compound group toxicity is expressed as toxic units tu rather than reference compound equivalents herein one tu represents the dilution at which the extract causes 50 effect for the respective endpoint of the test ec50 2 3 2 1 daphnia 48 h immobilization the daphnia 48 h immobilization assay was performed according to the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd standard 202 oecd environmental health and safety 2004 with reduced test volumes ec50 values volume percentage were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with a log logistic model by the statistical program spss ibm analytics bioassays were considered valid if 90 of the daphnids in the negative controls were mobile at the end of the test 2 3 2 2 algatox the inhibition of algal growth was determined according to oecd standard 201 oecd environmental health and safety 2006 with reduced test volumes based on peterson et al 2005 after 72 h exponential algal growth curves were determined to assess the percentage of growth inhibition compared to controls algal growth rate in the controls was required to reach 0 92 d according to the oecd standard the ec50 values were calculated using sigmoidal dose response curves with variable slopes 2 3 2 3 microtox the microtox test was performed by exposing the bioluminescent marine bacterium aliivibrio fischeri to a dilution range of the passive sampler extracts toxicity was determined by quantifying inhibition of the luminescence produced by a fischeri exposed to the extracts after 5 15 and 30 min of exposure microtox omni software version 1 18 was used for determination of the tu values 2 3 3 calux assays passive sampler extracts were analysed by a panel of in vitro calux bioassays specific calux assays were performed on either polar or non polar extracts as suggested by van der oost et al 2017a sr extracts were subjected to dr pah pparÎ³ nrf2 pxr and p53 with and without s9 metabolism assays and pocis extracts were subjected to erÎ± anti ar and gr assays according to previously described protocols hamers et al 2006 murk et al 1996 sonneveld et al 2004 van der linden et al 2008 the dr calux assay was performed without a sulfuric acid clean up step to eliminate pahs and isolate the dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls to rule out confounding influences cells were also monitored for cytotoxicity which resulted in additional data for cytotoxicity caused by both polar and non polar passive sampler extracts the effects of the extracts were expressed as bioanalytical equivalents beqs of the reference compounds table 1 2 3 4 antibiotics activity assay activities of 5 classes of antibiotics in the pocis extracts were determined with the waterscan assay obtained from rikilt wageningen the netherlands the test system comprised 5 plates details outlined in pikkemaat et al 2008 tetracyclines t quinolones q Î² lactams and macrolides b m sulphonamides s and aminoglycosides a after incubation of the test plates antibiotic activities were estimated and expressed as beq concentrations of the reference compounds table 1 2 4 data analysis bioassay effects were expressed as beq l by using the estimated sampled water volumes of the respective passive samplers to determine the concentration factor of the used extracts subsequently bioassay effects were compared to previously defined ebts ebts from escher et al 2018 were utilized when available and when the used reference compounds matched those applied in the current study this was the case for the pah anti ar and er calux assays for all other applied bioassays ebts from van der oost et al 2017b were used table 1 average numbers of ebt exceedances per land use category were tested for equality of variances using a f test and subsequently differences between land use were tested for significance using a two sample t test assuming equal variances Î± 0 05 statistical analyses were performed in excel for mac version 16 microsoft multivariate analysis was applied to gain insight in the relationship between the surrounding land use water type and ecological water quality and the bioanalytical responses only the tests that showed a response above the respective ebt were included the total bioanalytical dataset consisted of 9 responding bioassays and 45 locations alongside this response matrix two location variables were included in the multivariate analysis a measure of ecological quality expressed as wfd ecological quality assessment scores for macrofauna eqr mafa obtained from the dutch waterboards and the water type of the locations expressed as ditch pond or lake for lentic waters and stream channel or river for lotic waters missing values in the dataset were substituted with the average response value for each bioassay to minimise their effect on multivariate analysis outcome bioassay responses were transformed to a logarithmic scale and the resulting dataset was ordinated by redundancy analyses rda in canoco 4 2 for windows ter braak 1990 1988 the data analyses are fully described by verdonschot and ter braak 1994 an unrestricted permutation test was used to test the validity of the total ordination as described by ter braak 1990 and verdonschot and ter braak 1994 3 results 3 1 bioassay battery responses to passive sampler extracts passive samplers for polar and non polar compounds were successfully exposed at 45 surface water locations during extraction pocis extracts were lost for three sampling locations resulting in an incomplete dataset for these locations therefore these locations were excluded from the comparison of ebt exceedances per location all bioassays met their respective validity criteria responses were observed in all 21 bioassays but for each bioassay there were clear differences in the strength of the responses between the locations a representative example of the 21 bioassays is given in fig 1 which depicts the estrogen receptor er calux responses to the pocis extracts er responses were observed at all but one location with only a non detect at one of the reference locations the intensity of the response was highly variable for the different locations per land use with the highest response at one of the urban locations on average the highest responses were observed at urban 0 40 ng eeq l complex 0 38 eeq l and wwtp 0 36 eeq l locations while the lowest responses were observed at the reference locations 0 13 eeq l this is also reflected by the percentage of ebt exceedances per land use category where ebt exceedance for the er calux assay was observed at the majority of urban 71 complex 89 and wwtp 86 locations while the ebt was exceeded at 40 of the reference locations responses in the other 20 bioassays are listed in table s1 this information was subsequently used to calculate the number of ebt exceedances per location 3 2 effect based trigger value exceedances per location all locations caused the exceedance of at least one ebt in the bioassay battery the sum of ebt exceedances per location and the resulting average number of ebt exceedances per land use category are depicted in fig 2 the variation between locations within a land use category was largest for horticultural locations while urban locations showed the most consistent number of responses above the ebt per location the lowest average number of ebt exceedances was observed at reference locations 2 and the highest number of ebt exceedances were observed at urban 3 wwtp 3 9 complex 3 4 and horticulture 3 4 locations including one location with seven ebt exceedances in the latter however only at wwtp locations the average number of ebt exceedances was significantly higher than at the reference p 0 01 and mixed agriculture p 0 05 locations the sum of ebt exceedances per site allowed for the ranking of sites based on ecotoxicological risk where the sites with the highest number of ebt exceedances are assumed to be at the highest risk of surface water pollution table s1 ebt exceedances were observed for 9 out of the 21 applied bioassays for the in situ daphnia test and for 8 in vitro calux assays performed with both non polar and polar extracts 3 3 ecotoxicological risk identification next a heat map was constructed that visualizes the percentage of the investigated locations with ebt exceedance per land use category fig 3 interestingly the ebt for the pah calux assay was exceeded at all the investigated locations and hence this assay did not allow for differentiation in ecotoxicological effect identification between locations or land uses reference locations showed the lowest percentage of ebt exceedances however ecotoxicological risk was not completely absent with responses in pah nrf2 pxr and er calux tests at urban locations ecotoxicological risks were driven most strongly by pxr er and anti ar activity at wwtp locations the most profound contribution to ecotoxicological risks was caused by pxr and er activity a less frequent but nonetheless substantial contribution to ecotoxicological risks was observed for nrf2 and anti ar activity similarly for horticultural locations ecotoxicological risks were most frequently caused by pxr and er with a contribution of er and anti ar activity however risk indication was also frequently observed in the daphnia in situ test and polar extracts from horticultural locations were the only samples to cause cytotoxicity above the ebt for mixed agricultural locations risks were most frequently caused by er activity with less frequent contributions of pxr and anti ar notably mixed agricultural locations were the only ones to cause ebt exceeding pparÎ³ activity complex locations also showed ebt exceedances most frequently for pxr and er with less frequent exceedances for anti ar activity and the daphnia in situ test dr activity above the ebt was observed only at wwtp and complex locations 3 4 response frequency per bioassay responses of all bioassays were summarized to gain insight into which assays responded most frequently to the passive sampler extracts and were hence the main determinants of the detection of ecotoxicological risks fig 4 bioassay signals were categorized as no response or a response below or above the ebt of that test the frequency of effect detection in the bioassays ranged from largely no response 96 of locations for the algatox assay to responses above the ebt at all locations for the pah calux assay the pah pxr nrf2 and dr calux assays showed a response at all locations however with a varying frequency of responses above the ebt with the most striking result for the pah calux assay for which the ebt was exceeded at all the investigated locations nine out of the battery of 21 bioassays showed responses above the ebt figs 3 and 4 the other 12 assays gave no response above their ebt out of these nine showed no bioanalytical response at all at more than 50 of the investigated locations these were the gr calux and the five antibiotics assays which were exposed to the polar passive sampler extracts and the whole organism daphniatox and algatox and the in vitro p53 calux assay with s9 metabolism exposed to the non polar extracts 3 5 multivariate analysis the ordination result of the rda with land use as explaining variable is presented as a correlation biplot of bioassay responses land use and environmental quality scores fig s1 the rda revealed no significant variables in the dataset hence land use water type and the ecological quality score did not explain the variation observed in the bioassay battery responses 4 discussion 4 1 effect based identification of ecotoxicological risks in the present study an effect based nationwide water quality assessment to identify ecotoxicological risks was performed effects were observed in all bioassays and ebt exceedances were observed for 9 out of the 21 bioassays the sum of ebt exceedances per site allowed for the ranking of sites based on ecotoxicological risk rather than on the presence of a limited number of target compounds hamers et al 2018 which can be considered as a proof of principle of effect based water quality assessment subsequently at locations where risks were identified it becomes relevant to investigate the drivers of the observed effects the bioassays that showed responses above ebts in the present study and hence allowed the identification of ecotoxicological risks were the dr pah pparÎ³ nrf2 and pxr calux assays for non polar extracts the er anti ar and cytotoxicity calux assays for polar extracts and the in situ daphnia assay this is partly in line with previous findings by escher et al 2014 and van der oost et al 2017a that identified high responses of in vitro assays for amongst others pah nrf2 pxr and er and anti ar activity in surface water following from the observed calux responses in the present study risks were caused by both polar and non polar organic extracts several of these tests indicated risks at the majority of the studied locations most notably the pah calux which indicated ecotoxicological risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah at all sites this can in part be explained by the atmospheric origin of pah loading to aquatic systems causing the presence of pahs even at locations with very limited anthropogenic pollution manoli and samara 1999 interestingly however this was not the case for dioxins which also partly find their way to the aquatic environment through atmospheric deposition kulkarni et al 2008 in the present study risk of dioxins was only observed for wwtp and complex locations and infrequently at both as for both groups of compounds the ultimate environmental sink is the sediment which was not examined in the present study this difference may be explained by the current emissions which in europe are more strongly regulated for dioxins and more common for pahs kulkarni et al 2008 manoli and samara 1999 the pah and dr calux assays both target aryl hydrocarbon receptor binding yet after different exposure times 4 vs 24 h respectively which affects the in vitro metabolization of pahs pieterse et al 2013 since in the present study water extracts subjected to the dr calux assay were not treated with a sulfuric acid clean up step to eliminate pahs and isolate the dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls responses in the dr calux assay may be caused by stable pahs that were not metabolized during the 24 h exposure thus had the extracts been cleaned up with sulfuric acid the three samples that showed ebt exceedance in the dr assay may well have lost their activity due to destruction of stable pahs this strengthens the observation that ecotoxicological risks in the investigated surface waters are much more common for pahs than for dioxins besides the ubiquity of pahs in surface waters the detection of ecotoxicological risk also depends on the ebt value used for this specific test in the case of the pah calux assay this ebt value was obtained from the study by escher et al 2018 in which ebts were derived by read across from existing eu wfd environmental quality standards eqs this resulted in an ebt value of 6 21 ng benzo a pyrene equivalents beq per litre which is substantially lower than the ebt of 150 ng beq l derived by van der oost et al 2017b had we applied the latter the resulting detection of ecotoxicological risk caused by toxic pah concentrations in surface water would have been markedly less dramatic and would have resulted in an ebt exceedance at only a single location however the study by escher et al 2018 based their ebt on existing eqs values about which a european wide consensus exists and which reliably indicates ecotoxicological risks to aquatic communities hence the dramatic ebt exceedance observed here may identify a serious risk posed by pahs in the majority of waterbodies even at locations with very few other anthropogenic pollution sources nonetheless the profound influence of the value of the ebt for each bioassay on the detection of ecotoxicological risks should not be underestimated this underlines the need for a standard procedure and consensus on ebt derivation and values for the successful application of effect based monitoring strategies in water quality assessment 4 2 identification of location and land use specific ecotoxicological risks although several unique responses for the different land use and bioassay combinations were observed no land use specific responses or patterns became apparent and only small differences in ebt exceedances between land use types were found this observation was corroborated by the outcome of the multivariate analysis which revealed no significant effect of land use on the bioassay battery responses the selected locations appear to suffer from the presence of complex mixtures of micropollutants frequently caused by the same drivers hence to identify pollution source specific drivers of ecotoxicological risks in future research locations should be selected that better represent a single pollution source and that are more morphologically and biogeochemically similar to exclude confounding effects yet at the same time these findings also confirm the complex nature of surface water pollution in large river deltas this raises the question if categorizing sites into land use types is appropriate at all and if alternatively sampling sites may better be considered independent stochastic draws of diffuse pollution covering the industrialized world when applying that paradigm in the present study several discriminating bioassays allowed for the identification of locations at risk from chemical stressors and for the ranking and subsequent prioritization of the locations that were at the highest risk from micropollutants 4 3 considerations for improved effect based monitoring ebt exceedances were observed for 9 out of the applied 21 bioassays indicating that 12 bioassays were less effective in elucidating ecotoxicological risks at the studied locations the bioassays that were not discriminating for ecotoxicological risks were the in vivo whole organism bioassays the antibiotics assays and the p53 with and without s9 metabolism gr and cytotoxicity for non polar compounds calux assays 4 3 1 p53 and cytotoxicity calux assays the p53 and cytotoxicity calux assays indicate risks at a high organisational level caused by all compounds in a water sample escher et al 2018 van der linden et al 2014 van der oost et al 2017b hence signals above the ebt in these assays would imply far stretching ecological effects in the field maltby 1999 therefore although these tests did not respond frequently or severely to surface water passive sampler extracts in the present study the inclusion of such tests in future bioassay batteries is recommended given their ecological relevance yet the inclusion of s9 metabolism in the p53 test can be debated the s9 metabolism in this assay can elucidate the enzymatic activation of mutagenicity in the sample however given the time integrative nature of passive sampling six weeks in the present study metabolism and activation of more toxic or persistent metabolites is expected to occur in the field rather than in the laboratory and the added value of in vitro metabolization is negligible this was also illustrated by the much lower p53 test response after s9 metabolism in the present study hence the p53 assay without s9 metabolism should be sufficient to assess mutagenicity of surface water samples in monitoring strategies that apply passive sampling techniques 4 3 2 whole organism bioassays for the whole organism bioassays it can be argued that more sensitive alternatives should be developed and applied for example the algatox assay showed no response to surface water extracts from approximately 95 of the locations in the present study this is unexpected as herbicides that are the major target compound group of this bioassay are the most frequently detected pesticide group in european surface waters booij et al 2015 schreiner et al 2016 recent work has shown that fluorescence based algal bioassays are efficient and effective in the assessment of toxicity to primary producers in regionwide screening efforts de baat et al 2018 novÃ¡k et al 2018 sjollema et al 2014 hence in the future replacement of the algatox assay with fluorescence based algal bioassays may result in more effective assessment of risks to primary producers in effect based monitoring finally the applicability of the in situ daphnia assay in micropollutant effect monitoring should be questioned although it was responsive and discriminating in the present and previous studies van der oost et al 2017a it is nearly impossible to determine the contribution of micropollutants to the observed mortality exposure of daphnids in the field for seven days gives rise to a multitude of confounding factors including oxygen dynamics food availability ph salinity and temperature and unless the effects of these on daphnid mortality can be fully excluded the outcome of the test cannot be considered indicative of micropollutant risk in surface water nonetheless the added value of in situ or active biomonitoring approaches in water quality assessment strategies should not be underestimated as they represent the most realistic exposure scenario available in the effect based toolbox recently promising strategies to differentiate between the effects of chemical exposure and confounding factors in active biomonitoring with invertebrates were described e g brettschneider et al 2019 4 3 3 antibiotics and gr calux assays the antibiotics and gr calux assays target specific groups of compounds and their inclusion in bioassay batteries is only justified when there is an assumable occurrence and risk of these groups of compounds glucocorticoids mainly find their way into surface waters through industrial and hospital effluents glucocorticoid concentrations in such effluents are high but decrease substantially after wastewater treatment schriks et al 2010b van der linden et al 2008 hence application of the gr calux assay in surface water monitoring is only marginally relevant as the risk of glucocorticoids in surface waters is expected to be negligible therefore this test can be omitted in future bioassay batteries to save costs or be replaced with a more relevant endpoint to surface water toxicity like the anti pr calux assay for which a recently defined ebt value is available escher et al 2018 contrasting to glucocorticoids antibiotics are ubiquitous in nw european surface waters they reach surface waters through diffuse input from the general public and the agri food sector giving rise to surface water concentrations that are expected to cause risks to bacteria fungi and microalgae hernando et al 2006 kÃ¼mmerer 2009 zhou et al 2019 hence risks of antibiotics in the here tested surface waters are assumable and the lack of effects above the ebt for the antibiotics assays in the present study is therefore unexpected given the low responsiveness of the here applied waterscan antibiotics assay pikkemaat et al 2008 and the ubiquity of antibiotics in surface waters there is evidently a need for a more sensitive detection method for antibiotics residues a potentially suitable alternative is the use of whole cell based biosensors in which similar to calux assays receptor binding mediated bioluminescence detects antibiotics activity at a sublethal level virolainen and karp 2014 however this method is yet to be applied as bioanalytical tool in surface water antibiotics screening 4 3 4 sediments and metals as of yet successful effect based monitoring efforts have been focused mainly on pollution of surface waters by organic compounds altenburger et al 2019 hamers et al 2018 van der oost et al 2017b while relatively little attention has been given to the inclusion of sediments as a relevant source of impaired ecological surface water quality sediments are the largest chemical repositories on earth where harmful compounds accumulate thereby representing a significant threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems burton 2013 despite their relevant role in aquatic ecosystem health sediments are often overlooked and understudied in regular water quality assessment strategies like the wfd borja et al 2004 metal pollution is another relevant source of impaired ecological surface water quality that is currently largely overlooked in effect based monitoring efforts metal pollution can have severe detrimental effects on water quality owing to its toxicity frequency and abundance armitage et al 2007 sin et al 2001 only very rarely have the effects of metal pollution on aquatic ecosystems been studied using a combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical tools roig et al 2011 given the relevance of these pollution sources to aquatic ecosystem health the development of integrative strategies that include the effect based assessment of metal pollution as well as sediment quality would be a valuable addition to future research efforts 4 4 conclusions scientists and water authorities together are faced with the challenge of the increasing complexity of pollution in surface waters and how to make the impact of this pollution on aquatic ecosystems measurable traditional chemical target analysis of a limited selection of pollutants has lost its relevance fortunately the current availability and future development of a wide variety of alternative tools in the form of effect based methods allows for a holistic interpretation of the harmful effects of all chemicals present in surface waters without individual identification of the causing compounds it is likely that the debate on the most efficient and effective combination of effect based tools in bioassay batteries a conclusive approach to ebt derivation as well as the regionwide implementation of the resulting monitoring strategies will be ongoing for some time to come yet at present there is no practical limitation to the application of effect based water quality assessment methods in regular water quality monitoring at a region or
