13920,in assessing sewage treatment systems decision makers now have to consider sustainability affordability and reliability beyond functionality to facilitate this complex assessment multi criteria decision making mcdm tools have evolved recently this case study illustrates an application of the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations promethee method in the mcdm process in evaluating five sewage treatment systems activated sludge treatment followed by anaerobic digestion p1 photoautotrophic algal treatment followed by hydrothermal liquefaction p2 or by anaerobic digestion p3 and mixotrophic algal treatment followed by hydrothermal liquefaction p4 or by anaerobic digestion p5 this evaluation is based on 15 criteria aligned with the united nation s sustainable development goals based on energy recovery the five processes ranked as follows p2 p3 p4 p5 and p1 but when all the 15 criteria are considered p4 ranked as the most preferred option followed by p5 and p2 utility of the mcdm approach in highlighting drawbacks of the options and identifying areas for improvement is illustrated this study indicated that recovering phosphates and energy from the digested sludge in p1 offer greater potential to improve its ranking than by minimizing its energy demand for aeration increasing biomass density in the mixotrophic system can further improve its ranking minimizing footprint and maximizing recoveries since the energy intensity of hydrothermal liquefaction in p2 and p4 4 57 and 23 23 kwh kg bod respectively is higher than that of anaerobic digestion in p1 0 01 kwh kg bod nutrient recovery from its byproducts has to be maximized to justify its selection keywords multi criteria decision making promethee modeling process evaluation preference ranking 1 introduction sewage treatment plants stps in the us and around the world that have continued to rely on obsolete technologies are now facing new challenges because of emergent concerns about their resource intensity secondary emissions ecological footprint sustainability and life cycle impacts 1 from another standpoint these technologies wastefully dissipate valuable elements in sewage without any options for recovering for beneficial reuse for example human excreta are estimated to contain 20 of all manufactured nitrogen and phosphorous that are destroyed or dissipated by current treatment technologies 2 these realizations have been driving the search for greener and sustainable technologies not only for treating sewage energy efficiently but also for recovering energy and valuable commodities for reuse and minimizing secondary emissions 2 recent advances in algal based technologies indicate that they hold promise as energy efficient and greener alternatives to the classical activated sludge based as sewage treatment systems 3 in this case study we illustrate a multi criteria decision making mcdm approach in evaluating algal based sewage treatment technologies against the well established as system in today s context to recognize their shortcomings and identify areas for refinement and advancement we base our evaluation on multiple criteria that are aligned with the goals and targets set in the united nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development relating to water sanitation and hygiene 4 we illustrate the use of the mcdm approach in utilizing quantitative and non quantitative forms of data and information to aid in this evaluation 5 while the mcdm approach had been used by others in ranking of alternate options 6 11 our goal is to also gain insights about sustainable alternate sewage treatment options and to identify their shortcomings that could be improved or studied further to advance them towards utility adoption in the following sections an introduction of the algal based sewage treatment technologies is presented first followed by an overview of the mcdm approach 1 1 algal based sewage treatment algal based sewage treatment systems introduced in the 1950s utilize the symbiosis between photoautotrophic algae and heterotrophic bacteria for energy efficient removal of organic carbon and nutrients in sewage in a single step 12 in the high rate algal pond hrap design which is now in wide use photosynthetic oxygen produced by the algae is utilized by the bacteria to oxidize the organics and the resulting carbon dioxide is consumed by the algae for photosynthesis this symbiosis conserves the energy expended in the as system for artificial aeration which typically amounts to 1 kwh m3 3 13 in comparison energy input for hraps range widely depending on the scale of operation 0 00089 0 00267 14 0 0039 15 0 14 3 16 and 2 64 kwh m3 17 algal systems have an additional advantage over the as systems from energy and nutrient recovery perspectives because sewage grown algae are reported to be richer than waste activated sludge in energy and nutrient content 18 for instance nearly 50 of the organic carbon in the influent to the aeration tank of the as process is lost as carbon dioxide 19 whereas the algal systems have the potential to sequester carbon dioxide producing more biomass algal biomass could be processed downstream by anaerobic digestion pyrolysis gasification hydrothermal liquefaction or wet lipid extraction to recover its energy content as biofuel and nutrient content as fertilizer 20 21 recent innovations in algal biotechnology have shown that mixotrophic systems could be more beneficial than the traditional photoautotrophic systems 13 in removing dissolved organic carbon and nutrients in sewage in a single step a pilot scale sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system based on mixotrophic metabolism has been demonstrated recently 22 24 in contrast to the alkaline phototrophic alga utilized in hraps an acidophilic alga galdieria sulphuraria is employed in the starr system 25 core components of the starr system include the mixotrophic algal cultivation sewage treatment step followed by harvesting and hydrothermal liquefaction htl of the resulting biomass and recovery of energy and nutrients from the products of htl performance of the starr system in concurrent reduction of organics nutrients bacteria and viruses in a single step has been demonstrated these reductions are comparable to or better than that of as systems and of hraps 26 32 58 besides the starr system enables recovery of energy as biocrude 33 and nutrients as high quality struvite 29 in spite of the above mentioned advantages the algal systems suffer from certain limitations including excessive footprint dependence on and sensitivity to ambient conditions energy intensive separation of algal biomass poor track record and lack of familiarity for utilities city planners and engineers to consider algal based sewage treatment systems as a viable alternative a rational comparison between the well known as systems and the algal systems is warranted very few studies have evaluated these options based on multiple criteria considering quantitative as well as qualitative information and contemporary issues wang et al 1 for example have reported on a decision making approach to select process alternatives in a conventional treatment train for recovering nutrients and or energy while meeting discharge standards 1 2 multi criteria decision making in contrast to the traditional process selection methods that rely on quantitative data e g effluent quality energy efficiency techno economics and life cycle impacts 1 mcdm approaches can take into account unquantifiable yet decisive parameters 5 e g stakeholders perspectives nuisance of odor and or noise familiarity ease of technology several mcdm approaches such as electre elimination et choix traduisant la realité topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution and ahp analytic hierarchy process etc have evolved to aid in this complex decision making process 34 in this case study the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations promethee method was adopted based on its ease of use and popularity promethee method has been used in over two thousand studies in areas such as environment water hydrology transportation medicine financial management etc 35 for example promethee has been applied in the wastewater industry for chemical selection 6 reuse applications 7 resource recovery possibilities 8 aquifer recharge 9 micropollutant removal 10 and algal biodiesel production 11 to the best of our knowledge the promethee method has not been applied in comparing algal processes for sewage treatment in this case study promethee method is applied to evaluate five alternative sewage management options including the emergent starr system based on 15 pre defined criteria this mcdm study was motivated by the need to substantiate the functionality as well as the sustainability of emerging sewage treatment technologies given that the starr system is an emergent technology with limited track record and familiarity it is envisaged that an evaluation of its performance against the familiar technologies based on multiple sustainable development goals sdg related criteria could be convincing to utilities regulatory agencies and consulting engineers 2 materials and methods 2 1 process alternatives in this case study four alternate sewage treatment systems are evaluated against the conventional system at the las cruces wastewater treatment plant lcwwtp the five systems compared in this study are as follows p1 conventional activated sludge system at lcwwtp around 25 000 m3 d consisting of primary treatment secondary treatment activated sludge gravity thickener and anaerobic digester the plant does not include a dedicated nitrification denitrification step 24 p2 a pilot scale high rate algal pond where primary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant 500 m3 d is treated 16 followed by lab scale hydrothermal liquefaction of the cultivated biomass to recover biocrude oil 36 p3 a pilot scale high rate algal pond where primary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant 500 m3 d is treated 16 followed by lab scale anaerobic digestion of the cultivated biomass to recover biomethane 37 p4 a pilot scale version of the starr system 700 l where primary effluent from lcwwtp 22 24 is treated followed by hydrothermal liquefaction 33 of the cultivated algal biomass to recover biocrude oil p5 a pilot scale version of the starr system 700 l where primary effluent from lcwwtp 22 24 is treated followed by anaerobic digestion of the cultivated algal biomass to recover biomethane the functional unit of comparison in this study is removal of 1 kg of biochemical oxygen demand bod from primary settled sewage it is to be noted that the five systems being considered here differ substantially in terms of scale in that the activated sludge process p1 has been well demonstrated at full scale in centralized stps whereas hraps p2 and p3 have been implemented in decentralized facilities with lab scale demonstration of energy recovery and the starr system p4 and p5 is an emerging alternative demonstrated at pilot scale however the normalizing approach in the mcdm method provides a rational basis for comparison of alternative systems irrespective of scale 2 2 promethee method the first step in the promethee method is to list all the criteria cj j 1 to k based on which the alternate processes pi i 1 to n are to be evaluated each criterion cj can have its own measure quantitative or qualitative goal maximize or minimize and importance or weight wj an evaluation matrix of processes p criteria c is then constructed where the elements of the matrix contain the corresponding evaluations the evaluations are used to calculate the preference of any given process a over any another process b by pairwise comparison for each criterion cj weighted by its weight wj these pairwise preferences are used to construct a matrix of outranking flows the preference of process a over all the other processes for all the k criteria is then estimated as positive outranking flow and preference of all the other processes over process a for all the k criteria is estimated as negative outranking flow of process a finally an overall ranking referred to as net outranking flow is generated for each process by summing its positive and negative outranking flows the theoretical framework of promethee as applied to process ranking is outlined in appendix a of supporting information si 2 3 criteria selection fifteen criteria are selected in this case study all of which are evaluated based on removal of 1 kg of bod the selected criteria are c1 energy consumption during sewage treatment c2 footprint c3 time for sewage treatment settling and energy recovery processes c4 effluent bod concentration c5 effluent ammoniacal nitrogen concentration c6 effluent phosphate concentration c7 direct global warming potential gwp due to sewage treatment and subsequent energy generation c8 downstream energy consumption c9 energy recovery ratio err c10 nitrogen emission during sewage treatment process c11 solid residue produced in energy generation process c12 potential for nutrient recovery after energy recovery c13 post disinfection demand c14 odor emissions and c15 potential for urban reuse of treated water table 1 illustrates how the above criteria are linked to many of the targets set by the united nations for meeting the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs by 2030 however the criteria selected here are not exhaustive they are selected to illustrate the application of the mcdm method in this case study and to identify shortcomings of the alternatives and potential areas for process improvement capital operational and maintenance costs are not included in this study as the pilot scale starr system lacks these data criteria c12 c15 are estimated on an ordinal scale as such the evaluations of criteria c12 c15 can vary depending on the decision maker s experience preferences and goals our rationale for the evaluations of criteria c12 c15 are included in appendix b minimum possible levels are used to reduce the uncertainty in selection for this preliminary illustration equal weights 6 7 are assigned to all the criteria selected in this study 2 4 data collection and calculation of evaluation elements mass flows across the system boundaries are calculated using stoichiometric relationships to the extent possible to maintain consistency reproducibility and reliability when not available literature values are used all the data used in this case study for p1 38 46 p2 and p3 15 16 20 36 37 47 48 and p4 and p5 15 20 23 33 37 are compiled in appendix c the following empirical formulae are used in the stoichiometric calculations wastewater c10h19o3n 19 bacterial biomass c5h7o2n 19 algae chlorella c106h181o45n16 49 and galdieria sulphuraria c83h116o34n14 50 stoichiometric equations for the five processes are detailed in appendix d steps involved in determining the evaluations of the processes are summarized in the following sections and illustrated in fig 1 detailed calculations are included in appendix e stoichiometric relationships are used to calculate the following parameters associated with the removal of 1 kg of bod in each system oxygen required in p1 for carbon assimilation and nitrification carbon dioxide fixation in p2 p3 p4 and p5 and bacterial biomass production in p1 p2 and p3 algal biomass production in p2 and p3 are calculated based on literature data 16 and that in p4 and p5 are calculated based on field data it is assumed that the biomass produced is settled separated by gravity in all processes and further by centrifugation in p2 and p4 to attain the respective solid content required for htl complete separation of biomass is assumed estimates of generation of methane carbon dioxide and digested sludge in the anaerobic digestion processes are based on stoichiometry 39 complete conversion of algae bacteria biomass is assumed in the htl process yielding four product streams crude oil an aqueous phase biochar and off gases corresponding htl product yields are obtained from literature 36 48 energy requirements for sewage treatment by the five processes are estimated from the literature 15 39 thermal energy input in the anaerobic digestion and htl processes are estimated considering specific heat values of activated sludge 44 algal biomass 48 and water 48 and assuming negligible heat loss an efficiency of 35 45 is assumed for methane to electricity conversion and biocrude to electricity conversion energy recovery ratio is defined as the ratio of net energy output to total energy input for the overall process biogenic co2 resulting from oxidation of organic carbon in p1 is not included in gwp estimation 51 co2 assimilated by algae is taken as a credit in gwp estimation co2 emissions in the ad and htl processes are included in the estimates of gwp evaluations determined as above for the five processes for each of the 15 criteria are used to construct the evaluation matrix shown in table 2 2 5 data analysis by visual promethee multi criteria decision making analysis is performed using the software visual promethee 1 4 academic edition comprehensive documentation of the terminologies and functions of this software are presented elsewhere 52 a summary is included herein appendix a the evaluation matrix in table 2 is entered as input to visual promethee since the measures of the criteria selected in this study have varying units and scales they are normalized for rational comparison by applying six preference functions built in visual promethee appendix f 52 since the goal of this study is to assess the emergent algal systems against the existing as system to identify their shortcomings the usual preference function was assigned to each criterion the procedure for assessing the preference of one process over another is illustrated by a numerical example in appendix g 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass and energy flows major mass and energy flows associated with the removal of 1 kg of bod and subsequent biogas or biocrude oil generation in the 5 processes were calculated and summarized to develop the evaluation matrix table 2 in this study given in appendix e gaseous streams considered are co2 ch4 and n2o which are potential global warming pollutants a distinct advantage of the algal processes p2 to p5 over the activated sludge process p1 is the negative gwp resulting from carbon fixation through photosynthesis when co2 is supplied to augment growth in algal systems the closed reactor design in the starr system can be advantageous than the open raceway design where 15 55 of co2 could be lost to the atmosphere depending on the exposure area 20 mass flow rates on nitrogen indicated that 21 of the influent n is incorporated into bacterial biomass in the as system while 65 is incorporated into the algal biomass in the phototrophic system assuming all ammoniacal n removed is assimilated after accounting for volatilization and 77 in the mixotrophic system no volatilization appendix e this implies that more n can be recovered from subsequent nutrient recovery processes in the algal systems to yield n rich fertilizer in addition to recovering energy as biocrude oil downstream analysis appendix e indicated that 29 of n incorporated into the biomass during sewage treatment is released in the anaerobic digester as ammonium and remains in the centrate effluent from ad in p1 which is recycled to the headworks of the plant in other words about 6 of influent n continues to be recycled within the system without any recovery in the starr system 47 of n in the algal biomass is solubilized by the htl process into the aqueous phase this study indicated that appropriate technologies should be integrated to recover the residual n in this n rich aqueous phase to justify the use of the energy intensive htl process and to improve the sustainability of this approach 53 even though the conventional plant considered in this case study in p1 does not include a dedicated nitrification denitrification step its effluent nitrate n concentration 33 mg l suggests possible nitrification in the aeration tank as such estimate for energy input for bod removal is the highest in the case of p1 29 8 kwh kg bod removed due to the oxygen demand for organic carbon oxidation as well as for nitrification as anticipated the algal systems p2 to p5 demand less energy than the activated sludge system p1 21 since their energy demand is primarily for circulation and maintaining the cultures in suspension based on the removal of 1 kg of bod energy input to the algal system is estimated to be 26 45 of that to the as system in the downstream energy recovery step processing of algae by htl requires more energy input 4 57 kwh kg bod in p2 and 23 23kw h kg bod in p4 including energy for biomass separation than for processing of waste activated sludge by ad 0 01 kwh kg bod in p1 despite that higher biomass produced in the algal systems than the as system 3 vs 1 kg biomass kg bod removed and higher product yield in htl enable higher energy recovery by the algae to biocrude oil pathway than by the waste activated sludge to methane pathway yet none of the process alternatives could recover more than 50 of the total energy input the highest energy recovery ratio err is estimated as 23 in process p2 based on the high biocrude oil yields reported by zhou et al 36 which is most probably due to the mixed cultures of heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic algae in hraps comparing solid residues criterion c11 those in p1 p3 and p5 are due to the digested sludge and those in p2 and p4 are due to the biochar resulting from htl the lowest solid residue generation is in p1 higher residue generation in p3 and p5 is attributed to low destruction of algal biomass by anaerobic digestion however it has been shown that the biochar resulting from htl is rich in phosphorous which could be readily recovered 54 favoring the htl process from a nutrient recovery perspective in contrast anaerobically digested sludge in p1 p3 and p5 is not amenable to nutrient recovery this consideration formed the basis for the qualitative evaluation of criterion c12 in the case of an operational criterion c2 footprint p1 is seen to be preferable than the algal systems table 2 the depth of the aeration tank in p1 can be up to 5 m whereas typical depths in algal systems are 0 2 0 5 m 16 24 hence the footprint in p1 is 7 that of the algal systems when compared on the basis of 1 kg of bod removal 3 2 promethee ranking results of pairwise comparisons between the process alternatives estimated as positive and negative outranking flows equations a1 a5 appendix a for each criterion are presented first fig 2 to gain an insight into the mcdm method despite the vastly different magnitudes and units of measures for each criterion the preference function transforms them into comparable dimensionless outranking indexes ranging 1 for any given criterion cj a value of 1 for any process implies a strict preference for that process over the other four processes i e pi outranks all other processes and a value of 1 signifies no preference at all for that process i e all other processes outrank pi for example in the case of criterion c1 energy requirement p1 is the least preferred option as all other four processes outrank p1 on the other hand in the case of c2 footprint p1 is the most preferred outranking all the other 4 processes fig 2 indicates that the activated sludge process p1 is strictly outranked by all the other four processes in 6 of the 15 criteria considered here c1 c6 c7 c9 c13 and c14 p1 gains strict preference only in 4 of the 15 criteria c2 c5 c8 and c11 this criterion by criterion evaluation suggests that the emerging algal technologies p2 to p5 can outcompete the traditional as process and are worth due consideration in selecting sewage treatment systems the criterion by criterion preference flows illustrated in fig 2 are integrated next to estimate the positive outranking flows φ and the negative outranking flows φ based on all the 15 criteria equations a4 and a5 the positive and negative outranking flows are then summed to yield the net preference outranking flow φ to rank the five processes fig 3 as can be noted in fig 3 the five processes considered in this case study ranked as follows p4 p5 p2 p1 and p3 positive outranking flow φ of p1 is higher than that of p2 0 40 vs 0 38 implying that the activated sludge process holds more merits than the autotrophic htl process but because p1 is outcompeted by the other processes in criteria c1 c6 c7 c9 c13 and c14 fig 2 the net preference outranking flow of p1 is reduced to negative overall this case study indicates that the mixotrophic algal wastewater treatment followed by htl for energy generation p4 is preferred over the other four alternatives based on the selected criteria to meet the sdgs it is of interest to note that the outranking of the activated sludge system by the phototrophic algal system is in line with the findings of other decision support tools such as life cycle assessments that have identified hraps better than the as systems 3 20 3 3 sensitivity analysis the weights assigned to each criterion can impact the ranking of the alternatives visual promethee software has a built in weight stability interval function to assess the stability of the final ranking this function generates a range for the weight of any given criterion where the final ranking is stable while other criteria hold the previously assigned values the stability ranges estimated for all the 15 criteria considered in this study are included in appendix h the widest range 0 34 9 is observed for criterion c7 gwp narrow ranges are observed in the case of seven criteria c2 c4 c5 c8 c9 c10 and c15 hence assigning the most appropriate weight to these 7 criteria are critical for reliable ranking for example if minimizing footprint is of interest increasing the weight of c2 to 19 will upgrade p1 to the 3rd rank projecting a narrow range for criterion c15 proves the significance of qualitative criteria in decision making it thus follows that this mcdm approach does not necessarily provide a definitive or general solution rather it is flexible in being able to adapt to the specific conditions based on the decision maker s goals 52 as an illustration in the case of criterion c11 solid residues the goal could be to minimize from the perspective of disposal on the other hand the goal could be to maximize from an energy or fertilizer recovery perspective in this case changing the goal from minimizing solid residues to maximizing net preference outranking flow of the process alternatives will change as follows in processes p3 and p5 where more residue is generated as described in section 3 1 φ will increase while in p1 it will decrease from 0 13 to 0 27 and in p2 from 0 07 to 0 13 making p1 more unfavorable meanwhile φ of p4 remains unchanged 0 42 3 4 data quality assessment it is acknowledged that the above results and the rankings are highly dependent on the selected criteria and the weights assigned to them as well as the assumptions field data and literature values underlying the estimation of the evaluations the conventional as system considered in this analysis p1 is not specifically designed for ammonia removal or nitrification but some ammonia is assimilated by heterotrophic bacteria for growth and some degree of nitrification is noted in the aeration basin emission of n2o by air stripping is also possible in the aeration basin due to the lack of process models emission rates reported in the literature were adopted in this study to quantify n2o emissions from the as process 1 in the case of hraps n2o emission is not accounted in this case study as the reported emission rates are negligible 0 005 g n2o n g input n 55 in processes p3 and p5 anaerobic digestion of algal biomass was considered for energy recovery even though this option is currently at a developmental scale 37 46 pilot scale data from different sources were combined and the procedure used for p1 was followed in these cases to complete the calculations when data were not available it is also acknowledged that some uncertainty is associated with the energy consumption by the centrifuge as there are no models or data available to relate energy to solid separation efficiency moreover since heat loss is ignored in the thermal calculations energy recovery ratios criterion c9 indicated here are optimistic this case study did not include environment related impacts such as eutrophication potential acidification potential and ecotoxicity 1 chemical usage requirement of expert knowledge manpower and cost related parameters 3 5 implications and future prospects management of sewage safely and sustainably includes not only its treatment but also minimizing the resource intensity energy chemicals and the associated environmental emissions odor greenhouse gases and maximizing the recovery of resources embedded in the wastewater water nutrients energy this case study illustrates how the promethee based mcdm approach can be applied in evaluating alternate technologies satisfying the selected criteria this method can be tailored to evaluate any criteria ranging from effluent quality environmental impacts operational conditions to cost benefits preference flow values estimated by the promethee method can highlight shortcomings of the alternatives and identify areas for improvement for example as shown in fig 3 the net preference value of as system p1 is negative indicating that it suffers from some inherent shortcomings while the other available options p2 p4 and p5 offer more benefits than the as system as indicated in fig 2 high energy demand of p1 and the lower energy demand by other technologies result in its lower ranking while energy demand of the as process has been the subject of research for several years simulation of the promethee based mcdm process indicates that even if its energy demand is reduced by more than 50 other shortcomings of p1 still dominate its final ranking the anaerobically digested sludge in p1 has been traditionally used as fertilizer soil amendment or in landscaping instead if it could be utilized as a fuel source 56 energy recovery ratio of p1 could increase to 0 05 assuming higher heating value of the digested sludge as 16 5 mj kg 56 and electricity conversion efficiency as 35 by doing so φ of p1 can increase making p1 φ 0 42 comparable to p5 φ 0 45 preference of p1 could be improved further by incorporating phosphate removal to reduce its effluent level to 1 5 mg l this will enable p1 to outcompete p2 it is identified that many of the drawbacks of the mixotrophic algal process p4 and p5 could be addressed by increasing the biomass density in the cultivation system since the mixotrophic cultures are not that dependent on light penetration as the phototrophic cultures increasing the biomass density in p4 and p5 may not cause any negative effects increased biomass density can reduce treatment time c3 effluent nh3 n concentration c5 and change err c9 and gwp c7 while the effects of biomass density on hrt and effluent concentrations have to be experimentally evaluated corresponding err and gwp could be estimated simulations indicate that doubling algal density will increase co2 fixation and increase err three fold if it is assumed that increasing algal density could reduce ammoniacal nitrogen to 1 mg l in 3 days the net preference outranking flow of both p4 and p5 will be higher mass flow calculations indicate that in p4 73 of n content of the algal biomass is released as an aqueous byproduct of htl of which about 47 is in the form of ammonium 1 7 g l of nh4 n 33 recovery of fertilizers from this n rich stream and the p rich biochar resulting from htl can improve the sustainability and the preferential ranking of p4 feasibility of combining the aqueous phase and the leachate of biochar to recover 70 of p and 6 of n from primary effluent as struvite has been demonstrated at the pilot scale 29 recovering the remaining n from the supernatant of the struvite precipitation step via gas permeable membranes for example to yield ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer can further improve the preference of p4 59 as demonstrated in this case study the promethee method could be used by water industries to evaluate not only specific components of the sewage treatment system 6 10 but the integrated system as well utility and flexibility of the promethee method in evaluating the significance of process parameters under varying weightages and in analyzing the sensitivity of the results can also be of benefit to water industries when evaluating alternate systems 4 conclusions a multi criteria decision making approach is applied to evaluate four sewage treatment process configurations as alternatives to the conventional activated sludge process fifteen criteria related to the un sustainable development goals are used in this evaluation the current sewage treatment practice using the activated sludge process gained strict preference in only 4 of the 15 of the selected criteria while the emergent mixotrophic algal system is ranked as the most preferred alternative for sewage treatment a possible option to improve the ranking of the activated sludge process is to investigate the feasibility of recovering energy from the anaerobically digested solid residues rather than minimizing its energy demand for aeration ranking of the mixotrophic algal system could be further improved by increasing biomass density in the cultivation step and by integrating appropriate downstream technologies to maximize recovery of nitrogen from the aqueous byproduct of hydrothermal liquefaction declaration of authors contribution

13920,in assessing sewage treatment systems decision makers now have to consider sustainability affordability and reliability beyond functionality to facilitate this complex assessment multi criteria decision making mcdm tools have evolved recently this case study illustrates an application of the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations promethee method in the mcdm process in evaluating five sewage treatment systems activated sludge treatment followed by anaerobic digestion p1 photoautotrophic algal treatment followed by hydrothermal liquefaction p2 or by anaerobic digestion p3 and mixotrophic algal treatment followed by hydrothermal liquefaction p4 or by anaerobic digestion p5 this evaluation is based on 15 criteria aligned with the united nation s sustainable development goals based on energy recovery the five processes ranked as follows p2 p3 p4 p5 and p1 but when all the 15 criteria are considered p4 ranked as the most preferred option followed by p5 and p2 utility of the mcdm approach in highlighting drawbacks of the options and identifying areas for improvement is illustrated this study indicated that recovering phosphates and energy from the digested sludge in p1 offer greater potential to improve its ranking than by minimizing its energy demand for aeration increasing biomass density in the mixotrophic system can further improve its ranking minimizing footprint and maximizing recoveries since the energy intensity of hydrothermal liquefaction in p2 and p4 4 57 and 23 23 kwh kg bod respectively is higher than that of anaerobic digestion in p1 0 01 kwh kg bod nutrient recovery from its byproducts has to be maximized to justify its selection keywords multi criteria decision making promethee modeling process evaluation preference ranking 1 introduction sewage treatment plants stps in the us and around the world that have continued to rely on obsolete technologies are now facing new challenges because of emergent concerns about their resource intensity secondary emissions ecological footprint sustainability and life cycle impacts 1 from another standpoint these technologies wastefully dissipate valuable elements in sewage without any options for recovering for beneficial reuse for example human excreta are estimated to contain 20 of all manufactured nitrogen and phosphorous that are destroyed or dissipated by current treatment technologies 2 these realizations have been driving the search for greener and sustainable technologies not only for treating sewage energy efficiently but also for recovering energy and valuable commodities for reuse and minimizing secondary emissions 2 recent advances in algal based technologies indicate that they hold promise as energy efficient and greener alternatives to the classical activated sludge based as sewage treatment systems 3 in this case study we illustrate a multi criteria decision making mcdm approach in evaluating algal based sewage treatment technologies against the well established as system in today s context to recognize their shortcomings and identify areas for refinement and advancement we base our evaluation on multiple criteria that are aligned with the goals and targets set in the united nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development relating to water sanitation and hygiene 4 we illustrate the use of the mcdm approach in utilizing quantitative and non quantitative forms of data and information to aid in this evaluation 5 while the mcdm approach had been used by others in ranking of alternate options 6 11 our goal is to also gain insights about sustainable alternate sewage treatment options and to identify their shortcomings that could be improved or studied further to advance them towards utility adoption in the following sections an introduction of the algal based sewage treatment technologies is presented first followed by an overview of the mcdm approach 1 1 algal based sewage treatment algal based sewage treatment systems introduced in the 1950s utilize the symbiosis between photoautotrophic algae and heterotrophic bacteria for energy efficient removal of organic carbon and nutrients in sewage in a single step 12 in the high rate algal pond hrap design which is now in wide use photosynthetic oxygen produced by the algae is utilized by the bacteria to oxidize the organics and the resulting carbon dioxide is consumed by the algae for photosynthesis this symbiosis conserves the energy expended in the as system for artificial aeration which typically amounts to 1 kwh m3 3 13 in comparison energy input for hraps range widely depending on the scale of operation 0 00089 0 00267 14 0 0039 15 0 14 3 16 and 2 64 kwh m3 17 algal systems have an additional advantage over the as systems from energy and nutrient recovery perspectives because sewage grown algae are reported to be richer than waste activated sludge in energy and nutrient content 18 for instance nearly 50 of the organic carbon in the influent to the aeration tank of the as process is lost as carbon dioxide 19 whereas the algal systems have the potential to sequester carbon dioxide producing more biomass algal biomass could be processed downstream by anaerobic digestion pyrolysis gasification hydrothermal liquefaction or wet lipid extraction to recover its energy content as biofuel and nutrient content as fertilizer 20 21 recent innovations in algal biotechnology have shown that mixotrophic systems could be more beneficial than the traditional photoautotrophic systems 13 in removing dissolved organic carbon and nutrients in sewage in a single step a pilot scale sewage treatment and resource recovery starr system based on mixotrophic metabolism has been demonstrated recently 22 24 in contrast to the alkaline phototrophic alga utilized in hraps an acidophilic alga galdieria sulphuraria is employed in the starr system 25 core components of the starr system include the mixotrophic algal cultivation sewage treatment step followed by harvesting and hydrothermal liquefaction htl of the resulting biomass and recovery of energy and nutrients from the products of htl performance of the starr system in concurrent reduction of organics nutrients bacteria and viruses in a single step has been demonstrated these reductions are comparable to or better than that of as systems and of hraps 26 32 58 besides the starr system enables recovery of energy as biocrude 33 and nutrients as high quality struvite 29 in spite of the above mentioned advantages the algal systems suffer from certain limitations including excessive footprint dependence on and sensitivity to ambient conditions energy intensive separation of algal biomass poor track record and lack of familiarity for utilities city planners and engineers to consider algal based sewage treatment systems as a viable alternative a rational comparison between the well known as systems and the algal systems is warranted very few studies have evaluated these options based on multiple criteria considering quantitative as well as qualitative information and contemporary issues wang et al 1 for example have reported on a decision making approach to select process alternatives in a conventional treatment train for recovering nutrients and or energy while meeting discharge standards 1 2 multi criteria decision making in contrast to the traditional process selection methods that rely on quantitative data e g effluent quality energy efficiency techno economics and life cycle impacts 1 mcdm approaches can take into account unquantifiable yet decisive parameters 5 e g stakeholders perspectives nuisance of odor and or noise familiarity ease of technology several mcdm approaches such as electre elimination et choix traduisant la realité topsis technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution and ahp analytic hierarchy process etc have evolved to aid in this complex decision making process 34 in this case study the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations promethee method was adopted based on its ease of use and popularity promethee method has been used in over two thousand studies in areas such as environment water hydrology transportation medicine financial management etc 35 for example promethee has been applied in the wastewater industry for chemical selection 6 reuse applications 7 resource recovery possibilities 8 aquifer recharge 9 micropollutant removal 10 and algal biodiesel production 11 to the best of our knowledge the promethee method has not been applied in comparing algal processes for sewage treatment in this case study promethee method is applied to evaluate five alternative sewage management options including the emergent starr system based on 15 pre defined criteria this mcdm study was motivated by the need to substantiate the functionality as well as the sustainability of emerging sewage treatment technologies given that the starr system is an emergent technology with limited track record and familiarity it is envisaged that an evaluation of its performance against the familiar technologies based on multiple sustainable development goals sdg related criteria could be convincing to utilities regulatory agencies and consulting engineers 2 materials and methods 2 1 process alternatives in this case study four alternate sewage treatment systems are evaluated against the conventional system at the las cruces wastewater treatment plant lcwwtp the five systems compared in this study are as follows p1 conventional activated sludge system at lcwwtp around 25 000 m3 d consisting of primary treatment secondary treatment activated sludge gravity thickener and anaerobic digester the plant does not include a dedicated nitrification denitrification step 24 p2 a pilot scale high rate algal pond where primary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant 500 m3 d is treated 16 followed by lab scale hydrothermal liquefaction of the cultivated biomass to recover biocrude oil 36 p3 a pilot scale high rate algal pond where primary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant 500 m3 d is treated 16 followed by lab scale anaerobic digestion of the cultivated biomass to recover biomethane 37 p4 a pilot scale version of the starr system 700 l where primary effluent from lcwwtp 22 24 is treated followed by hydrothermal liquefaction 33 of the cultivated algal biomass to recover biocrude oil p5 a pilot scale version of the starr system 700 l where primary effluent from lcwwtp 22 24 is treated followed by anaerobic digestion of the cultivated algal biomass to recover biomethane the functional unit of comparison in this study is removal of 1 kg of biochemical oxygen demand bod from primary settled sewage it is to be noted that the five systems being considered here differ substantially in terms of scale in that the activated sludge process p1 has been well demonstrated at full scale in centralized stps whereas hraps p2 and p3 have been implemented in decentralized facilities with lab scale demonstration of energy recovery and the starr system p4 and p5 is an emerging alternative demonstrated at pilot scale however the normalizing approach in the mcdm method provides a rational basis for comparison of alternative systems irrespective of scale 2 2 promethee method the first step in the promethee method is to list all the criteria cj j 1 to k based on which the alternate processes pi i 1 to n are to be evaluated each criterion cj can have its own measure quantitative or qualitative goal maximize or minimize and importance or weight wj an evaluation matrix of processes p criteria c is then constructed where the elements of the matrix contain the corresponding evaluations the evaluations are used to calculate the preference of any given process a over any another process b by pairwise comparison for each criterion cj weighted by its weight wj these pairwise preferences are used to construct a matrix of outranking flows the preference of process a over all the other processes for all the k criteria is then estimated as positive outranking flow and preference of all the other processes over process a for all the k criteria is estimated as negative outranking flow of process a finally an overall ranking referred to as net outranking flow is generated for each process by summing its positive and negative outranking flows the theoretical framework of promethee as applied to process ranking is outlined in appendix a of supporting information si 2 3 criteria selection fifteen criteria are selected in this case study all of which are evaluated based on removal of 1 kg of bod the selected criteria are c1 energy consumption during sewage treatment c2 footprint c3 time for sewage treatment settling and energy recovery processes c4 effluent bod concentration c5 effluent ammoniacal nitrogen concentration c6 effluent phosphate concentration c7 direct global warming potential gwp due to sewage treatment and subsequent energy generation c8 downstream energy consumption c9 energy recovery ratio err c10 nitrogen emission during sewage treatment process c11 solid residue produced in energy generation process c12 potential for nutrient recovery after energy recovery c13 post disinfection demand c14 odor emissions and c15 potential for urban reuse of treated water table 1 illustrates how the above criteria are linked to many of the targets set by the united nations for meeting the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs by 2030 however the criteria selected here are not exhaustive they are selected to illustrate the application of the mcdm method in this case study and to identify shortcomings of the alternatives and potential areas for process improvement capital operational and maintenance costs are not included in this study as the pilot scale starr system lacks these data criteria c12 c15 are estimated on an ordinal scale as such the evaluations of criteria c12 c15 can vary depending on the decision maker s experience preferences and goals our rationale for the evaluations of criteria c12 c15 are included in appendix b minimum possible levels are used to reduce the uncertainty in selection for this preliminary illustration equal weights 6 7 are assigned to all the criteria selected in this study 2 4 data collection and calculation of evaluation elements mass flows across the system boundaries are calculated using stoichiometric relationships to the extent possible to maintain consistency reproducibility and reliability when not available literature values are used all the data used in this case study for p1 38 46 p2 and p3 15 16 20 36 37 47 48 and p4 and p5 15 20 23 33 37 are compiled in appendix c the following empirical formulae are used in the stoichiometric calculations wastewater c10h19o3n 19 bacterial biomass c5h7o2n 19 algae chlorella c106h181o45n16 49 and galdieria sulphuraria c83h116o34n14 50 stoichiometric equations for the five processes are detailed in appendix d steps involved in determining the evaluations of the processes are summarized in the following sections and illustrated in fig 1 detailed calculations are included in appendix e stoichiometric relationships are used to calculate the following parameters associated with the removal of 1 kg of bod in each system oxygen required in p1 for carbon assimilation and nitrification carbon dioxide fixation in p2 p3 p4 and p5 and bacterial biomass production in p1 p2 and p3 algal biomass production in p2 and p3 are calculated based on literature data 16 and that in p4 and p5 are calculated based on field data it is assumed that the biomass produced is settled separated by gravity in all processes and further by centrifugation in p2 and p4 to attain the respective solid content required for htl complete separation of biomass is assumed estimates of generation of methane carbon dioxide and digested sludge in the anaerobic digestion processes are based on stoichiometry 39 complete conversion of algae bacteria biomass is assumed in the htl process yielding four product streams crude oil an aqueous phase biochar and off gases corresponding htl product yields are obtained from literature 36 48 energy requirements for sewage treatment by the five processes are estimated from the literature 15 39 thermal energy input in the anaerobic digestion and htl processes are estimated considering specific heat values of activated sludge 44 algal biomass 48 and water 48 and assuming negligible heat loss an efficiency of 35 45 is assumed for methane to electricity conversion and biocrude to electricity conversion energy recovery ratio is defined as the ratio of net energy output to total energy input for the overall process biogenic co2 resulting from oxidation of organic carbon in p1 is not included in gwp estimation 51 co2 assimilated by algae is taken as a credit in gwp estimation co2 emissions in the ad and htl processes are included in the estimates of gwp evaluations determined as above for the five processes for each of the 15 criteria are used to construct the evaluation matrix shown in table 2 2 5 data analysis by visual promethee multi criteria decision making analysis is performed using the software visual promethee 1 4 academic edition comprehensive documentation of the terminologies and functions of this software are presented elsewhere 52 a summary is included herein appendix a the evaluation matrix in table 2 is entered as input to visual promethee since the measures of the criteria selected in this study have varying units and scales they are normalized for rational comparison by applying six preference functions built in visual promethee appendix f 52 since the goal of this study is to assess the emergent algal systems against the existing as system to identify their shortcomings the usual preference function was assigned to each criterion the procedure for assessing the preference of one process over another is illustrated by a numerical example in appendix g 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass and energy flows major mass and energy flows associated with the removal of 1 kg of bod and subsequent biogas or biocrude oil generation in the 5 processes were calculated and summarized to develop the evaluation matrix table 2 in this study given in appendix e gaseous streams considered are co2 ch4 and n2o which are potential global warming pollutants a distinct advantage of the algal processes p2 to p5 over the activated sludge process p1 is the negative gwp resulting from carbon fixation through photosynthesis when co2 is supplied to augment growth in algal systems the closed reactor design in the starr system can be advantageous than the open raceway design where 15 55 of co2 could be lost to the atmosphere depending on the exposure area 20 mass flow rates on nitrogen indicated that 21 of the influent n is incorporated into bacterial biomass in the as system while 65 is incorporated into the algal biomass in the phototrophic system assuming all ammoniacal n removed is assimilated after accounting for volatilization and 77 in the mixotrophic system no volatilization appendix e this implies that more n can be recovered from subsequent nutrient recovery processes in the algal systems to yield n rich fertilizer in addition to recovering energy as biocrude oil downstream analysis appendix e indicated that 29 of n incorporated into the biomass during sewage treatment is released in the anaerobic digester as ammonium and remains in the centrate effluent from ad in p1 which is recycled to the headworks of the plant in other words about 6 of influent n continues to be recycled within the system without any recovery in the starr system 47 of n in the algal biomass is solubilized by the htl process into the aqueous phase this study indicated that appropriate technologies should be integrated to recover the residual n in this n rich aqueous phase to justify the use of the energy intensive htl process and to improve the sustainability of this approach 53 even though the conventional plant considered in this case study in p1 does not include a dedicated nitrification denitrification step its effluent nitrate n concentration 33 mg l suggests possible nitrification in the aeration tank as such estimate for energy input for bod removal is the highest in the case of p1 29 8 kwh kg bod removed due to the oxygen demand for organic carbon oxidation as well as for nitrification as anticipated the algal systems p2 to p5 demand less energy than the activated sludge system p1 21 since their energy demand is primarily for circulation and maintaining the cultures in suspension based on the removal of 1 kg of bod energy input to the algal system is estimated to be 26 45 of that to the as system in the downstream energy recovery step processing of algae by htl requires more energy input 4 57 kwh kg bod in p2 and 23 23kw h kg bod in p4 including energy for biomass separation than for processing of waste activated sludge by ad 0 01 kwh kg bod in p1 despite that higher biomass produced in the algal systems than the as system 3 vs 1 kg biomass kg bod removed and higher product yield in htl enable higher energy recovery by the algae to biocrude oil pathway than by the waste activated sludge to methane pathway yet none of the process alternatives could recover more than 50 of the total energy input the highest energy recovery ratio err is estimated as 23 in process p2 based on the high biocrude oil yields reported by zhou et al 36 which is most probably due to the mixed cultures of heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic algae in hraps comparing solid residues criterion c11 those in p1 p3 and p5 are due to the digested sludge and those in p2 and p4 are due to the biochar resulting from htl the lowest solid residue generation is in p1 higher residue generation in p3 and p5 is attributed to low destruction of algal biomass by anaerobic digestion however it has been shown that the biochar resulting from htl is rich in phosphorous which could be readily recovered 54 favoring the htl process from a nutrient recovery perspective in contrast anaerobically digested sludge in p1 p3 and p5 is not amenable to nutrient recovery this consideration formed the basis for the qualitative evaluation of criterion c12 in the case of an operational criterion c2 footprint p1 is seen to be preferable than the algal systems table 2 the depth of the aeration tank in p1 can be up to 5 m whereas typical depths in algal systems are 0 2 0 5 m 16 24 hence the footprint in p1 is 7 that of the algal systems when compared on the basis of 1 kg of bod removal 3 2 promethee ranking results of pairwise comparisons between the process alternatives estimated as positive and negative outranking flows equations a1 a5 appendix a for each criterion are presented first fig 2 to gain an insight into the mcdm method despite the vastly different magnitudes and units of measures for each criterion the preference function transforms them into comparable dimensionless outranking indexes ranging 1 for any given criterion cj a value of 1 for any process implies a strict preference for that process over the other four processes i e pi outranks all other processes and a value of 1 signifies no preference at all for that process i e all other processes outrank pi for example in the case of criterion c1 energy requirement p1 is the least preferred option as all other four processes outrank p1 on the other hand in the case of c2 footprint p1 is the most preferred outranking all the other 4 processes fig 2 indicates that the activated sludge process p1 is strictly outranked by all the other four processes in 6 of the 15 criteria considered here c1 c6 c7 c9 c13 and c14 p1 gains strict preference only in 4 of the 15 criteria c2 c5 c8 and c11 this criterion by criterion evaluation suggests that the emerging algal technologies p2 to p5 can outcompete the traditional as process and are worth due consideration in selecting sewage treatment systems the criterion by criterion preference flows illustrated in fig 2 are integrated next to estimate the positive outranking flows φ and the negative outranking flows φ based on all the 15 criteria equations a4 and a5 the positive and negative outranking flows are then summed to yield the net preference outranking flow φ to rank the five processes fig 3 as can be noted in fig 3 the five processes considered in this case study ranked as follows p4 p5 p2 p1 and p3 positive outranking flow φ of p1 is higher than that of p2 0 40 vs 0 38 implying that the activated sludge process holds more merits than the autotrophic htl process but because p1 is outcompeted by the other processes in criteria c1 c6 c7 c9 c13 and c14 fig 2 the net preference outranking flow of p1 is reduced to negative overall this case study indicates that the mixotrophic algal wastewater treatment followed by htl for energy generation p4 is preferred over the other four alternatives based on the selected criteria to meet the sdgs it is of interest to note that the outranking of the activated sludge system by the phototrophic algal system is in line with the findings of other decision support tools such as life cycle assessments that have identified hraps better than the as systems 3 20 3 3 sensitivity analysis the weights assigned to each criterion can impact the ranking of the alternatives visual promethee software has a built in weight stability interval function to assess the stability of the final ranking this function generates a range for the weight of any given criterion where the final ranking is stable while other criteria hold the previously assigned values the stability ranges estimated for all the 15 criteria considered in this study are included in appendix h the widest range 0 34 9 is observed for criterion c7 gwp narrow ranges are observed in the case of seven criteria c2 c4 c5 c8 c9 c10 and c15 hence assigning the most appropriate weight to these 7 criteria are critical for reliable ranking for example if minimizing footprint is of interest increasing the weight of c2 to 19 will upgrade p1 to the 3rd rank projecting a narrow range for criterion c15 proves the significance of qualitative criteria in decision making it thus follows that this mcdm approach does not necessarily provide a definitive or general solution rather it is flexible in being able to adapt to the specific conditions based on the decision maker s goals 52 as an illustration in the case of criterion c11 solid residues the goal could be to minimize from the perspective of disposal on the other hand the goal could be to maximize from an energy or fertilizer recovery perspective in this case changing the goal from minimizing solid residues to maximizing net preference outranking flow of the process alternatives will change as follows in processes p3 and p5 where more residue is generated as described in section 3 1 φ will increase while in p1 it will decrease from 0 13 to 0 27 and in p2 from 0 07 to 0 13 making p1 more unfavorable meanwhile φ of p4 remains unchanged 0 42 3 4 data quality assessment it is acknowledged that the above results and the rankings are highly dependent on the selected criteria and the weights assigned to them as well as the assumptions field data and literature values underlying the estimation of the evaluations the conventional as system considered in this analysis p1 is not specifically designed for ammonia removal or nitrification but some ammonia is assimilated by heterotrophic bacteria for growth and some degree of nitrification is noted in the aeration basin emission of n2o by air stripping is also possible in the aeration basin due to the lack of process models emission rates reported in the literature were adopted in this study to quantify n2o emissions from the as process 1 in the case of hraps n2o emission is not accounted in this case study as the reported emission rates are negligible 0 005 g n2o n g input n 55 in processes p3 and p5 anaerobic digestion of algal biomass was considered for energy recovery even though this option is currently at a developmental scale 37 46 pilot scale data from different sources were combined and the procedure used for p1 was followed in these cases to complete the calculations when data were not available it is also acknowledged that some uncertainty is associated with the energy consumption by the centrifuge as there are no models or data available to relate energy to solid separation efficiency moreover since heat loss is ignored in the thermal calculations energy recovery ratios criterion c9 indicated here are optimistic this case study did not include environment related impacts such as eutrophication potential acidification potential and ecotoxicity 1 chemical usage requirement of expert knowledge manpower and cost related parameters 3 5 implications and future prospects management of sewage safely and sustainably includes not only its treatment but also minimizing the resource intensity energy chemicals and the associated environmental emissions odor greenhouse gases and maximizing the recovery of resources embedded in the wastewater water nutrients energy this case study illustrates how the promethee based mcdm approach can be applied in evaluating alternate technologies satisfying the selected criteria this method can be tailored to evaluate any criteria ranging from effluent quality environmental impacts operational conditions to cost benefits preference flow values estimated by the promethee method can highlight shortcomings of the alternatives and identify areas for improvement for example as shown in fig 3 the net preference value of as system p1 is negative indicating that it suffers from some inherent shortcomings while the other available options p2 p4 and p5 offer more benefits than the as system as indicated in fig 2 high energy demand of p1 and the lower energy demand by other technologies result in its lower ranking while energy demand of the as process has been the subject of research for several years simulation of the promethee based mcdm process indicates that even if its energy demand is reduced by more than 50 other shortcomings of p1 still dominate its final ranking the anaerobically digested sludge in p1 has been traditionally used as fertilizer soil amendment or in landscaping instead if it could be utilized as a fuel source 56 energy recovery ratio of p1 could increase to 0 05 assuming higher heating value of the digested sludge as 16 5 mj kg 56 and electricity conversion efficiency as 35 by doing so φ of p1 can increase making p1 φ 0 42 comparable to p5 φ 0 45 preference of p1 could be improved further by incorporating phosphate removal to reduce its effluent level to 1 5 mg l this will enable p1 to outcompete p2 it is identified that many of the drawbacks of the mixotrophic algal process p4 and p5 could be addressed by increasing the biomass density in the cultivation system since the mixotrophic cultures are not that dependent on light penetration as the phototrophic cultures increasing the biomass density in p4 and p5 may not cause any negative effects increased biomass density can reduce treatment time c3 effluent nh3 n concentration c5 and change err c9 and gwp c7 while the effects of biomass density on hrt and effluent concentrations have to be experimentally evaluated corresponding err and gwp could be estimated simulations indicate that doubling algal density will increase co2 fixation and increase err three fold if it is assumed that increasing algal density could reduce ammoniacal nitrogen to 1 mg l in 3 days the net preference outranking flow of both p4 and p5 will be higher mass flow calculations indicate that in p4 73 of n content of the algal biomass is released as an aqueous byproduct of htl of which about 47 is in the form of ammonium 1 7 g l of nh4 n 33 recovery of fertilizers from this n rich stream and the p rich biochar resulting from htl can improve the sustainability and the preferential ranking of p4 feasibility of combining the aqueous phase and the leachate of biochar to recover 70 of p and 6 of n from primary effluent as struvite has been demonstrated at the pilot scale 29 recovering the remaining n from the supernatant of the struvite precipitation step via gas permeable membranes for example to yield ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer can further improve the preference of p4 59 as demonstrated in this case study the promethee method could be used by water industries to evaluate not only specific components of the sewage treatment system 6 10 but the integrated system as well utility and flexibility of the promethee method in evaluating the significance of process parameters under varying weightages and in analyzing the sensitivity of the results can also be of benefit to water industries when evaluating alternate systems 4 conclusions a multi criteria decision making approach is applied to evaluate four sewage treatment process configurations as alternatives to the conventional activated sludge process fifteen criteria related to the un sustainable development goals are used in this evaluation the current sewage treatment practice using the activated sludge process gained strict preference in only 4 of the 15 of the selected criteria while the emergent mixotrophic algal system is ranked as the most preferred alternative for sewage treatment a possible option to improve the ranking of the activated sludge process is to investigate the feasibility of recovering energy from the anaerobically digested solid residues rather than minimizing its energy demand for aeration ranking of the mixotrophic algal system could be further improved by increasing biomass density in the cultivation step and by integrating appropriate downstream technologies to maximize recovery of nitrogen from the aqueous byproduct of hydrothermal liquefaction declaration of authors contribution

13921,in this study different by product wastes i e fly ash fa and rice husk rh were analyzed in various proportions with other materials i e activated carbon ac activated alumina aa and quartz sand qs for the remediation of no3 and po4 3 using permeable reactive barrier prb generated from pit toilet leachate initially a batch analysis was conducted for finding the optimum material composition considering various significant parameters viz ph temperature initial concentration and dosage the experimental results suggest that no3 and po4 3 were successfully removed following the adsorption mechanism with an efficiency of more than 95 this removal efficiency was obtained with a mixture of ac rh aa qs and fa in a weight proportion of 1 2 1 2 4 at a controlled ph value of 6 langmuir isotherm model showed the most effective results with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 975 with a maximum sorption capacity of 32 6 mg g 1 and 46 5 mg g 1 for removal of no3 and po4 3 respectively the adsorption kinetic data for both no3 and po4 3 provided better relationships with the pseudo first order model further continuous fixed bed column analysis manifested that at 10 ml min 1 flow rate and 600 mg l 1 initial concentration of both no3 and po4 3 the reaction zone of the barrier provides a higher saturation time similarly the retention time of contaminant water was also found to be higher at 45 cm bed depth furthermore an adsorption desorption regeneration test observed a decent amount of material recovery after full exhaustion of reactive bed keywords permeable reactive barrier prb pit toilet leachate adsorption nitrate and phosphate contaminants desorption fly ash 1 introduction global biochemical cycles are highly influenced by human activities such as population explosion urbanization and agricultural activities these activities have increased the presence of nutrients amount particularly nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 beyond the acceptable limit into these biochemical cycles 1 2 these nutrients interfere with the biochemical cycles and change the likely trajectories of the natural processes particularly no3 and po4 3 contamination of groundwater by pit toilet leachate is a major environmental concern as it affects a major proportion i e 50 80 of water and aquifer in the subsurface 3 also the discharge of contaminated groundwater plumes in surface water bodies i e lake and ponds with excess amounts of no3 and po4 3 leads to eutrophication which increases the algal and other aquatic plant growth loss of species and disturbs the natural functioning of the ecosystem 4 5 in developing countries nearly 8 million people confess death every year due to water borne diseases mainly because of these contaminants 6 in india nearly 50 of the population is categorized as unsewered communities that rely on variants of pit toilets for disposal of human and or domestic waste 7 however lack of proper maintenance and ignorance of disposed of pit toilet waste management leads to a perilous scenario in the proximity aquifer and the groundwater 8 the entry of high concentration of no3 in drinking water has been found in most of the indian hydrogeological sub surfaces which increased methemoglobinemia cancers and thus causing death across the globe 9 further no3 can usually modify into nitrites which have high deleterious impacts on human health such as damage to the human liver blue baby syndrome and cancer 10 apart from no3 the presence of high amounts of po4 3 in groundwater contaminated plume when discharged in the surface water bodies causes depletion in oxygen levels in the water depletion of biodiversity reduction in transmission of light and the burgeoning of algal at the onset of eutrophication 11 therefore in the present scenario excessive no3 po4 3 and escherichia coli in drinking water wells due to pit toilet leachate infiltrates through the subsurface has underlined an urgent need to provide a cost effective and sustainable solution to mitigate groundwater contamination 9 12 it can be seen that the permeable reactive barriers prbs have emerged as an effective substitute to the conventional pump and treat p t technique and are also used in many field scale applications for pit toilet contamination management in various developing countries 13 17 the prbs that are filled with reactive material s can be seen as the most cost effective option to mitigate intercept and remove contaminants that are present in the subsurface 18 21 initially prb was used to treat variety of contaminants from groundwater using zerovalent iron zvi and granulated activated carbon gac 13 22 23 later many low cost materials such as rice husk and tea waste activated charcoal and teff straw cement kiln dust ckd mix with natural sand waste foundry sand wfs mixed with activated carbon and waterworks sludge filter sand were also used as a single as well as a combined matrix to treat the diverse toxic groundwater contaminants 24 25 various studies have proposed different reactive materials for the removal of no3 and po4 3 from the pit toilet leachate such as nano zero valent iron nzvi seagrass activated carbon ac and zeolite 26 29 however most of the studies found the composition of these materials in various forms more efficient than the individual application the mixture of nzvi with ac was able to remove 3 times more no3 and similarly high amount of po4 3 than the individual nzvi 26 it was found that clay 5 sand 95 mixture does not only act as an efficient reactive media for no3 removal from pit toilet but also work as immunization for the significant growth of denitrifying bacteria 3 however the growth of clay bentonite more than 5 from various experimental processes would also restrict the flow rate of the mixture 30 therefore it is important to analyze the optimum mixture ratio that would not disturb the remediation treatment process and can make it more sustainable and cost effective the researcher examined the reduction reactions of organic carbon ammonia and no3 concentration generated from pit toilet sewage considering the efficiency of an anaerobic aerobic and denitrification processes the low cost easily available reactive material mixture i e cattle manure sand and gravel were used as a bio barrier for the reduction of no3 and related compounds the exhaustive batch experiments showed that an anaerobic reduction is providing better results than an aerobic process and denitrification process in no3 reduction therefore based on experimental results they have built long term sustainable twin pit toilets to provide no3 amount within the permissible limit at the downstream of the pit toilet using low cost easily available material 8 a field scale prb for denitrification of groundwater can be used for the biological treatment process and the highest denitrification at the deepest part of prb can be seen where prb used as a carbon source for the denitrification process in the form of mulch and gravel mixture suggested as the ideal conditions for removal of no3 the field scale prb accounted for variations in groundwater conditions and meteorological parameters which existed at the site when the concentration of no3 was increased to 530 mg l 1 the removal efficiency decreased to 66 whereas the removal efficiency of greater than 97 was achieved up to a concentration of 280 mg l 1 which signifies the importance of initial concentration of contaminants on its removal efficiency 16 generally in the previous studies mostly the commercially available single materials comprise of high cost prbs were employed for in situ remediation of groundwater due to leachate generated from the pit toilet the previous studies also mainly dealt with the no3 removal from the pit toilet leachate but no concern has been raised about the po4 3 removal that could also be a major threat in the long term therefore the present objective of the study is to propose a prb which would act as a mixture of low cost multiple reactive materials barrier for the treatment of no3 and po4 3 generated from pit toilet leachate and also analyze the required scaling for the preventive measure to mitigate the percolation of no3 and po4 3 contaminant plume resulted from pit toilet leachate into the groundwater the removal of no3 and po4 3 using a composite material matrix is investigated at different significant parameters namely initial contaminant concentration the ph the temperature and the contact time isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies are also performed further long term investigation of a selected material matrix under dynamic flow conditions is also analyzed using a fixed bed reactor furthermore a post treatment material recovery process has also been conducted to see the reusability and recyclability of the used material for further treatment of pit toilet leachate 2 experimental work 2 1 synthetic pit toilet leachate synthetic wastewater was prepared to simulate different concentrations of no3 and po4 3 as per standard sodium nitrate nano3 and potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 were used for simulation of no3 and po4 3 in pit toilet leachate the chemical used in this study were of analytical grade the gram equivalents of nano3 and kh2po4 anions were added in 1 l of distilled water to prepare the stock solutions of no3 and po4 3 the required concentrations for experimental measurements were then obtained by diluting the freshly prepared stock solution with deionized water as per standard 31 2 2 reactive materials five different reactive materials were used for the present study viz fly ash fa quartz sand qs rice husk rh activated charcoal ac and activated alumina aa for the removal of no3 and po4 3 from pit toilet leachate earlier studies were conducted individually only on fa 32 34 qs 35 rh 36 ac 37 39 and aa 40 41 these materials have been found to be highly effective and efficient for the treatment of wastewater and groundwater remediation each of the above materials was mixed in varied proportions to determine the most efficient matrix combination of the reactive material fa was procured from badarpur thermal power station located in national capital region ncr delhi qs rh ac and aa were procured from a local chemical supplier rh obtained in raw form was first grinded to obtain fine grained particles and to increase the surface area available for reactive sites of contaminants on the surface of reactive material it was pretreated for analysis by washing using distilled water after which it was dried for 6 h at 105 c in an oven and was then cooled down for some time after removing from oven thereafter the obtained rh was again sieved to get the particle size ranging from 100 to 250 μm diameter using standard sieves qs was washed and then dried for the analysis purpose ac and aa were utilized directly the physical properties i e bulk density ρb porosity and permeability k of all the selected materials are shown in table 1 after performing the required tests in the laboratory 2 3 batch analysis the major purpose for conducting the batch experiments was to screen different reactive materials for their respective efficiency under different matrix configurations different significant factors such as the effect of ph effect of initial anion concentration adsorbent dosage and temperature were analyzed for their respective optimum values table 2 shows the different matrix configurations analyzed and c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 represent different adsorbent mixtures and their respective proportions the desired contaminant solutions and adsorbent dosages were introduced in 250 ml erlenmeyer conical flask the conical flasks were sealed with cotton and later covered using aluminum foil to prevent the effect of moist air and spillage respectively the prepared flasks were agitated on a horizontal oscillatory shaker at a speed of 150 rpm aliquots were procured at suitable stages from the mixture using a graduated pipette and were stored in standard sampling bottles after filtration by using whatman filter paper no 44 for the ph tests five different ph levels 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 were chosen to map different ph ranges for different matrix configurations the adsorbent dosage and initial concentration were fixed to 8 g l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively the experiments were performed at a temperature of 35 c for ph analysis liquor aliquots were collected up to 24 h the matrix configuration with the highest removal efficiency and the corresponding optimum ph was then fixed and the next series of tests were conducted for determination of the optimum temperature for the optimum matrix for this the temperature was varied between 25 c and 45 c at optimum ph 2 g l 1 adsorbent dosages and 150 mg l 1 initial concentration of both no3 and po4 3 the next series of tests were then conducted to analyze the effect of initial anionic concentration at different adsorbent loadings on the removal efficiency of optimum prb matrix for this purpose no3 and po4 3 concentration were varied between 50 mg l 1 to 150 mg l 1 at ph 6 and 35 c the adsorbent dosages were varied between 2 g l 1 10 g l 1 respectively the removal efficiency of no3 and po4 3 was measured in terms of percentage of removal as shown in eq 1 which can be defined as a change in the initial contaminant concentration and the equilibrium concentration to the initial concentration of the metal 42 1 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration and c e is the concentration at equilibrium 2 3 1 isotherm models adsorption parameters were obtained using the batch sorption results and different isotherm models i e langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm models were fitted to assess the sorption patterns of no3 and po4 3 over the reactive material surface sites langmuir s model indicates the homogeneity of the surface of exchanges and the ion exchange phenomenon 43 the langmuir isotherm was first introduced in 1916 44 and is based on an assumption that no interaction occurs between the adsorbed molecules of metals and that the adsorbent sites are distributed uniformly and are equal a linearized mathematical model presented by eq 2 of the same was used for the computation of maximum sorption capacity and the langmuir constant 45 2 1 q e 1 q m 1 q m a x l 1 c e where q e is the amount of no3 and po4 3 adsorbed on simulated reactive barrier materials matrix mg g 1 at equilibrium q m a x is the maximum sorption capacity in mg g 1 l is the langmuir constant l mg 1 and c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate q e can be determined by eq 3 3 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the initial and the equilibrium concentrations of the adsorbate mg l 1 v is the volume of the adsorbent l and m is the weight of the adsorbent in the batch study g freundlich model is used for describing a heterogeneous adsorption process 46 the model can be represented linearly as shown in eq 4 47 4 log q 1 n log c e l o g k f k f is the freundlich coefficient n is the sorption capacity q is the amount of no3 and po4 3 adsorbed on simulated reactive barrier materials matrix mg g 1 and c e is the initial and equilibrium concentrations 2 3 2 kinetic models the kinetic study of the adsorption process by the selected material matrix is investigated based on two different kinetic models i the pseudo first order ii the pseudo second order the pseudo first order model is defined as the irreversible sorption of the solid liquid systems which is described by the following rate as shown by eq 5 48 5 l n q e q t l n q e k f t where q e and q t denote the amount of contaminant adsorbed mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t k f min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order reaction however the pseudo second order model is based on the assumption that chemical sorption is one of the factors controlling the sorption kinetics and the rate expression can be seen in eq 6 48 6 t q t 1 k s q e 2 t q e where k s is the rate constant for pseudo second order reaction l mg min 1 q e and q t are the amounts of solute sorbed at equilibrium and at any time t respectively 2 4 column analysis based on metal removal efficiencies of different adsorbents in the batch experiments optimum matrix configuration was selected for carrying out the continuous fixed bed study under dynamic flow conditions using various sets of column experiments the purpose of the column analysis was to assess the long term performance of the desired matrix configuration towards the removal of nitrate and phosphate from the pit toilet leachate fig 1 shows the design and fabrication of a continuous adsorption column set up cylindrical acrylic glass columns were fabricated with height and diameter of 60 cm and 2 cm respectively a peristaltic pump was provided to maintain different flow rates and pump the required synthetic wastewater containing no3 and po4 3 at different concentrations to the column bed the column was provided with six ports each at an equal distance of 10 cm along the ends a composite matrix was prepared instead of a stratified matrix to prevent clogging which was observed in a stratified matrix configuration standard sand replaced a small fraction of the activated charcoal to ensure optimum permeability to prevent possible clogging and cementation control tests were performed without sand to analyze the interference and to assess the change in adsorption efficiency due to the addition of sand at the extreme ends of the column bed glass beads were placed to ensure uniform distribution of flow throughout the column treated samples of the adsorbents were packed in the fixed column bed with the density corresponding to 0 859 g l 1 the column was rinsed with distilled water to ensure that the structure contained no cracks different operating conditions were tested in the continuous column tests the first set of tests were performed to analyze the effect of flow rates on the uptake capacity of the chosen adsorbent for this purpose the flow rates were varied from 10 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 at ph 6 temperature 25 c and initial no3 and po4 3 concentration of 900 mg l 1 and 300 mg l 1 respectively the second set of tests was performed to analyze the effect of bed depth for this purpose the depth was varied from 15 cm to 45 cm respectively the flow rates were also varied from 10 ml min 1 30 ml min 1 for each of the bed depth to analyze the bed performance at different flow rates the third series of tests were performed to analyze the effect of initial pollutant loading on the bed performance and for this the initial concentration of nitrate and phosphate was varied as 600 ml min 1 900 ml min 1 and 1200 ml min 1 at ph 6 and a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 2 5 measurements the concentrations of no3 and po4 3 in the filtrate were analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer no3 and po4 3 concentrations were determined using the salicylic acid method 49 and the ascorbic acid method 50 respectively the samples were tested immediately after collection to avoid any variations in the sample s quality 2 6 bed depth model the bed depth service time bdst model was introduced by bohart and adams and it is significantly used for determining the relationship between service time in a breakthrough curve and the bed depth 51 it is used for the initial portion of the breakthrough curve i e up to the point where breakthrough time is achieved or up to 10 50 of the exhaust points 51 and can be shown by eq 7 52 7 ln c 0 c b 1 ln e x p k n 0 z η 1 k c 0 t the above relation 7 can be rearranged to derive a linear relationship between the service time t and the bed depth z as follows by eq 8 53 8 t n 0 z η c 0 1 k c 0 ln c 0 c b 1 where η is the flow rate cm hr 1 cb is the concentration at breakthrough time mg l 1 n 0 is the adsorption capacity per volume of the column bed and k is the rate constant mg h 1 the linearized form of the equation can be written by eq 9 9 t m z c x where the slope m can be used for the computation of n 0 as represented by eq 10 10 m n 0 η c 0 the reaction coefficient can be calculated using the intercept as shown in eq 11 11 c x 1 k c 0 ln c 0 c b 1 the computation of the critical depth z0 can also be done using the bdst model critical depth is the depth of the column to ensure that outlet concentration does not exceed the breakthrough concentration 54 it can be computed using the following eq 12 12 z 0 η k n 0 l n c 0 c b 1 where except z0 all terms are the same as mentioned in eq 10 and eq 11 2 7 desorption analysis for reactive material recovery after conducting the adsorption tests desorption analysis was conducted to analyze the recyclability and reusability of the optimum adsorbent configuration for this purpose 8 g l 1 of the adsorbent was used and batch analysis on the same was conducted using 100 mg l 1 of no3 and po4 3 solution at optimum ph at 25 c the adsorbent was filtered using whatman filter paper and the filtrate was passed in 0 01 m sodium hydroxide naoh solution for 1 h to promote desorption and extract the anions from the adsorbent the filtrate was then washed using distilled water to remove excess chemicals leftover and then dried for 24 h at room temperature thereafter the dried adsorbent was weighed to analyze the regeneration cycle of the adsorbent it was acidified using 0 1 m hcl for 2 h 55 and the first cycle was tested for its regeneration capability in this present study six of these regeneration cycles were analyzed for the determination of reactive material recovery from the exhausted sorbents 3 results and discussions 3 1 batch analysis 3 1 1 effect of initial ph initial ph of the solution plays an important role in the no3 and po4 3 uptake by different adsorbents as it controls the process of adsorption and significantly influences the binding efficiency of the adsorbent surface with the incoming anion 31 different adsorbents have a varied affinity towards contaminants at different ph levels fig 2 a b shows the maximum percentage removal versus ph curves for no3 and po4 3 when they react individually whereas fig 2 c d shows the removal of no3 and po4 3 using combined matrix adsorbents it can be observed from fig 2 a that for a no3 concentration of 100 mg l 1 agitated for 24 h the no3 uptake by fa increases with the increase in the ph from 2 4 however in most cases the solution behaves aggressively at a lower ph value like 2 but in this artificially prepared leachate solution no such aggressiveness was observed with the solution the removal percentage significantly increases between the ph range of 4 6 reaching a maximum removal efficiency of 92 54 at ph equal to 6 and near to constant between 6 10 similarly rh shows a maximum removal efficiency of nitrate i e 86 87 at ph 6 and the removal efficiency decreases substantially after ph 6 this takes place because of chemical coagulation apart from adsorption of constituents present in the respective adsorbents such as calcium oxide cao which dissociate into ca2 ions and increases the fixation of no3 onto the adsorbent surface this coagulation takes place at a lower ph range and thus faster removal of no3 occurs at a ph of 6 these observations corroborate the results reported for the removal of lead using fa wherein competition between pb2 and h ion was cited as the reason for the depression of its adsorption over the fa surface 31 no3 uptake on qs achieves equilibrium up to ph of 8 beyond which there was a negative impact of the increase in the ph with the maximum uptake occurring at ph 8 beyond which the removal efficiency remains constant therefore at ph 8 or as the solution turns alkaline the amount of no3 uptake reduces significantly also it can be seen from fig 2 a that the adsorbents in a combination of three materials increase the overall no3 uptake in the suspension the removal percentage is the highest for the combination of fa qs and rh in 2 1 1 respective weight proportions at ph of 6 with the removal efficiency of 95 45 and remaining constant thereafter thus signifying that combination of adsorbents can be significant in higher rates of no3 removal from wastewater fig 2 b shows the maximum percentage of removal versus ph curves for po4 3 it can be observed that similar to no3 removal po4 3 removal by fa and rh that occurs at ph 6 with the fa achieving higher removal efficiency of 93 76 contrary to the rh which was achieved 90 97 at the same ph for initial po4 3 concentration of 100 mg l 1 provided with the agitation of 24 h the observation similar to the no3 uptake can be explained with the presence of the cao group in the adsorbents which dissociates at lower ph into ca2 ion that could lead to the plausible formation of calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 as a precipitate po4 3 removal is mainly achieved due to the presence of ca2 in the aqueous solution 34 56 the ca2 reduces at high ph concentration thus meaning that even though the formation of hydroxyapatite hap occurs at higher ph ph 9 57 the amount of the ca2 present in the suspension is not sufficient at higher ph levels thus reducing the removal efficiencies of the adsorbents in the case of qs maximum removal of the po4 3 unlike in the case of no3 occurs at ph of 6 and at ph 6 ph plays a negative role by depressing the removal of po4 3 uptake by the adsorbent the removal efficiency at ph 6 was achieved as 93 65 whereas the removal efficiency falls to nearly 76 89 at ph 8 and 59 87 at ph 10 this observation can be attributed to the existence of different po4 3 anions at different ph the ph in the range of 4 6 po4 3 ion exists as monobasic anion h2po4 this increases the rate of removal of po4 3 due to easy ion exchange process similar results were also obtained by researchers 58 fig 2 c shows the removal efficiency of different combinations of adsorbents as presented in table 2 for both no3 and po4 3 at an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 it can be seen that the c2 matrix performs the best out of five combinations with the maximum removal at ph 6 fig 2 d shows the removal efficiency of the c2 matrix of no3 and po4 3 at different ph levels and the maximum removal such as 96 41 for po4 3 and 95 17 of no3 was achieved for c2 at ph 6 3 1 2 effect of adsorbent loading and initial no3 and po4 3 concentration after selecting the optimum material for adsorption the effect of the initial concentration of the anionic ions and adsorbent loadings were analyzed the ph was fixed at 6 optimum ph obtained for c2 matrix configuration and one of the two parameters viz adsorbent dosage and anionic concentration was fixed to analyze the other the adsorbent loading was varied between 2 10 g l 1 whereas the initial concentration of no3 and po4 3 was varied in the range of 50 mg l 1 and 150 mg l 1 at 35 c as depicted in fig 3 a b for no3 and po4 3 it can be observed for both no3 and po4 3 that an increase in the initial concentration can negatively impact the removal efficiency of the c2 matrix for every adsorbent dosage the removal efficiency is greatly affected by the adsorbent dosage with the removal efficiency increasing from 81 90 for 6 g l 1 dosage at a no3 concentration of 150 mg l 1 to about 95 9 at 10 g l 1 for the same anionic concentration similarly in the case of po4 3 the removal efficiency increases from 74 99 at 2 g l 1 to 96 66 for 150 mg l 1 concentration this observation can be attributed to the requirement of active bonding sites for higher adsorption of anions as the adsorbent dosage is increased the amount of surface area available is also increased thus leading to higher removal of no3 and po4 3 anions in other words the adsorption over the surface is hindered at higher anion concentration thus leading to less adsorption over the surface similar findings were obtained for fa as an adsorbent material for removal of no3 and po4 3 56 3 1 3 effect of solution temperature temperature significantly affects the removal efficiency of no3 and po4 3 as it depicts the endothermic or the exothermic nature of the sorption process 59 fig 3 a b shows the removal efficiency versus temperature curves at different temperatures between 20 c 50 c it can be deciphered from fig 4 a that for temperature 45 c no3 uptake by the c2 matrix increases with the increase in the temperature which suggests that the process of sorption follows an endothermic path it may be due to an increase in the adsorption sites for active adsorption of the no3 anion that could be a factor affecting the removal efficiency these results corroborate the results reported by researchers 60 for no3 removal using sugar beet bagasse produced by activated carbon similar findings were reported for the removal of no3 using banana peel and fa 61 at temperature 45 c however the removal efficiency of the adsorbent decreased similarly for po4 3 it can be observed from fig 4 b that the removal increased with an increase in temperature up to 45 c but beyond 45 c there was a negative effect of the increase in the temperature the reason for such an observation can be cited to the fact that an increase in temperature affects the chemical potential which is one of the governing factors for the degree of adsorption and it also affects the solubility of the adsorbate in the suspension as proffered 59 increment in the temperature effects the chemical potential of the adsorbate depending upon its effect on the solubility it can be seen that with the increase in temperature the solubility of the adsorbate increases and there is a subsequent decrease in its chemical potential which thus decreases the adsorption over the adsorbate similarly if the temperature increases there is a decrease in the solubility of the adsorbate therefore there can be either a decrease or an increase of adsorption depending upon the predominance of either the solubility effect or the normal temperature effect another explanation for the decrease in the removal rate beyond 45 c is the fact that adsorption could be followed by desorption at a temperature greater than 45 c thus impeding the process of anionic removal the entropy and enthalpy of the equation due to temperature variation could be found with van t hoff s description as shown in eq 11 11 ln k e q δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t where k e q is the equilibrium constant t is the temperature in kelvin and δ s 0 and δ h 0 are the change in entropy and enthalpy respectively the slope of the linear van t hoff graph ln k e q vs 1 t and the intercept provides the values of the δ h 0 and δ s 0 respectively fig 5 a b shows the van t hoff curves for no3 and po4 3 and table 3 shows the values of δ s 0 and δ h 0 for no3 and po4 3 the positive value of δ h 0 confirms the endothermic state of the adsorption process for an adsorption process to be highly efficient the free energy changes viz δ g 0 must be negative the thermodynamic relationship between the δ g 0 δ s 0 and δ h 0 suggests that for the value of δ g 0 to be negative in the case when δ s 0 0 value δ h 0 must be smaller than the value of t δ s 0 hence the value of δ g 0 must be negative for the adsorption process negative value of δ g 0 suggests that the adsorption process is feasible and spontaneous it also suggests that the process of adsorption led to a decrease in gibbs free energy a positive value for both δ s 0 and δ h 0 is expected for precipitation reaction of basic anions and acidic cations as both are electrostatic structure makers 3 2 adsorption isotherms from batch experimental analysis the concentration of no3 and po4 3 were varied between 50 mg l 1 500 mg l 1 at ph 6 and 30 c for analyzing the equilibrium concentration fig 6 shows the sorption capacity versus concentration at the equilibrium curve for no3 and po4 3 anions it can be observed that the sorption capacity of po4 3 is higher than that of no3 suggesting that the binding between the po4 3 anion and the c2 matrix is higher and more efficient fig 7 a d shows the langmuir and freundlich curves for no3 and po4 3 and table 4 shows that the langmuir model best fits the experimental results with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 975 in comparison to 0 9132 for freundlich curve 3 3 kinetic study the kinetic study of no3 and po4 3 adsorption was studied using the pseudo first order kinetic model and the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 8 a and b shows the pseudo first order plot of log qe q versus contact time min for no3 and po4 3 whereas fig 8 c and d shows the pseudo second order plot of t q versus contact time min for no3 and po4 3 both the kinetic models provide an acceptable relationship for the kinetic of the adsorption process for both no3 and po4 3 for the selected c2 material matrix however the pseudo first order shows a better relationship of adsorption kinetics for no3 and po4 3 with the coefficient of determination r2 value as 0 97 each for both no3 and po4 3 which is more than the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics the rate constants and other estimated parameters for each system are given in table 5 3 4 fixed bed column testing 3 4 1 effect of influent flow rates on the breakthrough curves the highest removal efficiency for the c2 matrix was obtained at ph 6 and therefore the fixed bed analysis was conducted at a fixed ph of 6 in room temperature at depth of 30 cm with different influent rates fig 9 a b shows the variations in the breakthrough curve at different flow rates the point at which the effluent concentration begins to rise at a rapid rate which could be due to movement of the adsorption zone upwards and the upper edge of this adsorption zone beginning to arrive at the top of the column is known as the breakthrough point 62 it can be observed that the increase in the flow rate significantly reduces the breakthrough time however the breakthrough occurs at the same point at c co equal to 0 40 for each of the flow rates the shape of the breakthrough curve is obtained as a typical s shape the exhaust time corresponding to c co equal to 0 98 also reduces significantly with the increase in the flow rate the exhaust time for a 10 ml min 1 flow rate can be observed as 5200 min whereas for a 30 ml min 1 flow rate the exhaust time reduces to 3600 min the reason for this observation could be the reduction in the empty bed contact time ebct which reduces the diffusion capability of anions and the adsorbate thereby lowering the removal efficiency and thus signifying the importance of providing higher contact time for the adsorbent to reach a substantial uptake capacity and also obtain similar results reported by researchers 51 this observation can also be perceived from the steep movement of the curve at higher flow rates which suggests that the contact time between the anions and the c2 matrix is considerably less due to which the removal efficiency is also low in other words as the flow rate is increased the residence time decreases as a result of which the exhaust time decreases and leads to a reduction in the removal efficiency at the higher flow rates the front of the adsorption zone reaches the top of the column swiftly and reduces the saturation time 63 however in case of lower flow rates a shallow adsorption zone is formed as a result of longer contact time similar observations on flow rates were also reported by researchers 64 62 the results thus indicate that the adsorbent can be beneficial for the removal of anions at the lower flow rates further the hydraulic permeability was decreased very slightly from 8 9 10 3 cm sec 1 in the normal state to 4 5 10 4 cm sec 1 at the state of full exhaustion of the reactive material which proves the acceptable permeability even after full simulation of column experiments at all flow rates 3 4 2 effect of change in the bed depths on breakthrough curve the effect of bed depth on the breakthrough curve was analyzed by varying the depth at 15 cm 45 cm at an increment of 15 cm keeping the flow rate constant at 10 ml min 1 it can be observed from fig10 a b that the slope and the shape of the breakthrough curve changes with the change in the bed depth the gradient of the breakthrough curves decreases with the increase in the bed depth suggesting that a wider mass transfer zone is created as a result of depth increment 65 66 the saturation time and breakthrough time increase with the increase in the bed depth at a bed depth of 45 cm the saturation time is obtained as 7400 min which is almost double the saturation time obtained at 15 cm depth which comes out to be 3800 h this is due to the increase in the surface area of adsorption which results in a larger number of active sites for the adsorption process that took place longer contact time is obtained which results in larger saturation time and such findings were also reported by researchers 62 67 3 4 3 bed depth service time bdst model in the present study the bdst model was analyzed to assess the effect of varying flow rates on bed performance fig 11 a b shows the breakthrough time versus bed depth curves for po4 3 and no3 respectively at different flow rates table 6 illustrates the different parameters of the fixed bed column analysis using c2 matrix adsorbent at an anionic concentration of 600 mg l 1 each the value of r2 i e 0 97 0 99 were obtained for both no3 and po4 3 suggesting that the bdst model fits the experimental data well it can be observed from table 7 that the adsorption capacity n0 decreases with the increase in the flow rates thus suggesting that the sorption process deteriorates with increasing flow rates it can also be seen that the values of rate constant increases with the increase in the flow rates 3 4 4 effect of influent concentration the concentration fluctuations in pit toilet sewage might influence the performance of the adsorbent for analyzing this three different concentrations of no3 and po4 3 were analyzed viz 600 mg l 1 900 mg l 1 and 1200 mg l 1 respectively it can be observed from the curves as shown in fig 12 a b that the saturation time increases with the decrease in influent concentration the possible reason for this observation could be the greater availability of the active sites on the reactive materials for adsorption to occur efficiently it can also be seen that greater binding for po4 3 in comparison to no3 which commensurate with the results obtained in the isotherm study further the breakthrough time also decreases with an increase in concentration 3 5 regeneration and desorption study the greatest utilization of the prb can be achieved if the nutrients which are adsorbed onto the adsorbent can be desorbed to reuse or recycle it as a fertilizer agricultural use or utilizing the contaminant anions to achieve various environmental and economic benefits along with the reusability of adsorbents for the removal process up to certain extents the placement of the prbs emplaced underground in the subsurface also requires longer operational life so that it remains economically efficient and environmentally viable therefore after extensive adsorption experiments for no3 and po4 3 removal using various adsorbents matrix an analysis of the desorption capability of the c2 matrix was also been investigated to ensure the reusability of the reactive material with pit toilet leachate remediation fig 13 shows the relation between the desorption kinetics curve and time for the adsorbent it can be observed that the complete desorption of both the anions no3 and po4 3 could be achieved within 15 min table 8 shows the regeneration cycles for the c2 adsorbent matrix and it indicates a small difference in the uptake capacity of the adsorbent matrix in each of the six regeneration cycles which suggests that the chosen adsorbent material is highly effective for continuous sorption processes 4 conclusions the findings of the present study suggest that the prb can prove to be an efficient and cost effective technology for no3 and po4 3 removal from pit toilet leachate with a proper set of matrix configuration of low cost permeable reactive materials all the short term batch and long term column experiments proved that the potential use of waste by products could be taken as an effective prb material when mixed in an effective proportional with the traditionally used material for remediation the adsorbent matrix containing c2 as ac rh aa qs and fa in the weight proportion of 1 2 1 2 4 was found to remove effectively more than 95 of both no3 and po4 3 from the synthetic pit toilet leachate at the ph value of 6 further it was observed that the material matrix performed better than the individual reactive material interaction furthermore it was also seen that the temperature also played an important role in the adsorption process it also shows that the uptake capacity of the material matrix for no3 and po4 3 removal can increase by 10 at every 10 c increment of temperature from 25 c up to 45 c the process is suggesting an endothermic adsorption process which was further validated by von t hoff equation with the positive values of the standard enthalpy of adsorption δ h 0 kcal mol 1 of 15 78 and 19 872 for no3 and po4 3 however the uptake capacity is seen reducing if the temperature goes above 45 c due to change in the chemical potential at higher temperatures langmuir isotherm provided better adsorption results with an r2 value of 0 97 than the freundlich isotherm the maximum sorption capacity was found to be 32 6 mg g 1 and 46 5 mg g 1 for the removal of no3 and po4 3 the obtained optimum matrix was used for conducting a continuous fixed bed column experimental analysis it is observed that the increase in the flow rates from 10 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 decreases the saturation time up to 30 in the reactive zone and the breakthrough time whereas an increase in the bed depth can increase the uptake due to larger active sites available for adsorption however greater binding of po4 3 occur with the c2 material matrix compared to no3 in the established reactive zone furthermore the adsorption desorption study revealed that the chosen adsorbent matrix did not lose much of the efficiency in the six cycles and thus can be reused effectively for the further treatment process therefore the recovery of the reactive material after the exhaustion of the reactive material could also help in the sustainability of the prb technology for providing long term performance in pit toilet leachate remediation however the characterization of such kind of effective low cost and highly efficient mixed sorbents can also be encouraged for the further studies for analyzing the predominant mechanism involved in the removal of no3 and po4 3 originated from pit toilet leachate like another contaminant sources declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any conflict of interest acknowledgment the

13921,in this study different by product wastes i e fly ash fa and rice husk rh were analyzed in various proportions with other materials i e activated carbon ac activated alumina aa and quartz sand qs for the remediation of no3 and po4 3 using permeable reactive barrier prb generated from pit toilet leachate initially a batch analysis was conducted for finding the optimum material composition considering various significant parameters viz ph temperature initial concentration and dosage the experimental results suggest that no3 and po4 3 were successfully removed following the adsorption mechanism with an efficiency of more than 95 this removal efficiency was obtained with a mixture of ac rh aa qs and fa in a weight proportion of 1 2 1 2 4 at a controlled ph value of 6 langmuir isotherm model showed the most effective results with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 975 with a maximum sorption capacity of 32 6 mg g 1 and 46 5 mg g 1 for removal of no3 and po4 3 respectively the adsorption kinetic data for both no3 and po4 3 provided better relationships with the pseudo first order model further continuous fixed bed column analysis manifested that at 10 ml min 1 flow rate and 600 mg l 1 initial concentration of both no3 and po4 3 the reaction zone of the barrier provides a higher saturation time similarly the retention time of contaminant water was also found to be higher at 45 cm bed depth furthermore an adsorption desorption regeneration test observed a decent amount of material recovery after full exhaustion of reactive bed keywords permeable reactive barrier prb pit toilet leachate adsorption nitrate and phosphate contaminants desorption fly ash 1 introduction global biochemical cycles are highly influenced by human activities such as population explosion urbanization and agricultural activities these activities have increased the presence of nutrients amount particularly nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 beyond the acceptable limit into these biochemical cycles 1 2 these nutrients interfere with the biochemical cycles and change the likely trajectories of the natural processes particularly no3 and po4 3 contamination of groundwater by pit toilet leachate is a major environmental concern as it affects a major proportion i e 50 80 of water and aquifer in the subsurface 3 also the discharge of contaminated groundwater plumes in surface water bodies i e lake and ponds with excess amounts of no3 and po4 3 leads to eutrophication which increases the algal and other aquatic plant growth loss of species and disturbs the natural functioning of the ecosystem 4 5 in developing countries nearly 8 million people confess death every year due to water borne diseases mainly because of these contaminants 6 in india nearly 50 of the population is categorized as unsewered communities that rely on variants of pit toilets for disposal of human and or domestic waste 7 however lack of proper maintenance and ignorance of disposed of pit toilet waste management leads to a perilous scenario in the proximity aquifer and the groundwater 8 the entry of high concentration of no3 in drinking water has been found in most of the indian hydrogeological sub surfaces which increased methemoglobinemia cancers and thus causing death across the globe 9 further no3 can usually modify into nitrites which have high deleterious impacts on human health such as damage to the human liver blue baby syndrome and cancer 10 apart from no3 the presence of high amounts of po4 3 in groundwater contaminated plume when discharged in the surface water bodies causes depletion in oxygen levels in the water depletion of biodiversity reduction in transmission of light and the burgeoning of algal at the onset of eutrophication 11 therefore in the present scenario excessive no3 po4 3 and escherichia coli in drinking water wells due to pit toilet leachate infiltrates through the subsurface has underlined an urgent need to provide a cost effective and sustainable solution to mitigate groundwater contamination 9 12 it can be seen that the permeable reactive barriers prbs have emerged as an effective substitute to the conventional pump and treat p t technique and are also used in many field scale applications for pit toilet contamination management in various developing countries 13 17 the prbs that are filled with reactive material s can be seen as the most cost effective option to mitigate intercept and remove contaminants that are present in the subsurface 18 21 initially prb was used to treat variety of contaminants from groundwater using zerovalent iron zvi and granulated activated carbon gac 13 22 23 later many low cost materials such as rice husk and tea waste activated charcoal and teff straw cement kiln dust ckd mix with natural sand waste foundry sand wfs mixed with activated carbon and waterworks sludge filter sand were also used as a single as well as a combined matrix to treat the diverse toxic groundwater contaminants 24 25 various studies have proposed different reactive materials for the removal of no3 and po4 3 from the pit toilet leachate such as nano zero valent iron nzvi seagrass activated carbon ac and zeolite 26 29 however most of the studies found the composition of these materials in various forms more efficient than the individual application the mixture of nzvi with ac was able to remove 3 times more no3 and similarly high amount of po4 3 than the individual nzvi 26 it was found that clay 5 sand 95 mixture does not only act as an efficient reactive media for no3 removal from pit toilet but also work as immunization for the significant growth of denitrifying bacteria 3 however the growth of clay bentonite more than 5 from various experimental processes would also restrict the flow rate of the mixture 30 therefore it is important to analyze the optimum mixture ratio that would not disturb the remediation treatment process and can make it more sustainable and cost effective the researcher examined the reduction reactions of organic carbon ammonia and no3 concentration generated from pit toilet sewage considering the efficiency of an anaerobic aerobic and denitrification processes the low cost easily available reactive material mixture i e cattle manure sand and gravel were used as a bio barrier for the reduction of no3 and related compounds the exhaustive batch experiments showed that an anaerobic reduction is providing better results than an aerobic process and denitrification process in no3 reduction therefore based on experimental results they have built long term sustainable twin pit toilets to provide no3 amount within the permissible limit at the downstream of the pit toilet using low cost easily available material 8 a field scale prb for denitrification of groundwater can be used for the biological treatment process and the highest denitrification at the deepest part of prb can be seen where prb used as a carbon source for the denitrification process in the form of mulch and gravel mixture suggested as the ideal conditions for removal of no3 the field scale prb accounted for variations in groundwater conditions and meteorological parameters which existed at the site when the concentration of no3 was increased to 530 mg l 1 the removal efficiency decreased to 66 whereas the removal efficiency of greater than 97 was achieved up to a concentration of 280 mg l 1 which signifies the importance of initial concentration of contaminants on its removal efficiency 16 generally in the previous studies mostly the commercially available single materials comprise of high cost prbs were employed for in situ remediation of groundwater due to leachate generated from the pit toilet the previous studies also mainly dealt with the no3 removal from the pit toilet leachate but no concern has been raised about the po4 3 removal that could also be a major threat in the long term therefore the present objective of the study is to propose a prb which would act as a mixture of low cost multiple reactive materials barrier for the treatment of no3 and po4 3 generated from pit toilet leachate and also analyze the required scaling for the preventive measure to mitigate the percolation of no3 and po4 3 contaminant plume resulted from pit toilet leachate into the groundwater the removal of no3 and po4 3 using a composite material matrix is investigated at different significant parameters namely initial contaminant concentration the ph the temperature and the contact time isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies are also performed further long term investigation of a selected material matrix under dynamic flow conditions is also analyzed using a fixed bed reactor furthermore a post treatment material recovery process has also been conducted to see the reusability and recyclability of the used material for further treatment of pit toilet leachate 2 experimental work 2 1 synthetic pit toilet leachate synthetic wastewater was prepared to simulate different concentrations of no3 and po4 3 as per standard sodium nitrate nano3 and potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 were used for simulation of no3 and po4 3 in pit toilet leachate the chemical used in this study were of analytical grade the gram equivalents of nano3 and kh2po4 anions were added in 1 l of distilled water to prepare the stock solutions of no3 and po4 3 the required concentrations for experimental measurements were then obtained by diluting the freshly prepared stock solution with deionized water as per standard 31 2 2 reactive materials five different reactive materials were used for the present study viz fly ash fa quartz sand qs rice husk rh activated charcoal ac and activated alumina aa for the removal of no3 and po4 3 from pit toilet leachate earlier studies were conducted individually only on fa 32 34 qs 35 rh 36 ac 37 39 and aa 40 41 these materials have been found to be highly effective and efficient for the treatment of wastewater and groundwater remediation each of the above materials was mixed in varied proportions to determine the most efficient matrix combination of the reactive material fa was procured from badarpur thermal power station located in national capital region ncr delhi qs rh ac and aa were procured from a local chemical supplier rh obtained in raw form was first grinded to obtain fine grained particles and to increase the surface area available for reactive sites of contaminants on the surface of reactive material it was pretreated for analysis by washing using distilled water after which it was dried for 6 h at 105 c in an oven and was then cooled down for some time after removing from oven thereafter the obtained rh was again sieved to get the particle size ranging from 100 to 250 μm diameter using standard sieves qs was washed and then dried for the analysis purpose ac and aa were utilized directly the physical properties i e bulk density ρb porosity and permeability k of all the selected materials are shown in table 1 after performing the required tests in the laboratory 2 3 batch analysis the major purpose for conducting the batch experiments was to screen different reactive materials for their respective efficiency under different matrix configurations different significant factors such as the effect of ph effect of initial anion concentration adsorbent dosage and temperature were analyzed for their respective optimum values table 2 shows the different matrix configurations analyzed and c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 represent different adsorbent mixtures and their respective proportions the desired contaminant solutions and adsorbent dosages were introduced in 250 ml erlenmeyer conical flask the conical flasks were sealed with cotton and later covered using aluminum foil to prevent the effect of moist air and spillage respectively the prepared flasks were agitated on a horizontal oscillatory shaker at a speed of 150 rpm aliquots were procured at suitable stages from the mixture using a graduated pipette and were stored in standard sampling bottles after filtration by using whatman filter paper no 44 for the ph tests five different ph levels 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 were chosen to map different ph ranges for different matrix configurations the adsorbent dosage and initial concentration were fixed to 8 g l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively the experiments were performed at a temperature of 35 c for ph analysis liquor aliquots were collected up to 24 h the matrix configuration with the highest removal efficiency and the corresponding optimum ph was then fixed and the next series of tests were conducted for determination of the optimum temperature for the optimum matrix for this the temperature was varied between 25 c and 45 c at optimum ph 2 g l 1 adsorbent dosages and 150 mg l 1 initial concentration of both no3 and po4 3 the next series of tests were then conducted to analyze the effect of initial anionic concentration at different adsorbent loadings on the removal efficiency of optimum prb matrix for this purpose no3 and po4 3 concentration were varied between 50 mg l 1 to 150 mg l 1 at ph 6 and 35 c the adsorbent dosages were varied between 2 g l 1 10 g l 1 respectively the removal efficiency of no3 and po4 3 was measured in terms of percentage of removal as shown in eq 1 which can be defined as a change in the initial contaminant concentration and the equilibrium concentration to the initial concentration of the metal 42 1 r e m o v a l c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial concentration and c e is the concentration at equilibrium 2 3 1 isotherm models adsorption parameters were obtained using the batch sorption results and different isotherm models i e langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm models were fitted to assess the sorption patterns of no3 and po4 3 over the reactive material surface sites langmuir s model indicates the homogeneity of the surface of exchanges and the ion exchange phenomenon 43 the langmuir isotherm was first introduced in 1916 44 and is based on an assumption that no interaction occurs between the adsorbed molecules of metals and that the adsorbent sites are distributed uniformly and are equal a linearized mathematical model presented by eq 2 of the same was used for the computation of maximum sorption capacity and the langmuir constant 45 2 1 q e 1 q m 1 q m a x l 1 c e where q e is the amount of no3 and po4 3 adsorbed on simulated reactive barrier materials matrix mg g 1 at equilibrium q m a x is the maximum sorption capacity in mg g 1 l is the langmuir constant l mg 1 and c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate q e can be determined by eq 3 3 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the initial and the equilibrium concentrations of the adsorbate mg l 1 v is the volume of the adsorbent l and m is the weight of the adsorbent in the batch study g freundlich model is used for describing a heterogeneous adsorption process 46 the model can be represented linearly as shown in eq 4 47 4 log q 1 n log c e l o g k f k f is the freundlich coefficient n is the sorption capacity q is the amount of no3 and po4 3 adsorbed on simulated reactive barrier materials matrix mg g 1 and c e is the initial and equilibrium concentrations 2 3 2 kinetic models the kinetic study of the adsorption process by the selected material matrix is investigated based on two different kinetic models i the pseudo first order ii the pseudo second order the pseudo first order model is defined as the irreversible sorption of the solid liquid systems which is described by the following rate as shown by eq 5 48 5 l n q e q t l n q e k f t where q e and q t denote the amount of contaminant adsorbed mg g 1 at equilibrium and at time t k f min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order reaction however the pseudo second order model is based on the assumption that chemical sorption is one of the factors controlling the sorption kinetics and the rate expression can be seen in eq 6 48 6 t q t 1 k s q e 2 t q e where k s is the rate constant for pseudo second order reaction l mg min 1 q e and q t are the amounts of solute sorbed at equilibrium and at any time t respectively 2 4 column analysis based on metal removal efficiencies of different adsorbents in the batch experiments optimum matrix configuration was selected for carrying out the continuous fixed bed study under dynamic flow conditions using various sets of column experiments the purpose of the column analysis was to assess the long term performance of the desired matrix configuration towards the removal of nitrate and phosphate from the pit toilet leachate fig 1 shows the design and fabrication of a continuous adsorption column set up cylindrical acrylic glass columns were fabricated with height and diameter of 60 cm and 2 cm respectively a peristaltic pump was provided to maintain different flow rates and pump the required synthetic wastewater containing no3 and po4 3 at different concentrations to the column bed the column was provided with six ports each at an equal distance of 10 cm along the ends a composite matrix was prepared instead of a stratified matrix to prevent clogging which was observed in a stratified matrix configuration standard sand replaced a small fraction of the activated charcoal to ensure optimum permeability to prevent possible clogging and cementation control tests were performed without sand to analyze the interference and to assess the change in adsorption efficiency due to the addition of sand at the extreme ends of the column bed glass beads were placed to ensure uniform distribution of flow throughout the column treated samples of the adsorbents were packed in the fixed column bed with the density corresponding to 0 859 g l 1 the column was rinsed with distilled water to ensure that the structure contained no cracks different operating conditions were tested in the continuous column tests the first set of tests were performed to analyze the effect of flow rates on the uptake capacity of the chosen adsorbent for this purpose the flow rates were varied from 10 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 at ph 6 temperature 25 c and initial no3 and po4 3 concentration of 900 mg l 1 and 300 mg l 1 respectively the second set of tests was performed to analyze the effect of bed depth for this purpose the depth was varied from 15 cm to 45 cm respectively the flow rates were also varied from 10 ml min 1 30 ml min 1 for each of the bed depth to analyze the bed performance at different flow rates the third series of tests were performed to analyze the effect of initial pollutant loading on the bed performance and for this the initial concentration of nitrate and phosphate was varied as 600 ml min 1 900 ml min 1 and 1200 ml min 1 at ph 6 and a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 2 5 measurements the concentrations of no3 and po4 3 in the filtrate were analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometer no3 and po4 3 concentrations were determined using the salicylic acid method 49 and the ascorbic acid method 50 respectively the samples were tested immediately after collection to avoid any variations in the sample s quality 2 6 bed depth model the bed depth service time bdst model was introduced by bohart and adams and it is significantly used for determining the relationship between service time in a breakthrough curve and the bed depth 51 it is used for the initial portion of the breakthrough curve i e up to the point where breakthrough time is achieved or up to 10 50 of the exhaust points 51 and can be shown by eq 7 52 7 ln c 0 c b 1 ln e x p k n 0 z η 1 k c 0 t the above relation 7 can be rearranged to derive a linear relationship between the service time t and the bed depth z as follows by eq 8 53 8 t n 0 z η c 0 1 k c 0 ln c 0 c b 1 where η is the flow rate cm hr 1 cb is the concentration at breakthrough time mg l 1 n 0 is the adsorption capacity per volume of the column bed and k is the rate constant mg h 1 the linearized form of the equation can be written by eq 9 9 t m z c x where the slope m can be used for the computation of n 0 as represented by eq 10 10 m n 0 η c 0 the reaction coefficient can be calculated using the intercept as shown in eq 11 11 c x 1 k c 0 ln c 0 c b 1 the computation of the critical depth z0 can also be done using the bdst model critical depth is the depth of the column to ensure that outlet concentration does not exceed the breakthrough concentration 54 it can be computed using the following eq 12 12 z 0 η k n 0 l n c 0 c b 1 where except z0 all terms are the same as mentioned in eq 10 and eq 11 2 7 desorption analysis for reactive material recovery after conducting the adsorption tests desorption analysis was conducted to analyze the recyclability and reusability of the optimum adsorbent configuration for this purpose 8 g l 1 of the adsorbent was used and batch analysis on the same was conducted using 100 mg l 1 of no3 and po4 3 solution at optimum ph at 25 c the adsorbent was filtered using whatman filter paper and the filtrate was passed in 0 01 m sodium hydroxide naoh solution for 1 h to promote desorption and extract the anions from the adsorbent the filtrate was then washed using distilled water to remove excess chemicals leftover and then dried for 24 h at room temperature thereafter the dried adsorbent was weighed to analyze the regeneration cycle of the adsorbent it was acidified using 0 1 m hcl for 2 h 55 and the first cycle was tested for its regeneration capability in this present study six of these regeneration cycles were analyzed for the determination of reactive material recovery from the exhausted sorbents 3 results and discussions 3 1 batch analysis 3 1 1 effect of initial ph initial ph of the solution plays an important role in the no3 and po4 3 uptake by different adsorbents as it controls the process of adsorption and significantly influences the binding efficiency of the adsorbent surface with the incoming anion 31 different adsorbents have a varied affinity towards contaminants at different ph levels fig 2 a b shows the maximum percentage removal versus ph curves for no3 and po4 3 when they react individually whereas fig 2 c d shows the removal of no3 and po4 3 using combined matrix adsorbents it can be observed from fig 2 a that for a no3 concentration of 100 mg l 1 agitated for 24 h the no3 uptake by fa increases with the increase in the ph from 2 4 however in most cases the solution behaves aggressively at a lower ph value like 2 but in this artificially prepared leachate solution no such aggressiveness was observed with the solution the removal percentage significantly increases between the ph range of 4 6 reaching a maximum removal efficiency of 92 54 at ph equal to 6 and near to constant between 6 10 similarly rh shows a maximum removal efficiency of nitrate i e 86 87 at ph 6 and the removal efficiency decreases substantially after ph 6 this takes place because of chemical coagulation apart from adsorption of constituents present in the respective adsorbents such as calcium oxide cao which dissociate into ca2 ions and increases the fixation of no3 onto the adsorbent surface this coagulation takes place at a lower ph range and thus faster removal of no3 occurs at a ph of 6 these observations corroborate the results reported for the removal of lead using fa wherein competition between pb2 and h ion was cited as the reason for the depression of its adsorption over the fa surface 31 no3 uptake on qs achieves equilibrium up to ph of 8 beyond which there was a negative impact of the increase in the ph with the maximum uptake occurring at ph 8 beyond which the removal efficiency remains constant therefore at ph 8 or as the solution turns alkaline the amount of no3 uptake reduces significantly also it can be seen from fig 2 a that the adsorbents in a combination of three materials increase the overall no3 uptake in the suspension the removal percentage is the highest for the combination of fa qs and rh in 2 1 1 respective weight proportions at ph of 6 with the removal efficiency of 95 45 and remaining constant thereafter thus signifying that combination of adsorbents can be significant in higher rates of no3 removal from wastewater fig 2 b shows the maximum percentage of removal versus ph curves for po4 3 it can be observed that similar to no3 removal po4 3 removal by fa and rh that occurs at ph 6 with the fa achieving higher removal efficiency of 93 76 contrary to the rh which was achieved 90 97 at the same ph for initial po4 3 concentration of 100 mg l 1 provided with the agitation of 24 h the observation similar to the no3 uptake can be explained with the presence of the cao group in the adsorbents which dissociates at lower ph into ca2 ion that could lead to the plausible formation of calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 as a precipitate po4 3 removal is mainly achieved due to the presence of ca2 in the aqueous solution 34 56 the ca2 reduces at high ph concentration thus meaning that even though the formation of hydroxyapatite hap occurs at higher ph ph 9 57 the amount of the ca2 present in the suspension is not sufficient at higher ph levels thus reducing the removal efficiencies of the adsorbents in the case of qs maximum removal of the po4 3 unlike in the case of no3 occurs at ph of 6 and at ph 6 ph plays a negative role by depressing the removal of po4 3 uptake by the adsorbent the removal efficiency at ph 6 was achieved as 93 65 whereas the removal efficiency falls to nearly 76 89 at ph 8 and 59 87 at ph 10 this observation can be attributed to the existence of different po4 3 anions at different ph the ph in the range of 4 6 po4 3 ion exists as monobasic anion h2po4 this increases the rate of removal of po4 3 due to easy ion exchange process similar results were also obtained by researchers 58 fig 2 c shows the removal efficiency of different combinations of adsorbents as presented in table 2 for both no3 and po4 3 at an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 it can be seen that the c2 matrix performs the best out of five combinations with the maximum removal at ph 6 fig 2 d shows the removal efficiency of the c2 matrix of no3 and po4 3 at different ph levels and the maximum removal such as 96 41 for po4 3 and 95 17 of no3 was achieved for c2 at ph 6 3 1 2 effect of adsorbent loading and initial no3 and po4 3 concentration after selecting the optimum material for adsorption the effect of the initial concentration of the anionic ions and adsorbent loadings were analyzed the ph was fixed at 6 optimum ph obtained for c2 matrix configuration and one of the two parameters viz adsorbent dosage and anionic concentration was fixed to analyze the other the adsorbent loading was varied between 2 10 g l 1 whereas the initial concentration of no3 and po4 3 was varied in the range of 50 mg l 1 and 150 mg l 1 at 35 c as depicted in fig 3 a b for no3 and po4 3 it can be observed for both no3 and po4 3 that an increase in the initial concentration can negatively impact the removal efficiency of the c2 matrix for every adsorbent dosage the removal efficiency is greatly affected by the adsorbent dosage with the removal efficiency increasing from 81 90 for 6 g l 1 dosage at a no3 concentration of 150 mg l 1 to about 95 9 at 10 g l 1 for the same anionic concentration similarly in the case of po4 3 the removal efficiency increases from 74 99 at 2 g l 1 to 96 66 for 150 mg l 1 concentration this observation can be attributed to the requirement of active bonding sites for higher adsorption of anions as the adsorbent dosage is increased the amount of surface area available is also increased thus leading to higher removal of no3 and po4 3 anions in other words the adsorption over the surface is hindered at higher anion concentration thus leading to less adsorption over the surface similar findings were obtained for fa as an adsorbent material for removal of no3 and po4 3 56 3 1 3 effect of solution temperature temperature significantly affects the removal efficiency of no3 and po4 3 as it depicts the endothermic or the exothermic nature of the sorption process 59 fig 3 a b shows the removal efficiency versus temperature curves at different temperatures between 20 c 50 c it can be deciphered from fig 4 a that for temperature 45 c no3 uptake by the c2 matrix increases with the increase in the temperature which suggests that the process of sorption follows an endothermic path it may be due to an increase in the adsorption sites for active adsorption of the no3 anion that could be a factor affecting the removal efficiency these results corroborate the results reported by researchers 60 for no3 removal using sugar beet bagasse produced by activated carbon similar findings were reported for the removal of no3 using banana peel and fa 61 at temperature 45 c however the removal efficiency of the adsorbent decreased similarly for po4 3 it can be observed from fig 4 b that the removal increased with an increase in temperature up to 45 c but beyond 45 c there was a negative effect of the increase in the temperature the reason for such an observation can be cited to the fact that an increase in temperature affects the chemical potential which is one of the governing factors for the degree of adsorption and it also affects the solubility of the adsorbate in the suspension as proffered 59 increment in the temperature effects the chemical potential of the adsorbate depending upon its effect on the solubility it can be seen that with the increase in temperature the solubility of the adsorbate increases and there is a subsequent decrease in its chemical potential which thus decreases the adsorption over the adsorbate similarly if the temperature increases there is a decrease in the solubility of the adsorbate therefore there can be either a decrease or an increase of adsorption depending upon the predominance of either the solubility effect or the normal temperature effect another explanation for the decrease in the removal rate beyond 45 c is the fact that adsorption could be followed by desorption at a temperature greater than 45 c thus impeding the process of anionic removal the entropy and enthalpy of the equation due to temperature variation could be found with van t hoff s description as shown in eq 11 11 ln k e q δ s 0 r δ h 0 r t where k e q is the equilibrium constant t is the temperature in kelvin and δ s 0 and δ h 0 are the change in entropy and enthalpy respectively the slope of the linear van t hoff graph ln k e q vs 1 t and the intercept provides the values of the δ h 0 and δ s 0 respectively fig 5 a b shows the van t hoff curves for no3 and po4 3 and table 3 shows the values of δ s 0 and δ h 0 for no3 and po4 3 the positive value of δ h 0 confirms the endothermic state of the adsorption process for an adsorption process to be highly efficient the free energy changes viz δ g 0 must be negative the thermodynamic relationship between the δ g 0 δ s 0 and δ h 0 suggests that for the value of δ g 0 to be negative in the case when δ s 0 0 value δ h 0 must be smaller than the value of t δ s 0 hence the value of δ g 0 must be negative for the adsorption process negative value of δ g 0 suggests that the adsorption process is feasible and spontaneous it also suggests that the process of adsorption led to a decrease in gibbs free energy a positive value for both δ s 0 and δ h 0 is expected for precipitation reaction of basic anions and acidic cations as both are electrostatic structure makers 3 2 adsorption isotherms from batch experimental analysis the concentration of no3 and po4 3 were varied between 50 mg l 1 500 mg l 1 at ph 6 and 30 c for analyzing the equilibrium concentration fig 6 shows the sorption capacity versus concentration at the equilibrium curve for no3 and po4 3 anions it can be observed that the sorption capacity of po4 3 is higher than that of no3 suggesting that the binding between the po4 3 anion and the c2 matrix is higher and more efficient fig 7 a d shows the langmuir and freundlich curves for no3 and po4 3 and table 4 shows that the langmuir model best fits the experimental results with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 975 in comparison to 0 9132 for freundlich curve 3 3 kinetic study the kinetic study of no3 and po4 3 adsorption was studied using the pseudo first order kinetic model and the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 8 a and b shows the pseudo first order plot of log qe q versus contact time min for no3 and po4 3 whereas fig 8 c and d shows the pseudo second order plot of t q versus contact time min for no3 and po4 3 both the kinetic models provide an acceptable relationship for the kinetic of the adsorption process for both no3 and po4 3 for the selected c2 material matrix however the pseudo first order shows a better relationship of adsorption kinetics for no3 and po4 3 with the coefficient of determination r2 value as 0 97 each for both no3 and po4 3 which is more than the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics the rate constants and other estimated parameters for each system are given in table 5 3 4 fixed bed column testing 3 4 1 effect of influent flow rates on the breakthrough curves the highest removal efficiency for the c2 matrix was obtained at ph 6 and therefore the fixed bed analysis was conducted at a fixed ph of 6 in room temperature at depth of 30 cm with different influent rates fig 9 a b shows the variations in the breakthrough curve at different flow rates the point at which the effluent concentration begins to rise at a rapid rate which could be due to movement of the adsorption zone upwards and the upper edge of this adsorption zone beginning to arrive at the top of the column is known as the breakthrough point 62 it can be observed that the increase in the flow rate significantly reduces the breakthrough time however the breakthrough occurs at the same point at c co equal to 0 40 for each of the flow rates the shape of the breakthrough curve is obtained as a typical s shape the exhaust time corresponding to c co equal to 0 98 also reduces significantly with the increase in the flow rate the exhaust time for a 10 ml min 1 flow rate can be observed as 5200 min whereas for a 30 ml min 1 flow rate the exhaust time reduces to 3600 min the reason for this observation could be the reduction in the empty bed contact time ebct which reduces the diffusion capability of anions and the adsorbate thereby lowering the removal efficiency and thus signifying the importance of providing higher contact time for the adsorbent to reach a substantial uptake capacity and also obtain similar results reported by researchers 51 this observation can also be perceived from the steep movement of the curve at higher flow rates which suggests that the contact time between the anions and the c2 matrix is considerably less due to which the removal efficiency is also low in other words as the flow rate is increased the residence time decreases as a result of which the exhaust time decreases and leads to a reduction in the removal efficiency at the higher flow rates the front of the adsorption zone reaches the top of the column swiftly and reduces the saturation time 63 however in case of lower flow rates a shallow adsorption zone is formed as a result of longer contact time similar observations on flow rates were also reported by researchers 64 62 the results thus indicate that the adsorbent can be beneficial for the removal of anions at the lower flow rates further the hydraulic permeability was decreased very slightly from 8 9 10 3 cm sec 1 in the normal state to 4 5 10 4 cm sec 1 at the state of full exhaustion of the reactive material which proves the acceptable permeability even after full simulation of column experiments at all flow rates 3 4 2 effect of change in the bed depths on breakthrough curve the effect of bed depth on the breakthrough curve was analyzed by varying the depth at 15 cm 45 cm at an increment of 15 cm keeping the flow rate constant at 10 ml min 1 it can be observed from fig10 a b that the slope and the shape of the breakthrough curve changes with the change in the bed depth the gradient of the breakthrough curves decreases with the increase in the bed depth suggesting that a wider mass transfer zone is created as a result of depth increment 65 66 the saturation time and breakthrough time increase with the increase in the bed depth at a bed depth of 45 cm the saturation time is obtained as 7400 min which is almost double the saturation time obtained at 15 cm depth which comes out to be 3800 h this is due to the increase in the surface area of adsorption which results in a larger number of active sites for the adsorption process that took place longer contact time is obtained which results in larger saturation time and such findings were also reported by researchers 62 67 3 4 3 bed depth service time bdst model in the present study the bdst model was analyzed to assess the effect of varying flow rates on bed performance fig 11 a b shows the breakthrough time versus bed depth curves for po4 3 and no3 respectively at different flow rates table 6 illustrates the different parameters of the fixed bed column analysis using c2 matrix adsorbent at an anionic concentration of 600 mg l 1 each the value of r2 i e 0 97 0 99 were obtained for both no3 and po4 3 suggesting that the bdst model fits the experimental data well it can be observed from table 7 that the adsorption capacity n0 decreases with the increase in the flow rates thus suggesting that the sorption process deteriorates with increasing flow rates it can also be seen that the values of rate constant increases with the increase in the flow rates 3 4 4 effect of influent concentration the concentration fluctuations in pit toilet sewage might influence the performance of the adsorbent for analyzing this three different concentrations of no3 and po4 3 were analyzed viz 600 mg l 1 900 mg l 1 and 1200 mg l 1 respectively it can be observed from the curves as shown in fig 12 a b that the saturation time increases with the decrease in influent concentration the possible reason for this observation could be the greater availability of the active sites on the reactive materials for adsorption to occur efficiently it can also be seen that greater binding for po4 3 in comparison to no3 which commensurate with the results obtained in the isotherm study further the breakthrough time also decreases with an increase in concentration 3 5 regeneration and desorption study the greatest utilization of the prb can be achieved if the nutrients which are adsorbed onto the adsorbent can be desorbed to reuse or recycle it as a fertilizer agricultural use or utilizing the contaminant anions to achieve various environmental and economic benefits along with the reusability of adsorbents for the removal process up to certain extents the placement of the prbs emplaced underground in the subsurface also requires longer operational life so that it remains economically efficient and environmentally viable therefore after extensive adsorption experiments for no3 and po4 3 removal using various adsorbents matrix an analysis of the desorption capability of the c2 matrix was also been investigated to ensure the reusability of the reactive material with pit toilet leachate remediation fig 13 shows the relation between the desorption kinetics curve and time for the adsorbent it can be observed that the complete desorption of both the anions no3 and po4 3 could be achieved within 15 min table 8 shows the regeneration cycles for the c2 adsorbent matrix and it indicates a small difference in the uptake capacity of the adsorbent matrix in each of the six regeneration cycles which suggests that the chosen adsorbent material is highly effective for continuous sorption processes 4 conclusions the findings of the present study suggest that the prb can prove to be an efficient and cost effective technology for no3 and po4 3 removal from pit toilet leachate with a proper set of matrix configuration of low cost permeable reactive materials all the short term batch and long term column experiments proved that the potential use of waste by products could be taken as an effective prb material when mixed in an effective proportional with the traditionally used material for remediation the adsorbent matrix containing c2 as ac rh aa qs and fa in the weight proportion of 1 2 1 2 4 was found to remove effectively more than 95 of both no3 and po4 3 from the synthetic pit toilet leachate at the ph value of 6 further it was observed that the material matrix performed better than the individual reactive material interaction furthermore it was also seen that the temperature also played an important role in the adsorption process it also shows that the uptake capacity of the material matrix for no3 and po4 3 removal can increase by 10 at every 10 c increment of temperature from 25 c up to 45 c the process is suggesting an endothermic adsorption process which was further validated by von t hoff equation with the positive values of the standard enthalpy of adsorption δ h 0 kcal mol 1 of 15 78 and 19 872 for no3 and po4 3 however the uptake capacity is seen reducing if the temperature goes above 45 c due to change in the chemical potential at higher temperatures langmuir isotherm provided better adsorption results with an r2 value of 0 97 than the freundlich isotherm the maximum sorption capacity was found to be 32 6 mg g 1 and 46 5 mg g 1 for the removal of no3 and po4 3 the obtained optimum matrix was used for conducting a continuous fixed bed column experimental analysis it is observed that the increase in the flow rates from 10 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 decreases the saturation time up to 30 in the reactive zone and the breakthrough time whereas an increase in the bed depth can increase the uptake due to larger active sites available for adsorption however greater binding of po4 3 occur with the c2 material matrix compared to no3 in the established reactive zone furthermore the adsorption desorption study revealed that the chosen adsorbent matrix did not lose much of the efficiency in the six cycles and thus can be reused effectively for the further treatment process therefore the recovery of the reactive material after the exhaustion of the reactive material could also help in the sustainability of the prb technology for providing long term performance in pit toilet leachate remediation however the characterization of such kind of effective low cost and highly efficient mixed sorbents can also be encouraged for the further studies for analyzing the predominant mechanism involved in the removal of no3 and po4 3 originated from pit toilet leachate like another contaminant sources declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any conflict of interest acknowledgment the

electrical resistivity tomography vertical electrical soundings and hydrochemistry surveys the river aquifer interaction zones low saline are successfully identified and drilled the rbf well on the varaha river bank up to the depth of 35 m below ground level the rbf well yield and aquifer productivity are assessed during pumping test analysis the comparison of hydrochemistry between river water

water supply scheme in the saline coastal tracts of east flowing rivers of india keywords groundwater salinity geophysical methods pumping tests river aquifer interaction riverbank filtration 1 introduction according to the united nations 1 eighteen percent of the world population does not have access to safe drinking water in india also over the years many people have been experiencing the health problems due to intake of unsafe water 2 the demand for fresh water is increasing in india day by day due to the limitted availability of surface water in the form of rivers perennial ephemeral lakes ponds and reservoirs and its quality deterioration from anthropogenic activities the dependence on groundwater for drinking and other usages has been increased drastically in global scale as well as in india due to the unreliability of surface water resources 3 moreover most of the groundwater is being extracted for agricultural production in many parts of india as a result depletion of groundwater levels is a serious threat to the water supply in india 4 according to the asian development bank 5 the domestic water demand in india is projected to show an increasing trend from 25 109 m3 year in 1990 to 116 109 m3 year in 2010 and reaches 174 109 m3 year by 2025 the country is thus facing an exponential decline in per capita availability of water the world resource institute 6 has already predicted and cautioned that the majority of the indian subcontinent would experience the water scarcity by the year 2025 the excessive pumping from the aquifers can lead not only declining the groundwater table but it also changes the groundwater quality the water levels in the surface water bodies can also be affected due to huge groundwater withdrawals and climate change hence there is a need for massive investment in water supply systems by utilizing the existing surface water bodies especially for rural population 7 providing safe drinking water to villages is a major issue in the saline coastal aquifer of andhra pradesh state india in general water supply schemes found in andhra pradesh are infiltration galleries reservoirs and protected water supply from groundwater sources in the upstream reaches of the river further the present water supply in this coastal region is either from drawing the available river water from longer distances or from groundwater through overhead tanks these sources are exhausted during summer months and creating drinking water gaps these gaps are further affected by the saline groundwater and poor surface water quality in the coastal environment the reverse osmosis ro schemes are initiated commercially to exploit the present situation and but most of the poor people can t afford to purchase the ro water therefore to provide the safe drinking water supplies to the rural populations of india river bank filtration rbf is one of the possible sources for extracting safe drinking water supplies from the favorable hydrogeological conditions the selection of the rbf site on the river bank is a challenging task as the rate of bank filtration mainly depends on the various hydrogeological settings lithology of subsurface layers type of soil aquifer characteristics and hydraulic conductivity etc the distance of rbf well from the river is one of the important aspect to provide good yield as well as better quality of water the rbf is a natural filtration process in which physico chemical and biological parameters plays a significant role in improving the quality of percolating water and almost all river contaminants are removed 8 the rbf technique can be used at sites where groundwater resources are limited and contaminated 9 11 in rbf river water moves through the pores of the natural soils of the river bed and river bank 12 bank filtration sites in the united states of america mostly exist along major and medium rivers 13 many countries are being successfully implemented the rbf technique 14 16 the safe distance of the pumping well from river bed is a function of water quality soil condition and the rate of pumping 17 a feasible solution is to set up a pumping well or infiltration gallery in the vicinity of the surface water body in order to take advantage of the river bank filtration which facilitates the removal of impurities such as microbial contaminants organic and inorganic chemicals and turbidity 18 improvement of water quality during the river bank filtration in india has been demonstrated by 19 according to 20 rbf technique has high potential for future applications in india and other alternative sources are also required to mitigate water scarcity for the rural population the rbf investigations of 21 on parapeti river bolivia have shown that the river bed filtration systems act like filters for efficiently removing turbidity and microorganisms 22 reviewed potential locations of rbf in the coastal andhra pradesh and concluded that there are no technically designed rbf schemes in the coastal andhra pradesh state india according to 23 the bank filtrate system in mathura uttar pradesh india effectively attenuates organic contaminants and turbidity further notable feature of medium to coarse sand and gravel are found in the indian river beds which exhibit a suitable hydraulic conductivity for rbf 24 have conducted various rbf studies in india and found that the river bank filtrate system reduces or eliminates the turbidity bacteria and other impurities potential existing rbf sites in india are discussed by 25 and also stated that the total coliform counts in the alaknanda river india attained a maximum of nearly 21 000 mpn 100 ml along the ganga river and its tributaries on the other hand the total coliform 45 mpn 100 ml and e coli 2 2 mpn 100 ml counts found at the rbf site are significantly lower although not completely absent in some other cases e coli bacteria reduced in rbf sites by nearly 100 26 rbf studies of 27 showed that rbf treatment lowers heavy metals concentrations such as zinc by 82 copper by 51 lead by 75 chromium by 94 and cadmium by 75 to identify the reliable rbf location the multi electrode geophysical surveys are very much useful to assess the thickness of the various layers the groundwater potential and subsurface groundwater quality in any geological strata 28 31 the resistivity values of groundwater vary in the range of 10 100 ω m depending on the various geological strata the degree of water saturation and concentration of dissolved salts contain in the subsurface 32 33 electrical resistivity tomography ert techniques are capable to detect the changes of apparent resistivity with depth and to detect the degree of water saturation in case of alluvial aquifer which has good contact with surface water resources such as rivers and lakes the pores are saturated with water contain low few ω m to moderate resistivity values less than 20 ω m 34 that means soils below the water table generally gives a resistivity value of less than 25 ω m the factors such as porosity pore size quality of water encountered in the aquifer etc influence the resistivity value the inadequate knowledge of groundwater occurrence poor water quality and saline water intrusion along the coastal areas are common factors in water supplies in many nations 35 the ert surveys have been successfully used to delineate various subsurface layers seepage zones and river aquifer interaction zones 36 many authors have successfully distinguished the difference in freshwater and saline water domains in various coastal zones by combining the results of one dimensional 1d vertical electrical soundings ves and two dimensional 2d ert surveys 37 40 the potential high quality pore water zones can be identified using ert and ves surveys 41 the groundwater salinization process in multi layered coastal aquifer in greece was successfully explained by 42 using large scale ert profiles the electrical resistivity techniques have given successful results in delineating the potential freshwater aquifer 43 and related to geological parameters such as porosity and degree of water saturation 44 keeping in view of providing safe drinking water supply to the rural people the varaha river basin which is located in the visakhapatnam district andhra pradesh india which is saline aquifer is selected for the rbf investigations one of the objectives of this paper is to identify the exact location for establishing a new rbf well on the flanks of river and to understand the river aquifer interaction by ert and ves surveys 2 study area the river varaha originates in a part of the eastern ghats mountain range kondasanta hill and flows 62 km southeast and bifurcates into two branches before join the bay of bengal fig 1 the varaha river basin is characterized by undulating topography sloping towards southeast the maximum elevation found to be around 1174 m amsl and it is underlain by precambrian rocks and recent formations the flood plain is formed by the processes of erosion and deposition of gravel pebbles sand silt and clay along the river course in the upper reaches the width of the flood plain is narrow while in the lower reaches it is much wider the paleo channels were observed in the upper middle and lower parts of the flood plain in the coastal plain salt flats and mud flats occur which are gently sloping groundwater is the main source for drinking and irrigation due to less availability of surface water in the coastal tracts of the basin in general geologically the downstream of the varaha river basin is occupied with alluvium of recent age followed by khondalites the downstream of the varaha river basin is considered as study area fig 1 for present rbf investigations the study area lies in between latitudes 17 23 00 n and 17 29 00 n and longitudes 82 46 00 e and 82 51 00 e the major soil types found in the study area coastal region of the varaha river basin are coastal sand loamy sand marine clay silt loam and residual eastern ghats the climate of the area is semi arid type with temperature varying from 15 to 20 c in winter season and 32 to 38 8 c in summer season the average annual rainfall is about 1230 mm the majority of the rainfall 58 is received from the southwest monsoon in june to september the drainage is mostly dendritic and the nature of the river is ephemeral 3 methodology the detailed methodology of water quality assessment in the lower reaches of varaha river ert ves surveys and a pumping test is described below 3 1 water quality assessment groundwater quality especially in terms of total dissolved solids tds is assessed in the month of may 2018 in the coastal tracts of the varaha river basin total 12 groundwater samples have been collected and analyzed for tds chloride and sodium concentrations for salinity assessment further after completing the rbf well development the quality of river water rbf water and present drinking water source groundwater samples were collected in the month of october 2019 and analysed for physico chemical parameters ph turbidity electrical conductivity tds dissolved oxygen chemical parameters ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 po4 no3 trace elements mn si br i f and bacteriological coliform e coli as per standard methods suggested by the american public health association 45 46 the data have been compared to the drinking water limits of the bureau of indian standards 47 all these samples have been analyzed in the water quality laboratory of national institute of hydrology kakinada 3 2 ert and ves surveys in order to identify the aquifer layer which is connected to the river bed multi electrode ert surveys are conducted at selected location near vommavaram village along the river bank the geophysical investigations are useful for identification of low saline aquifer zones which are connected to the river bed ert profiles have been carried out at 4 locations in the varaha river reaches near vommavaram village with varying length of profiles having 5 m electrode spacing during inversion the interval has been reduced to 2 5 m for obtaining better analysis results the apparent resistivity data were collected using syscal pro resistivity meter with 96 electrodes using 5 m inter electrode spacing with the wenner schlumberger configuration which gives good quality data both in lateral and vertical variations to delineate aquifer geometry and to identify the potential pore water seepage locations 48 50 the syscal pro resistivity meter is a field resistivity equipment which includes a large number of electrodes located along a line at the same time and which carries out an automatic switching of these electrodes for acquiring profiling data the images which are obtained apparent resistivity pseudo sections are processed by an inversion software which gives interpreted resistivity and depth values for the anomalies detected along the profile the collected apparent resistivity values are then converted into true resistivity using res2dinv inversion program 28 51 the inversion data is calculated by the least squares inversion method 52 2d resistivity data are interpreted using 2d forward modeling software 41 from the interpretation of the 2d resistivity data the groundwater potential layers seepage zones from river bed and river aquifer interaction along the river bank are achieved 3 3 pumping test analysis pumping test was conducted at rbf well using cooper jacob method 53 for estimating transmissivity and storativity of the aquifer the recovery transmissivity is estimated from theis recovery method the rbf well is taken as pumping well and newly drilled peizometer well for conducting pumping tests is considered as observation well before pumping water from rbf well the static water levels in both wells are measured the discharge rate pumping rate during pumping was determined from the time taken in seconds to fill the 220 l drum the rbf well and peizometer well are 4 5 m apart from each other except rbf well no other well was pumped in the vicinity of the rbf and peizometer wells drawdown values are observed in the peizometer well till steadystate conditions are achieved 54 the drawdown measurements are taken for a period of 300 min with an initial interval of 1 min up to 10 min and later at an interval of 5 min till water level reaches the steady state condition the drawdown per log cycle is obtained from the slope of the line the values for transmissivity t and storativity s are calculated from the following equations 53 respectively t r a n s m i s s i v i t y t 2 3 q 4 π δ s s t o r a t i v i t y s 2 25 t t 0 r 2 here q is the constant pumping rate δs is drawdown for one log cycle time t0is the time since pumping began to just before drawdown starts and r is the radial distance to the observation well 4 results and discussion the results and discussion are mainly focused on assessment of groundwater quality ert and ves profiles pumping test and comparision of hydrochemistry of samples collected from present source of water supply groundwater river water rbf water 4 1 assessment of groundwater quality the spatial distribution of groundwater tds in the month of may 2018 in a coastal region of the varaha river basin is shown in fig 2 it is observed from the tds map that most of the villages in the downstream area are having the tds values in the range of 1000 4500 mg l the important water quality parameters which can cause salinity in groundwater are chlorides cl and sodium na ions the chloride and sodium ions in groundwater are in the range of 248 1868 mg l and 190 2000 mg l respectively in the coastal region the spatial distribution of tds indicated that the lower reaches of the varaha river is saline zone 1500 4500 mg l the vommavaram village near varaha river sample location 1 in fig 2 is having the tds range of 1000 1500 mg l and also has suitable hydrogeological conditions more river alluvium therefore this region is considered for identifying possible rbf well 4 2 geophysical surveys four ert surveys are carried out at the feasible locations in the vommavaram village to identify the appropriate place for drilling the rbf production well out of four ert surveys three erts are conducted along the varaha river bank and one ert is conducted across the varaha river fig 3 these four ert images have achieved high accuracy with minimum absolute error all resistivity profiles indicated the information upto the depth of 48 m below ground level and also having the horizontal length of 240 m 4 2 1 ert 1 the first electrical resistivity tomography ert 1 profile fig 4 a is carried out at the downstream of varaha river from ert 1 it can be observed that the subsurface upto the depth of 6 m having the resistivity values of more than 37 1 ω m over the entire profile this is mainly due to the presence of dry sands in the top left of the image the coarse grained sand having the resistivity values of 24 37 1 ω m is observed at the depth range of 6 28 7 m the low resistivity values are in the range of 2 74 10 1 ω m indicating the presence of highly weathered khondalitic rocks thick clayey material it is identified that fine to medium grain sand saturated with water having the resistivity values of 15 6 24 0 ω m is presented at the horizontal profile distance of 100 120 m from 10 m depth in the middle of the image hence it is recommended that a well can be drilled in between 100 120 m of the profile length and up to the depth of 35 m to implement the rbf technique fig 4 a 4 2 2 ert 2 the second ert profile ert 2 has been carried out on the upstream side of varaha river fig 4 b at this location the horizontal profile distance from 0 150 m in ert 2 is having the dry sand with the resistivity values of more than 42 4 ω m the greater part of the image is secured with the low resistivity estimations of 5 46 15 2 ω m which is a sign of profoundly endured khondalitic rocks and clingy clayey material consequently this area isn t suggested for the rbf well 4 2 3 ert 3 the third ert profile ert 3 has been carried out across the varaha river fig 4 c to know the extent of river bed and its connectivity to the aquifer the resistivity values less than 2 ω m at extreme right bottom side in the image indicated the presence of clay bed the resistivity values between 7 92 12 6 ω m indicating fine sands mixed with medium sands in the subsurface at this place the river has been connected with aquifer which is indicated by continuous resistivity value of 4 99 ω m and this layer is surrounded by highly weathered khondalites 7 92 ω m since the whole base of the image is secured with low resistivity values there is no chance of penetrating of rbf well 4 2 4 ert 4 the ert 4 has been carried out along the river fig 4 d the resistivity values found between 16 8 32 8 ω m upto the depth of 22 m middle section of the image are indicating the presence of coarse grained sands the scope of resistivity esteems 12 16 8 ω m found up to the profundity of 30 m show the nearness of immersed conditions be that as it may this layer is encircled by low resistivity zone which is showing exceptionally endured khondalites that contain thick clay and consequently quality of groundwater may not be acceptable and the area isn t reasonable for rbf well the ert results have revealed that three different kinds of formations existed in the study area clay and dry coarse grained sands on top underlain by fine sands mixed with medium grained sand followed by highly weathered khondalites and hard khondalitic formation the results indicated that the dry coarse grained sand exhibited resistivity values of greater than 30 ω m whereas clay beds having resistivity of less than 2 ω m the highly weathered khondalite are having the resistivity values in the range of 4 10 ω m fine to medium grain sand saturated with water aquifer formation having the resistivity values of 15 6 24 0 ω m is found as good quality water bearing zones one potential and favourable location on the ert 1 profile has been identified for drilling of rbf well except ert 1 the other ert profiles have exhibited very low resistivity values due to highly weathered khondalite and poor quality of groundwater therefore it is recommended from the ert surveys that the proposed rbf well could be drilled upto the depth of 35 m at identified location on ert 1 to extract good quality water further the ves survey is also conducted at the proposed rbf site since the location of proposed rbf well is site specific vertically downwards and also to compare the various zones layers obtained from ert 1 the one dimensional resistivity surveys ves are useful for identifying various vertical subsurface layers more accurately seven geoelectrial layers are identified from ves data at proposed rbf well site the interpretation of ves data fig 5 has suggested that the good aquifer layer is identified in the fifth layer between 6 19 15 1 m with a thickness of nearly 9 m that means a good aquifer zone in terms of both quality and quantity has a hydraulic connection to the river bed at the depth between 6 19 15 1 m it is also observed that the aquifer resistivity obtained from ves data 30 7 ω m is nearer to ert data 24 ω m and as shown in fig 5 this aquifer resistivity range indicates that the aquifer is not contaminated by saline water or geogenic contamination or other anthropogenic activities according to the outcome of ert and ves surveys the rbf well has been drilled up to the depth of 35 m the interpreted subsurface lithologs in different depths are compared with ert and ves results and observed the consistency among these three investigations fig 5 based on the results obtained from ert and ves surveys the exploratory drilling work is carried out by employing the rotary drilling method at the rbf well location during the drilling of rbf well the ec value of each soil sample is measured at every 1 m depth interval to understand the soil salinity the range of soil ec found to be 41 63 μs cm at the depth of 7 16 m below the subsurface fig 6 this aquifer layer is at the same depth range determined by ert and ves surveys hence the drilling results are correlated with the results of ert and ves surveys for delineating good quality water bearing zone which is hydrogeologically connected to the river bed to extract high quality of water from the rbf well and also to arrest the vertical leaching the rbf well construction is critical and crucial in the sandy aquifer zone hence the galvanized iron gi pipe diameter of 10 in at a length of 18 m is used and provided angular slots screening between depth of 7 13 m aquifer river bed connection based on the water requirement from rbf well the 5 horse power hp capacity submersible motor is installed 4 3 pumping test in the rbf well the pumping test is conducted in drilled rbf well in the month of october 2019 during post monsoon season drawdown values during pumping test and residual drawdown values during recovery test are observed in the peizometer well which is at 4 5 m distance from rbf well pumping test is conducted nearly 300 min and recovery test is carried out nearly 60 min the graphical representation of the drawdown pattern as a function of time at rbf well during pumping and recovery tests is shown in fig 7 a and 7 b respectively the drawdown transmissivity is determined using cooper jacob method fig 7 a while the recovery transmissivity was determined from theis recovery method fig 7 b during the pumping test the rbf well has a constant pumping rate of 520 lpm transmissivity of 285 m2 day and storativity value of 0 03 are obtained from the pumping test the storativity value indicates that the aquifer is unconfined in nature the transmissivity value obtained from recovery test is 360 m2 day therefore the rbf well is capable to supply water for minimum five hour using 5 hp capacity motor without changing water quality 4 4 comparison of groundwater river water and rbf water hydrochemistry the ec values of extracted water from rbf well at every 30 min are maintained in the range of 720 850 μs cm table 1 which indicate that the quality of extracted water is suitable for water supply the rbf well water is analyzed and compared with the nearby groundwater present water supply to vommavaram village and varaha river water the detailed analysis of major ion chemistry physico chemical parameters trace elements and bacteriological characteristics of groundwater river water and rbf well water are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the water quality parameters of rbf well are better than river water and groundwater present water supply to the vommavaram village the ph of all water sources is almost same and are within the prescribed limits the turbidity level in groundwater and rbf well water is nearer to zero due to filtration mechanisms of the aquifer high tds total hardness and total alkalinity are present in groundwater than rbf water due to the long distance from the river the rbf water has lower values of ec tds total hardness and total alkalinity due to effective bank filtration process it is observed that the concentration of trace elements is almost similar in both groundwater and rbf well water according to the bacteriological results it is confirmed that the coliform bacteria is present in river water 17 mpn of coliform bacteria 100 ml and absent in the rbf well water as well as in groundwater 0 mpn 100 ml very less fluoride ion concentration 0 19 mg l is found in the rbf well as compared to the groundwater in summary the hydrochemistry results have shown that the newly established rbf well has qualified the conditions of all drinking water limits bis 2012 the geophysical surveys ert ves and pumping tests are effectively applied to identify the low saline river aquifer interaction zone on the river bank the rbf well has provided potable water to the vommavaram village however the higher pumping rates in rbf well for longer pumping durations more than five hours could affect the groundwater table which may lead to water quality deterioration in order to maintain good quality of water throughout the water supply a regional groundwater flow model is to be developed for optimizing pumping rate and also for sustainable use of the rbf well 5 conclusions the rbf technique has been implemented sucessfully in the downstream coastal tracts of the varaha river basin visakhapatnam district of andhra pradesh to supply safe drinking water to the rural population ert profiles have identified the river aquifer interaction zone having resistivity values in the range of 14 24 ω m and the ves survey confirmed the suitability of proposed rbf well location on the riverbank the ec values of rbf well during pumping test are between 720 850 μs cm throughout the pumping period 5 h the quality of rbf well water is suitable for potable water supply in terms of physico chemical parameters bacteriological parameters chemical parameters and trace elements as compared to the groundwater and river water the improvement of water quality in rbf well is mainly due to the combination of river water and groundwater in view of poor groundwater quality in the coastal saline aquifer the application of geophysical surveys ert and ves along with pumping tests has an advantage to locate rbf site on the river bank for supplying safe drinking water it is recommended to formulate regional flow modeling to optimize pumping rates from rbf well without producing the effect of cone of depression or to avoid upconing phenomena and also for sustainable use

overhead tanks these sources are exhausted during summer months and creating drinking water gaps these gaps are further affected by the saline groundwater and poor surface water quality in the coastal environment the reverse osmosis ro schemes are initiated commercially to exploit the present situation and but most of the poor people can t afford to purchase the ro water therefore to provide the safe drinking water supplies to the rural populations of india river bank filtration rbf is one of the possible sources for extracting safe drinking water supplies from the favorable hydrogeological conditions the selection of the rbf site on the river bank is a challenging task as the rate of bank filtration mainly depends on the various hydrogeological settings lithology of subsurface layers type of soil aquifer characteristics and hydraulic conductivity etc the distance of rbf well from the river is one of the important aspect to provide good yield as well as better quality of water the rbf is a natural filtration process in which physico chemical and biological parameters plays a significant role in improving the quality of percolating water and almost all river contaminants are removed 8 the rbf technique can be used at sites where groundwater resources are limited and contaminated 9 11 in rbf river water moves through the pores of the natural soils of the river bed and river bank 12 bank filtration sites in the united states of america mostly exist along major and medium rivers 13 many countries are being successfully implemented the rbf technique 14 16 the safe distance of the pumping well from river bed is a function of water quality soil condition and the rate of pumping 17 a feasible solution is to set up a pumping well or infiltration gallery in the vicinity of the surface water body in order to take advantage of the river bank filtration which facilitates the removal of impurities such as microbial contaminants organic and inorganic chemicals and turbidity 18 improvement of water quality during the river bank filtration in india has been demonstrated by 19 according to 20 rbf technique has high potential for future applications in india and other alternative sources are also required to mitigate water scarcity for the rural population the rbf investigations of 21 on parapeti river bolivia have shown that the river bed filtration systems act like filters for efficiently removing turbidity and microorganisms 22 reviewed potential locations of rbf in the coastal andhra pradesh and concluded that there are no technically designed rbf schemes in the coastal andhra pradesh state india according to 23 the bank filtrate system in mathura uttar pradesh india effectively attenuates organic contaminants and turbidity further notable feature of medium to coarse sand and gravel are found in the indian river beds which exhibit a suitable hydraulic conductivity for rbf 24 have conducted various rbf studies in india and found that the river bank filtrate system reduces or eliminates the turbidity bacteria and other impurities potential existing rbf sites in india are discussed by 25 and also stated that the total coliform counts in the alaknanda river india attained a maximum of nearly 21 000 mpn 100 ml along the ganga river and its tributaries on the other hand the total coliform 45 mpn 100 ml and e coli 2 2 mpn 100 ml counts found at the rbf site are significantly lower although not completely absent in some other cases e coli bacteria reduced in rbf sites by nearly 100 26 rbf studies of 27 showed that rbf treatment lowers heavy metals concentrations such as zinc by 82 copper by 51 lead by 75 chromium by 94 and cadmium by 75 to identify the reliable rbf location the multi electrode geophysical surveys are very much useful to assess the thickness of the various layers the groundwater potential and subsurface groundwater quality in any geological strata 28 31 the resistivity values of groundwater vary in the range of 10 100 ω m depending on the various geological strata the degree of water saturation and concentration of dissolved salts contain in the subsurface 32 33 electrical resistivity tomography ert techniques are capable to detect the changes of apparent resistivity with depth and to detect the degree of water saturation in case of alluvial aquifer which has good contact with surface water resources such as rivers and lakes the pores are saturated with water contain low few ω m to moderate resistivity values less than 20 ω m 34 that means soils below the water table generally gives a resistivity value of less than 25 ω m the factors such as porosity pore size quality of water encountered in the aquifer etc influence the resistivity value the inadequate knowledge of groundwater occurrence poor water quality and saline water intrusion along the coastal areas are common factors in water supplies in many nations 35 the ert surveys have been successfully used to delineate various subsurface layers seepage zones and river aquifer interaction zones 36 many authors have successfully distinguished the difference in freshwater and saline water domains in various coastal zones by combining the results of one dimensional 1d vertical electrical soundings ves and two dimensional 2d ert surveys 37 40 the potential high quality pore water zones can be identified using ert and ves surveys 41 the groundwater salinization process in multi layered coastal aquifer in greece was successfully explained by 42 using large scale ert profiles the electrical resistivity techniques have given successful results in delineating the potential freshwater aquifer 43 and related to geological parameters such as porosity and degree of water saturation 44 keeping in view of providing safe drinking water supply to the rural people the varaha river basin which is located in the visakhapatnam district andhra pradesh india which is saline aquifer is selected for the rbf investigations one of the objectives of this paper is to identify the exact location for establishing a new rbf well on the flanks of river and to understand the river aquifer interaction by ert and ves surveys 2 study area the river varaha originates in a part of the eastern ghats mountain range kondasanta hill and flows 62 km southeast and bifurcates into two branches before join the bay of bengal fig 1 the varaha river basin is characterized by undulating topography sloping towards southeast the maximum elevation found to be around 1174 m amsl and it is underlain by precambrian rocks and recent formations the flood plain is formed by the processes of erosion and deposition of gravel pebbles sand silt and clay along the river course in the upper reaches the width of the flood plain is narrow while in the lower reaches it is much wider the paleo channels were observed in the upper middle and lower parts of the flood plain in the coastal plain salt flats and mud flats occur which are gently sloping groundwater is the main source for drinking and irrigation due to less availability of surface water in the coastal tracts of the basin in general geologically the downstream of the varaha river basin is occupied with alluvium of recent age followed by khondalites the downstream of the varaha river basin is considered as study area fig 1 for present rbf investigations the study area lies in between latitudes 17 23 00 n and 17 29 00 n and longitudes 82 46 00 e and 82 51 00 e the major soil types found in the study area coastal region of the varaha river basin are coastal sand loamy sand marine clay silt loam and residual eastern ghats the climate of the area is semi arid type with temperature varying from 15 to 20 c in winter season and 32 to 38 8 c in summer season the average annual rainfall is about 1230 mm the majority of the rainfall 58 is received from the southwest monsoon in june to september the drainage is mostly dendritic and the nature of the river is ephemeral 3 methodology the detailed methodology of water quality assessment in the lower reaches of varaha river ert ves surveys and a pumping test is described below 3 1 water quality assessment groundwater quality especially in terms of total dissolved solids tds is assessed in the month of may 2018 in the coastal tracts of the varaha river basin total 12 groundwater samples have been collected and analyzed for tds chloride and sodium concentrations for salinity assessment further after completing the rbf well development the quality of river water rbf water and present drinking water source groundwater samples were collected in the month of october 2019 and analysed for physico chemical parameters ph turbidity electrical conductivity tds dissolved oxygen chemical parameters ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 po4 no3 trace elements mn si br i f and bacteriological coliform e coli as per standard methods suggested by the american public health association 45 46 the data have been compared to the drinking water limits of the bureau of indian standards 47 all these samples have been analyzed in the water quality laboratory of national institute of hydrology kakinada 3 2 ert and ves surveys in order to identify the aquifer layer which is connected to the river bed multi electrode ert surveys are conducted at selected location near vommavaram village along the river bank the geophysical investigations are useful for identification of low saline aquifer zones which are connected to the river bed ert profiles have been carried out at 4 locations in the varaha river reaches near vommavaram village with varying length of profiles having 5 m electrode spacing during inversion the interval has been reduced to 2 5 m for obtaining better analysis results the apparent resistivity data were collected using syscal pro resistivity meter with 96 electrodes using 5 m inter electrode spacing with the wenner schlumberger configuration which gives good quality data both in lateral and vertical variations to delineate aquifer geometry and to identify the potential pore water seepage locations 48 50 the syscal pro resistivity meter is a field resistivity equipment which includes a large number of electrodes located along a line at the same time and which carries out an automatic switching of these electrodes for acquiring profiling data the images which are obtained apparent resistivity pseudo sections are processed by an inversion software which gives interpreted resistivity and depth values for the anomalies detected along the profile the collected apparent resistivity values are then converted into true resistivity using res2dinv inversion program 28 51 the inversion data is calculated by the least squares inversion method 52 2d resistivity data are interpreted using 2d forward modeling software 41 from the interpretation of the 2d resistivity data the groundwater potential layers seepage zones from river bed and river aquifer interaction along the river bank are achieved 3 3 pumping test analysis pumping test was conducted at rbf well using cooper jacob method 53 for estimating transmissivity and storativity of the aquifer the recovery transmissivity is estimated from theis recovery method the rbf well is taken as pumping well and newly drilled peizometer well for conducting pumping tests is considered as observation well before pumping water from rbf well the static water levels in both wells are measured the discharge rate pumping rate during pumping was determined from the time taken in seconds to fill the 220 l drum the rbf well and peizometer well are 4 5 m apart from each other except rbf well no other well was pumped in the vicinity of the rbf and peizometer wells drawdown values are observed in the peizometer well till steadystate conditions are achieved 54 the drawdown measurements are taken for a period of 300 min with an initial interval of 1 min up to 10 min and later at an interval of 5 min till water level reaches the steady state condition the drawdown per log cycle is obtained from the slope of the line the values for transmissivity t and storativity s are calculated from the following equations 53 respectively t r a n s m i s s i v i t y t 2 3 q 4 π δ s s t o r a t i v i t y s 2 25 t t 0 r 2 here q is the constant pumping rate δs is drawdown for one log cycle time t0is the time since pumping began to just before drawdown starts and r is the radial distance to the observation well 4 results and discussion the results and discussion are mainly focused on assessment of groundwater quality ert and ves profiles pumping test and comparision of hydrochemistry of samples collected from present source of water supply groundwater river water rbf water 4 1 assessment of groundwater quality the spatial distribution of groundwater tds in the month of may 2018 in a coastal region of the varaha river basin is shown in fig 2 it is observed from the tds map that most of the villages in the downstream area are having the tds values in the range of 1000 4500 mg l the important water quality parameters which can cause salinity in groundwater are chlorides cl and sodium na ions the chloride and sodium ions in groundwater are in the range of 248 1868 mg l and 190 2000 mg l respectively in the coastal region the spatial distribution of tds indicated that the lower reaches of the varaha river is saline zone 1500 4500 mg l the vommavaram village near varaha river sample location 1 in fig 2 is having the tds range of 1000 1500 mg l and also has suitable hydrogeological conditions more river alluvium therefore this region is considered for identifying possible rbf well 4 2 geophysical surveys four ert surveys are carried out at the feasible locations in the vommavaram village to identify the appropriate place for drilling the rbf production well out of four ert surveys three erts are conducted along the varaha river bank and one ert is conducted across the varaha river fig 3 these four ert images have achieved high accuracy with minimum absolute error all resistivity profiles indicated the information upto the depth of 48 m below ground level and also having the horizontal length of 240 m 4 2 1 ert 1 the first electrical resistivity tomography ert 1 profile fig 4 a is carried out at the downstream of varaha river from ert 1 it can be observed that the subsurface upto the depth of 6 m having the resistivity values of more than 37 1 ω m over the entire profile this is mainly due to the presence of dry sands in the top left of the image the coarse grained sand having the resistivity values of 24 37 1 ω m is observed at the depth range of 6 28 7 m the low resistivity values are in the range of 2 74 10 1 ω m indicating the presence of highly weathered khondalitic rocks thick clayey material it is identified that fine to medium grain sand saturated with water having the resistivity values of 15 6 24 0 ω m is presented at the horizontal profile distance of 100 120 m from 10 m depth in the middle of the image hence it is recommended that a well can be drilled in between 100 120 m of the profile length and up to the depth of 35 m to implement the rbf technique fig 4 a 4 2 2 ert 2 the second ert profile ert 2 has been carried out on the upstream side of varaha river fig 4 b at this location the horizontal profile distance from 0 150 m in ert 2 is having the dry sand with the resistivity values of more than 42 4 ω m the greater part of the image is secured with the low resistivity estimations of 5 46 15 2 ω m which is a sign of profoundly endured khondalitic rocks and clingy clayey material consequently this area isn t suggested for the rbf well 4 2 3 ert 3 the third ert profile ert 3 has been carried out across the varaha river fig 4 c to know the extent of river bed and its connectivity to the aquifer the resistivity values less than 2 ω m at extreme right bottom side in the image indicated the presence of clay bed the resistivity values between 7 92 12 6 ω m indicating fine sands mixed with medium sands in the subsurface at this place the river has been connected with aquifer which is indicated by continuous resistivity value of 4 99 ω m and this layer is surrounded by highly weathered khondalites 7 92 ω m since the whole base of the image is secured with low resistivity values there is no chance of penetrating of rbf well 4 2 4 ert 4 the ert 4 has been carried out along the river fig 4 d the resistivity values found between 16 8 32 8 ω m upto the depth of 22 m middle section of the image are indicating the presence of coarse grained sands the scope of resistivity esteems 12 16 8 ω m found up to the profundity of 30 m show the nearness of immersed conditions be that as it may this layer is encircled by low resistivity zone which is showing exceptionally endured khondalites that contain thick clay and consequently quality of groundwater may not be acceptable and the area isn t reasonable for rbf well the ert results have revealed that three different kinds of formations existed in the study area clay and dry coarse grained sands on top underlain by fine sands mixed with medium grained sand followed by highly weathered khondalites and hard khondalitic formation the results indicated that the dry coarse grained sand exhibited resistivity values of greater than 30 ω m whereas clay beds having resistivity of less than 2 ω m the highly weathered khondalite are having the resistivity values in the range of 4 10 ω m fine to medium grain sand saturated with water aquifer formation having the resistivity values of 15 6 24 0 ω m is found as good quality water bearing zones one potential and favourable location on the ert 1 profile has been identified for drilling of rbf well except ert 1 the other ert profiles have exhibited very low resistivity values due to highly weathered khondalite and poor quality of groundwater therefore it is recommended from the ert surveys that the proposed rbf well could be drilled upto the depth of 35 m at identified location on ert 1 to extract good quality water further the ves survey is also conducted at the proposed rbf site since the location of proposed rbf well is site specific vertically downwards and also to compare the various zones layers obtained from ert 1 the one dimensional resistivity surveys ves are useful for identifying various vertical subsurface layers more accurately seven geoelectrial layers are identified from ves data at proposed rbf well site the interpretation of ves data fig 5 has suggested that the good aquifer layer is identified in the fifth layer between 6 19 15 1 m with a thickness of nearly 9 m that means a good aquifer zone in terms of both quality and quantity has a hydraulic connection to the river bed at the depth between 6 19 15 1 m it is also observed that the aquifer resistivity obtained from ves data 30 7 ω m is nearer to ert data 24 ω m and as shown in fig 5 this aquifer resistivity range indicates that the aquifer is not contaminated by saline water or geogenic contamination or other anthropogenic activities according to the outcome of ert and ves surveys the rbf well has been drilled up to the depth of 35 m the interpreted subsurface lithologs in different depths are compared with ert and ves results and observed the consistency among these three investigations fig 5 based on the results obtained from ert and ves surveys the exploratory drilling work is carried out by employing the rotary drilling method at the rbf well location during the drilling of rbf well the ec value of each soil sample is measured at every 1 m depth interval to understand the soil salinity the range of soil ec found to be 41 63 μs cm at the depth of 7 16 m below the subsurface fig 6 this aquifer layer is at the same depth range determined by ert and ves surveys hence the drilling results are correlated with the results of ert and ves surveys for delineating good quality water bearing zone which is hydrogeologically connected to the river bed to extract high quality of water from the rbf well and also to arrest the vertical leaching the rbf well construction is critical and crucial in the sandy aquifer zone hence the galvanized iron gi pipe diameter of 10 in at a length of 18 m is used and provided angular slots screening between depth of 7 13 m aquifer river bed connection based on the water requirement from rbf well the 5 horse power hp capacity submersible motor is installed 4 3 pumping test in the rbf well the pumping test is conducted in drilled rbf well in the month of october 2019 during post monsoon season drawdown values during pumping test and residual drawdown values during recovery test are observed in the peizometer well which is at 4 5 m distance from rbf well pumping test is conducted nearly 300 min and recovery test is carried out nearly 60 min the graphical representation of the drawdown pattern as a function of time at rbf well during pumping and recovery tests is shown in fig 7 a and 7 b respectively the drawdown transmissivity is determined using cooper jacob method fig 7 a while the recovery transmissivity was determined from theis recovery method fig 7 b during the pumping test the rbf well has a constant pumping rate of 520 lpm transmissivity of 285 m2 day and storativity value of 0 03 are obtained from the pumping test the storativity value indicates that the aquifer is unconfined in nature the transmissivity value obtained from recovery test is 360 m2 day therefore the rbf well is capable to supply water for minimum five hour using 5 hp capacity motor without changing water quality 4 4 comparison of groundwater river water and rbf water hydrochemistry the ec values of extracted water from rbf well at every 30 min are maintained in the range of 720 850 μs cm table 1 which indicate that the quality of extracted water is suitable for water supply the rbf well water is analyzed and compared with the nearby groundwater present water supply to vommavaram village and varaha river water the detailed analysis of major ion chemistry physico chemical parameters trace elements and bacteriological characteristics of groundwater river water and rbf well water are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the water quality parameters of rbf well are better than river water and groundwater present water supply to the vommavaram village the ph of all water sources is almost same and are within the prescribed limits the turbidity level in groundwater and rbf well water is nearer to zero due to filtration mechanisms of the aquifer high tds total hardness and total alkalinity are present in groundwater than rbf water due to the long distance from the river the rbf water has lower values of ec tds total hardness and total alkalinity due to effective bank filtration process it is observed that the concentration of trace elements is almost similar in both groundwater and rbf well water according to the bacteriological results it is confirmed that the coliform bacteria is present in river water 17 mpn of coliform bacteria 100 ml and absent in the rbf well water as well as in groundwater 0 mpn 100 ml very less fluoride ion concentration 0 19 mg l is found in the rbf well as compared to the groundwater in summary the hydrochemistry results have shown that the newly established rbf well has qualified the conditions of all drinking water limits bis 2012 the geophysical surveys ert ves and pumping tests are effectively applied to identify the low saline river aquifer interaction zone on the river bank the rbf well has provided potable water to the vommavaram village however the higher pumping rates in rbf well for longer pumping durations more than five hours could affect the groundwater table which may lead to water quality deterioration in order to maintain good quality of water throughout the water supply a regional groundwater flow model is to be developed for optimizing pumping rate and also for sustainable use of the rbf well 5 conclusions the rbf technique has been implemented sucessfully in the downstream coastal tracts of the varaha river basin visakhapatnam district of andhra pradesh to supply safe drinking water to the rural population ert profiles have identified the river aquifer interaction zone having resistivity values in the range of 14 24 ω m and the ves survey confirmed the suitability of proposed rbf well location on the riverbank the ec values of rbf well during pumping test are between 720 850 μs cm throughout the pumping period 5 h the quality of rbf well water is suitable for potable water supply in terms of physico chemical parameters bacteriological parameters chemical parameters and trace elements as compared to the groundwater and river water the improvement of water quality in rbf well is mainly due to the combination of river water and groundwater in view of poor groundwater quality in the coastal saline aquifer the application of geophysical surveys ert and ves along with pumping tests has an advantage to locate rbf site on the river bank for supplying safe drinking water it is recommended to formulate regional flow modeling to optimize pumping rates from rbf well without producing the effect of cone of depression or to avoid upconing phenomena and also for sustainable use

13923,the abundances of the napa narg nirk nirs norb noszi and noszii genes involved in all the steps of the bacterial denitrification pathway were monitored by a quantitative pcr approach in 4 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps the absolute and relative abundances of narg were greater than those of napa in all the surveyed facilities while few significant differences were found in the case of the nitrite reductase genes nirk and nirs greater absolute and relative abundances of the norb gene were always detected in the anoxic bioreactors and the noszi gene was more abundant than noszii in 3 of the wwtps analysed gene abundances were significantly linked to the variations of the operating parameters and environmental conditions influencing the wwtps using multivariate analysis taken together the solids retention time srt and the concentrations of nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 in the activated sludge were the major abiotic variables explaining the ordination of samples these results contribute to understand the shifts of the different groups of denitrifying bacteria in activated sludge seeking for operation strategies allowing to maximise n removal without increasing nitrous oxide n2o emissions keywords wastewater treatment denitrification qpcr multivariate analysis denitrifying genes 1 introduction denitrification is a major process for biological nitrogen n removal in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 2 this biochemical pathway allows respiration in the absence of oxygen o2 by the sequential use of nitrate no3 nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o as electron acceptors generating molecular nitrogen n2 as the end product among the microorganisms involved in this process the denitrifying systems of bacteria are well studied and comprise the enzymes nitrate nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases encoded by the napa narg nirk nirs norb and nosz structural genes respectively 3 although denitrifying bacteria can harbour in their genomes different combinations of genes encoding the abovementioned reductases or even all of them 4 5 and references therein imbalances of the activity of these enzymes bring about the release of intermediate products such as no2 no and or n2o 5 6 in wwtps these imbalances have been associated with variables such as the available concentrations of dissolved oxygen do and anoxic electron acceptors no3 no2 and no and the c n ratios 5 9 in addition it has been reported that most denitrifying bacteria lack the nosz gene required to carry out complete denitrification 10 11 thus denitrification tends to release n2o to the atmosphere which is a strong ozone depleting agent and may account for more than 80 of the total greenhouse gases released from wwtps 6 12 13 bacteria harbouring the napa and or narg genes provide no2 which is used as an electron acceptor by nirk and nirs type denitrifiers thus eliminating the toxicity of no2 by reducing it to no despite the important role of no3 reducers its abundance has infrequently been monitored in activated sludge 9 14 16 on the other hand the prevalence of nirs type no2 reducing bacteria over those harbouring the nirk gene has been often reported in wwtps 9 15 17 20 and therefore it is believed to play the dominant role in the no2 reduction process 21 the by product of no2 reductase activity no is unstable and easily transformed into n2o yet few studies have analysed the occurrence and abundance of the norb gene in wwtps or the abiotic factors involved in its control 20 22 because of the importance of nosz type denitrifiers in regulating n2o emissions a number of studies have quantified its abundance in wwtps e g 19 5 6 15 23 25 it has been concluded that denitrifiers harbouring the nosz gene often correlate negatively with do concentration 9 12 26 and ph 8 and positively with the available concentration of total n 14 recently a new clade of n2o reducers carrying an atypical form of the nosz gene noszii gene was described by jones et al 11 few attempts have been made in wwtps regarding the quantification of the abundance of noszii gene but recently vieira et al 9 found a higher abundance of transcripts of noszii gene compared to those of noszi suggesting that noszii type denitrifiers could be of great importance in wwtps the main purpose of the present study was to quantify the abundance of total bacteria gene markers 16s rrna genes and the denitrification genes napa narg nirk nirs norb noszi and noszii in activated sludge samples of 4 municipal wwtps microbial gene abundance was correlated with the operating and environmental variables exerting an influence on the wwtp facilities by applying multivariate analyses finally we evaluated the potential of denitrifiers in the activated sludge to completely reduce no3 and n2o to n2 by calculation of the napa narg nirk nirs and nirk nirs norb noszi noszii ratios respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the wwtps and samples collection the four municipal wwtps investigated in the study denoted as baza churriana padul and los vados were fully described previously 25 27 and their operational parameters are summarised in table s1 details are included in supplementary material activated sludge samples were monthly collected during the experimental period from the aerated and the anoxic bioreactors brs of each wwtp a randomized design was followed in order to sample evenly among the br volume samples 1 l were collected in sterile bottles shipped to the laboratory in a refrigerator and immediately stored at 4 c until their analysis the following parameters were monthly analysed in influent and effluent water samples during the period of december 2015 to april 2016 total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand at five days bod5 total phosphorus tp and ph table s2 using standard protocols 28 temperature t and the concentrations of do nh4 no3 and no2 were measured in the activated sludge as described elsewhere 25 data summarised in table s3 t and do of the wastewater in the brs were recorded during samplings using a digital thermometer and a portable do meter respectively 2 2 dna extraction and qpcr assays dna was extracted from activated sludge following the methods described by maza márquez et al 29 the numbers of copies of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and those of the genes related with denitrification napa narg nirk nirs norb noszi and noszii genes were quantified in each of the samples by qpcr in accordance with the miqe guidelines 30 using an mx3000 p qpcr system agilent technologies as described earlier 25 31 primers and amplification conditions are summarised in table s4 standard curves for absolute quantifications were constructed with plasmids carrying inserts of each of the denitrification genes amplified from the following culture collections strains pseudomonas putida ncb 957 bacterial 16s rrna genes p aeruginosa pao1 napa and narg ensifer meliloti 1021 nirk p fluorescens c7r12 nirs p stutzeri atcc 14405 norb bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens usda110 noszi and paraccocus denitrificans pd1222 noszii 32 plasmid quality was evaluated by electrophoresis in agarose gels 1 w v and concentrations were measured with the qubit ssdna assay the absolute abundances of the targeted denitrification genes in the samples were expressed as no copies per l of activated sludge while relative abundances were calculated as the percentage of the total abundance of the 16s rrna genes the calibration curves showed a correlation coefficient r2 0 99 in all the assays the efficiency of pcr amplification for all target genes was between 90 and 100 2 3 statistics normality and homoscedasticity assumptions for all the operational and environmental parameters were tested using shapiro wilk and bartlett s tests respectively with the aid of the r software http www rproject org the kruskal wallis test coupled with the conover iman test was used for multiple comparisons among samples multivariate statistical analyses mds and bio env were run using the primer software primer e v 6 0 plymouth uk following the procedures described in full detail by maza márquez et al 29 subsequently pearson s product moment correlation coefficients between the vectors representing biotic and abiotic variables in the mds plots were also calculated the absolute abundances of denitrification genes were used to estimate the potential of the activated sludge community to reduce no3 no2 and n2o by calculations of two ratios 33 34 ratio 1 included the genes involved in the reduction of no3 napa narg versus those involved in no2 reduction nirk nirs whereas ratio 2 takes into account the genes involved in the production of n2o nirk nirs norb versus those involved in its reduction noszi noszii 3 results 3 1 abundance of 16s rrna and denitrification genes in wwtps the results of the kruskal wallis test demonstrated that the absolute and relative quantifications of all the targeted gene markers were significantly different depending on the wwtp analysed while no differences were found among the different sampling dates consequently the results were grouped together to analyse the shifts of abundance of the targeted gene markers in the two brs aerated and anoxic of the four wwtps fig 1 shows the absolute quantifications of copies of the 16s rrna gene of total bacteria and those of the denitrifying genes in the four sewage treatment facilities little differences of abundance were observed between the brs of a same wwtp for all the targeted genes with the exception of norb which were always quantified at ca 1 order of magnitude higher in the anoxic brs the average numbers of copies of the bacterial 16s rrna gene remained in the same order of magnitude 11 4 11 9 log no copies l in the four wwtps however they were slightly but significantly higher in the anoxic brs of padul and los vados wwtps according to the conover iman test the numbers of copies of napa and narg ranged between 8 7 9 4 and 9 6 10 4 log no copies l respectively and the highest values were measured in the two brs of baza wwtp the absolute abundances of nirk and nirs ranged from 9 1 to 9 9 and 9 4 to 9 9 log no copies l and the highest numbers of these two genes were reached in the aerated brs of baza and padul wwtps respectively the absolute quantification of copies of norb showed significant variations among the four wwtps 8 9 10 3 log no copies l with maximum average numbers in the anoxic br of baza wwtp finally the noszi and noszii genes were measured in the ranges of 6 4 9 1 and 7 5 8 0 log no copies l respectively the highest average numbers of noszi were measured at

in activated sludge samples of 4 municipal wastewater treatment facilities to the best of the authors knowledge the simultaneous quantification of all the genes involved in the denitrification pathway in this type of engineered systems was not previously attempted overall the absolute abundances of narg nirk nirs and noszi genes fell within the ranges reported in earlier works 15 17 35 in all the four wwtps analysed the absolute and relative abundances of narg were greater ca 10 and 8 5 times higher respectively than those of napa figs 1 and 2 however the prevalence of the number of copies of narg over napa may be not only related to the higher abundance of bacteria carrying membrane bound rather than periplasmic no3 reductases since analyses of bacterial genomes have shown that usually 1 copy of napa 36 versus 1 3 copies of narg are harboured per cell 4 few previous studies have analysed the abundance of both types of nitrate reductase genes in wwtps leading to contradictory results shu et al 15 found that napa was several orders of magnitude more abundant than narg in samples retrieved from the aerated or anoxic bioreactors of 4 municipal and 2 industrial wwtps while narg was more abundant in a plant treating landfill leachate through an uasb a2o mbr combined process in contrast zhang et al 16 found no differences between the numbers of napa and narg genes in an electrolysis augmented constructed wetland treating a wwtp effluent in the present study the bio env analyses showed that the shifts in the abundances of napa and narg genes in the four wwtps were closely and distinctly correlated with several operational and environmental parameters the absolute and relative abundances of both genes were positively correlated with srt and the concentrations of no2 and no3 in the activated sludge while negative correlations were displayed with the concentrations of organic matter cod bod5 and nh4 table s5b and s6b figs 4 and 5 in this sense kim et al 14 observed a positive correlation between the abundance of copies of narg and the concentration of total n in a combined anoxic oxic activated sludge system while shu et al 15 found that napa and narg abundances had negative correlations with the concentrations of nh4 measured in both the influents and effluents of 12 municipal and industrial wwtps based on different technologies similar correlations among the abundance of napa narg and the availability of carbon and no3 have been also previously observed in soils 31 regarding the abundance of gene markers of nitrite reducing bacteria little differences were found among either the absolute or relative abundances of nirk and nirs in the four wwtps analysed figs 1 and 2 as already highlighted in the introduction section several earlier studies highlighted the prevalence of nirs over nirk in wwtps 9 15 17 20 37 in contrast geets et al 35 quantified similar abundances of both genes 108 109 copies l in activated sludges of a municipal and two industrial wwtps in line with the results presented here the bio env analyses evidenced that the abundance of nirk type denitrifiers was more strongly correlated with the changes of the environmental variables than that of nirs table s5b and table s6b figs 4 and 5 temperature was the environmental factor mostly influencing the absolute abundance of nirs which was higher at lower temperatures contrary to the trends exhibited by the nirk gene fig 4 table s5b similar opposite responses of nirs and nirk to temperature were previously observed in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor 37 and in samples from 12 municipal industrial wwtps 15 in soils the abundance of the nirs gene is often positively correlated with the no3 content whereas that of nirk increases with the organic carbon content of soils 38 39 the results in table s5b showed that the abundance of the nirs gene in activated sludge samples was negligibly correlated with no3 concentration whereas that of nirk was negatively correlated with cod and bod5 ratio 1 which provides a measure of the balance among nitrate and nitrite reducing genes remained in values close to 1 in churriana los vados and padul wwtps a greater prevalence of no3 reducing genes was observed in both brs in baza wwtp in agreement with the highest concentrations of no3 and no2 measured there table s3 since these two variables were positively correlated with the values of ratio 1 table s5b however the n threshold if any by which ratio 1 is controlled in the activated sludge cannot be elicited from our results despite the importance of the norb gene in controlling n2o emissions few studies have analysed its abundance in wwtps 20 22 interestingly in all the four wwtps surveyed here greater absolute and relative abundances of the norb gene were observed in the anoxic br than in the aerated br figs 1 and 2 the bio env analyses showed a strong negative correlation among the relative abundance of norb and the do content table s6b in agreement with previously published studies which reported a high oxygen sensibility of norb type denitrifiers 3 the results of the abundance of the norb gene are also in accordance with the observations of a previous study where the biological generation of n2o in activated sludge samples collected from the same set of wwtps was measured and greater amounts were always released by biomass taken from the anoxic brs 25 taken together the results presented here highlight that norb is a good molecular marker for understanding changes in the biological emission of n2o as previously observed in soils 31 33 although in wwtps the input of nitrifier denitrification to the generation of n2o under suboptimal do concentrations must also be taken into consideration 25 in addition fluctuations of do concentrations throughout the whole br volume or the generation of do concentration gradients within the flocs biomass were variables not considered in this study which should be taking into account in further work in order to confirm these findings a number of studies have dealt with the abundance of nosz type denitrifiers in wwtps because of their importance for mitigating n2o emissions e g 5 6 15 19 23 25 in this study we observed a greater prevalence of noszi over noszii type denitrifiers up to 3 orders of magnitude in 3 of the wwtps analysed while higher copy numbers of noszii were only measured in padul wwtp fig 1 in contrast vieira et al 9 found that transcripts of noszii genes were more abundant than those of noszi in three full scale wwtps however differences in the technological configuration of the wwtps analysed in this study versus those studied by vieira et al 9 and the fact that transcriptional analysis was not performed here make a direct comparison of the results difficult supporting that the distinct responses of nosz type denitrifiers should be further explored in wwtps furthermore the abundances of noszi and noszii genes measured here displayed opposed trends through the ordinations of the samples in the mds plots figs 4 and 5 which together with results of the bio env analyses table s5b and table s6b indicated that the two types of n2o reducers were differentially controlled by the environmental and operational parameters influencing the wwtps despite temperature was reported to negatively affect the abundance of n2o reductases of heterotrophic denitrifiers in wwtps 40 the results presented here showed a different response of noszi and noszii type denitrifiers fig 4 further studies are needed to demonstrate whether the observed distinct effect of temperature on nosz genes could subsequently affect the emission of n2o in wwtps the relative abundance of noszi gene also showed a positive correlation with cod fig 5 table s6b these results agree with the previous findings of shu et al 15 who reported that organic matter was favourable for the growth of denitrifying bacteria in addition shu et al 15 observed that gene copies of nirk in wwtps were nearly 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than noszi gene also in agreement with the results presented here fig 2 ratio 2 provides a calculation of the balance between the abundances of genes involved in n2o production nirk nirs norb and reduction noszi noszii fig 3 the average values of ratio 2 were 100 in all the analysed wwtps except churriana results of the bio env analyses showed that ratio 2 was positively influenced by several abiotic variables table s5b most remarkably those best explaining the ordination of samples srt no2 and no3 concentrations fig 4 which lead to the highest values of ratio 2 in baza wwtp fig 3 srt has been highlighted previously as a critical operational parameter to control n2o emissions in wwtps the results of the present study evidenced that the abundance of noszi type n2o reducers is favoured at shorter srt however srt must be long enough to forestall nitrite accumulation during nitrification since it is an intermediate of n2o generation by both denitrification and incomplete nitrification 41 emissions mostly take place in the aerated phases of wwtps and have been attributed to the activity of nitrifiers since the ratio between n2o n emitted and nh4 n removed in the aerobic phase increases as srt decreases 0 8 5 for 40 and 5 days respectively 42 however n2o may also be generated by denitrifiers in anoxic microniches within the aerated zone or even being transported from the anoxic to the aerated zones by recirculation 5 where emissions are additionally favoured by air stripping phenomena 12 optimizing srt is thus a key strategy to achieve an efficient removal of n while minimising the generation of n2o by either nitrifiers or heterotrophic denitrifiers in activated sludge 5 conclusions the results presented here show that the structure of the denitrifying communities changed among the wwtps studied and occasionally among the aerated and anoxic brs but no differences were observed throughout the 5 month sampling period greater absolute abundances of the narg napa nirk and norb genes involved in the sequential reduction of no3 to no were found when operating at longer srt and in those brs with the lowest cod and bod5 and the highest concentrations of no3 and no2 while the abundance of noszi displayed opposite trends of response and those of nirs and noszii were not significantly correlated with the aforementioned variables because of the distinct and sometimes opposite responses of the abundance of the analysed genes to operational environmental changes our results highlight the difficulty in designing a control strategy to achieve a successful no3 reduction and minimise n2o emissions in this type of engineered systems

13923,the abundances of the napa narg nirk nirs norb noszi and noszii genes involved in all the steps of the bacterial denitrification pathway were monitored by a quantitative pcr approach in 4 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps the absolute and relative abundances of narg were greater than those of napa in all the surveyed facilities while few significant differences were found in the case of the nitrite reductase genes nirk and nirs greater absolute and relative abundances of the norb gene were always detected in the anoxic bioreactors and the noszi gene was more abundant than noszii in 3 of the wwtps analysed gene abundances were significantly linked to the variations of the operating parameters and environmental conditions influencing the wwtps using multivariate analysis taken together the solids retention time srt and the concentrations of nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 in the activated sludge were the major abiotic variables explaining the ordination of samples these results contribute to understand the shifts of the different groups of denitrifying bacteria in activated sludge seeking for operation strategies allowing to maximise n removal without increasing nitrous oxide n2o emissions keywords wastewater treatment denitrification qpcr multivariate analysis denitrifying genes 1 introduction denitrification is a major process for biological nitrogen n removal in wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 2 this biochemical pathway allows respiration in the absence of oxygen o2 by the sequential use of nitrate no3 nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o as electron acceptors generating molecular nitrogen n2 as the end product among the microorganisms involved in this process the denitrifying systems of bacteria are well studied and comprise the enzymes nitrate nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases encoded by the napa narg nirk nirs norb and nosz structural genes respectively 3 although denitrifying bacteria can harbour in their genomes different combinations of genes encoding the abovementioned reductases or even all of them 4 5 and references therein imbalances of the activity of these enzymes bring about the release of intermediate products such as no2 no and or n2o 5 6 in wwtps these imbalances have been associated with variables such as the available concentrations of dissolved oxygen do and anoxic electron acceptors no3 no2 and no and the c n ratios 5 9 in addition it has been reported that most denitrifying bacteria lack the nosz gene required to carry out complete denitrification 10 11 thus denitrification tends to release n2o to the atmosphere which is a strong ozone depleting agent and may account for more than 80 of the total greenhouse gases released from wwtps 6 12 13 bacteria harbouring the napa and or narg genes provide no2 which is used as an electron acceptor by nirk and nirs type denitrifiers thus eliminating the toxicity of no2 by reducing it to no despite the important role of no3 reducers its abundance has infrequently been monitored in activated sludge 9 14 16 on the other hand the prevalence of nirs type no2 reducing bacteria over those harbouring the nirk gene has been often reported in wwtps 9 15 17 20 and therefore it is believed to play the dominant role in the no2 reduction process 21 the by product of no2 reductase activity no is unstable and easily transformed into n2o yet few studies have analysed the occurrence and abundance of the norb gene in wwtps or the abiotic factors involved in its control 20 22 because of the importance of nosz type denitrifiers in regulating n2o emissions a number of studies have quantified its abundance in wwtps e g 19 5 6 15 23 25 it has been concluded that denitrifiers harbouring the nosz gene often correlate negatively with do concentration 9 12 26 and ph 8 and positively with the available concentration of total n 14 recently a new clade of n2o reducers carrying an atypical form of the nosz gene noszii gene was described by jones et al 11 few attempts have been made in wwtps regarding the quantification of the abundance of noszii gene but recently vieira et al 9 found a higher abundance of transcripts of noszii gene compared to those of noszi suggesting that noszii type denitrifiers could be of great importance in wwtps the main purpose of the present study was to quantify the abundance of total bacteria gene markers 16s rrna genes and the denitrification genes napa narg nirk nirs norb noszi and noszii in activated sludge samples of 4 municipal wwtps microbial gene abundance was correlated with the operating and environmental variables exerting an influence on the wwtp facilities by applying multivariate analyses finally we evaluated the potential of denitrifiers in the activated sludge to completely reduce no3 and n2o to n2 by calculation of the napa narg nirk nirs and nirk nirs norb noszi noszii ratios respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the wwtps and samples collection the four municipal wwtps investigated in the study denoted as baza churriana padul and los vados were fully described previously 25 27 and their

thermometer and a portable do meter respectively 2 2 dna extraction and qpcr assays dna was extracted from activated sludge following the methods described by maza márquez et al 29 the numbers of copies of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and those of the genes related with denitrification napa narg nirk nirs norb noszi and noszii genes were quantified in each of the samples by qpcr in accordance with the miqe guidelines 30 using an mx3000 p qpcr system agilent technologies as described earlier 25 31 primers and amplification conditions are summarised in table s4 standard curves for absolute quantifications were constructed with plasmids carrying inserts of each of the denitrification genes amplified from the following culture collections strains pseudomonas putida ncb 957 bacterial 16s

pd1222 noszii 32 plasmid quality was evaluated by electrophoresis in agarose gels 1 w v and concentrations were measured with the qubit ssdna assay the absolute abundances of the targeted denitrification genes in the samples were expressed as no copies per l of activated sludge while relative abundances were calculated as the percentage of the total abundance of the 16s rrna genes the calibration curves showed a correlation coefficient r2 0 99 in all the assays the efficiency of pcr amplification for all target genes was between 90 and 100 2 3 statistics normality and homoscedasticity assumptions for all the operational and environmental parameters were tested using shapiro wilk and bartlett s tests respectively with the aid of the r software http www rproject org the kruskal wallis test coupled with the conover iman test was used for multiple comparisons among samples multivariate statistical analyses mds and bio env were run using the primer software primer e v 6 0 plymouth uk following the procedures described in full detail by maza márquez et al 29 subsequently pearson s product moment correlation coefficients between the vectors representing biotic and abiotic variables in the mds plots were also calculated the absolute abundances of denitrification genes were used to estimate the potential of the activated sludge community to reduce no3 no2 and n2o by calculations of two ratios 33 34 ratio 1 included the genes involved in the reduction of no3 napa narg versus those involved in no2 reduction nirk nirs whereas ratio 2 takes into account the genes involved in the production of n2o nirk nirs norb versus those involved in its reduction noszi noszii 3 results 3 1 abundance of 16s rrna and denitrification genes in wwtps the results of the kruskal wallis test demonstrated that the absolute and relative quantifications of all the targeted gene markers were significantly different depending on the wwtp analysed while no differences were found among the different sampling dates consequently the results were grouped together to analyse the shifts of abundance of the targeted gene markers in the two brs aerated and anoxic of the four wwtps fig 1 shows the absolute quantifications of copies of the 16s rrna gene of total bacteria and those of the denitrifying genes in the four sewage treatment facilities little differences of abundance were observed between the brs of a same wwtp for all the targeted genes with the exception of norb which were always quantified at ca 1 order of magnitude higher in the anoxic brs the average numbers of copies of the bacterial 16s rrna gene remained in the same order of magnitude 11 4 11 9 log no copies l in the four wwtps however they were slightly but significantly higher in the anoxic brs of padul and los vados wwtps according to the conover iman test the numbers of copies of napa and narg ranged between 8 7 9 4 and 9 6 10 4 log no copies l respectively and the highest values were measured in the two brs of baza wwtp the absolute abundances of nirk and nirs ranged from 9 1 to 9 9 and 9 4 to 9 9 log no copies l and the highest numbers of these two genes were reached in the aerated brs of baza and padul wwtps respectively the absolute quantification of copies of norb showed significant variations among the four wwtps 8 9 10 3 log no copies l with maximum average numbers in the anoxic br of baza wwtp finally the noszi and noszii genes were measured in the ranges of 6 4 9 1 and 7 5 8 0 log no copies l respectively the highest average numbers of noszi were measured at both brs in churriana wwtp whereas the anoxic br of padul wwtp rendered the highest abundance of noszii copies per l activated sludge regarding the relative abundances of napa narg nirk nirs norb

correlations among the abundance of napa narg and the availability of carbon and no3 have been also previously observed in soils 31 regarding the abundance of gene markers of nitrite reducing bacteria little differences were found among either the absolute or relative abundances of nirk and nirs in the four wwtps analysed figs 1 and 2 as already highlighted in the introduction section several earlier studies highlighted the prevalence of nirs over nirk in wwtps 9 15 17 20 37 in contrast geets et al 35 quantified similar abundances of both genes 108 109 copies l in activated sludges of a municipal and two industrial wwtps in line with the results presented here the bio env analyses evidenced that the abundance of nirk type denitrifiers was more strongly correlated with the changes of the environmental variables than that of nirs table s5b and table s6b figs 4 and 5 temperature was the environmental factor mostly influencing the absolute abundance of nirs which was higher at lower temperatures contrary to the trends exhibited by the nirk gene fig 4 table s5b similar opposite responses of nirs and nirk to temperature were previously observed in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor 37 and in samples from 12 municipal industrial wwtps 15 in soils the abundance of the nirs gene is often positively correlated with the no3 content whereas that of nirk increases with the organic carbon content of soils 38 39 the results in table s5b showed that the abundance of the nirs gene in activated sludge samples was negligibly correlated with no3 concentration whereas that of nirk was negatively correlated with cod and bod5 ratio 1 which provides a measure of the balance among nitrate and nitrite reducing genes remained in values close to 1 in churriana los vados and padul wwtps a greater prevalence of no3 reducing genes was observed in both brs in baza wwtp in agreement with the highest concentrations of no3 and no2 measured there table s3 since these two variables were positively correlated with the values of ratio 1 table s5b however the n threshold if any by which ratio 1 is controlled in the activated sludge cannot be elicited from our results despite the importance of the norb gene in controlling n2o emissions few studies have analysed its abundance in wwtps 20 22 interestingly in all the four wwtps surveyed here greater absolute and relative abundances of the norb gene were observed in the anoxic br than in the aerated br figs 1 and 2 the bio env analyses showed a strong negative correlation among the relative abundance of norb and the do content table s6b in agreement with previously published studies which reported a high oxygen sensibility of norb type denitrifiers 3 the results of the abundance of the norb gene are also in accordance with the observations of a previous study where the biological generation of n2o in activated sludge samples collected from the same set of wwtps was measured and greater amounts were always released by biomass taken from the anoxic brs 25 taken together the results presented here highlight that norb is a good molecular marker for understanding changes in the biological emission of n2o as previously observed in soils 31 33 although in wwtps the input of nitrifier denitrification to the generation of n2o under suboptimal do concentrations must also be taken into consideration 25 in addition fluctuations of do concentrations throughout the whole br volume or the generation of do concentration gradients within the flocs biomass were variables not considered in this study which should be taking into account in further work in order to confirm these findings a number of studies have dealt with the abundance of nosz type denitrifiers in wwtps because of their importance for mitigating n2o emissions e g 5 6 15 19 23 25 in this study we observed a greater prevalence of noszi over noszii type denitrifiers up to 3 orders of magnitude in 3 of the wwtps analysed while higher copy numbers of noszii were only measured in padul wwtp fig 1 in contrast vieira et al 9 found that transcripts of noszii genes were more abundant than those of noszi in three full scale wwtps however differences in the technological configuration of the wwtps analysed in this study versus those studied by vieira et al 9 and the fact that transcriptional analysis was not performed here make a direct comparison of the results difficult supporting that the distinct responses of nosz type denitrifiers should be further explored in wwtps furthermore the abundances of noszi and noszii genes measured here displayed opposed trends through the ordinations of the samples in the mds plots figs 4 and 5 which together with results of the bio env analyses table s5b and table s6b indicated that the two types of n2o reducers were differentially controlled by the environmental and operational parameters influencing the wwtps despite temperature was reported to negatively affect the abundance of n2o reductases of heterotrophic denitrifiers in wwtps 40 the results presented here showed a different response of noszi and noszii type denitrifiers fig 4 further studies are needed to demonstrate whether the observed distinct effect of temperature on nosz genes could subsequently affect the emission of n2o in wwtps the relative abundance of noszi gene also showed a positive correlation with cod fig 5 table s6b these results agree with the previous findings of shu et al 15 who reported that organic matter was favourable for the growth of denitrifying bacteria in addition shu et al 15 observed that gene copies of nirk in wwtps were nearly 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than noszi gene also in agreement with the results presented here fig 2 ratio 2 provides a calculation of the balance between the abundances of genes involved in n2o production nirk nirs norb and reduction noszi noszii fig 3 the average values of ratio 2 were 100 in all the analysed wwtps except churriana results of the bio env analyses showed that ratio 2 was positively influenced by several abiotic variables table s5b most remarkably those best explaining the ordination of samples srt no2 and no3 concentrations fig 4 which lead to the highest values of ratio 2 in baza wwtp fig 3 srt has been highlighted previously as a critical operational parameter to control n2o emissions in wwtps the results of the present study evidenced that the abundance of noszi type n2o reducers is favoured at shorter srt however srt must be long enough to forestall nitrite accumulation during nitrification since it is an intermediate of n2o generation by both denitrification and incomplete nitrification 41 emissions mostly take place in the aerated phases of wwtps and have been attributed to the activity of nitrifiers since the ratio between n2o n emitted and nh4 n removed in the aerobic phase increases as srt decreases 0 8 5 for 40 and 5 days respectively 42 however n2o may also be generated by denitrifiers in anoxic microniches within the aerated zone or even being transported from the anoxic to the aerated zones by recirculation 5 where emissions are additionally favoured by air stripping phenomena 12 optimizing srt is thus a key strategy to achieve an efficient removal of n while minimising the generation of n2o by either nitrifiers or heterotrophic denitrifiers in activated sludge 5 conclusions the results presented here show that the structure of the denitrifying communities changed among the wwtps studied and occasionally among the aerated and anoxic brs but no differences were observed throughout the 5 month sampling period greater absolute abundances of the narg napa nirk and norb genes involved in the sequential reduction of no3 to no were found when operating at longer srt and in those brs with the lowest cod and bod5 and the highest concentrations of no3 and no2 while the abundance of noszi displayed opposite trends of response and those of nirs and noszii were not significantly correlated with the aforementioned variables because of the distinct and sometimes opposite responses of the abundance of the analysed genes to operational environmental changes our results highlight the difficulty in designing a control strategy to achieve a successful no3 reduction and minimise n2o emissions in this type of engineered systems

13924,rapid small scale column tests rsscts have been previously used to predict the effluent concentration of a single nutrient in large filters with good accuracy however in drainage waters originating from heavy textured soils where there is a need for in ditch filters to retain both dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and ammonium nh4 simultaneously the suitability of a rssct approach to model both parameters must be proved in this study a decision support tool was used to identify appropriate media that may be placed in filters for the removal of drp and nh4 the selected media for this study were sand and zeolite both media were placed in acrylic tubes each with an internal diameter of 0 01 m and with lengths ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 m and their performance for simultaneous removal of drp and nh4 1 mg drp and nh4 n l 1 from water was evaluated the data generated from the rsscts were used to model drp and nh4 removals in 0 4 m long laboratory columns of internal diameter 0 1 m which had the same media configuration as the small columns and were operated using the same influent concentrations the developed model successfully predicted the effluent concentration of both the drp and nh4 n from the large columns this indicates using rsscts to model the performance of filters will produce substantial savings in operational financial and labour costs without affecting the accuracy of model predictions keywords adsorption phosphorus ammonium agriculture drainage water 1 introduction intensification of agriculture through crop growth strategies and increased animal stocking rates has been enacted in many countries of the european union eu 1 this may result in unabated diffuse and point source nutrient nitrogen n and phosphorus p losses to water bodies causing multiple effects on environmental systems while traveling along biogeochemical pathways and continua from soil to water bodies 2 3 as surface and subsurface storage components of these mixed nutrients are large critical and incidental losses which are deleterious for the aquatic system will occur 4 5 therefore alongside existing best management practices to mitigate surface and groundwater nutrient losses there is a need for a number of additional measures that can intercept and mitigate nutrients before they leave the farm system engineered remediation technologies often referred to as engineered structures are amongst these measures and have moved beyond proof of concept in recent years 6 these are placed at nutrient pollution delivery points in hydrologically active areas 7 where the soil natural attenuation capacity does not exist or has already been exhausted due to accumulation of nutrients 8 these structures include installation of structures filled with p sorbing materials 9 10 to intercept surface runoff in ditch control structures designed to remove both p and n in drainage waters 11 and denitrifying bioreactors connected to tile systems that are filled with carbon based media that convert nitrate no3 to di nitrogen gas 11 13 efforts are now being made to make the use of engineered structures as a sustainable pollution remediation technique that takes local environmental and financial conditions of the user into consideration ezzati et al 14 developed a decision support tool dst to assist users in the selection of locally sourced media for use in mitigating pollution associated with excess nutrients in drainage waters which incorporates several factors important in choosing filter media such as lifespan hydraulic conductivity the potential for pollution swapping attenuation of non target contaminants e g pesticides organic carbon etc local availability and costs associated with transporting media to site within this dst several water contamination scenarios were identified such as no3 only dissolved reactive phosphorus drp only or a mixed discharge of ammonium nh4 and drp on heavy textured soils where land drainage has been installed to extend the grazing season there is a large body of evidence e g 15 that identifies nh4 not no3 and drp as the main nutrients of concern in both shallow and groundwater drainage systems the aim of the current study is to design and quantify the effectiveness of small filters containing appropriate media capable of retaining both nh4 and drp prior to deployment of filters in field situations it is advisable to characterise the adsorption capacity of the media using batch experiments these tests are quick cheap and easy to perform 16 but fail to replicate in field conditions in which there may be additional variables such as fluctuating water temperatures flow dynamics and pollutant loads consequently they often fail to accurately estimate lifespan or effectiveness of the media 17 as the accurate estimation of long term performance of a medium is only possible under continuous flow conditions in the field 18 the closest simulation to in field conditions is to allow nutrient rich water to flow through large scale adsorption columns which are frequently operated in the laboratory 19 20 however these tests are costly and may take a long period to reach steady state conditions 21 rapid small scale column tests rsscts which use only a minimum quantity of medium and contaminant solution have been developed to reproduce the results of large scale column studies 22 callery et al 23 used rsscts to predict the long term p retention performance of large scale single medium adsorption filters callery and healy 24 developed the model further to predict medium saturation as well as filter pore and effluent concentration data this rssct and modeling approach has never been attempted to examine a mixed contaminant scenario such as that found in heavy textured soils i e the simultaneous treatment of drp and nh4 such a scenario would necessitate the presence of more than one medium in a filter that would retain both nutrients of environmental concern in drainage waters therefore the objective of the current study is to examine the efficacy of the rssct modeling approach in predicting drp and nh4 effluent concentration that simultaneously pass through large scale columns filled with two media if this methodology proves successful this approach may provide an accurate and quick method of predicting the performance of filter media that may negate the need for long term and expensive large scale column studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 media selection using batch experiments and falling head tests the dst developed by ezzati et al 14 was used to generate a list of media capable of mitigating drp and nh4 in drainage water table 1 stage 1 batch and adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted to identify media with the highest adsorption capacities for drp and nh4 table 1 stage 2 the batch experiments were conducted as follows 2 g of locally sourced media identified in stage 1 were placed in 50 ml capacity glass containers each medium was overlain with 35 ml of distilled water which was amended with both kh2po4 and nh4cl to produce mixed drp and nh4 n solutions with concentrations ranging from 1 mg l 1 to 40 mg l 1 the containers were then sealed and placed in an end over end shaker for 24 h following this the samples were allowed to settle for 1 h and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min before the supernatant was withdrawn and filtered using 0 45 μm filters all water samples were analysed for drp and nh4 n within 24 h using a thermo konelab 20 analyser technical lab services ontario canada a multipoint langmuir isotherm 25 was used to estimate the adsorption capacity of each medium the specific adsorption qe the mass of nutrient adsorbed per unit mass of amendment at equilibrium g kg 1 was calculated from the following equation 25 1 q e c 0 c e v m where ce is the concentration of nutrient drp or nh4 n in solution at equilibrium mg l 1 c0 is initial concentration v is the volume of

1 of the media selected in stage 2 table 1 stage 3 this parameter helps in avoiding filter clogging and is considered to be one of the factors that ensures effective operation of filters segismundo et al 2017 the elemental composition of selected media was analysed with a rigaku nex cg energy dispersive x ray fluorescence bench top spectrometer edxrf rigaku austin usa 2 2 preparation of filter columns in this experiment two sets of filter columns were constructed small columns with lengths ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 m internal diameter 0 01 m and large columns with lengths of 0 4 m internal diameter 0 1 m fig 1 and figure s1 in the supplementary material for both scales the selected media for drp and nh4 retention was sand and zeolite respectively the packing density for sand and zeolite was 1 8 g cm 3 and 0 92 g cm 3 respectively each large column was instrumented with an inlet pipe at the base and an outlet pipe which was positioned 0 38 m from the base after the second media the media overlay a fine metal mesh positioned 0 01 m from the base to prevent clogging and to allow for uniform water distribution the columns were positioned vertically and fixed on a steel frame with flow entering the bottom of the columns for the large columns two media configurations were used to investigate possible differences in nutrient breakthrough such an aspect is important in real world filters where the first medium acts as a bulk removal medium with a large capacity for the contaminant and the second medium captures the low concentration of the remaining contaminant e g drp before discharge the media configurations were as follows sand over zeolite or zeolite over sand each at n 3 and each layer was 0 19 m deep giving a total depth of filter media of 0 38 m for the small columns polycarbonate tubes with an internal diameter of 0 01 m and lengths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m were used fig 1 b plastic syringes were connected to either end of the columns into which acid washed glass wool 2 g was placed to retain the media and avoid microbial growth the columns were positioned vertically and fixed in retort stands with flow entering the bottom of the columns as media configuration change made no difference to retention section 3 2 a single configuration was chosen i e zeolite over sand to achieve a similar packing density to the large columns for each column length a mass of 12 4 24 9 37 4 and 49 7 g of sand and 6 3 12 7 19 1 and 25 5 g of zeolite were used for the 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m columns respectively 2 3 operation of the filter units prior to the start of the experiment potable water was pumped through the small and large columns to remove background concentrations of drp and nh4 when the outlet concentrations were 0 01 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg nh4 n l 1 the experiment commenced kh2po4 and nh4cl were used to produce mixed influent water for the large and small columns with concentrations of 1 mg l 1 and 1 mg nh4 n l 1 as the objective of the study was to examine the efficacy of the rssct modeling approach in predicting drp and nh4 effluent concentration effects such as competitive adsorption between multiple contaminants were not examined peristaltic pumps were used to pump the influent water to the large columns at a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 156 cm d 1 which is similar to the hlr applied in onsite wastewater filtration systems 61 the large columns were operated for 42 d with the pumps operational for 5 h per day for the small columns influent water with a concentration of 1 mg l 1 and 1 mg nh4 n l 1 was pumped into the base of the columns at a hlr 52 8 cm d 1 for 6 h per day the hlr was chosen so as the median empty bed contact time ebct of the small columns was similar to the large columns the duration of the small column experiment was 11 d which was the length of time over which both drp and nh4 n removals dropped below 100 to provide enough data for model generation 2 4 data collection and analysis for both column scales the influent daily and effluent different time points were sampled in 50 ml tubes and filtered immediately through 0 45 μm filters and analysed for drp and nh4 n within 24 h using a thermo konelab 20 analyser technical lab services ontario canada during the first 4 days of operation of the large columns the effluent was sampled after every bed volume after reaching steady state conditions defined as the point at which the effluent concentration began to stabilise sampling was increased to every 5 bed volumes for another 2 days and later on increased to every 10 bed volumes for the small columns sampling was conducted every two hours on each sampling occasion two samples were taken from each column a sample 5 ml was taken directly from the effluent marking the end of the 2 h period and compared with the influent daily concentration and a sub sample 50 ml was taken from the total filtered volume in that 2 h composite period in order to model the effluent concentrations

least error squared errsq of difference between the predicted and the actual effluent concentrations they were then applied to predict the effluent concentration of the large columns as the concentration of nh4 effluent in the 0 2 to 0 4 m columns was zero during the early bed volumes of the experiment i e 100 retention was achieved initially data for the modelling process were taken after 12 bed volumes for all column sizes from this period onwards the retention in the columns dropped below 100 2 5 statistics to assess if there were any differences in of nutrient retention

of retention based on the configuration 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of media the final selected media for the small and large column experiments were coarse sand particle size 1 2 mm sourced from the south west of ireland with a high iron fe content and natural turkish yildizeli zeolite particle size 1 3 mm batch experiment results indicated that both the sand and zeolite had good drp and nh4 removals and had good ksat values for the column experiments table 2 the sand had a qmax of 8 34 g drp kg 1 with a binding energy k of 2 87 l mg 1 table 2 this qmax was higher than other sands commonly used in filter systems e g danish sands which have 0 02 to 0 13 g drp kg 1 33 zeolite which is an aluminosilicate mineral also had good drp retention similar to the results of other studies 34 36 zeolite used in the current study to target nh4 removal had an aluminium al content of 12 8 table 2 which is within the range of commonly used filter p materials i e 1 3 to over 40 37 according to penn et al 7 high fe and al content of a p sorption material indicates ligand exchange ion binding to a metal as the main mechanism for drp retention rather than precipitation which would occur in high calcium content materials zeolite had a qmax of 39 5 g nh4 n kg 1 with a binding energy of 9 8 l mg 1 table 2 the nh4 n retention mechanism was either molecular adsorption or ion exchange 38 various ranges of qmax for zeolite are found in the literature due to variations in country of origin and chemical element 32 e g 15 3 25 g nh4 n kg 1 39 40 41 31 9 g nh4 n kg 1 42 and 40 3 g nh4 n kg 1 36 these have resulted in 84 to complete nh4 n removal 99 depending on operational conditions such as influent concentration temperature ph and adsorbent dosage 3 2 retention of drp and nh4 n in the columns for the large columns the drp retention was initially high at 95 for the first two empty bed volumes vb of filtered solution and decreased gradually to 13 after 100 pore volumes 43 vb fig 2 one hundred percent nh4 n retention was achieved for the first 25 pore volumes but decreased to 80 after 120 pore volumes 52 vb fig 3 similar trends in nh4 n retention using zeolite were also documented by other studies 43 41 44 clinoptilolite zeolite is known to be a very good ion exchanger 32 and a high adsorption rate has been associated with diffusion of nh4 n ions 45 through macropores and mesopores to the surface of zeolite 46 the configuration of the media did not affect drp or nh4 retentions p 0 05 the use of dual media placed side by side in a filter with each designed to adsorb either p or n from different wastewater types has been previously investigated e g 47 and similar to the current study other studies have found that configuration of the media n adsorbing media before p adsorbing media or vice versa does not affect p or n removal 48 the small columns were p saturated after 1 l of filtered volume vb 50 for the 0 3 m column whereas the nh4 saturation of the columns took substantially longer to occur the 0 1 m column was 80 saturated after approximately 10 l filter volumes vb 1550 and duration of complete removal was related to the length of the column unlike many batch adsorption experiments and large scale column tests examining the nh4 removal efficiency of zeolite rsscts operated under continuous loading of a few hours per day has never been investigated however the results here are in agreement with other studies which showed a positive relationship between removal efficiency mass of adsorbent and contact time 41 3 3 predicting drp effluent concentration in large columns using scale column data regardless of media configuration the model developed using the small column data table 3 errsq 5 56 was able to predict the trend of drp effluent in the large columns fig 2 superimposes the modelled data from the small columns onto the measured data from the large columns and fig 4 presents the observed versus modelled data using coefficients from small column tests for each individual column and configuration the constant of heterogeneity b was a dominant coefficient in predicting effluent concentrations this is indicative of potentially multiple adsorption mechanisms responsible for nutrient removal which can be explained by the fact that the model is predicting combined removal efficiency of two media with different elemental compositions table 2 which are packed into one filter column according to callery and healy 24 the curve produced by eqn 4 which is based on second order kinetics can indicate the importance of intraparticle diffusion 49 for model prediction within small columns at different lengths this is shown in fig 2 where the tailing of the breakthrough curve has likely been caused by intra particle diffusion 50 this may become significant as the surface of the medium media become saturated or as ebct increases 24 3 4 predicting nh4 n effluent concentration from large columns using small columns complete nh4 n removal was observed during the initial operational period of the large and small columns which is consistent with other studies 51 53 41 consequently the small columns were operated for a longer period of time 11 d in total to generate enough data for the successful prediction of nh4 n effluent concentrations leaving the large columns eqn 4 predicted the behaviour of the filters in retaining nh4 n fig 3 and fig 5 presents observed versus modelled data using coefficients from small column tests for each individual column the constant of heterogeneity in nh4 n adsorption b was less than drp table 4 which indicates that zeolite not sand was the only medium in the columns capable of nh4 n retention as also observed in the batch experiment however the high k values indicate that the adsorption rate did not follow a linear regression with filter depth as initially proposed by filter bed depth service time bdst 54 which has been used by many adsorption studies the bdst model assumes that intraparticle diffusion is negligible 55 which becomes an important factor as a medium s surface becomes more saturated 24 50 the proposed model in this study is therefore describing a real world adsorption system in which several factors control the adsorption crini and badot 2010 meaning that larger amounts of media and increased contact time may not produce directly proportionally higher adsorption a similar lack of proportionality between the length of columns amount of adsorbent and increase in nh4 n retention has been reported by sarioğlu 56 although the experiments were carefully designed to provide similar environmental conditions for all columns there was a small difference between data generated from various large scale columns in order to avoid any bias average effluent data were used to generate model parameters 3 5 implications of study for drainage filters to date large scale columns have been mainly used to estimate nutrient saturation and longevity of media to replicate operational conditions 57 20 58 however moving from large scale columns to rsscts would gain financial and labour advantages whilst not sacrificing the accuracy of model outcomes this may include considerable savings on time required for constructing and operating the columns labour hours and number of staff required space required to house the structure and experimental set up number capacity of containers amount of influent chemical and distilled water procurement of adsorbent s media and sampling equipment e g tubes syringes filter pours number of pumps cost of laboratory analysis of water samples and overhead costs including electricity and light the results of this study validated the model showing that it could upscale rsscts accurately to describe the pattern of large scale column performance however it is important to design the experiment carefully so as the media becomes partially saturated over the duration of the experiment in the current study the modelling parameters of eqn 4 predicted the nh4 n effluent concentration in the large columns only after the retention of nh4 n in the small columns dropped to below 100 fig 6 presents a flowchart which shows steps towards the implementation of an efficient field scale engineered structure filled with adsorptive media to treat drp and nh4 n in drainage water in general a successful implementation includes characterisation of nutrient losses in the farm correct choice of medium media with a high nutrient retention capacity and which does not contribute to pollution swapping 14 characterisation of the retention capacity and therefore lifetime of the selected media and the identification of an optimal location for installation of structure 8 this would ultimately provide a sustainable and cost effective mitigation for the removal of mixed contaminants in agricultural ditches 4 conclusions in this study rapid small scale column tests were used to predict effluent drp and nh4 n concentrations from much larger columns with good accuracy as large scale laboratory filter column tests are time consuming and expensive but are considered to replicate in field conditions well the methodology used in this study will save operational financial and labour costs whilst providing good model predictions of drp and nh4 n future work should consider

installed to extend the grazing season there is a large body of evidence e g 15 that identifies nh4 not no3 and drp as the main nutrients of concern in both shallow and groundwater drainage systems the aim of the current study is to design and quantify the effectiveness of small filters containing appropriate media capable of retaining both nh4 and drp prior to deployment of filters in field situations it is advisable to characterise the adsorption capacity of the media using batch experiments these tests are quick cheap and easy to perform 16 but fail to replicate in field conditions in which there may be additional variables such as fluctuating water temperatures flow dynamics and pollutant loads consequently they often fail to accurately estimate lifespan or effectiveness of the media 17 as the accurate estimation of long term performance of a medium is only possible under continuous flow conditions in the field 18 the closest simulation to in field conditions is to allow nutrient rich water to flow through large scale adsorption columns which are frequently operated in the laboratory 19 20 however these tests are costly and may take a long period to reach steady state conditions 21 rapid small scale column tests rsscts which use only a minimum quantity of medium and contaminant solution have been developed to reproduce the results of large scale column studies 22 callery et al 23 used rsscts to predict the long term p retention performance of large scale single medium adsorption filters callery and healy 24 developed the model further to predict medium saturation as well as filter pore and effluent concentration data this rssct and modeling approach has never been attempted to examine a mixed contaminant scenario such as that found in heavy textured soils i e the simultaneous treatment of drp and nh4 such a scenario would necessitate the presence of more than one medium in a filter that would retain both nutrients of environmental concern in drainage waters therefore the objective of the current study is to examine the efficacy of the rssct modeling approach in predicting drp and nh4 effluent concentration that simultaneously pass through large scale columns filled with two media if this methodology proves successful this approach may provide an accurate and quick method of predicting the performance of filter media that may negate the need for long term and expensive large scale column studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 media selection using batch experiments and falling head tests the dst developed by ezzati et al 14 was used to generate a list of media capable of mitigating drp and nh4 in drainage water table 1 stage 1 batch and adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted to identify media with the highest adsorption capacities for drp and nh4 table 1 stage 2 the batch experiments were conducted as follows 2 g of locally sourced media identified in stage 1 were placed in 50 ml capacity glass containers each medium was overlain with 35 ml of distilled water which was amended with both kh2po4 and nh4cl to produce mixed drp and nh4 n solutions with concentrations ranging from 1 mg l 1 to 40 mg l 1 the containers were then sealed and placed in an end over end shaker for 24 h following this the samples were allowed to settle for 1 h and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min before the supernatant was withdrawn and filtered using 0 45 μm filters all water samples were analysed for drp and nh4 n within 24 h using a thermo konelab 20 analyser technical lab services ontario canada a multipoint langmuir isotherm 25 was used to estimate the adsorption capacity of each medium the specific adsorption qe the mass of nutrient adsorbed per unit mass of amendment at equilibrium g kg 1 was calculated from the following equation 25 1 q e c 0 c e v m where ce is the concentration of nutrient drp or nh4 n in solution at equilibrium mg l 1 c0 is initial concentration v is the volume of

1 of the media selected in stage 2 table 1 stage 3 this parameter helps in avoiding filter clogging and is considered to be one of the factors that ensures effective operation of filters segismundo et al 2017 the elemental composition of selected media was analysed with a rigaku nex cg energy dispersive x ray fluorescence bench top spectrometer edxrf rigaku austin usa 2 2 preparation of filter columns in this experiment two sets of filter columns were constructed small columns with lengths ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 m internal diameter 0 01 m and large columns with lengths of 0 4 m internal diameter 0 1 m fig 1 and figure s1 in the supplementary material for both scales the selected media for drp and nh4 retention was sand and zeolite respectively the packing density for sand and zeolite was 1 8 g cm 3 and 0 92 g cm 3 respectively each large column was instrumented with an inlet pipe at the base and an outlet pipe which was positioned 0 38 m from the base after the second media the media overlay a fine metal mesh positioned 0 01 m from the base to prevent clogging and to allow for uniform water distribution the columns were positioned vertically and fixed on a steel frame with flow entering the bottom of the columns for the large columns two media configurations were used to investigate possible differences in nutrient breakthrough such an aspect is important in real world filters where the first medium acts as a bulk removal medium with a large capacity for the contaminant and the second medium captures the low concentration of the remaining contaminant e g drp before discharge the media configurations were as follows sand over zeolite or zeolite over sand each at n 3 and each layer was 0 19 m deep giving a total depth of filter media of 0 38 m for the small columns polycarbonate tubes with an internal diameter of 0 01 m and lengths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m were used fig 1 b plastic syringes were connected to either end of the columns into which acid washed glass wool 2 g was placed to retain the media and avoid microbial growth the columns were positioned vertically and fixed in retort stands with flow entering the bottom of the columns as media configuration change made no difference to retention section 3 2 a single configuration was chosen i e zeolite over sand to achieve a similar packing density to the large columns for each column length a mass of 12 4 24 9 37 4 and 49 7 g of sand and 6 3 12 7 19 1 and 25 5 g of zeolite were used for the 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m columns respectively 2 3 operation of the filter units prior to the start of the experiment potable water was pumped through the small and large columns to remove background concentrations of drp and nh4 when the outlet concentrations were 0 01 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg nh4 n l 1 the experiment commenced kh2po4 and nh4cl were used to produce mixed influent water for the large and small columns with concentrations of 1 mg l 1 and 1 mg nh4 n l 1 as the objective of the study was to examine the efficacy of the rssct modeling approach in predicting drp and nh4 effluent concentration effects such as competitive adsorption between multiple contaminants were not examined peristaltic pumps were used to pump the influent water to the large columns at a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 156 cm d 1 which is similar to the hlr applied in onsite wastewater filtration systems 61 the large columns were operated for 42 d with the pumps operational for 5 h per day for the small columns influent water with a concentration of 1 mg l 1 and 1 mg nh4 n l 1 was pumped into the base of the columns at a hlr 52 8 cm d 1 for 6 h per day the hlr was chosen so as the median empty bed contact time ebct of the small columns was similar to the large columns the duration of the small column experiment was 11 d which was the length of time over which both drp and nh4 n removals dropped below 100 to provide enough data for model generation 2 4 data collection and analysis for both column scales the influent daily and effluent different time points were sampled in 50 ml tubes and filtered immediately through 0 45 μm filters and analysed for drp and nh4 n within 24 h using a thermo konelab 20 analyser technical lab services ontario canada during the first 4 days of operation of the large columns the effluent was sampled after every bed volume after reaching steady state conditions defined as the point at which the effluent concentration began to stabilise sampling was increased to every 5 bed volumes for another 2 days and later on increased to every 10 bed volumes for the small columns sampling was conducted every two hours on each sampling occasion two samples were taken from each column a sample 5 ml was taken directly from the effluent marking the end of the 2 h period and compared with the influent daily concentration and a sub sample 50 ml was taken from the total filtered volume in that 2 h composite period in order to model the effluent concentrations of nutrients leaving the large and small columns the adsorption model of callery and healy 24 was used assuming that pseudo second order kinetics was occurring for both nutrients 28 29 32 4 c t c 0 a

excel file is given in the supplementary material the coefficients a b and k determined from the small column study were fitted using the levenberg marquant algorithm via solver in excel to give the least error squared errsq of difference between the predicted and the actual effluent concentrations they were then applied to predict the effluent concentration of the large columns as the concentration of nh4 effluent in the 0 2 to 0 4 m columns was zero during the early bed volumes of the experiment i e 100 retention was achieved initially data for the modelling process were taken after 12 bed volumes for all column sizes from this period onwards the retention in the columns dropped below 100 2 5 statistics to assess if there were any differences in of nutrient retention capacity based on media configuration in the large columns i e sand over zeolite or zeolite over sand a z test was conducted a p value of 0 05 rejected the null hypotheses i e no difference in terms of retention based on the configuration 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of media the final selected media for the small and large column experiments were coarse sand particle size 1 2 mm sourced from the south west of ireland with a high iron fe content and natural turkish yildizeli zeolite particle size 1 3 mm batch experiment results indicated that both the sand and zeolite had good drp and nh4 removals and had good ksat values for the column experiments table 2 the sand had a qmax of 8 34 g drp kg 1 with a binding energy k of 2 87 l mg 1 table 2 this qmax was higher than other sands commonly used in filter systems e g danish sands which have 0 02 to 0 13 g drp kg 1 33 zeolite which is an aluminosilicate mineral also had good drp retention similar to the results of other studies 34 36 zeolite used in the current study to target nh4 removal had an aluminium al content of 12 8 table 2 which is within the range of commonly used filter p materials i e 1 3 to over 40 37 according to penn et al 7 high fe and al content of a p sorption material indicates ligand exchange ion binding to a metal as the main mechanism for drp retention rather than precipitation which would occur in high calcium content materials zeolite had a qmax of 39 5 g nh4 n kg 1 with a binding energy of 9 8 l mg 1 table 2 the nh4 n retention mechanism was either molecular adsorption or ion exchange 38 various ranges of qmax for zeolite are found in the literature due to variations in country of origin and chemical element 32 e g 15 3 25 g nh4 n kg 1 39 40 41 31 9 g nh4 n kg 1 42 and 40 3 g nh4 n kg 1 36 these have resulted in 84 to complete nh4 n removal 99 depending on operational conditions such as influent concentration temperature ph and adsorbent dosage 3 2 retention of drp and nh4 n in the columns for the large columns the drp retention was initially high at 95 for the first two empty bed volumes vb of filtered solution and decreased gradually to 13 after 100 pore volumes 43 vb fig 2 one hundred percent nh4 n retention was achieved for the first 25 pore volumes but decreased to 80 after 120 pore volumes 52 vb fig 3 similar trends in nh4 n retention using zeolite were also documented by other studies 43 41 44 clinoptilolite zeolite is known to be a very good ion exchanger 32 and a high adsorption rate has been associated with diffusion of nh4 n ions 45 through macropores and mesopores to the surface of zeolite 46 the configuration of the media did not affect drp or nh4 retentions p 0 05 the use of dual media placed side by side in a filter with each designed to adsorb either p or n from different wastewater types has been previously investigated e g 47 and similar to the current study other studies have found that configuration of the media n adsorbing media before p adsorbing media or vice versa does not affect p or n removal 48 the small columns were p saturated after 1 l of filtered volume vb 50 for the 0 3 m column whereas the nh4 saturation of the columns took substantially longer to occur the 0 1 m column was 80 saturated after approximately 10 l filter volumes vb 1550 and duration of complete removal was related to the length of the column unlike many batch adsorption experiments and large scale column tests examining the nh4 removal efficiency of zeolite rsscts operated under continuous loading of a few hours per day has never been investigated however the results here are in agreement with other studies which showed a positive relationship between removal efficiency mass of adsorbent and contact time 41 3 3 predicting drp effluent concentration in large columns using scale column data regardless of media configuration the model developed using the small column data table 3 errsq 5 56 was able to predict the trend of drp effluent in the large columns fig 2 superimposes the modelled data from the small columns onto the measured data from the large columns and fig 4 presents the observed versus modelled data using coefficients from small column tests for each individual column and configuration the constant of heterogeneity b was a dominant coefficient in predicting effluent concentrations this is indicative of potentially multiple adsorption mechanisms responsible for nutrient removal which can be explained by the fact that the model is predicting combined removal efficiency of two media with different elemental compositions table 2 which are packed into one filter column according to callery and healy 24 the curve produced by eqn 4 which is based on second order kinetics can indicate the importance of intraparticle diffusion 49 for model prediction within small columns at different lengths this is shown in fig 2 where the tailing of the breakthrough curve has likely been caused by intra particle diffusion 50 this may become significant as the surface of the medium media become saturated or as ebct increases 24 3 4 predicting nh4 n effluent concentration from large columns using small columns complete nh4 n removal was observed during the initial operational period of the large and small columns which is consistent with other studies 51 53 41 consequently the small columns were operated for a longer period of time 11 d in total to generate enough data for the successful prediction of nh4 n effluent concentrations leaving the large columns eqn 4 predicted the behaviour of the filters in retaining nh4 n fig 3 and fig 5 presents observed versus modelled data using coefficients from small column tests for each individual column the constant of heterogeneity in nh4 n adsorption b was less than drp table 4 which indicates that zeolite not sand was the only medium in the columns capable of nh4 n retention as also observed in the batch experiment however the high k values indicate that the adsorption rate did not follow a linear regression with filter depth as initially proposed by filter bed depth service time bdst 54 which has been used by many adsorption studies the bdst model assumes that intraparticle diffusion is negligible 55 which becomes an important factor as a medium s surface becomes more saturated 24 50 the proposed model in this study is therefore describing a real world adsorption system in which several factors control the adsorption crini and badot 2010 meaning that larger amounts of media and increased contact time may not produce directly proportionally higher adsorption a similar lack of proportionality between the length of columns amount of adsorbent and increase in nh4 n retention has been reported by sarioğlu 56 although the experiments were carefully designed to provide similar environmental conditions for all columns there was a small difference between data generated from various large scale columns in order to avoid any bias average effluent data were used to generate model parameters 3 5 implications of study for drainage filters to date large scale columns have been mainly used to estimate nutrient saturation and longevity of media to replicate operational conditions 57 20 58 however moving from large scale columns to rsscts would gain financial and labour advantages whilst not sacrificing the accuracy of model outcomes this may include considerable savings on time required for constructing and operating the columns labour hours and number of staff required space required to house the structure and experimental set up number capacity of containers amount of influent chemical and distilled water procurement of adsorbent s media and sampling equipment e g tubes syringes filter pours number of pumps cost of laboratory analysis of water samples and overhead costs including electricity and light the results of this study validated the model showing that it could upscale rsscts accurately to describe the pattern of large scale column performance however it is important to design the experiment carefully so as the media becomes partially saturated over the duration of the experiment in the current study the modelling parameters of eqn 4 predicted the nh4 n effluent concentration in the large columns only after the retention of nh4 n in the small columns dropped to below 100 fig 6 presents a flowchart which shows steps towards the implementation of an efficient field scale engineered structure filled with adsorptive media to treat drp and nh4 n in drainage water in general a successful implementation includes characterisation of nutrient losses in the farm correct choice of medium media with a high nutrient retention capacity and which does not contribute to pollution swapping 14 characterisation of the retention capacity and therefore lifetime of the selected media and the identification of an optimal location for installation of structure 8 this would ultimately provide a sustainable and cost effective mitigation for the removal of mixed contaminants in agricultural ditches 4 conclusions in this study rapid small scale column tests were used to predict effluent drp and nh4 n concentrations from much larger columns with good accuracy as large scale laboratory filter column tests are time consuming and expensive but are considered to replicate in field conditions well the methodology used in this study will save operational financial and labour costs whilst providing good model predictions of drp and nh4 n future work should consider modelling biological n removal e g nitrate in filters containing c rich media e g woodchip where adsorption is not the dominant removal mechanism in addition research should focus on potential uses
