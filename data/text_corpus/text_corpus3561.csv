17805,the function of the microbiomes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters is dictated by the physiological activity of their members and complex interactions between them since functional traits are often conserved at low taxonomic ranks genus species strain high resolution taxonomic classification is crucial to understand the role of microbes in any ecosystem here we present midas 3 a comprehensive 16s rrna gene reference database based on full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants fl asvs derived from activated sludge and anaerobic digester systems in denmark the new database proposes unique provisional names for all unclassified microorganisms down to species level providing a new and much needed tool for microbiome research the midas 3 database was used to analyze the microbiome in 20 danish wastewater treatment plants with nutrient removal sampled over 13 years the 50 most abundant species belonged to 42 genera including 14 genera with provisional midas name of those 20 have no known function in the system which highlights the need for more efforts towards elucidating the role of important members of wastewater treatment ecosystems the new midas 3 database also forms the backbone of the midas field guide an online resource linking the identity of microorganisms in wastewater treatment systems to available data related to their functional importance the new field guide contains a complete list of genera 1800 and species 4200 found in activated sludge and anaerobic digesters in denmark but is also relevant to wastewater systems across the world the identity of the microbes is linked to functional information where available and the website provides the possibility to blast new sequences against the midas 3 database the midas field guide is a collaborative platform acting as an online knowledge repository facilitating understanding of wastewater treatment ecosystem function graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge midas species composition database taxonomy 1 introduction biological nutrient removal plants are the principal wastewater treatment systems across the urbanized world besides their primary role in removing pollutants and pathogens these systems are increasingly seen as resource recovery facilities contributing to sustainable resource management nielsen 2017 for example at plant anaerobic digestion exploits the value of sludge as a source of energy reducing plant carbon footprint and placing wastewater treatment plants wwtps on the road to achieving a circular economy complex microbial communities the microbiome define the function of biological wastewater treatment systems and understanding the role of individual microbes requires knowledge of their identity to which known and putative functions can be assigned the gold standard for identification and characterization of the diversity composition and dynamics of the microbiome is presently 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing boughner and singh 2016 a crucial step is a reliable taxonomic classification but this is strongly hampered by the lack of sufficient reference sequences in public databases for many important microbes present in wastewater treatment systems mcilroy et al 2015 in addition high taxonomic resolution is missing from the large scale public reference databases such as silva quast et al 2013 greengenes desantis et al 2006 and rdp cole et al 2014 often resulting in poor classification midas microbial database for activated sludge was established in 2015 as an ecosystem specific database for wastewater treatment systems based on the silva database which provided manually curated taxonomic assignment midas taxonomy 1 0 and associated physiological information profiles midasfieldguide org for all abundant and process critical genera in activated sludge as mcilroy et al 2015 both taxonomy and database were later updated midas 2 0 to cover abundant microorganisms found in anaerobic digesters ad and influent wastewater mcilroy et al 2017 midas 2 0 can only provide taxonomic classification down to genus level due to the resolution of the silva database and classification to higher taxonomic ranks family order is often observed because proper reference sequences are lacking this limits elucidation of the diversity in these ecosystems consequently physiological differences between the members of the same genus that coexist in activated sludge cannot be reliably linked to the individual phylotypes due to insufficient phylogenetic resolution furthermore the growing number of sequences and frequent taxonomy updates of large scale databases such as silva gl√∂ckner et al 2017 make manual curation difficult to maintain recent developments of sequencing technology and bioinformatic tools have enabled generation of millions of high quality full length 16s rrna gene reference sequences from any environmental ecosystem callahan et al 2019 karst et al 2019 2018 by obtaining full length 16s rrna gene sequences directly from environmental samples we have established a near complete reference database for high taxonomic resolution studies of the wastewater treatment ecosystem a approx one million 16s rrna gene sequences were retrieved from the wastewater treatment plants providing more than 9500 full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants fl asvs after dereplication and error correction dueholm et al 2019 moreover we created the autotax pipeline for generating a comprehensive ecosystem specific taxonomic database with de novo names for novel taxa the names are first inherited from sequences present in large scale silva taxonomy and de novo names are provided for all remaining unclassified taxa based on reproducible clustering with rank specific identity thresholds yarza et al 2014 these de novo names provide placeholder names for all novel phylotypes and act as fixed unique identifiers making the taxonomic assignment independent of the analyzed data set and enabling cross study comparisons here we present the midas 3 reference database which is based on the fl asvs previously obtained from activated sludge and anaerobic digester systems dueholm et al 2019 amended with additional sequences of potential importance in the field these sequences represent bacteria from influent wastewater potential pathogens and genome derived sequences of microbes found in wastewater treatment systems the midas 3 taxonomy is built using autotax dueholm et al 2019 and proposes unique provisional names for all microorganisms important in wastewater treatment ecosystems at species level resolution compared to midas 2 0 which was a manually curated version of silva database providing classifications down to genus level midas 3 provides a more sustainable and streamlined workflow for taxonomy assignment the database contains only high quality sequences coming from the ecosystem where the existing taxonomic classification down to species level is adapted from silva or automatically assigned using the novel autotax concept in order to automate the procedure the majority of manual curations present in midas 2 0 are not maintained in midas 3 thus a minor number of changes in taxonomic classification of the abundant microorganisms present in the ecosystem are observed upon the comparison of the two midas versions we have furthermore curated some of the species level names and here we demonstrate the resolution power of midas 3 by analyzing species level microbiome in 20 danish full scale wwtps carrying out nutrient removal with chemical phosphorus removal bnr or enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr over 13 years we provide information about diversity core communities and the most abundant species in these ecosystems although the plants investigated here are danish the results and approach are relevant for studies of biological nutrient removal wwtps worldwide as previously demonstrated for dutch and canadian wwtps dueholm et al 2019 we also present the updated midas field guide an online platform that links the midas 3 taxonomy derived identity of all microbes from wastewater treatment systems to abundance information based on our long term survey and functional information where available midas 3 alleviates important problems related to the taxonomic classification of microbes in environmental ecosystems such as missing reference sequences and low taxonomic resolution while our midas field guide acts as an online knowledge repository facilitating understanding the function of microbes present in wastewater treatment ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 midas 3 reference database and taxonomy the midas 3 reference database was built using 16s rrna gene fl asvs from 21 activated sludge wwtps and 16 ads systems and taxonomic classification was assigned as described by dueholm et al 2019 and shown in fig 1 the database was amended with 95 additional sequences from published genomes for 60 bacteria and 35 archaea that are potentially important in wastewater treatment systems but not present in the reference fl asvs obtained table s2 taxonomy was assigned to all sequences using the workflow presented in fig 1 gaps in the silva derived taxonomy were filled with a de novo taxonomy which provides midas x y placeholder names where x represents the first letter of taxonomic level for which de novo assignment was created and y is a number derived from the fl asv that forms the cluster centroid for a given taxon where applicable placeholder names were replaced with taxon names for fl asvs that represent genomes published in peer reviewed literature which were not included in the silva taxonomy additionally several manual curations of the silva derived taxonomy were made based on published literature full list of amendments is presented in table s3 2 2 activated sludge samples sampling of the activated sludge biomass from 20 danish full scale municipal wwtps was carried out within the midas project mcilroy et al 2015 the plants were sampled up to four times a year february may august and october from 2006 to 2018 with a total of 712 samples all samples were taken from the aeration tank and sent overnight to aalborg university for processing basic information about the design and operation of the wwtps as well as number of samples collected are given in table s1 wwtps included in this study comprised 16 ebpr plants 3 bnr plants and 1 plant that changed from bnr to ebpr during the survey all ebpr plants received occasional dosage of iron or aluminum salts to improve phosphorus p precipitation and enhance flocculation all wwtps had stable operation with effluent total p concentration below the required limit 1 0 mgp l with average effluent p concentration across all ebpr plants of 0 39 0 37 mgp l effluent total n and total cod concentrations were 4 59 2 44 and 27 4 12 3 respectively 2 3 amplicon sequencing and bioinformatic analysis dna extraction sample preparation including amplification of v1 3 region of 16s rrna gene using the 27f agagtttgatcctggctcag lane 1991 and 534r attaccgcggctgctgg muyzer et al 1993 primers and amplicon sequencing were conducted as described by stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the v1 3 region was chosen for activated sludge community analysis based on the studies by albertsen et al 2015 and dueholm et al 2019 showing this primer to give the most representative community structure and the highest taxonomic resolution forward reads were processed using usearch v 11 0 667 edgar 2010 raw fastq files were filtered for phix sequences using usearch filter phix trimmed to 250 bp using usearch fastx truncate trunclen 250 and quality filtered using usearch fastq filter with fastq maxee 1 0 the sequences were dereplicated using usearch fastx uniques with sizeout exact amplicon sequence variants asvs were generated using unoise3 edgar 2016 with standard settings and taxonomy was assigned using the midas 3 reference database available at https www midasfieldguide org guide downloads and the sintax classifier with a confidence threshold of 0 8 edgar 2018 2 4 data analysis and visualization r v 3 5 1 r core team 2018 rstudio rstudio team 2015 and qiime v 1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 were used for downstream data processing 712 samples with minimum 13 500 reads the cutoff value was chosen based on read histogram analysis were normalized and analyzed using ggplot2 v 3 2 1 wickham 2009 and ampvis2 v 2 4 9 andersen et al 2018a for alpha and beta diversity analysis samples were rarefied to 13 500 reads alpha diversity was calculated in ampvis2 beta diversity analysis was performed using qiime s beta diversity py script for calculating unifrac distance lozupone and knight 2005 and visualized by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using ampvis2 based on unifrac distance matrix statistically significant differences among wwtps were calculated using the anosim qiime and dunn s post hoc test with bonferroni correction dunn test v 1 3 5 dinno 2017 the core communities were defined as asv level taxa that are 1 observed in all the plants and 2 abundant belonging to top 80 of the reads in all the plants the average abundance of each asv in all samples from given plant was summed and divided by total abundance of all asvs in that plant cumulative asv read abundance was calculated for each plant and the asvs comprising top 80 reads were considered abundant asvs were grouped according to the number of plants in which they were observed as well as number of plants in which they were abundant sequencing data is available at the sequence read archive https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra under the project number prjna622675 r codes and metadata files are available at https github com martanierychlo midas3 3 results and discussion 3 1 the midas reference database provides species level classification in the creation of the midas 3 database we have applied a novel approach described in fig 1 where high throughput sequencing of high quality full length 16s rrna genes karst et al 2018 was combined with a new automatic taxonomy assignment concept autotax dueholm et al 2019 the database contains full length sequences from 21 danish wwtps carrying out nutrient removal and 16 mesophilic and thermophilic danish ads located at wastewater treatment plants the midas 3 reference database was additionally supplemented with high quality full length 16s rrna gene sequences addons of microbes with known importance in the field as well as bacteria present in the influent wastewater and pathogens table s2 midas 3 taxonomic assignment is based on the autotax framework where sequences first inherit taxonomic classification from the silva ssuref nr99 database release 132 quast et al 2013 including species names based on type strains if available the remaining unclassified sequences are assigned unique midas names down to species level thus the new release of midas 3 taxonomy proposes a provisional genus and species name for all microorganisms found in activated sludge and anaerobic digester microbiomes acting as stable identifiers and placeholder names for the sequences until the representative microorganisms are further characterized and assigned approved names additionally names derived from recently published genomes and other sources not yet incorporated in silva taxonomy were adopted in midas 3 see table s3 for full list of curated names to provide a near complete database and taxonomy for microorganisms in wastewater treatment ecosystems for a few species there were inconsistencies between the genus and type strain name assigned by silva see table s4 these issues relate to the fact that the silva taxonomy is updated based on phylogenetic analyses of the available 16s rrna gene sequences whereas type strain names have to be approved by the international taxonomy committee the possibility of including additional sequences ensures that the database can easily be updated based on the current state of the ecosystem specific field and will drive the future releases of the midas database two examples of improved taxonomy are shown in table 1 acidovorax is one of the most abundant genera in danish influent wastewater mcilroy et al 2017 with one abundant species identified using the midas 3 reference database two asvs belonging to the species midas s 2077 are classified down to genus level in all the reference databases tested except greengenes which failed to provide genus classification for both asvs or even family classification for asv17 genus ca amarolinea contains abundant filamentous bacteria in danish wwtps nierychlo et al 2019 and can be associated with serious bulking incidents andersen et al 2018b nierychlo and nielsen 2017 all three abundant species belonging to the genus lack taxonomic classification below order level in public large scale databases preventing identification and analysis of this important member of the activated sludge system the overview of the top 50 most abundant asvs in danish wwtps with their taxonomic classification based on midas 3 compared to silva is shown in fig s1 3 2 microbiome composition of danish activated sludge plants in this study we performed a 13 year survey of the microbiome in 20 danish full scale wwtps with nutrient removal that primarily treated municipal wastewater all plants had biological nitrogen removal and most also had ebpr 16 plants 3 plants had chemical p removal bnr plants while 1 changed from bnr to ebpr table s1 the survey was carried out using 16s rrna gene sequencing of the v1 3 region on the illumina miseq platform exact amplicon sequence variants asvs were generated and analyzed here instead of operational taxonomic units otus in order to avoid similarity based clustering and to reflect the true biological diversity in the samples callahan et al 2017 asvs provide consistent labels used for identification of microbes however they can only be compared across studies when generated in the same way since their numbering is dependent on the data set and processing steps midas 3 taxonomy providing species names ensures deeper resolution and robust classification that allows inter study comparisons using midas 3 taxonomy the microbiome was characterized at genus and species level for all plants based on 712 samples collected 2 to 4 times per year for each plant from 2006 to 2018 the data set consisted of 75 017 asvs that were represented by 1693 genera and 3787 species of the total asv number 49 possessed genus level classification and 30 species level classification the presence of unclassified asvs was primarily due to missing fl asv reference sequences for rare asvs or the presence of highly similar 16s rrna genes in different species of the same genus this is especially the case for medically relevant species which are often defined based on physiological traits rather than molecular phylogeny an example of the latter is the genus trichococcus where the similarity of the 16s rrna genes between species is between 99 and 100 strepis et al 2016 a blast search at the midas field guide can be used to evaluate whether high similarity of 16s rrna gene within the same genus causes lack of classification for a specific asv because several species will be hit by the asv the overall microbial diversity within samples was estimated for each plant at asv level using the simpson index of diversity and compared for all plants analyzed fig 2 the simpson index places greater weight on species evenness than the richness kim et al 2017 thus allowing the assessment of how evenly distributed relative taxa contributions are across the samples since the value of the index represents the probability that two randomly selected individuals belong to the same taxa the low values of simpson index of diversity fig 2 indicate that the microbial communities were highly diverse in all the danish plants additionally the narrow spread of the index in each plant indicates that the microbial communities across the plants were consistently stable across the years similar alpha diversity indices were observed in wwtps across the world by wu et al 2019 calculated as inverse simpson fig s2 the differences in overall activated sludge microbiome in 20 danish wwtps were assessed using the phylogeny based metric unifrac and visualized using pcoa plot fig 3 a small unifrac distance indicates similarity between the communities composed of taxa that share a common evolutionary history samples belonging to different wwtps were not completely separated from each other suggesting high similarity between the microbial communities in those wwtps this is also highlighted by the fact that the two principal coordinates only explain a small fraction of variation in the data 5 6 and 5 4 fredericia appeared to have a more distinct microbiome composition presumably due to a high fraction of industrial waste in the influent table s1 noticeable clustering of the samples coming from individual wwtps fig 3a as well as analysis of unweighed unifrac distances within and between wwtps fig 3b showed that variation between the plants was higher than within individual plants over time which suggests long term stability of the microbial communities in danish plants with nutrient removal visualization of time series data see example fig s3 confirmed the stability of microbiome in individual plants with gradual fluctuation of abundance for only a few species fredericia wwtp demonstrated the greatest range of unifrac distances indicating the microbial community was less stable than in the remaining plants ribe had the lowest unifrac distances within the plant and second highest after fredericia distances among the plants suggesting highly stable and distinct microbial community present the separation of the microbial community observed in that plant fig 3a and b most probably results from a unique composition of the nitrifying community results not shown differences in community composition were analyzed statistically using dunn s post hoc test fig 3c fredericia and ribe were the only plants with microbial community significantly different from all plants whereas the community composition in all other plants was significantly different from more than half of the remaining plants analysis of weighed unifrac distances fig s4 showed the same trend with variation between the plants higher than within individual plants however those differences were less pronounced indicating that although the total microbial community composition is different in many plants the abundant members of these communities make them more similar to each other the microbiomes in wwtps were composed of 1694 genera and 3787 species including 1191 de novo genera and 3603 de novo species possessing midas x y names a relatively small fraction of taxa comprised a large proportion of the reads thus representing the abundant taxa that are assumed to carry out the main functions in the system fig 4 a and b saunders et al 2016 the abundant taxa were defined by asvs that constitute the top 80 of reads in individual wwtps obtained by amplicon sequencing these abundant asvs belonged to 491 and 410 genera and 945 and 720 species in ebpr and bnr plants respectively fig 4a and b of the top 80 reads in ebpr plants only 2 9 had no genus level classification while 13 2 had no species level classification similar numbers were observed in bnr plants to our knowledge differences in the microbial community structure between ebpr and bnr plants have not been investigated it is generally assumed that the introduction of an anaerobic stage required for the ebpr process will select for polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao but whether other microorganisms are also affected remains unknown in this study we have compared microbiomes of those two systems however the low number of bnr plants included may underestimate the diversity observed there the overlap of taxa between the bnr and ebpr abundant top 80 of the reads communities was high fig 4c the core taxa 93 asv level taxa in ebpr plants and 149 asv level taxa in bnr plants defined here as being present and abundant in all the plants constituted 25 of the total reads in ebpr plants fig 5 and more than 35 of total reads in bnr plants fig s5 these core taxa which belonged to 65 genera and 63 species in ebpr plants see the full list of genus level core taxa in fig s6 and to 95 genera and 99 species in bnr plants constituted only a small fraction of the total number of genera 3 8 and 5 6 for ebpr and bnr plants respectively and species 1 7 and 2 6 for ebpr and bnr plants respectively present the number of genera in ebpr plants is higher than the number of species because a number of asvs possessed genus but not species level classification the number of genera in bnr plants is lower than the number of species because of a number of core asvs belonging to the same genus but different species the core communities in ebpr and bnr plants included taxa known to perform important processes in wwtp nitrifying nitrospira as well as a number of known filamentous genera ca microthrix ca sarcinithrix and ca villigracilis interestingly ammonium oxidizing nitrosomona s was found in the core community of bnr but not ebpr plants this may be due to the fact that several of the ebpr plants included had a high proportion of comammox nitrospira which is responsible for most of the nitrogen transformation with simultaneous very low abundance of nitrosomonas results not shown among known and putative pao the genera tetrasphaera and dechloromonas were present in core communities in both types of plant suggesting their versatile role in the ecosystem while ca accumulibacter was only found among core taxa in ebpr plants taxa belonging to genera nitrospira dechloromonas sulfuritalea rhodoferax and zoogloea known to be involved in nitrogen transformations in wwtps were also found to belong to the core community in wwtps worldwide wu et al 2019 both plant types contained a number of unique genus level core taxa fig s6 however those differences may result from the low number of bnr plants included in the analysis so we cannot conclude that there are major differences in the microbiome of the two process types interestingly 25 and 41 de novo genera with midas names were observed in the core communities for the ebpr and bnr plants respectively some of these novel genera may have important functions e g novel paos thus the definition of the core community helps to guide the priority list for further functional studies 3 3 species level community composition the most abundant species present in the ebpr and bnr plants are shown in fig 6 among the 10 most abundant species two belong to genera with a provisional midas g name while of the top 50 and top 100 species 14 and 39 species respectively belong to genera not possessing genus level classification in silva top 100 species are presented in fig s7 these would be impossible to identify if midas 3 was not used as the reference database demonstrating the advantage of using the ecosystem specific taxonomy a large fraction of the most abundant species is poorly described in the literature the top 50 species belong to 42 different genera of which almost 50 20 genera have no known function in wastewater treatment systems mcilroy et al 2017 2015 demonstrating the need for more studies that link identity and function a few species however match silva type strains such as faecalibacterium prausnitzii and intestinibacter bartletti so these may be applied for relevant pure culture studies of their physiology the most abundant species in both bnr and ebpr plants belong to the genus tetrasphaera which represents pao with versatile metabolism including the potential for denitrification herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 other abundant species belong to the filamentous genera ca microthrix mcilroy et al 2013 and ca villigracilis nierychlo et al 2019 the former known to cause serious bulking problems rossetti et al 2005 trichococcus may also possess filamentous morphology in activated sludge and may be implicated in bulking liu and seviour 2001 rhodoferax is a denitrifier mcilroy et al 2014 while the function in activated sludge is unknown for species in the romboutsia and rhodobacter genera the novel genus midas g 17 belonging to the family saprospiraceae is one of the most abundant bacteria in danish plants however no functional information is available midas g 17 has been incorrectly classified as ca epiflobacter in the previous versions of midas taxonomy however based on in silico analysis of the coverage of the fish probes available and mapping of the partial 16s rrna gene sequences xia et al 2008 to midas 3 database we have re assigned ca epiflobacter in midas 3 to a correct genus which is present at much lower abundance in the ecosystem see ca epiflobacter in fig s7 midas 3 provides an opportunity to reclassify sequences from previous studies for which information about distribution and or function is available for example a set of partial 16s rrna gene sequences originally classified to genus aquaspirillum thomsen et al 2007 could be reclassified as midas g 33 thomsen et al 2007 demonstrated by fish microautoradiography that these sequences belong to bacteria possessing denitrifying capability suggesting genus midas g 33 as a potential important denitrifier in the ecosystem interestingly sub genus level diversity among the asvs belonging to the top 80 of the reads was generally low in the plants with the average of 1 8 and median 1 0 abundant species in each genus however the common pao tetrasphaera and the less abundant ca accumulibacter exhibited much higher diversity with 12 and 7 abundant species respectively five most abundant species for each pao genus are shown in fig 7 tetrasphaera had one dominant species midas s 5 present in most plants while the other species appeared more randomly distributed no clear dominance of any of ca accumulibacter species could be observed as their abundance was very different across the plants two of these ca a phosphatis and ca a aalborgensis are described at species level based on the genomes available albertsen et al 2016 mart√≠n et al 2006 interestingly the genus dechloromonas which is also suggested to be a putative pao stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 only had two dominant species present in almost all plants fig 7 in general high species diversity of the paos may suggest a high degree of specialization allowing the exploitation of different niches in the activated sludge microbiome ca accumulimonas another putative pao which was described in the previous version of midas is not included in the present taxonomy version as sequences representing that genus were reclassified to the genus halomonas according to the updated silva taxonomy this study provides an insight for the first time into species level composition of the activated sludge microbiome physiological characterization is not available for the great majority of the presented species since they represent hitherto unidentified microbes only a few of them are characterized based on available genomes and pure cultures the importance of sub genus level diversity in activated sludge ecosystem is largely unknown however since functional traits are often conserved at low taxonomic ranks knowledge about identity and role of individual species in the ecosystem is of crucial importance to understanding the ecosystem function its resilience to disturbances and biological nutrient transformation routes the significance of species level microbiome composition is emphasized by recent studies of e g comammox yang et al 2020 or tetrasphaera dueholm et al 2019 where certain traits of crucial importance to the ecosystem function ability to perform full nitrification and filamentous morphology respectively are only exhibited by some members of the genus 3 4 the midas reference database provides a common language for the field only a few studies have performed surveys of the microbiome in activated sludge systems and in all cases it has only been with genus level and not species level classification saunders et al 2016 wu et al 2019 since the different studies have applied different dna extraction procedures different primers typically v1 3 or v4 and different databases for taxonomic assignment midas 2 silva rdp or greengenes it can be difficult to compare results across studies at genus level even impossible at lower taxonomic levels therefore the use of the ecosystem specific midas database provides a common language for all work in the field another key advantage of the midas 3 taxonomy is that it includes taxa abundant in similar systems across the world dueholm et al 2019 which are missing in large scale public databases by using this approach and similar protocols for extraction and primer selection albertsen et al 2015 dueholm et al 2019 it will be possible to compare the results of wwtp microbiome studies in the future because midas 3 uses the silva taxonomy as its backbone it is also possible to merge classifications obtained using midas 3 with those obtained from the corresponding silva database this ensures high taxonomic resolution for all asvs with a good match in the midas 3 database and allows if reference sequences exist in the broader silva database classifications of the remaining asvs this combined approach may be beneficial for wastewater treatment systems without nutrient removal where other genera than those included in midas 3 may dominate in the future however the midas reference database will continuously be updated with fl asvs from wastewater treatment systems from all parts of the world and we are currently working on samples from 1000 wwtps from the whole world covering all types of processes as well as wastewater and digester types 3 5 the midas reference database for anaerobic digesters many wwtps have anaerobic digestion ad reactors associated to reduce waste sludge generate energy recover nutrients and minimize the carbon footprint of the plant nielsen 2017 in order to provide a comprehensive reference database for the microbes present in the whole wastewater treatment system midas 3 also includes fl asvs from 16 full scale danish ads treating primary and waste activated sludge bacterial and archaeal microbiomes at species level and the main factors driving their assembly based on a long term survey of 46 danish ads have been presented in detail by jiang et al 2020 3 6 midas field guide online platform midasfieldguide org the new midas field guide www midasfieldguide org is a comprehensive database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems which was updated together with midas 3 release all microbes found in activated sludge and anaerobic digesters are now included in the field guide and for the first time species are listed for each genus our database now covers more than 1800 genera and 4200 species found in biological nutrient removal treatment plants and anaerobic digesters detailed abundance information is now provided both at genus and species level and functional information is described where available the midas field guide integrates the identity of the microbes with the available functional information fig 8 into a community knowledge platform in the form of a searchable database of referenced information thus acting as a central on line repository for current knowledge where all are welcome to contribute due to the rapidly growing amount of relevant literature and high number of taxa included the midas field guide is a continuous work in progress with our efforts prioritized towards the microorganisms that comprise the core microbiome as well as other abundant or process critical species new features launched in the updated midas field guide include 1 phylogenetic search by taxonomy function where all microbes found in the ecosystem are displayed in their respective taxonomic groups 2 blast search function with complete midas 3 taxonomy directly online updated protocols for dna extraction and amplicon library preparation are available online to facilitate establishment of a common framework for studies of microbial ecology of wastewater treatment systems 4 conclusions here we present the new ecosystem specific reference database midas 3 based on a comprehensive set of full length 16s rrna gene sequences derived from activated sludge and related anaerobic digester systems it proposes unique provisional names for unclassified microorganisms in wastewater treatment microbiomes midas 3 was used to perform detailed analysis of the microbiome in 20 danish wwtps with nutrient removal sampled over 13 years this enabled unprecedented resolution revealing for the first time abundant species present in the plants variation of the communities across danish plants many abundant core taxa and the diversity of species in important functional guilds exemplified by the paos we found many genera without known function emphasizing the need for more efforts towards elucidating the role of important members of wastewater treatment ecosystems we also present a new version of the midas field guide an online resource with a near complete list of genera and species found in activated sludge and anaerobic digesters through the field guide microbe identity is linked to the knowledge available of their function and a blast function allows user 16s rrna gene sequences to be blasted online against the midas 3 taxonomy the central purpose of the midas field guide is to facilitate collaborative research into wastewater treatment ecosystem functions which will support efforts towards the sustainable production of clean water and bioenergy and the development of

17805,the function of the microbiomes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters is dictated by the physiological activity of their members and complex interactions between them since functional traits are often conserved at low taxonomic ranks genus species strain high resolution taxonomic classification is crucial to understand the role of microbes in any ecosystem here we present midas 3 a comprehensive 16s rrna gene reference database based on full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants fl asvs derived from activated sludge and anaerobic digester systems in

was used to analyze the microbiome in 20 danish wastewater treatment plants with nutrient removal sampled over 13 years the 50 most abundant species belonged to 42 genera including 14 genera with provisional midas name of those 20 have no known function in the system which highlights the need for more efforts towards elucidating the role of important members of wastewater treatment ecosystems the new midas 3 database also forms the backbone of the midas field guide an online resource linking the identity of microorganisms in wastewater treatment systems to available data related to their functional importance the new field guide contains a complete list of genera 1800 and species 4200 found in activated sludge and anaerobic digesters in denmark but is also relevant to wastewater systems across the world the identity of the microbes is linked to functional information where available and the website provides the possibility to blast new sequences against the midas 3 database the midas field guide is a collaborative platform acting as an online knowledge repository facilitating understanding of wastewater treatment ecosystem function graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge midas species composition database taxonomy 1 introduction biological nutrient removal plants are the principal wastewater treatment systems across the urbanized world besides their primary role in removing pollutants and pathogens these systems are increasingly seen as resource recovery facilities contributing to sustainable resource management nielsen 2017 for example at plant anaerobic digestion exploits the value of sludge as a source of energy reducing plant carbon footprint and placing wastewater treatment plants wwtps on the road to achieving a circular economy complex microbial communities the microbiome define the function of biological wastewater treatment systems and understanding the role of individual microbes requires knowledge of their identity to which known and putative functions can be assigned the gold standard for identification and characterization of the diversity composition and dynamics of the microbiome is presently 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing boughner and singh 2016 a crucial step is a reliable taxonomic classification but this is strongly hampered by the lack of sufficient reference sequences in public databases for many important microbes present in wastewater treatment systems mcilroy et al 2015 in addition high taxonomic resolution is missing from the large scale public reference databases such as silva quast et al 2013 greengenes desantis et al 2006 and rdp cole et al 2014 often resulting in poor classification midas microbial database for activated sludge was established in 2015 as an ecosystem specific database for wastewater treatment systems based on the silva database which provided manually curated taxonomic assignment midas taxonomy 1 0 and associated physiological information profiles midasfieldguide org for all abundant and process critical genera in activated sludge as mcilroy et al 2015 both taxonomy and database were later updated midas 2 0 to cover abundant microorganisms found in anaerobic digesters ad and influent wastewater mcilroy et al 2017 midas 2 0 can only provide taxonomic classification down to genus level due to the resolution of the silva database and classification to higher taxonomic ranks family order is often observed because proper reference sequences are lacking this limits elucidation of the diversity in these ecosystems consequently physiological differences between the members of the same genus that coexist in activated sludge cannot be reliably linked to the individual phylotypes due to insufficient phylogenetic resolution furthermore the growing number of sequences and frequent taxonomy updates of large scale databases such as silva gl√∂ckner et al 2017 make manual curation difficult to maintain recent developments of sequencing technology and bioinformatic tools have enabled generation of millions of high quality full length 16s rrna gene reference sequences from any environmental ecosystem callahan et al 2019 karst et al 2019 2018 by obtaining full length 16s rrna gene sequences directly from environmental samples we have established a near complete reference database for high taxonomic resolution studies of the wastewater treatment ecosystem a approx one million 16s rrna gene sequences were retrieved from the wastewater treatment plants providing more than 9500 full length 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants fl asvs after dereplication and error correction dueholm et al 2019 moreover we created the autotax pipeline for generating a comprehensive ecosystem specific taxonomic database with de novo names for novel taxa the names are first inherited from sequences present in large scale silva taxonomy and de novo names are provided for all remaining unclassified taxa based on reproducible clustering with rank specific identity thresholds yarza et al 2014 these de novo names provide placeholder names for all novel phylotypes and act as fixed unique identifiers making the taxonomic assignment independent of the analyzed data set and enabling cross study comparisons here we present the midas 3 reference database which is based on the fl asvs previously obtained from activated sludge and anaerobic digester systems dueholm et al 2019 amended with additional sequences of potential importance in the field these sequences represent bacteria from influent wastewater potential pathogens and genome derived sequences of microbes found in wastewater treatment systems the midas 3 taxonomy is built using autotax dueholm et al 2019 and proposes unique provisional names for all microorganisms important in wastewater treatment ecosystems at species level resolution compared to midas 2 0 which was a manually curated version of silva database providing classifications down to genus level midas 3 provides a more sustainable and streamlined workflow for taxonomy assignment the database contains only high quality sequences coming from the ecosystem where the existing taxonomic classification down to species level is adapted from silva or automatically assigned using the novel autotax concept in order to automate the procedure the majority of manual curations present in midas 2 0 are not maintained in midas 3 thus a minor number of changes in taxonomic classification of the abundant microorganisms present in the ecosystem are observed upon the comparison of the two midas versions we have furthermore curated some of the species level names and here we demonstrate the resolution power of midas 3 by analyzing species level microbiome in 20 danish full scale wwtps carrying out nutrient removal with chemical phosphorus removal bnr or enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr over 13 years we provide information about diversity core communities and the most abundant species in these ecosystems although the plants investigated here are danish the results and approach are relevant for studies of biological nutrient removal wwtps worldwide as previously demonstrated for dutch and canadian wwtps dueholm et al 2019 we also present the updated midas field guide an online platform that links the midas 3 taxonomy derived identity of all microbes from wastewater treatment systems to abundance information based on our long term survey and functional information where available midas 3 alleviates important problems related to the taxonomic classification of microbes in environmental ecosystems such as missing reference sequences and low taxonomic resolution while our midas field guide acts as an online knowledge repository facilitating understanding the function of microbes present in wastewater treatment ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 midas 3 reference database and taxonomy the midas 3 reference database was built using 16s rrna gene fl asvs from 21 activated sludge wwtps and 16 ads systems and taxonomic classification was assigned as described by dueholm et al 2019 and shown in fig 1 the database was amended with 95 additional sequences from published genomes for 60 bacteria and 35 archaea that are potentially important in wastewater treatment systems but not present in the reference fl asvs obtained table s2 taxonomy was assigned to all sequences using the workflow presented in fig 1 gaps in the silva derived taxonomy were filled with a de novo taxonomy which provides midas x y placeholder names where x represents the first letter of taxonomic level for which de novo assignment was created and y is a number derived from the fl asv that forms the cluster centroid for a given taxon where applicable placeholder names were replaced with taxon names for fl asvs that represent genomes published in peer reviewed literature which were not included in the silva taxonomy additionally several manual curations of the silva derived taxonomy were made based on published literature full list of amendments is presented in table s3 2 2 activated sludge samples sampling of the activated sludge biomass from 20 danish full scale municipal wwtps was carried out within the midas project mcilroy et al 2015 the plants were sampled up to four times a year february may august and october from 2006 to 2018 with a total of 712 samples all samples were taken from the aeration tank and sent overnight to aalborg university for processing basic information about the design and operation of the wwtps as well as number of samples collected are given in table s1 wwtps included in this study comprised 16 ebpr plants 3 bnr plants and 1 plant that changed from bnr to ebpr during the survey all ebpr plants received occasional dosage of iron or aluminum salts to improve phosphorus p precipitation and enhance flocculation all wwtps had stable operation with effluent total p concentration below the required limit 1 0 mgp l with average effluent p concentration across all ebpr plants of 0 39 0 37 mgp l effluent total n and total cod concentrations were 4 59 2 44 and 27 4 12 3 respectively 2 3 amplicon sequencing and bioinformatic analysis dna extraction sample preparation including amplification of v1 3 region of 16s rrna gene using the 27f agagtttgatcctggctcag lane 1991 and 534r attaccgcggctgctgg muyzer et al 1993 primers and amplicon sequencing were conducted as described by stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the v1 3 region was chosen for activated sludge community analysis based on the studies by albertsen et al 2015 and dueholm et al 2019 showing this primer to give the most representative community structure and the highest taxonomic resolution forward reads were processed using usearch v 11 0 667 edgar 2010 raw fastq files were filtered for phix sequences using usearch filter phix trimmed to 250 bp using usearch fastx truncate trunclen 250 and quality filtered using usearch fastq filter with fastq maxee 1 0 the sequences were dereplicated using usearch fastx uniques with sizeout exact amplicon sequence variants asvs were generated using unoise3 edgar 2016 with standard settings and taxonomy was assigned using the midas 3 reference database available at https www midasfieldguide org guide downloads and the sintax classifier with a confidence threshold of 0 8 edgar 2018 2 4 data analysis and visualization r v 3 5 1 r core team 2018 rstudio rstudio team 2015 and qiime v 1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 were used for downstream data processing 712 samples with minimum 13 500 reads the cutoff value was chosen based on read histogram analysis were normalized and analyzed using ggplot2 v 3 2 1 wickham 2009 and ampvis2 v 2 4 9 andersen et al 2018a for alpha and beta diversity analysis samples were rarefied to 13 500 reads alpha diversity was calculated in ampvis2 beta diversity analysis was performed using qiime s beta diversity py script for calculating unifrac distance lozupone and knight 2005 and visualized by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using ampvis2 based on unifrac distance matrix statistically significant differences among wwtps were calculated using the anosim qiime and dunn s post hoc test with bonferroni correction dunn test v 1 3 5 dinno 2017 the core communities were defined as asv level taxa that are 1 observed in all the plants and 2 abundant belonging to top 80 of the reads in all the plants the average abundance of each asv in all samples from given plant was summed and divided by total abundance of all asvs in that plant cumulative asv read abundance was calculated for each plant and the asvs comprising top 80 reads were considered abundant asvs were grouped according to the number of plants in which they were observed as well as number of plants in which they were abundant sequencing data is available at the sequence read archive https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra under the project number prjna622675 r codes and metadata files are available at https github com martanierychlo midas3 3 results and discussion 3 1 the midas reference database provides species level classification in the creation of the midas 3 database we have applied a novel approach described in fig 1 where high throughput sequencing of high quality full length 16s rrna genes karst et al 2018 was combined with a new automatic taxonomy assignment concept autotax dueholm et al 2019 the database contains full length sequences from 21 danish wwtps carrying out nutrient removal and 16 mesophilic and thermophilic danish ads located at wastewater treatment plants the midas 3 reference database was additionally supplemented with high quality full length 16s rrna gene sequences addons of microbes with known importance in the field as well as bacteria present in the influent wastewater and pathogens table s2 midas 3 taxonomic assignment is based on the autotax framework where sequences first inherit taxonomic classification from the silva ssuref nr99 database release 132 quast et al 2013 including species names based on type strains if available the remaining unclassified sequences are assigned unique midas names down to species level thus the new release of midas 3 taxonomy proposes a provisional genus and species name for all microorganisms found in activated sludge and anaerobic digester microbiomes acting as stable identifiers and placeholder names for the sequences until the representative microorganisms are further characterized and assigned approved names additionally names derived from recently published genomes and other sources not yet incorporated in silva taxonomy were adopted in midas 3 see table s3 for full list of curated names to provide a near complete database and taxonomy for microorganisms in wastewater treatment ecosystems for a few species there were inconsistencies between the genus and type strain name assigned by silva see table s4 these issues relate to the fact that the silva taxonomy is updated based on phylogenetic analyses of the available 16s rrna gene sequences whereas type strain names have to be approved by the international taxonomy committee the possibility of including additional sequences ensures that the database can easily be updated based on the current state of the ecosystem specific field and will drive the future releases of the midas database two examples of improved taxonomy are shown in table 1 acidovorax is one of the most abundant genera in danish influent wastewater mcilroy et al 2017 with one abundant species identified using the midas 3 reference database two asvs belonging to the species midas s 2077 are classified down to genus level in all the reference databases tested except greengenes which failed to provide genus classification for both asvs or even family classification for asv17 genus ca amarolinea contains abundant filamentous bacteria in danish wwtps nierychlo et al 2019 and can be associated with serious bulking incidents andersen et al 2018b nierychlo and nielsen 2017 all three abundant species belonging to the genus lack taxonomic classification below order level in public large scale databases preventing identification and analysis of this important member of the activated sludge system the overview of the top 50 most abundant asvs in danish wwtps with their taxonomic classification based on midas 3 compared to silva is shown in fig s1 3 2 microbiome composition of danish activated sludge plants in this study we performed a 13 year survey of the microbiome in 20 danish full scale wwtps with nutrient removal that primarily treated municipal wastewater all plants had biological nitrogen removal and most also had ebpr 16 plants 3 plants had chemical p removal bnr plants while 1 changed from bnr to ebpr table s1 the survey was carried out using 16s rrna gene sequencing of the v1 3 region on the illumina miseq platform exact amplicon sequence variants asvs were generated and analyzed here instead of operational taxonomic units otus in order to avoid similarity based clustering and to reflect the true biological diversity in the samples callahan et al 2017 asvs provide consistent labels used for identification of microbes however they can only be compared across studies when generated in the same way since their numbering is dependent on the data set and processing steps midas 3 taxonomy providing species names ensures deeper resolution and robust classification that allows inter study comparisons using midas 3 taxonomy the microbiome was characterized at genus and species level for all plants based on 712 samples collected 2 to 4 times per year for each plant from 2006 to 2018 the data set consisted of 75 017 asvs that were represented by 1693 genera and 3787 species of the total asv number 49 possessed genus level classification and 30 species level classification the presence of unclassified asvs was primarily due to missing fl asv reference sequences for rare asvs or the presence of highly similar 16s rrna genes in different species of the same genus this is especially the case for medically relevant species which are often defined based on physiological traits rather than molecular phylogeny an example of the latter is the genus trichococcus where the similarity of the 16s rrna genes between species is between 99 and 100 strepis et al 2016 a blast search at the midas field guide can be used to evaluate whether high similarity of 16s rrna gene within the same genus causes lack of classification for a specific asv because several species will be hit by the asv the overall microbial diversity within samples was estimated for each plant at asv level using the simpson index of diversity and compared for all plants analyzed fig 2 the simpson index places greater weight on species evenness than the richness kim et al 2017 thus allowing the assessment of how evenly distributed relative taxa contributions are across the samples since the value of the index represents the probability that two randomly selected individuals belong to the same taxa the low values of simpson index of diversity fig 2 indicate that the microbial communities were highly diverse in all the danish plants additionally the narrow spread of the index in each plant indicates that the microbial communities across the plants were consistently stable across the years similar alpha diversity indices were observed in wwtps across the world by wu et al 2019 calculated as inverse simpson fig s2 the differences in overall activated sludge microbiome in 20 danish wwtps were assessed using the phylogeny based metric unifrac and visualized using pcoa plot fig 3 a small unifrac distance indicates similarity between the communities composed of taxa that share a common evolutionary history samples belonging to different wwtps were not completely separated from each other suggesting high similarity between the microbial communities in those wwtps this is also highlighted by the fact that the two principal coordinates only explain a small fraction of variation in the data 5 6 and 5 4 fredericia appeared to have a more distinct microbiome composition presumably due to a high fraction of industrial waste in the influent table s1 noticeable clustering of the samples coming from individual wwtps fig 3a as well as analysis of unweighed unifrac distances within and between wwtps fig 3b showed that variation between the plants was higher than within individual plants over time which suggests long term stability of the microbial communities in danish plants with nutrient removal visualization of time series data see example fig s3 confirmed the stability of microbiome in individual plants with gradual fluctuation of abundance for only a few species fredericia wwtp demonstrated the greatest range of unifrac distances indicating the microbial community was less stable than in the remaining plants ribe had the lowest unifrac distances within the plant and second highest after fredericia distances among the plants suggesting highly stable and distinct microbial community present the separation of the microbial community observed in that plant fig 3a and b most probably results from a unique composition of the nitrifying community results not shown differences in community composition were analyzed statistically using dunn s post hoc test fig 3c fredericia and ribe were the only plants with microbial community significantly different from all plants whereas the community composition in all other plants was significantly different from more than half of the remaining plants analysis of weighed unifrac distances fig s4 showed the same trend with variation between the plants higher than within individual plants however those differences were less pronounced indicating that although the total microbial community composition is different in many plants the abundant members of these communities make them more similar to each other the microbiomes in wwtps were composed of 1694 genera and 3787 species including 1191 de novo genera and 3603 de novo species possessing midas x y names a relatively small fraction of taxa comprised a large proportion of the reads thus representing the abundant taxa that are assumed to carry out the main functions in the system fig 4 a and b saunders et al 2016 the abundant taxa were defined by asvs that constitute the top 80 of reads in individual wwtps obtained by amplicon sequencing these abundant asvs belonged to 491 and 410 genera and 945 and 720 species in ebpr and bnr plants respectively fig 4a and b of the top 80 reads in ebpr plants only 2 9 had no genus level classification while 13 2 had no species level classification similar numbers were observed in bnr plants to our knowledge differences in the microbial community structure between ebpr and bnr plants have not been investigated it is generally assumed that the introduction of an anaerobic stage required for the ebpr process will select for polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao but whether other microorganisms are also affected remains unknown in this study we have compared microbiomes of those two systems however the low number of bnr plants included may underestimate the diversity observed there the overlap of taxa between the bnr and ebpr abundant top 80 of the reads communities was high fig 4c the core taxa 93 asv level taxa in ebpr plants and 149 asv level taxa in bnr plants defined here as being present and abundant in all the plants constituted 25 of the total reads in ebpr plants fig 5 and more than 35 of total reads in bnr plants fig s5 these core taxa which belonged to 65 genera and 63 species in ebpr plants see the full list of genus level core taxa in fig s6 and to 95 genera and 99 species in bnr plants constituted only a small fraction of the total number of genera 3 8 and 5 6 for ebpr and bnr plants respectively and species 1 7 and 2 6 for ebpr and bnr plants respectively present the number of genera in ebpr plants is higher than the number of species because a number of asvs possessed genus but not species level classification the number of genera in bnr plants is lower than the number of species because of a number of core asvs belonging to the same genus but different species the core communities in ebpr and bnr plants included taxa known to perform important processes in wwtp nitrifying nitrospira as well as a number of known filamentous genera ca microthrix ca sarcinithrix and ca villigracilis interestingly ammonium oxidizing nitrosomona s was found in the core community of bnr but not ebpr plants this may be due to the fact that several of the ebpr plants included had a high proportion of comammox nitrospira which is responsible for most of the nitrogen transformation with simultaneous very low abundance of nitrosomonas results not shown among known and putative pao the genera tetrasphaera and dechloromonas were present in core communities in both types of plant suggesting their versatile role in the ecosystem while ca accumulibacter was only found among core taxa in ebpr plants taxa belonging to genera nitrospira dechloromonas sulfuritalea rhodoferax and zoogloea known to be involved in nitrogen transformations in wwtps were also found to belong to the core community in wwtps worldwide wu et al 2019 both plant types contained a number of unique genus level core taxa fig s6 however those differences may result from the low number of bnr plants included in the analysis so we cannot conclude that there are major differences in the microbiome of the two process types interestingly 25 and 41 de novo genera with midas names were observed in the core communities for the ebpr and bnr plants respectively some of these novel genera may have important functions e g novel paos thus the definition of the core community helps to guide the priority list for further functional studies 3 3 species level community composition the most abundant species present in the ebpr and bnr plants are shown in fig 6 among the 10 most abundant species two belong to genera with a provisional midas g name while of the top 50 and top 100 species 14 and 39 species respectively belong to genera not possessing genus level classification in silva top 100 species are presented in fig s7 these would be impossible to identify if midas 3 was not used as the reference database demonstrating the advantage of using the ecosystem specific taxonomy a large fraction of the most abundant species is poorly described in the literature the top 50 species belong to 42 different genera of which almost 50 20 genera have no known function in wastewater treatment systems mcilroy et al 2017 2015 demonstrating the need for more studies that link identity and function a few species however match silva type strains such as faecalibacterium prausnitzii and intestinibacter bartletti so these may be applied for relevant pure culture studies of their physiology the most abundant species in both bnr and ebpr plants belong to the genus tetrasphaera which represents pao with versatile metabolism including the potential for denitrification herbst et al 2019 kristiansen et al 2013 other abundant species belong to the filamentous genera ca microthrix mcilroy et al 2013 and ca villigracilis nierychlo et al 2019 the former known to cause serious bulking problems rossetti et al 2005 trichococcus may also possess filamentous morphology in activated sludge and may be implicated in bulking liu and seviour 2001 rhodoferax is a denitrifier mcilroy et al 2014 while the function in activated sludge is unknown for species in the romboutsia and rhodobacter genera the novel genus midas g 17 belonging to the family saprospiraceae is one of the most abundant bacteria in danish plants however no functional information is available midas g 17 has been incorrectly classified as ca epiflobacter in the previous versions of midas taxonomy however based on in silico analysis of the coverage of the fish probes available and mapping of the partial 16s rrna gene sequences xia et al 2008 to midas 3 database we have re assigned ca epiflobacter in midas 3 to a correct genus which is present at much lower abundance in the ecosystem see ca epiflobacter in fig s7 midas 3 provides an opportunity to reclassify sequences from previous studies for which information about distribution and or function is available for example a set of partial 16s rrna gene sequences originally classified to genus aquaspirillum thomsen et al 2007 could be reclassified as midas g 33 thomsen et al 2007 demonstrated by fish microautoradiography that these sequences belong to bacteria possessing denitrifying capability suggesting genus midas g 33 as a potential important denitrifier in the ecosystem interestingly sub genus level diversity among the asvs belonging to the top 80 of the reads was generally low in the plants with the average of 1 8 and median 1 0 abundant species in each genus however the common pao tetrasphaera and the less abundant ca accumulibacter exhibited much higher diversity with 12 and 7 abundant species respectively five most abundant species for each pao genus are shown in fig 7 tetrasphaera had one dominant species midas s 5 present in most plants while the other species appeared more randomly distributed no clear dominance of any of ca accumulibacter species could be observed as their abundance was very different across the plants two of these ca a phosphatis and ca a aalborgensis are described at species level based on the genomes available albertsen et al 2016 mart√≠n et al 2006 interestingly the genus dechloromonas which is also suggested to be a putative pao stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 only had two dominant species present in almost all plants fig 7 in general high species diversity of the paos may suggest a high degree of specialization allowing the exploitation of different niches in the activated sludge microbiome ca accumulimonas another putative pao which was described in the previous version of midas is not included in the present taxonomy version as sequences representing that genus were reclassified to the genus halomonas according to the updated silva taxonomy this study provides an insight for the first time into species level composition of the activated sludge microbiome physiological characterization is not available for the great majority of the presented species since they represent hitherto unidentified microbes only a few of them are characterized based on available genomes and pure cultures the importance of sub genus level diversity in activated sludge ecosystem is largely unknown however since functional traits are often conserved at low taxonomic ranks knowledge about identity and role of individual species in the ecosystem is of crucial importance to understanding the ecosystem function its resilience to disturbances and biological nutrient transformation routes the significance of species level microbiome composition is emphasized by recent studies of e g comammox yang et al 2020 or tetrasphaera dueholm et al 2019 where certain traits of crucial importance to the ecosystem function ability to perform full nitrification and filamentous morphology respectively are only exhibited by some members of the genus 3 4 the midas reference database provides a common language for the field only a few studies have performed surveys of the microbiome in activated sludge systems and in all cases it has only been with genus level and not species level classification saunders et al 2016 wu et al 2019 since the different studies have applied different dna extraction procedures different primers typically v1 3 or v4 and different databases for taxonomic assignment midas 2 silva rdp or greengenes it can be difficult to compare results across studies at genus level even impossible at lower taxonomic levels therefore the use of the ecosystem specific midas database provides a common language for all work in the field another key advantage of the midas 3 taxonomy is that it includes taxa abundant in similar systems across the world dueholm et al 2019 which are missing in large scale public databases by using this approach and similar protocols for extraction and primer selection albertsen et al 2015 dueholm et al 2019 it will be possible to compare the results of wwtp microbiome studies in the future because midas 3 uses the silva taxonomy as its backbone it is also possible to merge classifications obtained using midas 3 with those obtained from the corresponding silva database this ensures high taxonomic resolution for all asvs with a good match in the midas 3 database and allows if reference sequences exist in the broader silva database classifications of the remaining asvs this combined approach may be beneficial for wastewater treatment systems without nutrient removal where other genera than those included in midas 3 may dominate in the future however the midas reference database will continuously be updated with fl asvs from wastewater treatment systems from all parts of the world and we are currently working on samples from 1000 wwtps from the whole world covering all types of processes as well as wastewater and digester types 3 5 the midas reference database for anaerobic digesters many wwtps have anaerobic digestion ad reactors associated to reduce waste sludge generate energy recover nutrients and minimize the carbon footprint of the plant nielsen 2017 in order to provide a comprehensive reference database for the microbes present in the whole wastewater treatment system midas 3 also includes fl asvs from 16 full scale danish ads treating primary and waste activated sludge bacterial and archaeal microbiomes at species level and the main factors driving their assembly based on a long term survey of 46 danish ads have been presented in detail by jiang et al 2020 3 6 midas field guide online platform midasfieldguide org the new midas field guide www midasfieldguide org is a comprehensive database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems which was updated together with midas 3 release all microbes found in activated sludge and anaerobic digesters are now included in the field guide and for the first time species are listed for each genus our database now covers more than 1800 genera and 4200 species found in biological nutrient removal treatment plants and anaerobic digesters detailed abundance information is now provided both at genus and species level and functional information is described where available the midas field guide integrates the identity of the microbes with the available functional information fig 8 into a community knowledge platform in the form of a searchable database of referenced information thus acting as a central on line repository for current knowledge where all are welcome to contribute due to the rapidly growing amount of relevant literature and high number of taxa included the midas field guide is a continuous work in progress with our efforts prioritized towards the microorganisms that comprise the core microbiome as well as other abundant or process critical species new features launched in the updated midas field guide include 1 phylogenetic search by taxonomy function where all microbes found in the ecosystem are displayed in their respective taxonomic groups 2 blast search function with complete midas 3 taxonomy directly online updated protocols for dna extraction and amplicon library preparation are available online to facilitate establishment of a common framework for studies of microbial ecology of wastewater treatment systems 4 conclusions here we present the new ecosystem specific reference database midas 3 based on a comprehensive set of full length 16s rrna gene sequences derived from activated sludge and related anaerobic digester systems it proposes unique provisional names for unclassified microorganisms in wastewater treatment microbiomes midas 3 was used to perform detailed analysis of the microbiome in 20 danish wwtps with nutrient removal sampled over 13 years this enabled unprecedented resolution revealing for the first time abundant species present in the plants variation of the communities across danish plants many abundant core taxa and the diversity of species in important functional guilds exemplified by the paos we found many genera without known function emphasizing the need for more efforts towards elucidating the role of important members of wastewater treatment ecosystems we also present a new version of the midas field guide an online resource with a near complete list of genera and species found in activated sludge and anaerobic digesters through the field guide microbe identity is linked to the knowledge available of their function and a blast function allows user 16s rrna gene sequences to be blasted online against the midas 3 taxonomy the central purpose of the midas field guide is to facilitate collaborative research into wastewater treatment ecosystem functions which will support efforts towards the sustainable production of clean water and bioenergy and the development of

17806,in recent years several studies have investigated the flux of particulate plastic through municipal waste water treatment plants wwtp challenges related to time consuming analytical methods have limited the number of sampling points and detection limits have hampered quantification of nanoplastic and microplastic fiber fluxes through wwtps by synthesizing nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers labeled with a rare metal pd and in respectively which can be measured as a proxy for the plastic itself we have circumvented major analytical pitfalls associated with micro plastic measurements in this study we spiked the labeled materials to a pilot wwtp mimicking the activated sludge process nitrification de nitrification and secondary clarification using a mass flow model for wwtp sludge we assessed the behavior of particulate plastic in relation to the removal of organic matter triplicate samples were collected from the mixed liquor and from the effluent at least twice weekly over the entire experimental run time of 40 d our findings show that in discrete grab samples during steady state conditions at least 98 of particulate plastics were associated with the biosolids a positive correlation between total suspended solids tss and plastic concentrations was observed in the sludge as well as in the effluent because of the strong association between particulate plastic and tss tss removal is likely a good indicator of plastic removal in a full scale wwtp therefore additional process steps in a full scale wwtp which further reduce the tss load will likely retain nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers effectively and consequently increase the removal rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste water microplastic nanoplastic nano analysis fate 1 introduction reports on the occurrence of particulate plastic nano and microplastic particles and fibers in the environment emerge on a weekly basis however analytical challenges and difficulties with sampling collection strategies interfere with a reliable quantification of the fluxes of particulate plastic through wastewater treatment plants wwtp horton et al 2017 rocha santos and duarte 2015 shim et al 2017 this is particularly true for nanoplastic particles due to their small size and low concentration and microplastic fibers due to contamination during sampling and analysis gigault et al 2016 schwaferts et al 2019 nevertheless a sound understanding of transport processes is key for an assessment of the environmental fate of particulate plastics kawecki and nowack 2019 kawecki et al 2018 wwtp are at the interface between technical and natural systems dris et al 2015 where potentially large quantities of particulate plastic resulting from either domestic sources e g textile washing carr 2017 hernandez et al 2017 personal care products napper et al 2015 or from mismanaged fragmented macroplastic waste and tire wear in road runoff may reach surface waters kole et al 2017 vogelsang et al 2018 wagner et al 2018 or agricultural fields from sludge application kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 keller et al 2020 zubris and richards 2005 therefore wwtp have been considered key hubs regarding the flux of particulate plastic into natural environments conley et al 2019 mason et al 2016 and the presence of particulate plastic in effluent streams has led to speculation as to whether particulate plastic may pose a threat to environmental ecosystems enfrin et al 2019 a number of studies investigating the removal of microplastics along the wwtp treatment chain have indicated that over 90 of the incoming plastics are effectively sequestered in the wastewater biomass and thus removed from the effluent stream carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017b nevertheless the concentration of microplastics downstream of wwtp have been reported to be higher than those upstream of the plants suggesting that cumulatively a measurable release of particulate plastic into receiving waters is conceivable as the majority of particulate plastic is retained in the sludge the burden of plastic pollution would shift with sewage sludge application to soil or effectively be eliminated if sludge were incinerated however assessing particulate plastic fluxes through the wwtp have so far been based on limited surveys of individual wwtp at single time points with few exceptions blair et al 2019 conley et al 2019 and for the most part have excluded microplastic fibers and have not assess nanoplastic particles at all to better understand the extent and distribution of particulate plastic in various technical and environmental compartments including wwtp more effective comparisons between various studies must be drawn chae and an 2018 for this standardization of analytical workflows and sampling protocols would greatly improve comparability and potentially achieve more accurate results for each study individually talvitie et al 2017a currently a range of approaches have been adopted though lower particle size cutoffs are often determined by the sampling setup filtration using mesh sizes between 10 and 300 Œºm is most commonly applied which can subsequently exclude smaller e g nanoplastic particle analysis extraction of microplastics from complex media degradation of organic material and chemical analysis by an array of techniques micro ft ir micro raman etc have considerably improved schwaferts et al 2019 shim et al 2017 which has allowed for more reliable quantification of microplastic concentrations in various media albeit with time consuming methods however the detection limits for commonly applied techniques that allow assessment of the particle size on a semi automated basis are in the micrometer size range which is already close to the diffraction limitation of the respective techniques although further advances in detector technologies will enable faster measurements in the future the detection of individual nanoplastic particles will not be possible with these methods currently the most pressing issues in assessing particulate plastic distribution in any media are 1 ensuring accurate sampling protocols to reliably assess the diversity of an inherently heterogeneous particulate plastic population both in terms of particle size and particle composition 2 measuring plastic particles in the sub micrometer size range and 3 capturing time resolved data for particulate plastic fluxes in various systems which will require reducing the time and labor of current analytical workflows to date the time and resource intensive nature of particulate plastic analysis has hindered researchers from performing in depth studies to understand the fate transport and biological interactions of these materials while progress is ongoing to develop analytical methods to measure particulate plastic in field studies and at the submicron scale mintenig et al 2018 researchers who study these processes in bench top or pilot scale studies can take advantage of an entirely different approach in the last years we have synthesized a variety of particulate plastics including nanoplastic particles mitrano et al 2019 and microplastic fibers schmiedgruber et al 2019 with a rare element embedded in the plastic which can be used to trace plastic by common analytical techniques for metals analysis such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in this study we calculated the flux of spiked particulate plastic through a pilot wwtp based on measurements of the metal tracer by using these pd and in doped plastics it was possible to quantify nanoplastic and microplastic fibers in a complex and heterogeneous wastewater matrix using icp ms besides circumventing the inherent difficulties of measuring nanoplastic and microplastic fibers specifically the ease and speed of the procedure allowed us to measure up to daily samples over the course of several weeks we therefore were able to 1 investigate replicate samples at each time point 2 monitor plastic concentrations at several points thereby allowing us to capture temporal fluctuations in the system and 3 follow plastic release patterns over an extended period of time and correlate them to standard properties commonly measured in wwtp such as tss content we assessed the association between particulate plastic and biosolids over time and determined to what extent nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers passed through the wwtp based on these results we extrapolated the expected performance of full scale municipal wwtp and anticipated the likely loads of particulate plastic to receiving waters using current water treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals for plastic synthesis and feed stock suspensions for all experiments deionized water from a nanopure diamond purification system thermo fisher scientific 18 2 m cm was used for nanoplastic synthesis dilutions and preparing

viscosity index of vi 158 indium iii oxide nanoparticles in2o3 were acquired from nanographi 16 68 nm 99 996 purity as reported by the manufacturer the feed suspension of microplastic fibers into the pilot wwtp was made in 0 001 surfactant fl 70 fisher scientific 2 2 nanoplastic synthesis and characterization emulsion polymerization of nanoplastic spheres containing entrapped pd were made in house and characterized following the protocol described in mitrano et al mitrano et al 2019 briefly the procedure consisted of a two step emulsion polymerization in which first the particle core was synthesized which contained the metal after which a further shell of polystyrene was grown through feeding a second monomer containing solution over time to augment the surface chemistry and morphology of the original particle for the nanoplastic core the surfactant sds and initiator were charged inside the reactor when the initial nucleation point was achieved the dissolved metal precursor and kpe were added slowly over the course of 5 min to the reaction vessel the evolution of the polymer conversion and particle size were followed through dynamic light scattering dls malvern zetasizer nano z backscatter angle 173 at 25 c and thermogravimetric analysis tga at t 120 c mettler toledo respectively after a conversion rate of approximately 90 was achieved the shell feed was directly plumbed into the reaction vessel along with an additional shot of initiator kps and water the shell feed a mixture of water styrene dvb and sds was dosed for 4 h the particle growth and extent of conversion was again closely monitored with samples collected every half hour to follow the reaction progress the nanoplastics were stored at room temperature to produce enough material for the entirety of the experiments 0 8 l of nanoplastic stock was synthesized in one large batch the solids content of the stock dispersion content was assessed by tga approximately 10 dry weight total

electrophoretic mobility was measured with the malvern zetasizer z average 187 nm polydispersity index 0 04 zeta potential derived from the electrophoretic mobility 43 mv scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images along with the operational parameters of the microscopes can be found in the supplemental information figs s1 and s2 2 3 microplastic fiber production and characterization the main steps for microplastic fiber production included compounding fiber melt spinning and cutting the endless filaments into microplastic fibers a pet compound containing indium oxide was prepared by melt extrusion in a co rotating 36 l d twin screw extruder dr collin gmbh germany in two steps first 5 wt of in2o3 was melt mixed with 95 pet followed by a second compounding with 95 pet resulting in the final in nominal concentration of approximately 0 25 wt corresponding extrusion temperature and output were 300 c and 0 9 g h respectively prior to compounding the polymer was dried at 140 c for 8 h the extruded polymer was quenched on a conveyor belt down to room temperature and subsequently pelletized fig s3 upper panel fiber melt spinning was carried out on a customized pilot melt spinning plant originally built by fourn√© polymertechnik alfter impekoven germany this pilot plant enables prototype production of fibers with a throughput of 0 1 5 kg h further details about the pilot melt spinning pant can be found elsewhere hufenus et al 2012 in this work the pilot melt spinning line was assembled with a single screw extruder with 14 mm diameter and length to diameter ratio of 25 which was used to melt and feed the polymer to a melt pump which in turn supplied the polymer melt at a fixed throughput to the spin pack fig s3 lower panel a static mixer was installed between extruder and melt pump to improve the distributive mixing and temperature uniformity of the melt stream extruder pressures needed for an effective operation of the melt pump was set to 40 bar extruder and spin pack temperatures were graduated between 270 and 300 c and nominal throughput of the gear pump was 10 5 cm3 min the draw ratio namely the ratio between the winder speed and that of the take up godet was 3 5 applying a final winding speed of 700 m min the fully drawn pet filaments proved difficult to cut in a reproducible fashion due to their flexibility and high tensile strength to aid fiber cuttability the filaments were annealed for 30 min at 200 c to increase their crystallinity and thus render them more brittle the load strain behavior of the filaments before and after annealing was assessed using the statimat me tensile tester textechno germany with 10 n load cell following astm d2256 table s1 due to the large mass of cut microplastic fibers which were needed for the experiments a device was built in house to quickly and reproducibly cut the endless filaments than cutting by hand e g with scissors or a knife or using a cryotome fig s4 briefly the microplastic fiber cutting device consisted of an assembly housing two stainless steel wheels which counter rotate when turning a crank lever this further propelled and guided fibers between the wheels as the crank was spun the wheels were equipped with teeth at an angle of 60 where the main reason for the fibers breaking was the force between the wheels the length of the resulting microplastic fibers was adjusted to approximately 500 Œºm corresponding to the length of the fibers released by textiles when laundering hernandez et al 2017 by selecting the angle of the teeth on the wheel and increasing the pressure on the filaments through tightening screws on the external housing of the device once cut the fibers were collected via a vacuum hose into a water bath to securely capture them fig s5 finally fibers were collected on a filter and allowed to air dry before being used in further experiments during processing a subsample of cut microplastic fibers was observed under a stereomicroscope olympus szx 10 to ensure complete scissions were made with the cutting device fiber length distribution and diameter were measured using an olympus dp 72 camera and the olympus cellsens software fig s6 average fiber length was 500 Œºm 12 2 Œºm and 30 Œºm in diameter the indium content of randomly selected fibers from each spool averaged 0 213 0 005 wt table s2 2 4 pilot wastewater treatment plant wwtp setup and operational procedures the pilot wwtp located at eawag was fed with municipal wastewater and simulates the activated sludge system consisting of a non aerated tank 92 l denitrification stage and aerated tank 147 l nitrification stage as well as secondary clarifier 150 l with an internal sludge recirculation a schematic layout of the activated sludge system our experimental boundaries and associated treatment facilities is given in fig 1 two months prior to spiking the pilot wwtp with particulate plastic the tanks were filled with activated sludge from a full scale wwtp ara neugut duebendorf switzerland and operated under the conditions listed in table 1 to establish the activated sludge process the activated sludge process was monitored using both automated sensors and manual performance tests for chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 no3 temperature ph and total suspended solids tss table 1 in the influent the average cod was 485 mg l 1 2 mg l and no3 was 1 4 mg l 0 2 mg l the background pd and in concentrations in the influent were both below the icp ms detection limit approximately 0 07 Œºg pd or in l the activated sludge was internally recirculated at a rate of 47 l h ratio of recirculated sludge to wastewater inflow 2 1 the wwtp was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 17 h and sludge age sa of 15 d the oxygen concentration in the nitrification reactor was kept between 2 and 3 mg l by periodically aerating the reactor the ph in both the nitrification and the denitrification reactors averaged 7 5 across the experiment with a temperature between 19 and 22 c excess sludge was withdrawn from the nitrification reactor at a rate of 17 5 l d into a thickener where it was mixed with primary sludge 50 50 after thickening the sludge mixture was pumped into an anaerobic digester the flow rate of the effluent of the secondary was between 22 and 23 l h with average values for cod 31 2 mg l 0 9 mg l no3 10 9 0 3 mg l and nh4 0 06 mg l 0 04 mg l 2 5 particulate plastic stock suspensions and feeding into the pilot wwtp three stages of particulate plastic feeding were performed including 1 a loading phase of 72 h to increase concentration of the particulate plastic in the sludge to a selected value 2 a continuous feeding phase of 598 h to maintain the particulate plastic concentration in the sludge at a constant value corresponding to a metal concentration of 150 Œºg metal l through steady addition and 3 a clearing phase of 330 h where no particulate plastic was added to investigate removal of plastic from the system the plastic particles were assumed to immediately attach to the biosolids and the wwtp was treated as a continuously stirred tank reactor as described in kaegi et al 2011 spiked particulate plastic concentrations were chosen based on the known analytical detection limits of the metal doped plastics in activated sludge from our previous work nanoplastic particles were dispersed in di h2o and remained stable for extended periods of time as assessed through bi monthly dls and icp ms measurements of the stock suspension data not shown depending on the feeding schedule loading phase or continuous phase nanoplastic concentrations of 13 78 mg plastic l and 2 5 mg plastic l equivalent to 6 89 mg pd l and 1 25 mg pd l were prepared in 5 l glass schott bottles the suspension was continuously stirred at 300 rpm using a magnetic stirrer across the experiment 24 2 g of nanoplastic equating to approximately 1 1016 particles were spiked into the pilot wwtp due to the increased surface tension and higher density of the microplastic fibers additional measures needed to be taken to ensure fibers were evenly dispersed in the stock suspension for feeding a 5 l glass schott bottle was filled with a 0 01 fl 70 surfactant solution made up in di h2o and spun with a magnetic stir bar at 300 rpm fibers were slowly added while continuously stirring with a metal spatula to disperse and separate fiber aggregates until the final desired mass loading was reached 27 mg fiber l for the loading phase and 5 04 mg fiber l for continuous feeding phase equivalent to 6 89 mg in l and 1 25 mg in l once fibers were visibly dispersed the suspension was transferred to the feeding platform of the wwtp where the magnetic spin bar was replaced with a mechanical stainless steel mixer which provided greater mixing force when continuously stirred the microplastic fibers remained evenly dispersed but would quickly settle if when stirring was interrupted in total 30 3 g pet fiber equating to approximately 2 2 107 individual microplastic fibers were fed into the pilot wwtp to feed the particulate plastic suspensions into the pilot wwtp a programmable peristaltic pump ismatec mpc z gear driven pump equipped with two double mounted pump heads masterflex easy load pps ss and 3 2 mm diameter tubing masterflex was used fig s7 additional information on pumping rates can be found in the supplementary information fig s8 although there were physical differences particle size shape polymer between the nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers the same feeding system was used for both materials the stock feeding solutions were replenished every 2 4 days see supplemental information for further assessment of the testing and reliability of the feeding protocol despite prior testing the fiber suspension still clogged in the peristaltic pump tubing over extended time periods and fewer fibers were delivered to the pilot wwtp than initially envisioned therefore after the dosing of each feed stock aliquot fibers remaining in the feeding flask were carefully collected dried and weighed to adjust the expected feeding concentration to the effective feeding concentration this effective feeding concentration was used for calculating the recovery of fibers over the course of the experiment and for the evaluation of the mass balance 2 6 sampling strategy sampling frequency was adjusted based on the phase of particulate plastic addition during the loading phase t 0 72 h samples were collected three times per day from the activated sludge nitrification tank and effluent supernatant of the secondary clarifier tank during the continuous feeding phase t 72 672 h samples were taken from the same locations approximately every 48 h at each time point triplicate samples were collected where an aliquot 10 ml was immediately digested and analyzed for the metal content and another aliquot 40 ml was stored at 20 c as a backup 2 7 assessment of total suspend solid tss in the activated sludge and effluent tss in the mixed liquor and effluent were measured weekly before initiating the spiking experiments and at each measurement point during the plastic dosing phase of the experiment after pre drying a filter paper whatman glass microfiber filter 1 5 Œºm pore diameter in an oven at 105 c for 60 min the dry weight was obtained using a laboratory balance mettler toledo ax 205 and subsequently placed into the filtration funnel of a vacuum filtration unit after wetting the filter paper 150 ml of mixed liquor or 500 ml of effluent were filtered to retain the biosolids the filter paper was placed in an oven at 105 c for 60 min allowed to cool and subsequently re weighed to assess tss 2 8 digestion protocols for sample digestions hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 sigma aldrich stored in the refrigerator at 5 c wrapped in aluminum foil nitric acid hno3 65 merck and sulfuric acid h2so4 95 98 sigma aldrich were used sample digestion was performed in a microwave system ultra clave 4 mls gmbh operated at a pressure of 120 bar and temperature of 250 c for 10 min digestion tubes and caps were made of teflon with sample volumes of 10 ml the digestion protocol was optimized to digest both particulate plastic and organic matter in the samples first 0 4 ml h2o2 was added to the sample directly in the digestion tube and allowed to stand for 30 min second 4 ml hno3 was added and again the sample was left to rest for 30 min finally 0 2 ml h2so4 was added and the samples were loaded into the microwave system after digestion the samples were quantitatively transferred to polypropylene faclon tubes with di h2o with a final volume of 50 ml 2 9 icp ms analysis elemental analysis was performed by icp ms agilent technologies qqq 8900 featuring an integrated sample introduction system isis micromist spray chamber and nickel cones a standard tune was performed on each day of icp ms analysis ionic palladium pd and indium in standard solutions 10 000 mg l and 1000 mg l respectively sigma aldrich were diluted and used for calibration solutions made fresh daily at concentration of 0 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 Œºg l an ionic rhodium standard 10 000 mg l sigma aldrich was diluted to approximately 100 Œºg l as an internal standard during all sample measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass balance model and particulate plastic concentrations assessed in the activated sludge the expected pd and in concentrations reflecting the spiked nanoplastic and microplastic fiber concentrations in the excess sludge and in the effluent were calculated by treating the wwtp as a continuously stirred reactor assuming that the plastic particles immediately attach to the biosolids as previously described by kaegi et al 2011 if the particulate plastic was removed proportionally to the sludge tss in the secondary clarifier we can argument that 1 particulate plastic is associated with the wastewater biosolids and thus is removed in the same proportion as the biosolids and or 2 that the particulate plastic does not functionally differ from other solids in the wwtp and thus similar removal of particulate plastic can be expected as other solids in the system for the mass balance calculations we assumed instantaneous uniform and complete mixing of the particulate plastic within the mixed liquor and identical particulate plastic attachment to the biosolids in the recirculated sludge the excess sludge and the effluent the time resolved mass fluxes of particulate plastic were calculated by scaling the pd and in concentrations measured in the excess sludge and in the effluent to their respective concentrations in the labeled plastic and multiplying these plastic concentrations with the volumetric flow rates of the excess sludge removal and of the effluent further details and assumptions included in the model can be found in the supplemental information by assuming a constant tss concentration in the mixed liquor excess sludge and in the effluent over time 3 g l in the mixed liquor and 5 mg l in the effluent the expected concentrations of plastic derived from the associated metal concentrations were calculated and the spiking concentrations of the particulate plastic were estimated the tss measured over the course of the experiment fluctuated both in the sludge and in the effluent fig 2 a in the model calculations we therefore adjusted the tss contents in the mixed liquor and effluent correspondingly at each phase of the experiment for both nanoplastic and microplastic fibers the measured concentrations of pd and in remained constant during the steady state feeding of the pilot wwtp fig 2 panels b and c and generally followed the predicted trends of the concentrations derived from the mass balance calculations a higher metal doped particulate plastic concentration than expected was observed in the effluent during the loading phase t 72 h 6 3 for nanoplastic particles 10 64 for microplastic fibers potentially due to limited attachment of the spiked plastic particles with the biosolids during the high pulse influx of particulate plastic into the system due to the logarithmic scale of fig 2 this effect can only be seen in the effluent and not in the mixed liquor phase however throughout the continuous feeding phase the concentration of the plastic in the effluent decreased to approximately 1 of the plastic in the mixed liquor for the remainder of the experiment in agreement with the expected proportions from the sludge model corrected for actual tss values after ceasing to add particulate plastic into the pilot wwtp at t 744 h i e the clearing phase the plastic concentration in the mixed liquor decreased although only one data point was collected during this time the high microplastic fiber concentrations in the stock suspension during the initial loading phase caused clogging and blockages in the peristaltic pump tubing during the initial loading phase disrupting delivery of microplastic fibers to the pilot wwtp the feeding system was monitored frequently several times daily and fibers were additionally spiked when needed adjustments to the fiber feeding strategy and clumping of fibers in the more concentrated stock suspension may have resulted in an uneven loading and distribution of microplastic fibers in the mixed liquor i e small entanglements of fibers in combination with the decreased delivery of microplastic fiber mass into the pilot wwtp this explains the perpetually lower in microplastic fiber concentration measured in the mixed liquor than predicted based on the model calculations fewer challenges with feeding microplastic fibers were evidenced in the continuous feeding phase when the fiber concentration in the stock suspension was six times lower compared to the fiber concentrations in the stock suspension used during the loading phase therefore it is recommended to feed a more dilute concentration of fibers at higher flow rates or to increase the time for the initial loading phase to reach comparable plastic concentrations in the mixed liquor in similar experiments in the future when the initial spiking concentration of in the model was matched to the measured concentration of in at the end of the loading phase i e adjusted to the anticipated effective dosing concentrations the measured tracer concentrations during the steady state operation of the wwtp were in line with the model predictions fig 2 at each sampling instance a low variability sludge 4 7 effluent 7 in pd nanoplastic concentrations between triplicate samples suggested that the plastic was well mixed within the activated sludge for a 10 ml sample notably in microplastic fibers concentrations showed a higher variability sludge 13 32 effluent 58 79 than nanoplastic particles when sampling equivalent volumes particularly for effluent samples this is likely due to the higher number of individual nanoplastics in the system compared to the microplastic fibers in the same sample volume given the metal concentration in the fibers and their average dimensions approximately 200 fibers per 10 ml of mixed liquor and 3 fibers per 10 ml of effluent were calculated for the continuous feeding phase particularly for the effluent samples a change in the sampling strategy to collect fibers from an increased sample volume through e g filtration may have improved the precision and thus decreased the standard deviation between these measurements diurnal and temporal variations of pollutants in wastewater flows have to be considered by assessing annual loads of pollutants of interest georgantzopoulou et al 2018 ort et al 2010 caused by the limited sample throughput of currently established analytical techniques for microplastic analyses reported removal efficiencies of microplastic particles during wastewater treatment are based on a limited amount of samples collected from a few treatment steps assessing the temporal fluctuations of microplastic in and outputs through time resolved sampling or through collecting multiple samples for triplicate analyses is thus unrealistic using currently available microplastic analyses schemes our method for particulate plastic measurement by way of measuring metals enabled us to take many samples over an extended period of time and allowed us to accurately construct a mass balance of particulate plastic over the course of the experiment based on the calculated plastic particle fluxes and in combination with the fraction of tss which is lost via the wwtp effluent allowed us to better describe the behavior of microplastics during the activated sludge treatment because the inflow of plastics into the pilot wwtp was well controlled any fluctuations observed in the plastic concentrations can be related to operational parameters of the pilot wwtp at steady state conditions continuous phase we observed only negligible fluctuations in the concentrations of our metal doped plastics and thus operational variability of the pilot wwtp was of minor importance during this phase in contrast lower than expected removal rates were found during the dynamic loading phase when the spiking concentrations were high and the system was not yet at equilibrium our results thus suggest that high pulses of plastic into the activated sludge system may result in a higher transmission of the plastic particles through the wwtp than observed during steady state conditions to date there has been little investigation as to if and to what extent plastic may degrade within the wwtp in laboratory testing conditions water sheer forces have been shown to induce nanoplastic formation from microplastic fragments enfrin et al 2020 however these principals may not be directly applicable in the context of water treatment depending on differences in the strength of sheer forces the relatively short residence time in the wwtp and the unlikelihood of chemical or biological degradation of the polystyrene and polyester studied here under our test conditions therefore in this context we hypothesize that the plastic particles which were introduced into the wwtp do not significantly change in size shape or chemistry after passing through the wwtp however we cannot completely exclude the possibility of fragmentation nevertheless even in the unlikely case of fragmentation we anticipate that these fragments would ultimately have the same fate as the larger particulate plastics which were introduced to the system that they would still largely be associated with the sludge flocs and be retained in the wwtp sludge 3 2 particulate plastic association with total suspended solids during the steady state conditions continuous feeding phase the proportions of pd and in reflecting nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers measured in the effluent correlated well with the proportion of tss loading in the effluent fig 3 as the nanoplastic particle concentration assessed in the effluent fluctuated over time a comparable trend was also observed for the tss concentration in the effluent fig 3a when comparing the mass fraction between the nanoplastic and tss in the effluent across all time points fig 3b a high pearsons coefficient r 0 94 was obtained implying that the relationship between the nanoplastic and tss is independent of time this suggests that nanoplastics are dominantly associated with the biosolids and removed during secondary clarification along with the biosolids as has been documented for other nanoscale particles dris et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 wang et al 2012 westerhoff et al 2011 generally a similar trend was observed for microplastic fibers and tss in the effluent fig 3c but the trend was not as clear as with the nanoplastics and tss pearsons correlation coefficient r 0 61 fig 3d this difference likely stems from hotspots of microplastic fibers in suspension which are not adequately assessed due to small sample sizes opposed to a decreased association between microplastic fibers and sludge flocs compared to nanoplastics thus this positive correlation between particulate plastic and tss suggests that reducing tss loads in the effluent would also result in a proportional reduction plastics being released to receiving waters 3 3 mass balance of particulate plastic through the wwtp in total 99 7 and 82 1 of nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers respectively were recovered i e measured via their respective metal content to assess mass closure over the course of the experiment fig s9 as the experiments were conducted in parallel using the same reactors temporal fluctuation of the tss cannot explain the lower recovery obtained for the microplastic fibers compared to the nanoplastic particles the poorer recovery of the microplastic fibers could have originated from a number of sources including 1 a consequence of the small sampling sizes which did not fully capture the microplastic fiber concentration at each time point and or 2 an inadequate feeding strategy which led to incomplete dispersion of fibers in the mixed liquor in the latter case the fiber entanglements could potentially be removed to a greater extent than individual fibers attached to sludge flocs since they would more likely settle in the secondary clarifier their increased size and density would mean they would have a reduced likelihood of exiting the pilot wwtp via the effluent the initial pitfalls with the microplastic fiber feeding strategy ultimately led to a decreased concentration of microplastic fibers in the wwtp than initially aimed for resulting in incomplete recovery over the course of the entire experiment we determined the flux of both plastics and biosolids through the pilot wwtp to assess retention of particulate matter in system 66 5 of the nanoplastic particles were associated with the excess sludge and 31 1 were recovered from the effluent for microplastic fibers a similar proportion was calculated in the effluent 29 4 yet only 49 3 was recovered in the activated sludge our study exclusively targeted the activated sludge process and thus lower removal efficiencies of tss as compared to full scale wwtp which also include primary clarification are conceivable for example the primary clarifier typically removes over 50 of settleable solids and thus a further fraction of particulate plastics including nanoplastic and microplastic fibers would already be removed in that stage sun et al 2019 sutton et al 2016 in comparison higher removal rates of plastic from full scale wwtp have been reported typically 90 likewise most wwtp systems would have a higher removal efficiency of tss e g through additional treatment steps such as sand filtration and tertiary filtration compared to our pilot system which is only equipped with a secondary clarifier our results support our hypothesis that particulate plastics aggregate with tss and that this aggregation and settling of plastic tss aggregates is responsible for the retention of plastics in the sludge this is why plastics of different shape size and density are effectively retained in the system we anticipate that the strong association between particulate plastic and tss would remain the same in full scale wwtp as we have seen in our pilot wwtp therefore actions which reduce the tss load of the effluent would consequently reduce particulate plastic concentrations to receiving waters 4 conclusions the influx of particulate plastic into the urban wastewater system can come from a variety of sources resulting in a poly disperse population in terms of size shape polymer and arrival time to the wwtp in full scale wwtp elevated loads of particulate plastic may result from industrial discharges e g holding basins which are released this discontinuous discharge from industrial sites would translate to temporally increased plastic loads in the influent of wwtp with possibly reduced retention rates of particulate plastic however in principal these industrial sources would not affect municipal wwtp in most locations and thus a more continuous influx of particulate plastic is anticipated under most conditions in our study a constant feed of particulate plastic was spiked over time to correlate with realistic input parameters with removal rates currently it is not possible to measure nanoplastic particles in full scale wwtp and while feasible it is lengthy and cumbersome to assess microplastic fibers fragments and films because of analytical challenges while analytical capabilities are constantly being refined and improved a robust and reliable monitoring strategy for nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers seems still far away and is unlikely to be developed in the near future however if the processes which control the removal of plastics in wwtp or engineered systems in general are understood then it will be possible to extrapolate results on the fate and behavior of plastic particles obtained from simplified model systems such as pilot wwtp to full scale systems in this study the use of our metal doped particulate plastics has enabled us to investigate the behavior of nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers during the activated sludge process a key element in modern wastewater treatment plants our finding based on the analyses of a large set of samples collected over several weeks allowed us to estimate the degree of nanoplastic particle and microplastic fiber removal in full scale wwtp a strong correlation between particulate plastics and tss was observed in this study in agreement with the results from our previous batch experiments suggesting an efficient hetero aggregation between particulate plastic and biosolids in less than half an hour mitrano et al 2019 schmiedgruber et al 2019 considering the relevant time scales of the path of particulate plastic to the wwtp e g through sewers and all treatment stages it is highly likely that in larger scale systems nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers will be largely associated with tss and a large fraction of which would already be removed by settling in a primary clarifier in a full scale wwtp given the strong correlation between particulate plastic and tss in this study and as well as the high retention rate of particulate plastic observed during wastewater treatment processes in other published literature there may be little added value in continuing to perform removal efficiency studies for municipal wwtp while investigating the flux of particulate plastic may not provide any additional information understanding the particle population in terms of number size and polymer may still be of interest however because of the high temporal fluctuations in the influent and effluent the particle population moving through the wwtp is not well characterized by current studies as most particulate plastic has been assessed to remain with the biosolids it would be most beneficial i e more efficient to characterize the plastic particles residing in the digested sludge the sludge age of the digested sludge is typically in the order of 30 days and thus temporal fluctuations in type and concentration of plastic particles in the inflow will be well balanced by focusing on sampling strategies and analysis of particulate plastic in the digested sludge this would save time opposed to sampling every stage of wastewater treatment and provide increased understanding for the material that may enter the environment in those locations where sludge is still used as an amendment to agricultural soils based on the strong correlation between particulate plastics and tss the known tss removal efficiencies and flow rates of a given full scale wwtp the plastic particle concentrations in the inflow and in the outflow of full scale wwtp may be estimated based on the concentrations observed in the sludge the strong association between particulate plastic and tss likely makes the tss removal a good and easy way to access indicator of plastic removal rates in a full scale wwtp therefore additional process steps in a full scale wwtp which further reduce the tss load will likely retain nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers effectively and consequently increase the removal rates 5 associated content additional

17806,in recent years several studies have investigated the flux of particulate plastic through municipal waste water treatment plants wwtp challenges related to time consuming analytical methods have limited the number of sampling points and detection limits have hampered quantification of nanoplastic and microplastic fiber fluxes through wwtps by synthesizing nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers labeled with a rare metal pd and in respectively which can be measured as a proxy for the plastic itself we have circumvented major analytical pitfalls associated with micro plastic measurements in this study we spiked the labeled materials to a pilot wwtp mimicking the activated sludge process nitrification de nitrification and secondary clarification using a mass flow model for wwtp sludge we assessed the behavior of particulate plastic in relation to the removal of organic matter triplicate samples were collected from the mixed liquor and from the effluent at least twice weekly over the entire experimental run time of 40 d our findings show that in discrete grab samples during steady state conditions at least 98 of particulate plastics were associated with the biosolids a positive correlation between total suspended solids tss and plastic concentrations was observed in the sludge as well as in the effluent because of the strong association between particulate plastic and tss tss removal is likely a good indicator of plastic removal in a full scale wwtp therefore additional process steps in a full scale wwtp which further reduce the tss load will likely retain nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers effectively and consequently increase the removal rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste water microplastic nanoplastic nano analysis fate 1 introduction reports on the occurrence of particulate plastic nano and microplastic particles and fibers in the environment emerge on a weekly basis however analytical challenges and difficulties with sampling collection strategies interfere with a reliable quantification of the fluxes of particulate plastic through wastewater treatment plants wwtp horton et al 2017 rocha santos and duarte 2015 shim et al 2017 this is particularly true for nanoplastic particles due to their small size and low concentration and microplastic fibers due to contamination during sampling and analysis gigault et al 2016 schwaferts et al 2019 nevertheless a sound understanding of transport processes is key for an assessment of the environmental fate of particulate plastics kawecki and nowack 2019 kawecki et al 2018 wwtp are at the interface between technical and natural systems dris et al 2015 where potentially large quantities of particulate plastic resulting from either domestic sources e g textile washing carr 2017 hernandez et al 2017 personal care products napper et al 2015 or from mismanaged fragmented macroplastic waste and tire wear in road runoff may reach surface waters kole et al 2017 vogelsang et al 2018 wagner et al 2018 or agricultural fields from sludge application kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 keller et al 2020 zubris and richards 2005 therefore wwtp have been considered key hubs regarding the flux of particulate plastic into natural environments conley et al 2019 mason et al 2016 and the presence of particulate plastic in effluent streams has led to speculation as to whether particulate plastic may pose a threat to environmental ecosystems enfrin et al 2019 a number of studies investigating the removal of microplastics along the wwtp treatment chain have indicated that over 90 of the incoming plastics are effectively sequestered in the wastewater biomass and thus removed from the effluent stream carr et al 2016 lares et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017b nevertheless the concentration of microplastics downstream of wwtp have been reported to be higher than those upstream of the plants suggesting that cumulatively a measurable release of particulate plastic into receiving waters is conceivable as the majority of particulate plastic is retained in the sludge the burden of plastic pollution would shift with sewage sludge application to soil or effectively be eliminated if sludge were incinerated however assessing particulate plastic fluxes through the wwtp have so far been based on limited surveys of individual wwtp at single time points with few exceptions blair et al 2019 conley et al 2019 and for the most part have excluded microplastic fibers and have not assess nanoplastic particles at all to better understand the extent and distribution of particulate plastic in various technical and environmental compartments including wwtp more effective comparisons between various studies must be drawn chae and an 2018 for this standardization of analytical workflows and sampling protocols would greatly improve comparability and potentially achieve more accurate results for each study individually talvitie et al 2017a currently a range of approaches have been adopted though lower particle size cutoffs are often determined by the sampling setup filtration using mesh sizes between 10 and 300 Œºm is most commonly applied which can subsequently exclude smaller e g nanoplastic particle analysis extraction of microplastics from complex media degradation of organic material and chemical analysis by an array of techniques micro ft ir micro raman etc have considerably improved schwaferts et al 2019 shim et al 2017 which has allowed for more reliable quantification of microplastic concentrations in various media albeit with time consuming methods however the detection limits for commonly applied techniques that allow assessment of the particle size on a semi automated basis are in the micrometer size range which is already close to the diffraction limitation of the respective techniques although further advances in detector technologies will enable faster measurements in the future the detection of individual nanoplastic particles will not be possible with these methods currently the most pressing issues in assessing particulate plastic distribution in any media are 1 ensuring accurate sampling protocols to reliably assess the diversity of an inherently heterogeneous particulate plastic population both in terms of particle size and particle composition 2 measuring plastic particles in the sub micrometer size range and 3 capturing time resolved data for particulate plastic fluxes in various systems which will require reducing the time and labor of current analytical workflows to date the time and resource intensive nature of particulate plastic analysis has hindered researchers from performing in depth studies to understand the fate transport and biological interactions of these materials while progress is ongoing to develop analytical methods to measure particulate plastic in field studies and at the submicron scale mintenig et al 2018 researchers who study these processes in bench top or pilot scale studies can take advantage of an entirely different approach in the last years we have synthesized a variety of particulate plastics including nanoplastic particles mitrano et al 2019 and microplastic fibers schmiedgruber et al 2019 with a rare element embedded in the plastic which can be used to trace plastic by common analytical techniques for metals analysis such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in this study we calculated the flux of spiked particulate plastic through a pilot wwtp based on measurements of the metal tracer by using these pd and in doped plastics it was possible to quantify nanoplastic and microplastic fibers in a complex and heterogeneous wastewater matrix using icp ms besides circumventing the inherent difficulties of measuring nanoplastic and microplastic fibers specifically the ease and speed of the procedure allowed us to measure up to daily samples over the course of several weeks we therefore were able to 1 investigate replicate samples at each time point 2 monitor plastic concentrations at several points thereby allowing us to capture temporal fluctuations in the system and 3 follow plastic release patterns over an extended period of time and correlate them to standard properties commonly measured in wwtp such as tss content we assessed the association between particulate plastic and biosolids over time and determined to what extent nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers passed through the wwtp based on these results we extrapolated the expected performance of full scale municipal wwtp and anticipated the likely loads of particulate plastic to receiving waters using current water treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals for plastic synthesis and feed stock suspensions for all experiments deionized water from a nanopure diamond purification system thermo fisher scientific 18 2 m cm was used for nanoplastic synthesis dilutions and preparing feed stock suspensions for the pilot wwtp chemicals used for nanoplastic synthesis included a selection of monomers acrylonitrile 99 aldrich chemistry styrene 99 sigma aldrich and dvb 60 sigma aldrich

sigma aldrich and a water soluble pd precursor k2pdcl4 99 abcr for fiber production post condensed pet in granular form was obtained from tersuisse multils sa pet 5997 with a density of 1 4 g cm3 and viscosity index of vi 158 indium iii oxide nanoparticles in2o3 were acquired from nanographi 16 68 nm 99 996 purity as reported by the manufacturer the feed suspension of microplastic fibers into the pilot wwtp was made in 0 001 surfactant fl 70 fisher scientific 2 2 nanoplastic synthesis and characterization emulsion polymerization of nanoplastic spheres containing entrapped pd were made in house and characterized following the protocol described in mitrano et al mitrano et al 2019 briefly the procedure consisted of a two step emulsion polymerization in which first the particle core was synthesized which contained the metal after which a further shell of polystyrene was grown through feeding a second monomer containing solution over time to augment the surface chemistry and morphology of the original particle for the nanoplastic core the surfactant sds and initiator were charged inside the reactor when the initial nucleation point was achieved the dissolved metal precursor and kpe were added slowly over the course of 5 min to the reaction vessel the evolution of the polymer conversion and particle size were followed through dynamic light scattering dls malvern zetasizer nano z backscatter angle 173 at 25 c and thermogravimetric analysis tga at t 120 c mettler toledo respectively after a conversion rate of approximately 90 was achieved the shell feed was directly plumbed into the reaction vessel along with an additional shot of initiator kps and water the shell feed a mixture of water styrene dvb and sds was dosed for 4 h the particle growth and extent of conversion was again closely monitored with samples collected every half hour to follow the reaction progress the nanoplastics were stored at room temperature to produce enough material for the entirety of the experiments 0 8 l of nanoplastic stock was synthesized in one large batch the solids content of the stock dispersion content was assessed by tga approximately 10 dry weight total metal content was acquired by microwave ultraclave mls gmbh leutkirch germany assisted acid digestion see details below followed by icp ms analysis 255 mg pd l and the particle size and electrophoretic mobility was measured with the malvern zetasizer z average 187 nm polydispersity index 0 04 zeta potential derived from the electrophoretic mobility 43 mv scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images along with the operational parameters of the microscopes can be found in the supplemental information figs s1 and s2 2 3 microplastic fiber production and characterization the main steps for microplastic fiber production included compounding fiber melt spinning and cutting the endless filaments into microplastic fibers a pet compound containing indium oxide was prepared by melt extrusion in a co rotating 36 l d twin screw extruder dr collin gmbh germany in two steps first 5 wt of in2o3 was melt mixed with 95 pet followed by a second compounding with 95 pet resulting in the final in nominal concentration of approximately 0 25 wt corresponding extrusion temperature and output were 300 c and 0 9 g h respectively prior to compounding the polymer was dried at 140 c for 8 h the extruded polymer was quenched on a conveyor belt down to room temperature and subsequently pelletized fig s3 upper panel fiber melt spinning was carried out on a customized pilot melt spinning plant originally built by fourn√© polymertechnik alfter impekoven germany this pilot plant enables prototype production of fibers with a throughput of 0 1 5 kg h further details about the pilot melt spinning pant can be found elsewhere hufenus et al 2012 in this work the pilot melt spinning line was assembled with a single screw extruder with 14 mm diameter and length to diameter ratio of 25 which was used to melt and feed the polymer to a melt pump which in turn supplied the polymer melt at a fixed throughput to the spin pack fig s3 lower panel a static mixer was installed between extruder and melt pump to improve the distributive mixing and temperature uniformity of the melt stream extruder pressures needed for an effective operation of the melt pump was set to 40 bar extruder and spin pack temperatures were graduated between 270 and 300 c and nominal throughput of the gear pump was 10 5 cm3 min the draw ratio namely the ratio between the winder speed and that of the take up godet was 3 5 applying a final winding speed of 700 m min the fully drawn pet filaments proved difficult to cut in a reproducible fashion due to their flexibility and high tensile strength to aid fiber cuttability the filaments were annealed for 30 min at 200 c to increase their crystallinity and thus render them more brittle the load strain behavior of the filaments before and after annealing was assessed using the statimat me tensile tester textechno germany with 10 n load cell following astm d2256 table s1 due to the large mass of cut microplastic fibers which were needed for the experiments a device was built in house to quickly and reproducibly cut the endless filaments than cutting by hand e g with scissors or a knife or using a cryotome fig s4 briefly the microplastic fiber cutting device consisted of an assembly housing two stainless steel wheels which counter rotate when turning a crank lever this further propelled and guided fibers between the wheels as the crank was spun the wheels were equipped with teeth at an angle of 60 where the main reason for the fibers breaking was the force between the wheels the length of the resulting microplastic fibers was adjusted to approximately 500 Œºm corresponding to the length of the fibers released by textiles when laundering hernandez et al 2017 by selecting the angle of the teeth on the wheel and increasing the pressure on the filaments through tightening screws on the external housing of the device once cut the fibers were collected via a vacuum hose into a water bath to securely capture them fig s5 finally fibers were collected on a filter and allowed to air dry before being used in further experiments during processing a subsample of cut microplastic fibers was observed under a stereomicroscope olympus szx 10 to ensure complete scissions were made with the cutting device fiber length distribution and diameter were measured using an olympus dp 72 camera and the olympus cellsens software fig s6 average fiber length was 500 Œºm 12 2 Œºm and 30 Œºm in diameter the indium content of randomly selected fibers from each spool averaged 0 213 0 005 wt table s2 2 4 pilot wastewater treatment plant wwtp setup and operational procedures the pilot wwtp located at eawag was fed with municipal wastewater and simulates the activated sludge system consisting of a non aerated tank 92 l denitrification stage and aerated tank 147 l nitrification stage as well as secondary clarifier 150 l with an internal sludge recirculation a schematic layout of the activated sludge system our experimental boundaries and associated treatment facilities is given in fig 1 two months prior to spiking the pilot wwtp with particulate plastic the tanks were filled with activated sludge from a full scale wwtp ara neugut duebendorf switzerland and operated under the conditions listed in table 1 to establish the activated sludge process the activated sludge process was monitored using both automated sensors and manual performance tests for chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 no3 temperature ph and total suspended solids tss table 1 in the influent the average cod was 485 mg l 1 2 mg l and no3 was 1 4 mg l 0 2 mg l the background pd and in concentrations in the influent were both below the icp ms detection limit approximately 0 07 Œºg pd or in l the activated sludge was internally recirculated at a rate of 47 l h ratio of recirculated sludge to wastewater inflow 2 1 the wwtp was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 17 h and sludge age sa of 15 d the oxygen concentration in the nitrification reactor was kept between 2 and 3 mg l by periodically aerating the reactor the ph in both the nitrification and the denitrification reactors averaged 7 5 across the experiment with a temperature between 19 and 22 c excess sludge was withdrawn from the nitrification reactor at a rate of 17 5 l d into a thickener where it was mixed with primary sludge 50 50 after thickening the sludge mixture was pumped into an anaerobic digester the flow rate of the effluent of the secondary was between 22 and 23 l h with average values for cod 31 2 mg l 0 9 mg l no3 10 9 0 3 mg l and nh4 0 06 mg l 0 04 mg l 2 5 particulate plastic stock suspensions and feeding into the pilot wwtp three stages of particulate plastic feeding were performed including 1 a loading phase of 72 h to increase concentration of the particulate plastic in the sludge to a selected value 2 a continuous feeding phase of 598 h to maintain the particulate plastic concentration in the sludge at a constant value corresponding to a metal concentration of 150 Œºg metal l through steady addition and 3 a clearing phase of 330 h where no particulate plastic was added to investigate removal of plastic from the system the plastic particles were assumed to immediately attach to the biosolids and the wwtp was treated as a continuously stirred tank reactor as described in kaegi et al 2011 spiked particulate plastic concentrations were chosen based on the known analytical detection limits of the metal doped plastics in activated sludge from our previous work nanoplastic particles were dispersed in di h2o and remained stable for extended periods of time as assessed through bi monthly dls and icp ms measurements of the stock suspension data not shown depending on the feeding schedule loading phase or continuous phase nanoplastic concentrations of 13 78 mg plastic l and 2 5 mg plastic l equivalent to 6 89 mg pd l and 1 25 mg pd l were prepared in 5 l glass schott bottles the suspension was continuously stirred at 300 rpm using a magnetic stirrer across the experiment 24 2 g of nanoplastic equating to approximately 1 1016 particles were spiked into the pilot wwtp due to the increased surface tension and higher density of the microplastic fibers additional measures needed to be taken to ensure fibers were evenly dispersed in the stock suspension for feeding a 5 l glass schott bottle was filled with a 0 01 fl 70 surfactant solution made up in di h2o and spun with a magnetic stir bar at 300 rpm fibers were slowly added while continuously stirring with a metal spatula to disperse and separate fiber aggregates until the final desired mass loading was reached 27 mg fiber l for the loading phase and 5 04 mg fiber l for continuous feeding phase equivalent to 6 89 mg in l and 1 25 mg in l once fibers were visibly dispersed the suspension was transferred to the feeding platform of the wwtp where the magnetic spin bar was replaced with a mechanical stainless steel mixer which provided greater mixing force when continuously stirred the microplastic fibers remained evenly dispersed but would quickly settle if when stirring was interrupted in total 30 3 g pet fiber equating to approximately 2 2 107 individual microplastic fibers were fed into the pilot wwtp to feed the particulate plastic suspensions into the pilot wwtp a programmable peristaltic pump ismatec mpc z gear driven pump equipped with two double mounted pump heads masterflex easy load pps ss and 3 2 mm diameter tubing masterflex was used fig s7 additional information on pumping rates can be found in the supplementary information fig s8 although there were physical differences particle size shape polymer between the nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers the same feeding system was used for both materials the stock feeding solutions were replenished every 2 4 days see supplemental information for further assessment of the testing and reliability of the feeding protocol despite prior testing the fiber suspension still clogged in the peristaltic pump tubing over extended time periods and fewer fibers were delivered to the pilot wwtp than initially envisioned therefore after the dosing of each feed stock aliquot fibers remaining in the feeding flask were carefully collected dried and weighed to adjust the expected feeding concentration to the effective feeding concentration this effective feeding concentration was used for calculating the recovery of fibers over the course of the experiment and for the evaluation of the mass balance 2 6 sampling strategy sampling frequency was adjusted based on the phase of particulate plastic addition during the loading phase t 0 72 h samples were collected three times per day from the activated sludge nitrification tank and effluent supernatant of the secondary clarifier tank during the continuous feeding phase t 72 672 h samples were taken from the same locations approximately every 48 h at each time point triplicate samples were collected where an aliquot 10 ml was immediately digested and analyzed for the metal content and another aliquot 40 ml was stored at 20 c as a backup 2 7 assessment of total suspend solid tss in the activated sludge and effluent tss in the mixed liquor and effluent were measured weekly before initiating the spiking experiments and at each measurement point during the plastic dosing phase of the experiment after pre drying a filter paper whatman glass microfiber filter 1 5 Œºm pore diameter in an oven at 105 c for 60 min the dry weight was obtained using a laboratory balance mettler toledo ax 205 and subsequently placed into the filtration funnel of a vacuum filtration unit after wetting the filter paper 150 ml of mixed liquor or 500 ml of effluent were filtered to retain the biosolids the filter paper was placed in an oven at 105 c for 60 min allowed to cool and subsequently re weighed to assess tss 2 8 digestion protocols for sample digestions hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 sigma aldrich stored in the refrigerator at 5 c wrapped in aluminum foil nitric acid hno3 65 merck and sulfuric acid h2so4 95 98 sigma aldrich were used sample digestion was performed in a microwave system ultra clave 4 mls gmbh operated at a pressure of 120 bar and temperature of 250 c for 10 min digestion tubes and caps were made of teflon with sample volumes of 10 ml the digestion protocol was optimized to digest both particulate plastic and organic matter in the samples first 0 4 ml h2o2 was added to the sample directly in the digestion tube and allowed to stand for 30 min second 4 ml hno3 was added and again the sample was left to rest for 30 min finally 0 2 ml h2so4 was added and the samples were loaded into the microwave system after digestion the samples were quantitatively transferred to polypropylene faclon tubes with di h2o with a final volume of 50 ml 2 9 icp ms analysis elemental analysis was performed by icp ms agilent technologies qqq 8900 featuring an integrated sample introduction system isis micromist spray chamber and nickel cones a standard tune was performed on each day of icp ms analysis ionic palladium pd and indium in standard solutions 10 000 mg l and 1000 mg l respectively sigma aldrich were diluted and used for calibration solutions made fresh daily at concentration of 0 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 Œºg l an ionic rhodium standard 10 000 mg l sigma aldrich was diluted to approximately 100 Œºg l as an internal standard during all sample measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass balance model and particulate plastic concentrations assessed in the activated sludge the expected pd and in concentrations reflecting the spiked nanoplastic and microplastic fiber concentrations in the excess sludge and in the effluent were calculated by treating the wwtp as a continuously stirred reactor assuming that the plastic particles immediately attach to the biosolids as previously described by kaegi et al 2011 if the particulate plastic was removed proportionally to the sludge tss in the secondary clarifier we can argument that 1 particulate plastic is associated with the wastewater biosolids and thus is removed in the same proportion as the biosolids and or 2 that the particulate plastic does not functionally differ from other solids in the wwtp and thus similar removal of particulate plastic can be expected as other solids in the system for the mass balance calculations we assumed instantaneous uniform and complete mixing of the particulate plastic within the mixed liquor and identical particulate plastic attachment to the biosolids in the recirculated sludge the excess sludge and the effluent the time resolved mass fluxes of particulate plastic were calculated by scaling the pd and in concentrations measured in the excess sludge and in the effluent to their respective concentrations in the labeled plastic and multiplying these plastic concentrations with the volumetric flow rates of the excess sludge removal and of the effluent further details and assumptions included in the model can be found in the supplemental information by assuming a constant tss concentration in the mixed liquor excess sludge and in the effluent over time 3 g l in the mixed liquor and 5 mg l in the effluent the expected concentrations of plastic derived from the associated metal concentrations were calculated and the spiking concentrations of the particulate plastic were estimated the tss measured over the course of the experiment fluctuated both in the sludge and in the effluent fig 2 a in the model calculations we therefore adjusted the tss contents in the mixed liquor and effluent correspondingly at each phase of the experiment for both nanoplastic and microplastic fibers the measured concentrations of pd and in remained constant during the steady state feeding of the pilot wwtp fig 2 panels b and c and generally followed the predicted trends of the concentrations derived from the mass balance calculations a higher metal doped particulate plastic concentration than expected was observed in the effluent during the loading phase t 72 h 6 3 for nanoplastic particles 10 64 for microplastic fibers potentially due to limited attachment of the spiked plastic particles with the biosolids during the high pulse influx of particulate plastic into the system due to the logarithmic scale of fig 2 this effect can only be seen in the effluent and not in the mixed liquor phase however throughout the continuous feeding phase the concentration of the plastic in the effluent decreased to approximately 1 of the plastic in the mixed liquor for the remainder of the experiment in agreement with the expected proportions from the sludge model corrected for actual tss values after ceasing to add particulate plastic into the pilot wwtp at t 744 h i e the clearing phase the plastic concentration in the mixed liquor decreased although only one data point was collected during this time the high microplastic fiber concentrations in the stock suspension during the initial loading phase caused clogging and blockages in the peristaltic pump tubing during the initial loading phase disrupting delivery of microplastic fibers to the pilot wwtp the feeding system was monitored frequently several times daily and fibers were additionally spiked when needed adjustments to the fiber feeding strategy and clumping of fibers in the more concentrated stock suspension may have resulted in an uneven loading and distribution of microplastic fibers in the mixed liquor i e small entanglements of fibers in combination with the decreased delivery of microplastic fiber mass into the pilot wwtp this explains the perpetually lower in microplastic fiber concentration measured in the mixed liquor than predicted based on the model calculations fewer challenges with feeding microplastic fibers were evidenced in the continuous feeding phase when the fiber concentration in the stock suspension was six times lower compared to the fiber concentrations in the stock suspension used during the loading phase therefore it is recommended to feed a more dilute concentration of fibers at higher flow rates or to increase the time for the initial loading phase to reach comparable plastic concentrations in the mixed liquor in similar experiments in the future when the initial spiking concentration of in the model was matched to the measured concentration of in at the end of the loading phase i e adjusted to the anticipated effective dosing concentrations the measured tracer concentrations during the steady state operation of the wwtp were in line with the model predictions fig 2 at each sampling instance a low variability sludge 4 7 effluent 7 in pd nanoplastic concentrations between triplicate samples suggested that the plastic was well mixed within the activated sludge for a 10 ml sample notably in microplastic fibers concentrations showed a higher variability sludge 13 32 effluent 58 79 than nanoplastic particles when sampling equivalent volumes particularly for effluent samples this is likely due to the higher number of individual nanoplastics in the system compared to the microplastic fibers in the same sample volume given the metal concentration in the fibers and their average dimensions approximately 200 fibers per 10 ml of mixed liquor and 3 fibers per 10 ml of effluent were calculated for the continuous feeding phase particularly for the effluent samples a change in the sampling strategy to collect fibers from an increased sample volume through e g filtration may have improved the precision and thus decreased the standard deviation between these measurements diurnal and temporal variations of pollutants in wastewater flows have to be considered by assessing annual loads of pollutants of interest georgantzopoulou et al 2018 ort et al 2010 caused by the limited sample throughput of currently established analytical techniques for microplastic analyses reported removal efficiencies of microplastic particles during wastewater treatment are based on a limited amount of samples collected from a few treatment steps assessing the temporal fluctuations of microplastic in and outputs through time resolved sampling or through collecting multiple samples for triplicate analyses is thus unrealistic using currently available microplastic analyses schemes our method for particulate plastic measurement by way of measuring metals enabled us to take many samples over an extended period of time and allowed us to accurately construct a mass balance of particulate plastic over the course of the experiment based on the calculated plastic particle fluxes and in combination with the fraction of tss which is lost via the wwtp effluent allowed us to better describe the behavior of microplastics during the activated sludge treatment because the inflow of plastics into the pilot wwtp was well controlled any fluctuations observed in the plastic concentrations can be related to operational parameters of the pilot wwtp at steady state conditions continuous phase we observed only negligible fluctuations in the concentrations of our metal doped plastics and thus operational variability of the pilot wwtp was of minor importance during this phase in contrast lower than expected removal rates were found during the dynamic loading phase when the spiking concentrations were high and the system was not yet at equilibrium our results thus suggest that high pulses of plastic into the activated sludge system may result in a higher transmission of the plastic particles through the wwtp than observed during steady state conditions to date there has been little investigation as to if and to what extent plastic may degrade within the wwtp in laboratory testing conditions water sheer forces have been shown to induce nanoplastic formation from microplastic fragments enfrin et al 2020 however these principals may not be directly applicable in the context of water treatment depending on differences in the strength of sheer forces the relatively short residence time in the wwtp and the unlikelihood of chemical or biological degradation of the polystyrene and polyester studied here under our test conditions therefore in this context we hypothesize that the plastic particles which were introduced into the wwtp do not significantly change in size shape or chemistry after passing through the wwtp however we cannot completely exclude the possibility of fragmentation nevertheless even in the unlikely case of fragmentation we anticipate that these fragments would ultimately have the same fate as the larger particulate plastics which were introduced to the system that they would still largely be associated with the sludge flocs and be retained in the wwtp sludge 3 2 particulate plastic association with total suspended solids during the steady state conditions continuous feeding phase the proportions of pd and in reflecting nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers measured in the effluent correlated well with the proportion of tss loading in the effluent fig 3 as the nanoplastic particle concentration assessed in the effluent fluctuated over time a comparable trend was also observed for the tss concentration in the effluent fig 3a when comparing the mass fraction between the nanoplastic and tss in the effluent across all time points fig 3b a high pearsons coefficient r 0 94 was obtained implying that the relationship between the nanoplastic and tss is independent of time this suggests that nanoplastics are dominantly associated with the biosolids and removed during secondary clarification along with the biosolids as has been documented for other nanoscale particles dris et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 wang et al 2012 westerhoff et al 2011 generally a similar trend was observed for microplastic fibers and tss in the effluent fig 3c but the trend was not as clear as with the nanoplastics and tss pearsons correlation coefficient r 0 61 fig 3d this difference likely stems from hotspots of microplastic fibers in suspension which are not adequately assessed due to small sample sizes opposed to a decreased association between microplastic fibers and sludge flocs compared to nanoplastics thus this positive correlation between particulate plastic and tss suggests that reducing tss loads in the effluent would also result in a proportional reduction plastics being released to receiving waters 3 3 mass balance of particulate plastic through the wwtp in total 99 7 and 82 1 of nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers respectively were recovered i e measured via their respective metal content to assess mass closure over the course of the experiment fig s9 as the experiments were conducted in parallel using the same reactors temporal fluctuation of the tss cannot explain the lower recovery obtained for the microplastic fibers compared to the nanoplastic particles the poorer recovery of the microplastic fibers could have originated from a number of sources including 1 a consequence of the small sampling sizes which did not fully capture the microplastic fiber concentration at each time point and or 2 an inadequate feeding strategy which led to incomplete dispersion of fibers in the mixed liquor in the latter case the fiber entanglements could potentially be removed to a greater extent than individual fibers attached to sludge flocs since they would more likely settle in the secondary clarifier their increased size and density would mean they would have a reduced likelihood of exiting the pilot wwtp via the effluent the initial pitfalls with the microplastic fiber feeding strategy ultimately led to a decreased concentration of microplastic fibers in the wwtp than initially aimed for resulting in incomplete recovery over the course of the entire experiment we determined the flux of both plastics and biosolids through the pilot wwtp to assess retention of particulate matter in system 66 5 of the nanoplastic particles were associated with the excess sludge and 31 1 were recovered from the effluent for microplastic fibers a similar proportion was calculated in the effluent 29 4 yet only 49 3 was recovered in the activated sludge our study exclusively targeted the activated sludge process and thus lower removal efficiencies of tss as compared to full scale wwtp which also include primary clarification are conceivable for example the primary clarifier typically removes over 50 of settleable solids and thus a further fraction of particulate plastics including nanoplastic and microplastic fibers would already be removed in that stage sun et al 2019 sutton et al 2016 in comparison higher removal rates of plastic from full scale wwtp have been reported typically 90 likewise most wwtp systems would have a higher removal efficiency of tss e g through additional treatment steps such as sand filtration and tertiary filtration compared to our pilot system which is only equipped with a secondary clarifier our results support our hypothesis that particulate plastics aggregate with tss and that this aggregation and settling of plastic tss aggregates is responsible for the retention of plastics in the sludge this is why plastics of different shape size and density are effectively retained in the system we anticipate that the strong association between particulate plastic and tss would remain the same in full scale wwtp as we have seen in our pilot wwtp therefore actions which reduce the tss load of the effluent would consequently reduce particulate plastic concentrations to receiving waters 4 conclusions the influx of particulate plastic into the urban wastewater system can come from a variety of sources resulting in a poly disperse population in terms of size shape polymer and arrival time to the wwtp in full scale wwtp elevated loads of particulate plastic may result from industrial discharges e g holding basins which are released this discontinuous discharge from industrial sites would translate to temporally increased plastic loads in the influent of wwtp with possibly reduced retention rates of particulate plastic however in principal these industrial sources would not affect municipal wwtp in most locations and thus a more continuous influx of particulate plastic is anticipated under most conditions in our study a constant feed of particulate plastic was spiked over time to correlate with realistic input parameters with removal rates currently it is not possible to measure nanoplastic particles in full scale wwtp and while feasible it is lengthy and cumbersome to assess microplastic fibers fragments and films because of analytical challenges while analytical capabilities are constantly being refined and improved a robust and reliable monitoring strategy for nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers seems still far away and is unlikely to be developed in the near future however if the processes which control the removal of plastics in wwtp or engineered systems in general are understood then it will be possible to extrapolate results on the fate and behavior of plastic particles obtained from simplified model systems such as pilot wwtp to full scale systems in this study the use of our metal doped particulate plastics has enabled us to investigate the behavior of nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers during the activated sludge process a key element in modern wastewater treatment plants our finding based on the analyses of a large set of samples collected over several weeks allowed us to estimate the degree of nanoplastic particle and microplastic fiber removal in full scale wwtp a strong correlation between particulate plastics and tss was observed in this study in agreement with the results from our previous batch experiments suggesting an efficient hetero aggregation between particulate plastic and biosolids in less than half an hour mitrano et al 2019 schmiedgruber et al 2019 considering the relevant time scales of the path of particulate plastic to the wwtp e g through sewers and all treatment stages it is highly likely that in larger scale systems nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers will be largely associated with tss and a large fraction of which would already be removed by settling in a primary clarifier in a full scale wwtp given the strong correlation between particulate plastic and tss in this study and as well as the high retention rate of particulate plastic observed during wastewater treatment processes in other published literature there may be little added value in continuing to perform removal efficiency studies for municipal wwtp while investigating the flux of particulate plastic may not provide any additional information understanding the particle population in terms of number size and polymer may still be of interest however because of the high temporal fluctuations in the influent and effluent the particle population moving through the wwtp is not well characterized by current studies as most particulate plastic has been assessed to remain with the biosolids it would be most beneficial i e more efficient to characterize the plastic particles residing in the digested sludge the sludge age of the digested sludge is typically in the order of 30 days and thus temporal fluctuations in type and concentration of plastic particles in the inflow will be well balanced by focusing on sampling strategies and analysis of particulate plastic in the digested sludge this would save time opposed to sampling every stage of wastewater treatment and provide increased understanding for the material that may enter the environment in those locations where sludge is still used as an amendment to agricultural soils based on the strong correlation between particulate plastics and tss the known tss removal efficiencies and flow rates of a given full scale wwtp the plastic particle concentrations in the inflow and in the outflow of full scale wwtp may be estimated based on the concentrations observed in the sludge the strong association between particulate plastic and tss likely makes the tss removal a good and easy way to access indicator of plastic removal rates in a full scale wwtp therefore additional process steps in a full scale wwtp which further reduce the tss load will likely retain nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers effectively and consequently increase the removal rates 5 associated content additional

17807,over the past decades groundwater quality has deteriorated worldwide by nitrate pollution due to the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture release of untreated urban sewage and industrial wastewater and atmospheric deposition likewise groundwater is increasingly polluted by sulfate due to the release of domestic municipal and industrial wastewaters as well as through geothermal processes seawater intrusion atmospheric deposition mineral dissolution and acid rain the urbanized and industrialized monterrey valley has a long record of elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations in groundwater with multiple potential pollution sources this study aimed to track different sources and transformation processes of nitrate and sulfate pollution in monterrey using a suite of chemical and isotopic tracers Œ¥2h h2o Œ¥18o h2o Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥34s so4 Œ¥18o so4 combined with a probability isotope mixing model soil nitrogen and sewage were found to be the most important nitrate sources while atmospheric deposition marine evaporites and sewage were the most prominent sulfate sources however the concentrations of nitrate and sulfate were controlled by denitrification and sulfate reduction processes in the transition and discharge zones the approach followed in this study is useful for establishing effective pollution management strategies in contaminated aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate sulfate groundwater stable isotopes bayesian isotope mixing model 1 introduction nitrate and sulfate comprise a major portion of ionic charge in most natural waters both ions are included in international regulations and recommendations due to their adverse effects on humans at high concentrations the world health organization who guideline value for nitrate in drinking water is 50 mg l as nitrate ion based on the absence of adverse health effects at concentrations below this value in epidemiological studies who 2017 meanwhile no adverse human health effects have been identified for sulfate however too much of this anion in drinking water may cause taste impairment and laxative effects therefore the maximum concentration of sulfate recommended by the who in drinking water is 250 mg l who 2017 groundwater pollution from nitrate is one of the most prevalent environmental problems burow et al 2010 meghdadi and javar 2018 popescu et al 2015 yang et al 2016 over the past decades groundwater quality has deteriorated worldwide due to the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture the release of untreated urban sewage and industrial wastewater and natural sources natural fertilization bacterial production atmospheric deposition ducci et al 2019 harter et al 2012 serhal et al 2009 besides adverse human effects such as methemoglobinemia thyroid effects congenital disabilities and cancer of the digestive tract excess nitrate in surface waters can also contribute to acidification eutrophication and be toxic to aquatic ecosystems camargo and alonso 2006 leslie and lyons 2018 ward et al 2018 the treatment of contaminated water and remediation of polluted sites for water supply leads to elevated costs and other undesired side effects such as the disposal of brines nontreatment strategies to address impacted water sources can sometimes provide less costly solutions through wellhead protection land use management well abandonment source modification development of alternative sources including consolidation or connection to a nearby system or blending jensen et al 2014 ruiz bevi√° and fern√°ndez torres 2019 sulfate is a typical anion in water and traditionally neglected as pollution in the groundwater wang and zhang 2019 it is discharged into the water as part of domestic wastewaters industrial wastes and wastewaters e g mining smelting steel manufacturing kraft pulp paper mills and flue gas desulphurization circuits through geothermal processes seawater intrusion and atmospheric deposition however the highest levels in groundwater usually are from natural sources such as sulfate minerals e g gypsum oxidation of sulfide minerals e g pyrite rainfall and volcanic activity fernando et al 2018 galhardi and bonotto 2016 hosono et al 2011a li et al 2015 besides several diseases after excessive uptake such as diarrhea dehydration and gastrointestinal disorders backer 2000 leslie and lyons 2018 sulfate may be transformed in the aquatic systems into toxic substances under certain conditions resulting in the death of certain fauna and flora and place some constraints on industrial municipal and residential water systems such as clogging leading to increased pumping energy reduced heat transfer efficiency and clogging of equipment further the reduction of sulfate by bacteria produces h2s gas which can be corrosive to metals and concrete man et al 2014 soucek and kennedy 2005 zuo et al 2018 according to past trends it is expected that constant increases in urbanization and seasonally intensified fertilizer applications enhance nitrate loads in groundwater similarly it is supposed that sulfate loads in groundwater increase due to not only anthropogenic sources but also due to increasing extraction of groundwater resources from deeper geological formations in water scarce areas and mining activities archana et al 2018 horst et al 2011 kinnunen et al 2018 therefore developing cost effective methods to prevent remove or reduce nitrate and sulfate from water are of considerable significance to meet the regulatory limits the concentrations of these anions are measured routinely in groundwater monitoring programs and studies however this may not be sufficient to assess existing or potential groundwater remediation options e g pump and treat phytoremediation in situ bioremediation in situ denitrification because these anions originate each from multiple sources and undergo various biogeochemical processes biddau et al 2019 king et al 2012 tools based on environmental tracers have been developed since the 1970s to identify sources of contamination and monitor their fate and natural attenuation processes for better management of water resources clark and fritz 1997 kendall 1998 the first attempts of using nitrate isotopes used Œ¥15n no3 as a single tracer flipse jr and bonner 1985 kreitler 1979 mariotti et al 1988 mariotti and l√©tolle 1977 nevertheless the use of a single isotope is not a conclusive tool for the identification of nitrate sources given that there is interference caused by processes of volatilization nitrification denitrification or oxidation generating overlaps between the ranges of identification of the different pollution sources clark and fritz 1997 kaown et al 2009 similarly the use of a single isotope is not sufficient for identification of sulfate sources thus a dual isotope approach of Œ¥15n no3 combined with Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥34s so4 combined with Œ¥18o so4 respectively improved the capability to identify sources and track transformation processes of nitrogen and sulfate in aquatic systems aravena et al 1993 bottrell et al 2008 fukada et al 2004 2003 kaown et al 2009 mattern et

this investigation aims to identify and quantify nitrate and sulfate sources in groundwater within an area with multiple potential sources using a multi tracer approach combined with a bayesian isotope mixing model to our knowledge this is the first study to apply a bayesian isotope mixing model for tracing the sources and contribution of sulfate in groundwater of a contaminated aquifer the selected area is semiarid monterrey valley located in northeastern mexico this urbanized area has a record of elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations in groundwater ianl 2007 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 past√©n zapata et al 2014 a preliminary investigation assessing major and trace hydrochemistry suggests that along the groundwater flow path there is an increasing gradient of sulfate and nitrate concentration exceeding 10 and 35 of the samples the threshold for drinking water respectively the cause of the increasing concentrations of nitrate could potentially be infiltration of polluted water from the land surface or leakage from buried urban sewage pipes in contrast industrial activities on the land surface or rock weathering processes may account for the rising sulfate concentrations along a flow path mora et al 2017 previous works refer to the use of major ions and trace elements for determining the main hydrochemical characteristics thus inferring some natural and anthropogenic pollution sources however these approaches were not conclusive for identifying anthropogenic sources therefore this study aims to identify and quantify the relative contributions of nitrate and sulfate from different sources and processes in groundwater within the monterrey area this will be achieved by 1 characterizing the hydrochemical factors that affect the nitrate and sulfate concentration in groundwater and identifying the main contributors by using multivariate statistical techniques and dual isotopic composition and 2 using an isotopic mixing model to quantify the groundwater nitrate and sulfate sources the results are useful for decision makers or water managers to better understand groundwater nitrate and sulfate pollution at the scale across which nitrate and sulfate is added to and accumulates within a watershed and its underlying aquifer system and integrate this knowledge into the development of groundwater management plans 2 materials and methods 2

test k w was applied in three different zones namely mma aquifer buenos aires wellfield and santiago system the test evaluated if there are significant differences p value 0 05 between the years 2006 2012 and 2017 table 1 the results show no significant differences in temperature ph ca mg na k no3 and hco3 for the buenos aires wellfield nevertheless cl and so4 concentrations increase two fold between 2012 and 2017 for the mma aquifer there are no significant differences in any of the parameters over time except for reduced k concentrations in 2017 the santiago system show no significant differences in any parameter the values of physicochemical and isotopic parameters of 2017 are shown in table s1 of the supplementary material samples were classified into five groups according to their statistical similarities and geographic correspondence to understand local geochemical trends fig 2 the obtained clusters were spatially defined as follow group 1 comprises samples collected from the buenos aires wellfield and la estanzuela spring group 2 represents wells located in mina wellfield group 3 4 and 5 are all located in the mma aquifer and represent samples in the recharge area transition zone and discharge area of this aquifer respectively table 2 shows the statistical summary of physicochemical parameters and isotopic ratios of each group across all five groups the average temperature varies substantially between 22 9 and 30 4 c whereas the average ph ranges over a narrow interval of near neutral values from 7 0 to 7 4 across all groups anion concentrations decreased in the order hco3 so4 cl no3 in contrast cation concentrations decreased in the order ca mg na k for groups 1 and 3 and ca na mg k for groups 2 4 and 5 the synthetic parameters hco3 so4 cl and ca mg na k were plotted against each other as a scatter plot chadha 1999 to evaluate the hydrogeochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry fig 3 a this plot suggests that groups 1 3 and 4 are recharge waters of the ca mg hco3 type and groups 2 and 5 are more chemically evolved and controlled by reverse ion exchange processes which lowered the na concentrations in pore waters even more to produce waters of the ca mg cl type in the cases of reverse ion exchange na in the solution is exchanged for ca on the clay surfaces inverse ion exchange is common where solutes with high na concentrations mix with freshwater such as in coastal areas with saline intrusion mahlknecht et al 2017 tamez mel√©ndez et al 2016 in such settings seawater na replaces continental ca and sr in the aquifer clay surfaces in this study na concentration increments are possibly due to sewage infiltration since group 5 represents waters in the urbanized discharge area possibly promoting inverse exchange processes thivya et al 2014 samples from group 2 exhibit an increased na content from the weathering of silicate minerals in the mina wellfield the positive correlation between tds and no3 cl hco3 fig 3b confirms that water chemistry is heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities jalali 2009 xiao et al 2017 geothermal waters can carry high cl concentrations however there is no evidence of geothermal waters in the study area using this reasoning group 5 is the most impacted by excess cl and no3 likely coming from vertical infiltration through the urban landscape 3 2 correlation between hydrochemical parameters and pollution sources as indicated by the shapiro wilks test a logarithmic transformation was applied to normalize all variables except for mg Œ¥18o h2o Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥18o so4 five principal components were identified using pca in which the first three explain 65 8 of the total variance the loadings of the varimax rotated components are shown in table 3 the kmo

component pc1 explains 33 59 of the total variance and broadly describes water rock interaction processes namely the dissolution of carbonates and evaporites being responsible for most of the salinity in groundwater of the study area nitrate and sulfate concentrations as well as nitrate isotope ratios are also correlated with this component a similar trend was observed in a neighbor aquifer past√©n zapata et al 2014 ledesma et al 2015 where nitrate was found to be originated mostly from sewage leakage and application of manure however in this study area the application of manure is not a common practice the second component pc2 explains 16 20 of the variance and relates water isotopes with 34s so4 isotope it is remarkable that ca na and cl are also positive but less significantly related with this component thus this component could indicate the different origins of groundwater at different altitudes providing distinct signatures the third component pc3 represents 15 55 of the variance and describes the long term water rock interaction process evidenced by a strong relationship between f and temperature chae et al 2007 morales arredondo et al 2018 singaraja et al 2018 as well as a notable inverse relationship between 18o no3 18o so4 and dissolved oxygen suggesting denitrification processes and sulfate reduction li et al 2019 this component appears to be related to processes that mitigate nitrate and sulfate contamination the fourth component pc4 contributes 13 64 to the variance and is related mainly to the mobility of b br and i in groundwater these elements are positively correlated with no3 concentration which likely indicates anthropogenic contamination from industrialized and urban areas the fifth component pc5 depicts a minor proportion of variance 7 03 and relates the alkali metal k with redox condition orp this component is possibly related to mobilization of k through grass degradation and leaching processes since other sources such as the dissolution of k silicate minerals or evaporites would not have a relevant influence in the redox potential unfortunately commonly measured redox sensitive elements beyond do no3 and so4 which could provide further insight into this component e g nh4 fe ii fe iii mn ii h2s were not measured mcmahon and chapelle 2008 an examination of the pca confirms that most groundwater processes can be ascribed to the dissolution of carbonates and evaporites this is evidenced by the strong correlation of ca mg hco3 so4 cl and salinity tds these water rock interactions are accompanied by nitrate pollution derived from urbanization nitrate concentrations in the study area are likely generated from organic processes in soils leakage of sewage lines and wastewater treatment plants drainage from barnyards septic tanks and cesspools leaching from the use of inorganic and organic fertilizers and landfills regarding sulfate concentrations there is strong evidence that marine evaporites generate part of the pollution however other man made sources can be inferred due to its high correlation with nitrate it is remarkable that denitrification and sulfate reduction processes are suggested by pca 3 3 isotopic composition of water the values of Œ¥18o h2o and Œ¥2h h2o for groundwater in the study area ranged from 9 5 to 5 4 and from 63 9 to 36 0 respectively fig 4 a the samples plot between the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 and the local meteoric water line for the sierra madre oriental lmwl aguilar ram√≠rez et al 2017 which indicates a meteoric origin of groundwater as expected the most depleted most negative Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values occur in the buenos aires wellfield which is at a higher altitude compared to the other two wellfields samples from mina wellfield cluster narrowly in the central part of the graph in contrast samples from mma aquifer have a large variation and are the most enriched least negative in particular samples from group 5 wells in the valley floor within northeastern monterrey represent the most enriched samples reflecting the lowest topographic elevation in the study area with the exception of groups 2 and 3 a slight evaporation trend is observed the deuterium excess d excess may be useful for identifying the contributions of evaporation and or mineral dissolution to groundwater mineralization the d excess is estimated as d 2h 8 18o assuming for precipitation an average of 10 dansgaard 1964 the relationship between d excess and ec huang and pang 2012 shown in fig 4b shows that almost all samples are higher than 10 and consistent with a mineral dissolution trend this validates that evaporation is present however the influence of evapoconcentration is relatively insignificant 4 discussion 4 1 identification of possible pollution sources via halides halides br cl and i are of conservative nature with minimum interactions with the subsoil thus these elements are useful for the identification of potential pollution sources panno et al 2006 past√©n zapata et al 2014 results of this study indicate that group 1 could be considered as recently infiltrated water derived from rainfall e g dissolution of gaseous co2 with minimal impacts from water rock interactions fig 5 a and b likewise group 3 is considered recharge water in pristine conditions with certain trends of water rock interactions evaporite dissolution such as halite and mineralization of soil organic matter with nitrate as an end product group 2 appears to be affected by sewage from untreated wastewater and or septic tanks and landfills in mina municipality it is notable that the no3 to cl is relatively low fig 5c group 4 and 5 falls close to or in the range of water affected by human sewage and leaching of landfills and dumps which is in agreement with their location in the metropolitan area fig 5 4 2 nitrate sources and attenuation processes typical nitrogen transformations nitrification or denitrification occur primarily in shallow aquifers nitrification is the oxidation of nh4 to no3 and is mediated by bacteria that derive metabolic energy kendall 1998 denitrification is a reduction of no3 to n2 n2o or no which generally occurs under anaerobic environments brandes and devol 1997 koba et al 1997 in this study Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values varied from 2 0 to 14 8 and from 0 3 to 9 9 respectively different sources of nitrate were identified for the water samples of the study area using the dual isotopic approach fig 6 a the isotopic signatures of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 of sampled water combined with the different potential no3 sources illustrate that soil organic n and manure sewage sources were the two main nitrate sources samples from groups 1 2 and 3 were within the compositional field of soil organic n the origin of no3 for these samples could be related to natural soil sources which is congruent with their location in recharge areas with limited anthropogenic impact shrubland dispersed housings samples from group 2 mina well field exhibit a denitrification process identified by a ratio trend between the range from 1 1 3 to 1 2 1 aravena and robertson 1998 minet et al 2012 resulting in an enrichment of the isotopic composition of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 this may explain the reduced no3 vs cl ratio for group 2 in fig 5c on the other hand samples from groups 4 and 5 fell into the compositional field of manure sewage which is consistent with the land use of their location mostly urbanized and partly agricultural land use towards northeast these two groups also evidence a denitrification process the eh values of the sample waters range from 279 to 443 mv while dissolved oxygen content varies from 3 2 to 8 1 mg l this suggests oxic conditions for most of the studied wells which would favor nitrification processes the Œ¥18o no3 produced during the nitrification of nh4 is described as two thirds of oxygen from soil water and one third from atmospheric oxygen andersson and hooper 1983 as expressed in the following eq 6 Œ¥18o no3 2 3 Œ¥18o h2o 1 3 Œ¥18o o2 where Œ¥18o h2o represents the range of observed ratios 9 5 to 5 4 and Œ¥18o o2 the theoretical atmospheric o2 23 5 xue et al 2009 the solid gray area in fig 6b represents theoretical values of Œ¥18o no3 formed from microbial nitrification confirming this process in most samples except for group 2 where all of the isotopic signatures of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 were larger than theoretically expected confirming nitrate attenuation processes denitrification rivett et al 2008 4 3 pollution sources and attenuation processes of sulfate the Œ¥34s so4 and Œ¥18o so4 signatures of samples from the study area show compositional ranges from 1 03 to 12 16 and from 5 79 to 12 12 respectively four sources can be related to so4 2 according to fig 7 a atmospheric deposition from so2 emissions the influence of soil derived so4 sewage and marine evaporites samples from groups 1 3 and 4 plot almost all within the range of atmospheric deposition while samples from group 5 lie between atmospheric deposition and sewage for most samples of group 2 it was not possible to identify the source of sulfate due to an overlapping of source fields i e marine deposits sewage and sulfate reduction processes identified by the typical ratio trends between 1 4 and 1 2 5 mizutani and rafter 1973 fig 7a this process is described by the following equation eq 7 so4 2ch2o h2s 2hco3 furthermore in all samples Œ¥34s so4 decreases with increasing so4 cl ratio except for group 1 fig 7b suggesting that isotopically light so4 was removed and the residual so4 became enriched in 34s and 18o during sulfate reduction in groups 2 3 4 and 5 pittalis et al 2018 for group 1 an inverse trend is observed with smaller initial sulfate isotope values and larger so4 cl ratios than the rest this can be related to an initial so4 pool which is in agreement with the limestone gypsum geology of the buenos aires wellfield and a subsequent mixture with sulfate from atmospheric deposition guo et al 2015 mora et al 2017 the dual isotope diagram of Œ¥15n no3 vs Œ¥34s so4 further constrains the variety of sources are responsible for each of these contaminants even within the same aquifer fig 8 it confirms that the main sources of pollution in the sites close to recharge areas groups 1 2 and 3 are atmospheric deposition and mineralization of soil organic matter in contrast an additional source the infiltration of sewage leaks was identified for samples located in the urban area group 4 and 5 this is generally congruent with the findings for nitrate in the previous section 4 4 apportionment of nitrate and sulfate using a bayesian isotope mixing model a bayesian mixing model mixsiar was developed to estimate the proportional contributions of nitrate from the three identified potential sources atmospheric deposition ad soil organic nitrogen son and manure and sewage m s similarly a mixing model was developed to estimate the contributions of sulfate from the four identified potential sources atmospheric deposition ad soil sulfate ss manure and sewage m s and marine evaporites me the mean and standard deviation of the isotopic composition used in the mixsiar for the different pollution sources was estimated from a local end member and literature table s2 of supplementary material and is shown in table 4 the results reveal that the nitrate source contribution in the study area generally followed son m s ad with mean and standard deviation values of 60 6 12 4 37 8 12 5 and 1 6 1 2 respectively as illustrated in fig 9 a c specifically groups 1 2 and 3 showed similar patterns with the highest shares derived from son with 96 8 4 2 68 4 15 9 and 78 4 11 3 respectively in contrast for groups 4 and 5 the dominant nitrate source was m s 54 5 18 6 and 84 5 12 5 respectively atmospheric deposition contributed little nitrate to the groundwater this agrees with studies performed in other areas li et al 2019 matiatos 2016 xue et al 2012 yue et al 2017 these results are generally consistent with the qualitative analysis of the dual isotopic approach fig 6a sulfate source contribution generally followed m s ad me ss with mean and standard deviation values of 40 6 18 24 9 10 18 4 5 5 and 16 1 11 9 respectively the main sulfate source was m s for group 1 38 9 29 8 group 3 43 4 22 6 group 4 57 0 22 7 and 5 41 1 21 6 while for group 2 it was marine evaporites 38 7 11 7 fig 9b and c this mixing model exercise helped to discern the contribution of distinct sulfate sources whose isotopic compositional ranges show overlaps in fig 7a the summary of the results employing this multi tracer approach combined with the bayesian isotope mixing model is shown in table s3 of supplementary material in general results obtained from the isotope mixing model using the bayesian approach were consistent with interpretations based on the hydrochemical and isotopic data although one limitation of this approach is that the isotopic ranges of sources were derived from literature data further investigations to constrain the isotopic and chemical composition of local end members is necessary to reduce the variance and uncertainty of the results 4 5 recommendations for reducing nitrate and sulfate pollution and future research based on the results of this study soil organic nitrogen and sewage were the most critical nitrate and sulfate sources in groundwater while there exist natural denitrification processes in the study area these are locally limited the rapid economic and industrial growth of monterrey during the last 100 years resulted in reduced or lost ecological processes of the urban mosaic specifically the urban santa catarina river and its tributaries have been degraded and are extremely flashy today exhibiting very rapid increase in flow following storms the increase in imperviousness changes to the hydrological flow path and the increase of sources of nitrate in the urban landscape have all contributed to a decrease in water quality the biogeochemical implications of the engineered changes are that riparian zones with their expected high levels of denitrification due to their vegetation composition microbial populations soil conditions and hydrological regimes are faulty because they are altered and disconnected from urban streams followed by a transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions reducing the potential of denitrification designs that re establish ecological processes restauration can create hotspots of denitrification where the stream riparian interface has been modified to facilitate interaction of stream water with the riparian zone infrastructure can be added which serves as nitrate sink as in the case of detention basins or removed as in the case of daylighting buried urban streams or modified as in the case of bioretention ponds and level spreaders to better mimic natural structures and ecological processes the introduction of green roofs or permeable surfaces to enhance water infiltration farther upslope in the hydrological flow paths are other strategies which increase the capacity of mitigation of nitrate cadenasso 2008 monterrey has an outstanding status in latin america regarding access to drinking water and sanitation the population enjoys universal access to water distribution and sewerage this means that practically all generated water and wastewater is treated in treatment facilities the sewage system has been built starting in the early 1900s and expanded over time it operates as a combined system simultaneously collecting surface runoff and sewage water in a shared system hence the existence of reaches of old pipes and tunnels combined with limited preventive maintenance over prolonged periods and overflows during the rainy seasons have contributed to groundwater pollution olds et al 2018 selvakumar et al 2004 especially considering that the groundwater table of mma is located only about 7 20 m below ground level in this sense it is recommended that the water and sanitation utility pays special attention to the oldest parts of the city sewage system which coincide geographically with shallow unconfined aquifer conditions sample groups 3 and 4 in this areas exfiltration of the sewage from damaged reaches is a common problem and needs rehabilitation measures these rehabilitation projects will take many years to complete on the other hand the discharge zone of mma is strongly industrialized group 5 according to the mexican law industries are forced to comply with environmental standards when discharging the generated wastewater into water bodies thus it is imminent to monitor industrial discharges in terms of water quality and avoid illegal dumping to the environment furthermore a revision of the sanitation plan is required which includes among other measures the promotion of decentralized approaches in peri urban and rural areas for example mina group 2 and buenos aires group 1 are appropriate candidates for this kind of solutions they may maintain low nitrate and sulfate concentrations by reducing the infiltration of untreated wastewater from septic tanks and cesspools to the shallow aquifer and preserve the actual situation of water quality clemens et al 2020 oakley et al 2010 finally it is essential to create a long term groundwater monitoring network of nitrate and sulfate in the entire aquifer system to control the evolution of the contamination in time and space future research efforts should be developed towards evaluating seasonal changes of pollution and the use of microorganisms and micropollutants as co tracers for a more robust conceptualization of contamination paths and evaluation of mitigation measures in a complex groundwater system 5 conclusions a multi tracer study using chemical and isotopic fingerprints in combination with a probability mixing model was conducted to understand the origin and source contribution of nitrate and sulfate pollution in groundwater of the urbanized valley of monterrey nitrate pollution was mainly derived from sewage leaks in the urban area 37 8 in contrast soil organic nitrogen was responsible for nitrate concentration in the recharge areas 81 2 similarly sulfate pollution in the city was caused by sewage infiltration 45 1 in the groundwater and atmospheric deposition 24 9 as result of anthropogenic emissions in recharge areas sulfates are the result of the interaction between water and marine evaporites 38 7 the hydrochemical data suggests that groundwater of the study area is dominated by a ca mg hco3 water type in the topographically elevated non urbanized areas buenos aires and a ca mg cl water type in transition and discharge areas of monterrey metropolitan area and mina northwest of monterrey the latter chemistry type and locations suggest mixing between recharge waters and sewage leaks and possibly inverse cation exchange processes stable water isotopes suggest that water in the study area has a meteoric origin with some evaporation effects in the transition areas however evapoconcentration is insignificant compared to mineral dissolution the multivariate analysis confirms that carbonate and evaporite dissolution drives groundwater mineralization the evaluation of halide concentrations revealed that samples close to recharge areas in buenos aires indicate recently recharged meteoric water un impacted by anthropogenic contaminants these waters represent recent infiltrated water that has experienced some water rock interactions such as carbonate and halite dissolution and mineralization of soil organic matter with nitrate as an end product along the flow path these groundwaters mix with sewage leakages and leach from landfills these processes are likely operating within the mina wellfield as well as the transition and discharge zone of mma aquifer the dual isotope approach confirms that natural contamination by mineralization of soil organic nitrogen and anthropogenic contamination by sewage leakages and leaching from landfills are the main nitrate sources in addition it suggests the presence of denitrification processes in the mina area and the discharge zone of mma aquifer northeast of the monterrey area on the other hand sulfate contamination originated naturally by the dissolution of marine evaporites such as gypsum especially in the buenos aires area and from anthropogenically contaminated from atmospheric deposition from emissions and leakages from sewage in the urbanized area probability mixing models using the bayesian method confirm that leakage derived from sewage is not the only important pollution source of no3 and so4 proving that natural sources nitrogen and sulfate derived from the soil play also impact groundwater chemistry moreover mixing with different pollution sources could be identified for the urbanized area however future investigations should perform a detailed characterization of the isotopic composition ranges of the different local sources to reduce the uncertainty of the probability mixing results the rapid economic and industrial growth of monterrey resulted in reduced and lost ecological processes in the urban mosaic and a limited maintenance of sewage system restauration efforts can create natural structures and infrastructure which serve as nitrate and sulfate sink the continuous rehabilitation of the sewage system in the older urban landscape may reduce exfiltrations to the underlying close groundwater table decentralized on site treatment systems may be promoted in periurban and rural areas as a cost effective solution to prevent pollution in distant areas a long term monitoring network serves to control the pollution and to evaluate mitigation measures this methodology is an effective tool that can be successfully applied in catchments for a qualitative and

17807,over the past decades groundwater quality has deteriorated worldwide by nitrate pollution due to the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture release of untreated urban sewage and industrial wastewater and atmospheric deposition likewise groundwater is increasingly polluted by sulfate due to the release of domestic municipal and industrial wastewaters as well as through geothermal processes seawater intrusion atmospheric deposition mineral dissolution and acid rain the urbanized and industrialized monterrey valley has a long record of elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations in groundwater with multiple potential pollution sources this study aimed to track different sources and transformation processes of nitrate and sulfate pollution in monterrey using a suite of chemical and isotopic tracers Œ¥2h h2o Œ¥18o h2o Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥34s so4 Œ¥18o so4 combined with a probability isotope mixing model soil nitrogen and sewage were found to be the most important nitrate sources while atmospheric deposition marine evaporites and sewage were the most prominent sulfate sources however the concentrations of nitrate and sulfate were controlled by denitrification and sulfate reduction processes in the transition and discharge zones the approach followed in this study is useful for establishing effective pollution management strategies in contaminated aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate sulfate groundwater stable isotopes bayesian isotope mixing model 1 introduction nitrate and sulfate comprise a major portion of ionic charge in most natural waters both ions are included in international regulations and recommendations due to their adverse effects on humans at high concentrations the world health organization who guideline value for nitrate in drinking water is 50 mg l as nitrate ion based on the absence of adverse health effects at concentrations below this value in epidemiological studies who 2017 meanwhile no adverse human health effects have been identified for sulfate however too much of this anion in drinking water may cause taste impairment and laxative effects therefore the maximum concentration of sulfate recommended by the who in drinking water is 250 mg l who 2017 groundwater pollution from nitrate is one of the most prevalent environmental problems burow et al 2010 meghdadi and javar 2018 popescu et al 2015 yang et al 2016 over the past decades groundwater quality has deteriorated worldwide due to the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture the release of untreated urban sewage and industrial wastewater and natural sources natural fertilization bacterial production atmospheric deposition ducci et al 2019 harter et al 2012 serhal et al 2009 besides adverse human effects such as methemoglobinemia thyroid effects congenital disabilities and cancer of the digestive tract excess nitrate in surface waters can also contribute to acidification eutrophication and be toxic to aquatic ecosystems camargo and alonso 2006 leslie and lyons 2018 ward et al 2018 the treatment of contaminated water and remediation of polluted sites for water supply leads to elevated costs and other undesired side effects such as the disposal of brines nontreatment strategies to address impacted water sources can sometimes provide less costly solutions through wellhead protection land use management well abandonment source modification development of alternative sources including consolidation or connection to a nearby system or blending jensen et al 2014 ruiz bevi√° and fern√°ndez torres 2019 sulfate is a typical anion in water and traditionally neglected as pollution in the groundwater wang and zhang 2019 it is discharged into the water as part of domestic wastewaters industrial wastes and wastewaters e g mining smelting steel manufacturing kraft pulp paper mills and flue gas desulphurization circuits through geothermal processes seawater intrusion and atmospheric deposition however the highest levels in groundwater usually are from natural sources such as sulfate minerals e g gypsum oxidation of sulfide minerals e g pyrite rainfall and volcanic activity fernando et al 2018 galhardi and bonotto 2016 hosono et al 2011a li et al 2015 besides several diseases after excessive uptake such as diarrhea dehydration and gastrointestinal disorders backer 2000 leslie and lyons 2018 sulfate may be transformed in the aquatic systems into toxic substances under certain conditions resulting in the death of certain fauna and flora and place some constraints on industrial municipal and residential water systems such as clogging leading to increased pumping energy reduced heat transfer efficiency and clogging of equipment further the reduction of sulfate by bacteria produces h2s gas which can be corrosive to metals and concrete man et al 2014 soucek and kennedy 2005 zuo et al 2018 according to past trends it is expected that constant increases in urbanization and seasonally intensified fertilizer applications enhance nitrate loads in groundwater similarly it is supposed that sulfate loads in groundwater increase due to not only anthropogenic sources but also due to increasing extraction of groundwater resources from deeper geological formations in water scarce areas and mining activities archana et al 2018 horst et al 2011 kinnunen et al 2018 therefore developing cost effective methods to prevent remove or reduce nitrate and sulfate from water are of considerable significance to meet the regulatory limits the concentrations of these anions are measured routinely in groundwater monitoring programs and studies however this may not be sufficient to assess existing or potential groundwater remediation options e g pump and treat phytoremediation in situ bioremediation in situ denitrification because these anions originate each from multiple sources and undergo various biogeochemical processes biddau et al 2019 king et al 2012 tools based on environmental tracers have been developed since the 1970s to identify sources of contamination and monitor their fate and natural attenuation processes for better management of water resources clark and fritz 1997 kendall 1998 the first attempts of using nitrate isotopes used Œ¥15n no3 as a single tracer flipse jr and bonner 1985 kreitler 1979 mariotti et al 1988 mariotti and l√©tolle 1977 nevertheless the use of a single isotope is not a conclusive tool for the identification of nitrate sources given that there is interference caused by processes of volatilization nitrification denitrification or oxidation generating overlaps between the ranges of identification of the different pollution sources clark and fritz 1997 kaown et al 2009 similarly the use of a single isotope is not sufficient for identification of sulfate sources thus a dual isotope approach of Œ¥15n no3 combined with Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥34s so4 combined with Œ¥18o so4 respectively improved the capability to identify sources and track transformation processes of nitrogen and sulfate in aquatic systems aravena et al 1993 bottrell et al 2008 fukada et al 2004 2003 kaown et al 2009 mattern et

this investigation aims to identify and quantify nitrate and sulfate sources in groundwater within an area with multiple potential sources using a multi tracer approach combined with a bayesian isotope mixing model to our knowledge this is the first study to apply a bayesian isotope mixing model for tracing the sources and contribution of sulfate in groundwater of a contaminated aquifer the selected area is semiarid monterrey valley located in northeastern mexico this urbanized area has a record of elevated nitrate and sulfate concentrations in groundwater ianl 2007 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 past√©n zapata et al 2014 a preliminary investigation assessing major and trace hydrochemistry suggests that along the groundwater flow path there is an increasing gradient of sulfate and nitrate concentration exceeding 10 and 35 of the samples the threshold for drinking water respectively the cause of the increasing concentrations of nitrate could potentially be infiltration of polluted water from the land surface or leakage from buried urban sewage pipes in contrast industrial activities on the land surface or rock weathering processes may account for the rising sulfate concentrations along a flow path mora et al 2017 previous works refer to the use of major ions and trace elements for determining the main hydrochemical characteristics thus inferring some natural and anthropogenic pollution sources however these approaches were not conclusive for identifying anthropogenic sources therefore this study aims to identify and quantify the relative contributions of nitrate and sulfate from different sources and processes in groundwater within the monterrey area this will be achieved by 1 characterizing the hydrochemical factors that affect the nitrate and sulfate concentration in groundwater and identifying the main contributors by using multivariate statistical techniques and dual isotopic composition and 2 using an isotopic mixing model to quantify the groundwater nitrate and sulfate sources the results are useful for decision makers or water managers to better understand groundwater nitrate and sulfate pollution at the scale across which nitrate and sulfate is added to and accumulates within a watershed and its underlying aquifer system and integrate this knowledge into the development of groundwater management plans 2 materials and methods 2

approximately 40 of the urban water supply and is extracted mainly from three different aquifers or wellfields these will be referred to herein as the buenos aires wellfield mina wellfield and

isotopic datasets among the different groups generated by the hca a principal component analysis pca was implemented after the hca to explain the possible contributors to the total chemical variance controlled by different processes defined by one or more natural anthropogenic factors the varimax normalized rotation method was implemented as factor rotation to achieve a significant distribution of weights with geochemical data charizopoulos et al 2018 das et al 2018 tiwari et al 2019 the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartletts tests were used to verify the adequacy of the pca with kmo values of

differentiate pollution sources besides mixing and transformation processes to estimate the relative contribution of different sources of nitrate and sulfate in water samples the bayesian isotope mixing model mixsiar stock and semmens 2016 was employed mixsiar is a combination of models integrated by isosource phillips and gregg 2003 mixsir moore and semmens 2008 siar parnell et al 2010 isotoper hopkins and ferguson 2012 fruits fernandes et al 2014 and others it has been used to assess the contributions of pollution sources such as no3 griffiths et al 2016 m zhang et al 2018 heavy metals kong et al 2018 longman et al 2018 and sediments blake et al 2018 dang et al 2018 dutton et al 2019 liu et al 2017 smith et al 2018 upadhayay et al 2018 the authors are not aware of a previous study that assesses the contribution of sources of so4 using these techniques the mixing model for a set of n mixture measurements with j isotopes and k sources is described by the following equations parnell et al 2010 eq 2 x i j k 1 k p k s j k c j k Œµ i j eq 3 s j k n Œº j k œâ j k 2 eq 4 c j k n Œª j k œÑ j k 2 eq 5 Œµ i j n 0 œÉ j 2 where x ij represents the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j s jk indicate the source value k of isotope j k 1 2 3 k which is normally distributed with mean Œºjk and standard deviation œâ jk p k is the proportional contribution of source k which is estimated by the mixsiar model c jk describes the isotope fractionation factor of isotope j on source k which follow a normal distribution with mean Œª jk and standard deviation œÑ jk and Œµ ij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures which follows a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation œÉ j more detailed information on the mixsiar model can be found in stock et al 2018 in this study the mean values Œº jk and standard deviations œâ jk of nitrate sulfate and oxygen isotopes associated with different end members were obtained from previous studies 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal trends of groundwater chemistry to evaluate changes over time in groundwater chemistry the kruskal wallis test k w was applied in three different zones namely mma aquifer buenos aires wellfield and santiago system the test evaluated if there are significant differences p value 0 05 between the years 2006 2012 and 2017 table 1 the results show no significant differences in temperature ph ca mg na k no3 and hco3 for the buenos aires wellfield nevertheless cl and so4 concentrations increase two fold between 2012 and 2017 for the mma aquifer there are no significant differences in any of the parameters over time except for reduced k concentrations in 2017 the santiago system show no significant differences in any parameter the values of physicochemical and isotopic parameters of 2017 are shown in table s1 of the supplementary material samples were classified into five groups according to their statistical similarities and geographic correspondence to understand local geochemical trends fig 2 the obtained clusters were spatially defined as follow group 1 comprises samples collected from the buenos aires wellfield and la estanzuela spring group 2 represents wells located in mina wellfield group 3 4 and 5 are all located in the mma aquifer and represent samples in the recharge area transition zone and discharge area of this aquifer respectively table 2 shows the statistical summary of physicochemical parameters and isotopic ratios of each group across all five groups the average temperature varies substantially between 22 9 and 30 4 c whereas the average ph ranges over a narrow interval of near neutral values from 7 0 to 7 4 across all groups anion concentrations decreased in the order hco3 so4 cl no3 in contrast cation concentrations decreased in the order ca mg na k for groups 1 and 3 and ca na mg k for groups 2 4 and 5 the synthetic parameters hco3 so4 cl and ca mg na k were plotted against each other as a scatter plot chadha 1999 to evaluate the hydrogeochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry fig 3 a this plot suggests that groups 1 3 and 4 are recharge waters of the ca mg hco3 type and groups 2 and 5 are more chemically evolved and controlled by reverse ion exchange processes which lowered the na concentrations in pore waters even more to produce waters of the ca mg cl type in the cases of reverse ion exchange na in the solution is exchanged for ca on the clay surfaces inverse ion exchange is common where solutes with high na concentrations mix with freshwater such as in coastal areas with saline intrusion mahlknecht et al 2017 tamez mel√©ndez et al 2016 in such settings seawater na replaces continental ca and sr in the aquifer clay surfaces in this study na concentration increments are possibly due to sewage infiltration since group 5 represents waters in the urbanized discharge area possibly promoting inverse exchange processes thivya et al 2014 samples from group 2 exhibit an increased na content from the weathering of silicate minerals in the mina wellfield the positive correlation between tds and no3 cl hco3 fig 3b confirms that water chemistry is heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities jalali 2009 xiao et al 2017 geothermal waters can carry high cl concentrations however there is no evidence of geothermal waters in the study area using this reasoning group 5 is the most impacted by excess cl and no3 likely coming from vertical infiltration through the urban landscape 3 2 correlation between hydrochemical parameters and pollution sources as indicated by the shapiro wilks test a logarithmic transformation was applied to normalize all variables except for mg Œ¥18o h2o Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥18o so4 five principal components were identified using pca in which the first three explain 65 8 of the total variance the loadings of the varimax rotated components are shown in table 3 the kmo and bartlett s sphericity test value was 0 79 and the chi square value resulted in 1395 43 p value 0 05 demonstrating an accurate reduction of the hydrochemical data in terms of dimension the first component pc1 explains 33 59 of the total variance and broadly describes water rock interaction processes namely the dissolution of carbonates and evaporites being responsible for most of the salinity in groundwater of the study area nitrate and sulfate concentrations as well as nitrate isotope ratios are also correlated with this component a similar trend was observed in a neighbor aquifer past√©n zapata et al 2014 ledesma et al 2015 where nitrate was found to be originated mostly from sewage leakage and application of manure however in this study area the application of manure is not a common practice the second component pc2 explains 16 20 of the variance and relates water isotopes with 34s so4 isotope it is remarkable that ca na and cl are also positive but less significantly related with this component thus this component could indicate the different origins of groundwater at different altitudes providing distinct signatures the third component pc3 represents 15 55 of the variance and describes the long term water rock interaction process evidenced by a strong relationship between f and temperature chae et al 2007 morales arredondo et al 2018 singaraja et al 2018 as well as a notable inverse relationship between 18o no3 18o so4 and dissolved oxygen suggesting denitrification processes and sulfate reduction li et al 2019 this component appears to be related to processes that mitigate nitrate and sulfate contamination the fourth component pc4 contributes 13 64 to the variance and is related mainly to the mobility of b br and i in groundwater these elements are positively correlated with no3 concentration which likely indicates anthropogenic contamination from industrialized and urban areas the fifth component pc5 depicts a minor proportion of variance 7 03 and relates the alkali metal k with redox condition orp this component is possibly related to mobilization of k through grass degradation and leaching processes since other sources such as the dissolution of k silicate minerals or evaporites would not have a relevant influence in the redox potential unfortunately commonly measured redox sensitive elements beyond do no3 and so4 which could provide further insight into this component e g nh4 fe ii fe iii mn ii h2s were not measured mcmahon and chapelle 2008 an examination of the pca confirms that most groundwater processes can be ascribed to the dissolution of carbonates and evaporites this is evidenced by the strong correlation of ca mg hco3 so4 cl and salinity tds these water rock interactions are accompanied by nitrate pollution derived from urbanization nitrate concentrations in the study area are likely generated from organic processes in soils leakage of sewage lines and wastewater treatment plants drainage from barnyards septic tanks and cesspools leaching from the use of inorganic and organic fertilizers and landfills regarding sulfate concentrations there is strong evidence that marine evaporites generate part of the pollution however other man made sources can be inferred due to its high correlation with nitrate it is remarkable that denitrification and sulfate reduction processes are suggested by pca 3 3 isotopic composition of water the values of Œ¥18o h2o and Œ¥2h h2o for groundwater in the study area ranged from 9 5 to 5 4 and from 63 9 to 36 0 respectively fig 4 a the samples plot between the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 1993 and the local meteoric water line for the sierra madre oriental lmwl aguilar ram√≠rez et al 2017 which indicates a meteoric origin of groundwater as expected the most depleted most negative Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values occur in the buenos aires wellfield which is at a higher altitude compared to the other two wellfields samples from mina wellfield cluster narrowly in the central part of the graph in contrast samples from mma aquifer have a large variation and are the most enriched least negative in particular samples from group 5 wells in the valley floor within northeastern monterrey represent the most enriched samples reflecting the lowest topographic elevation in the study area with the exception of groups 2 and 3 a slight evaporation trend is observed the deuterium excess d excess may be useful for identifying the contributions of evaporation and or mineral dissolution to groundwater mineralization the d excess is estimated as d 2h 8 18o assuming for precipitation an average of 10 dansgaard 1964 the relationship between d excess and ec huang and pang 2012 shown in fig 4b shows that almost all samples are higher than 10 and consistent with a mineral dissolution trend this validates that evaporation is present however the influence of evapoconcentration is relatively insignificant 4 discussion 4 1 identification of possible pollution sources via halides halides br cl and i are of conservative nature with minimum interactions with the subsoil thus these elements are useful for the identification of potential pollution sources panno et al 2006 past√©n zapata et al 2014 results of this study indicate that group 1 could be considered as recently infiltrated water derived from rainfall e g dissolution of gaseous co2 with minimal impacts from water rock interactions fig 5 a and b likewise group 3 is considered recharge water in pristine conditions with certain trends of water rock interactions evaporite dissolution such as halite and mineralization of soil organic matter with nitrate as an end product group 2 appears to be affected by sewage from untreated wastewater and or septic tanks and landfills in mina municipality it is notable that the no3 to cl is relatively low fig 5c group 4 and 5 falls close to or in the range of water affected by human sewage and leaching of landfills and dumps which is in agreement with their location in the metropolitan area fig 5 4 2 nitrate sources and attenuation processes typical nitrogen transformations nitrification or denitrification occur primarily in shallow aquifers nitrification is the oxidation of nh4 to no3 and is mediated by bacteria that derive metabolic energy kendall 1998 denitrification is a reduction of no3 to n2 n2o or no which generally occurs under anaerobic environments brandes and devol 1997 koba et al 1997 in this study Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values varied from 2 0 to 14 8 and from 0 3 to 9 9 respectively different sources of nitrate were identified for the water samples of the study area using the dual isotopic approach fig 6 a the isotopic signatures of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 of sampled water combined with the different potential no3 sources illustrate that soil organic n and manure sewage sources were the two main nitrate sources samples from groups 1 2 and 3 were within the compositional field of soil organic n the origin of no3 for these samples could be related to natural soil sources which is congruent with their location in recharge areas with limited anthropogenic impact shrubland dispersed housings samples from group 2 mina well field exhibit a denitrification process identified by a ratio trend between the range from 1 1 3 to 1 2 1 aravena and robertson 1998 minet et al 2012 resulting in an enrichment of the isotopic composition of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 this may explain the reduced no3 vs cl ratio for group 2 in fig 5c on the other hand samples from groups 4 and 5 fell into the compositional field of manure sewage which is consistent with the land use of their location mostly urbanized and partly agricultural land use towards northeast these two groups also evidence a denitrification process the eh values of the sample waters range from 279 to 443 mv while dissolved oxygen content varies from 3 2 to 8 1 mg l this suggests oxic conditions for most of the studied wells which would favor nitrification processes the Œ¥18o no3 produced during the nitrification of nh4 is described as two thirds of oxygen from soil water and one third from atmospheric oxygen andersson and hooper 1983 as expressed in the following eq 6 Œ¥18o no3 2 3 Œ¥18o h2o 1 3 Œ¥18o o2 where Œ¥18o h2o represents the range of observed ratios 9 5 to 5 4 and Œ¥18o o2 the theoretical atmospheric o2 23 5 xue et al 2009 the solid gray area in fig 6b represents theoretical values of Œ¥18o no3 formed from microbial nitrification confirming this process in most samples except for group 2 where all of the isotopic signatures of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 were larger than theoretically expected confirming nitrate attenuation processes denitrification rivett et al 2008 4 3 pollution sources and attenuation processes of sulfate the Œ¥34s so4 and Œ¥18o so4 signatures of samples from the study area show compositional ranges from 1 03 to 12 16 and from 5 79 to 12 12 respectively four sources can be related to so4 2 according to fig 7 a atmospheric deposition from so2 emissions the influence of soil derived so4 sewage and marine evaporites samples from groups 1 3 and 4 plot almost all within the range of atmospheric deposition while samples from group 5 lie between atmospheric deposition and sewage for most samples of group 2 it was not possible to identify the source of sulfate due to an overlapping of source fields i e marine deposits sewage and sulfate reduction processes identified by the typical ratio trends between 1 4 and 1 2 5 mizutani and rafter 1973 fig 7a this process is described by the following equation eq 7 so4 2ch2o h2s 2hco3 furthermore in all samples Œ¥34s so4 decreases with increasing so4 cl ratio except for group 1 fig 7b suggesting that isotopically light so4 was removed and the residual so4 became enriched in 34s and 18o during sulfate reduction in groups 2 3 4 and 5 pittalis et al 2018 for group 1 an inverse trend is observed with smaller initial sulfate isotope values and larger so4 cl ratios than the rest this can be related to an initial so4 pool which is in agreement with the limestone gypsum geology of the buenos aires wellfield and a subsequent mixture with sulfate from atmospheric deposition guo et al 2015 mora et al 2017 the dual isotope diagram of Œ¥15n no3 vs Œ¥34s so4 further constrains the variety of sources are responsible for each of these contaminants even within the same aquifer fig 8 it confirms that the main sources of pollution in the sites close to recharge areas groups 1 2 and 3 are atmospheric deposition and mineralization of soil organic matter in contrast an additional source the infiltration of sewage leaks was identified for samples located in the urban area group 4 and 5 this is generally congruent with the findings for nitrate in the previous section 4 4 apportionment of nitrate and sulfate using a bayesian isotope mixing model a bayesian mixing model mixsiar was developed to estimate the proportional contributions of nitrate from the three identified potential sources atmospheric deposition ad soil organic nitrogen son and manure and sewage m s similarly a mixing model was developed to estimate the contributions of sulfate from the four identified potential sources atmospheric deposition ad soil sulfate ss manure and sewage m s and marine evaporites me the mean and standard deviation of the isotopic composition used in the mixsiar for the different pollution sources was estimated from a local end member and literature table s2 of supplementary material and is shown in table 4 the results reveal that the nitrate source contribution in the study area generally followed son m s ad with mean and standard deviation values of 60 6 12 4 37 8 12 5 and 1 6 1 2 respectively as illustrated in fig 9 a c specifically groups 1 2 and 3 showed similar patterns with the highest shares derived from son with 96 8 4 2 68 4 15 9 and 78 4 11 3 respectively in contrast for groups 4 and 5 the dominant nitrate source was m s 54 5 18 6 and 84 5 12 5 respectively atmospheric deposition contributed little nitrate to the groundwater this agrees with studies performed in other areas li et al 2019 matiatos 2016 xue et al 2012 yue et al 2017 these results are generally consistent with the qualitative analysis of the dual isotopic approach fig 6a sulfate source contribution generally followed m s ad me ss with mean and standard deviation values of 40 6 18 24 9 10 18 4 5 5 and 16 1 11 9 respectively the main sulfate source was m s for group 1 38 9 29 8 group 3 43 4 22 6 group 4 57 0 22 7 and 5 41 1 21 6 while for group 2 it was marine evaporites 38 7 11 7 fig 9b and c this mixing model exercise helped to discern the contribution of distinct sulfate sources whose isotopic compositional ranges show overlaps in fig 7a the summary of the results employing this multi tracer approach combined with the bayesian isotope mixing model is shown in table s3 of supplementary material in general results obtained from the isotope mixing model using the bayesian approach were consistent with interpretations based on the hydrochemical and isotopic data although one limitation of this approach is that the isotopic ranges of sources were derived from literature data further investigations to constrain the isotopic and chemical composition of local end members is necessary to reduce the variance and uncertainty of the results 4 5 recommendations for reducing nitrate and sulfate pollution and future research based on the results of this study soil organic nitrogen and sewage were the most critical nitrate and sulfate sources in groundwater while there exist natural denitrification processes in the study area these are locally limited the rapid economic and industrial growth of monterrey during the last 100 years resulted in reduced or lost ecological processes of the urban mosaic specifically the urban santa catarina river and its tributaries have been degraded and are extremely flashy today exhibiting very rapid increase in flow following storms the increase in imperviousness changes to the hydrological flow path and the increase of sources of nitrate in the urban landscape have all contributed to a decrease in water quality the biogeochemical implications of the engineered changes are that riparian zones with their expected high levels of denitrification due to their vegetation composition microbial populations soil conditions and hydrological regimes are faulty because they are altered and disconnected from urban streams followed by a transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions reducing the potential of denitrification designs that re establish ecological processes restauration can create hotspots of denitrification where the stream riparian interface has been modified to facilitate interaction of stream water with the riparian zone infrastructure can be added which serves as nitrate sink as in the case of detention basins or removed as in the case of daylighting buried urban streams or modified as in the case of bioretention ponds and level spreaders to better mimic natural structures and ecological processes the introduction of green roofs or permeable surfaces to enhance water infiltration farther upslope in the hydrological flow paths are other strategies which increase the capacity of mitigation of nitrate cadenasso 2008 monterrey has an outstanding status in latin america regarding access to drinking water and sanitation the population enjoys universal access to water distribution and sewerage this means that practically all generated water and wastewater is treated in treatment facilities the sewage system has been built starting in the early 1900s and expanded over time it operates as a combined system simultaneously collecting surface runoff and sewage water in a shared system hence the existence of reaches of old pipes and tunnels combined with limited preventive maintenance over prolonged periods and overflows during the rainy seasons have contributed to groundwater pollution olds et al 2018 selvakumar et al 2004 especially considering that the groundwater table of mma is located only about 7 20 m below ground level in this sense it is recommended that the water and sanitation utility pays special attention to the oldest parts of the city sewage system which coincide geographically with shallow unconfined aquifer conditions sample groups 3 and 4 in this areas exfiltration of the sewage from damaged reaches is a common problem and needs rehabilitation measures these rehabilitation projects will take many years to complete on the other hand the discharge zone of mma is strongly industrialized group 5 according to the mexican law industries are forced to comply with environmental standards when discharging the generated wastewater into water bodies thus it is imminent to monitor industrial discharges in terms of water quality and avoid illegal dumping to the environment furthermore a revision of the sanitation plan is required which includes among other measures the promotion of decentralized approaches in peri urban and rural areas for example mina group 2 and buenos aires group 1 are appropriate candidates for this kind of solutions they may maintain low nitrate and sulfate concentrations by reducing the infiltration of untreated wastewater from septic tanks and cesspools to the shallow aquifer and preserve the actual situation of water quality clemens et al 2020 oakley et al 2010 finally it is essential to create a long term groundwater monitoring network of nitrate and sulfate in the entire aquifer system to control the evolution of the contamination in time and space future research efforts should be developed towards evaluating seasonal changes of pollution and the use of microorganisms and micropollutants as co tracers for a more robust conceptualization of contamination paths and evaluation of mitigation measures in a complex groundwater system 5 conclusions a multi tracer study using chemical and isotopic fingerprints in combination with a probability mixing model was conducted to understand the origin and source contribution of nitrate and sulfate pollution in groundwater of the urbanized valley of monterrey nitrate pollution was mainly derived from sewage leaks in the urban area 37 8 in contrast soil organic nitrogen was responsible for nitrate concentration in the recharge areas 81 2 similarly sulfate pollution in the city was caused by sewage infiltration 45 1 in the groundwater and atmospheric deposition 24 9 as result of anthropogenic emissions in recharge areas sulfates are the result of the interaction between water and marine evaporites 38 7 the hydrochemical data suggests that groundwater of the study area is dominated by a ca mg hco3 water type in the topographically elevated non urbanized areas buenos aires and a ca mg cl water type in transition and discharge areas of monterrey metropolitan area and mina northwest of monterrey the latter chemistry type and locations suggest mixing between recharge waters and sewage leaks and possibly inverse cation exchange processes stable water isotopes suggest that water in the study area has a meteoric origin with some evaporation effects in the transition areas however evapoconcentration is insignificant compared to mineral dissolution the multivariate analysis confirms that carbonate and evaporite dissolution drives groundwater mineralization the evaluation of halide concentrations revealed that samples close to recharge areas in buenos aires indicate recently recharged meteoric water un impacted by anthropogenic contaminants these waters represent recent infiltrated water that has experienced some water rock interactions such as carbonate and halite dissolution and mineralization of soil organic matter with nitrate as an end product along the flow path these groundwaters mix with sewage leakages and leach from landfills these processes are likely operating within the mina wellfield as well as the transition and discharge zone of mma aquifer the dual isotope approach confirms that natural contamination by mineralization of soil organic nitrogen and anthropogenic contamination by sewage leakages and leaching from landfills are the main nitrate sources in addition it suggests the presence of denitrification processes in the mina area and the discharge zone of mma aquifer northeast of the monterrey area on the other hand sulfate contamination originated naturally by the dissolution of marine evaporites such as gypsum especially in the buenos aires area and from anthropogenically contaminated from atmospheric deposition from emissions and leakages from sewage in the urbanized area probability mixing models using the bayesian method confirm that leakage derived from sewage is not the only important pollution source of no3 and so4 proving that natural sources nitrogen and sulfate derived from the soil play also impact groundwater chemistry moreover mixing with different pollution sources could be identified for the urbanized area however future investigations should perform a detailed characterization of the isotopic composition ranges of the different local sources to reduce the uncertainty of the probability mixing results the rapid economic and industrial growth of monterrey resulted in reduced and lost ecological processes in the urban mosaic and a limited maintenance of sewage system restauration efforts can create natural structures and infrastructure which serve as nitrate and sulfate sink the continuous rehabilitation of the sewage system in the older urban landscape may reduce exfiltrations to the underlying close groundwater table decentralized on site treatment systems may be promoted in periurban and rural areas as a cost effective solution to prevent pollution in distant areas a long term monitoring network serves to control the pollution and to evaluate mitigation measures this methodology is an effective tool that can be successfully applied in catchments for a qualitative and

ibp and npx via uv nh2cl the electron spin resonance spectroscopy and kinetic modeling results also indicated the larger amount of oh and weaker reactive chlorine species mainly clo and clo2 in uv nh2cl compared with uv naclo compared to uv naclo in synthetic and natural water uv nh2cl was a more stable degrader with little ph and substrate dependence while uv naclo preferred degrading the electron donating ppcp and at low ph the uv nh2cl produced less halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps even nitrogenous dbps and was less cytotoxic theoretically than uv naclo based on the dbps included in this study thus uv nh2cl process may be an effective aop for water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv nh2cl uv naclo pharmaceuticals and personal care products hydroxyl radical disinfection by products drinking water 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are widespread and are receiving considerable attention liu and wong 2013 yap et al 2018 which are important emerging contaminants ecs yap et al 2018 nearly 20 million tons of ppcps are produced every year via commercial processes xu et al 2017 and these are removed inefficiently by conventional water treatments castiglioni et al 2006 daughton and ternes 1999 lin et al 2018 santos et al 2007 thus the outpouring ppcps contain in surface and ground water sediments and soil xiang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 which constitute a threat to the whole ecosystem and human health ducey and sapkota 2010 khetan and collins 2007 oaks et al 2004 santos et al 2010 advanced treatment of drinking water is a developing society s response to deteriorating water quality and increased health concerns of citizens the most promising technologies for the removal of ppcps are adsorption and advanced oxidation processes aops xu et al 2017 the principle of aops is the generation of reactive free radicals to degrade or even completely mineralize contaminants the removal of ppcps via aops is actively studied kanakaraju et al 2018 mendez arriaga et al 2010 the most widely used and studied uv based aops in drinking water is uv h2o2 which generates the strong free radical oh e0 2 73 v via eq 1 schwarz and dodson 1984 wardman 1989 however oh tends to react nonselectively making the removal rate of the target contaminant depend on water matrixes westerhoff et al 1999 wols et al 2013 furthermore the residual h2o2 produced by this aop needs to be quenched glaze et al 1987 keen et al 2013 eq 2 chlorine and chloramine residues also need to meet disinfection requirements in pipeline networks in some countries which raises costs chuang et al 2017 sun et al 2012 since chlorination is the most widely utilized technologies to disinfect water deborde and von gunten 2008 an emerging aop combining uv and chlorine has attracted much interest in recent years aghdam et al 2017 dong et al 2017 fang et al 2018 guo et al 2017 sichel et al 2011 besides nonselective oh reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 and clo are also generated during the uv chlorine process eqs 3 11 buxton and subhani 1972a b chuang et al 2017 guo et al 2017 jayson et al 1973 these species preferentially react with benzene derivatives with electron donating groups they react at a high rate with specific contaminants such as phenols anilines and alkyl alkoxybenzenes guo et al 2017 thus the degradation rate of different ppcps using the uv chlorine process varies according to the result of a previous study the degradation rate constant of thirty four kinds of ppcps ranged from 4 min 1 to 0 025 min 1 and several ppcps cephalexin ciprofloxacin tetracycline terbutaline famotidine and cimetidine even degraded too fast to be determined under the same conditions in uv chlorine utilizing a borosilicate glass reactor with a quartz tube in the center ppcp 0 1 Œºg l chlorine 0 10 Œºm average uv fluence rate 0 78 mw cm2 guo et al 2017 furthermore the molar absorptivity …õ and quantum yield …∏ of hocl and ocl were higher than those of h2o2 under low pressure uv radiation feng et al 2007 liao and gurol 1995 morgan et al 1988 zhang et al 2018a which makes uv chlorine process produce radicals more efficiently than uv h2o2 and the uv chlorine may benefit from this to reduce energy or oxidant consumption compared with the uv h2o2 as to the same photoreactor chuang et al 2017 however the contribution of free radicals to contaminant degradation is still not well understood chuang et al 2017 moreover the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps needs to be more carefully considered 1 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh 2 hocl h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o cl h 3 hocl ocl hv oh o cl 4 o h oh 5 cl cl cl 2 6 oh hocl ocl clo h 2 o oh 7 cl hocl clo cl h 8 cl ocl clo cl 9 cl oh cloh 10 cl h 2 o cloh h 11 cloh oh cl chloramine is generated during chlorination table s1 hand and margerum 1983 jafvert and valentine 1992 when nh3 is present in the water and chloramine commonly monochloramine is itself a long lasting disinfectant that may reduce the levels of dbps due to its low reactivity compared to chlorine and a possible alternative disinfectant for chlorine as recommended by the world health organization who bu et al 2018 who 2011 wolfe et al 1984 it is therefore important to look deeper into the uv nh2cl process used for drinking water treatment the application of uv nh2cl process as an aop to degrade contaminant is just rising recently which produces cl nh2 and oh via eq 9 13 li and blatchley 2009 patton et al 2016 yu and barker 2003 the great efficacy of the uv nh2cl process in the degradation of ppcps has been demonstrated bu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a there is a possibility that uv nh2cl can effectively remove different kinds of ppcps non selectively and leaving behind nh2cl as a residual disinfectant however previous studies of the uv nh2cl process have mainly focused on disinfection risk uv was used in disinfecting poor water containing chloramine or removal of ammonia nh2cl photolysis and ammonia oxidation in uv nh2cl soltermann et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a 2015b thus the degradation of ppcps especially the reaction mechanism of the uv nh2cl process must be further studied 12 nh 2 cl hv nh 2 cl 13 cl nh 2 cl nhcl h cl when water is treated with chlorine or chloramine the dbp formation is a matter of great concern because of their toxicity chaves et al 2019 diana et al 2019 mian et al 2018 dbp formation during uv nh2cl is complex which includes the change in the hydrophilicity and molecular weight of the substrate by uv irradiation buchanan et al 2005 corin et al 1996 ye et al 2018 and the oxidation of free radicals and nh2cl the formation of dbps during chlor am ination may differ after uv nh2cl treatment this phenomenon has been observed after other aops uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv chlorine which enhances the risk of dbp formation in pipework after the implementation of such aops lu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 however there are only few studies on dbp formation during uv nh2cl or post chloramination thus it is necessary to explore the formation and theoretical cytotoxicity of common dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas and more toxicological nitrogenous dbps n dbps muellner et al 2007 during the uv nh2cl process and post chloramination subsequent to the uv nh2cl process here we systematically studied the degradation of typical ppcps that is ibuprofen ibp and naproxen npx details in table s2 these ppcps were chosen for two main reasons 1 ibp and npx are widely used ppcps and they are detected worldwide in water sources archer et al 2017 banaschik et al 2015 mendez arriaga et al 2010 pan et al 2018 hence there is an urgency to the task of removing ibp and npx from drinking water 2 ibp and npx are structurally different unlike ibp npx is electron donating and reacts rapidly with rcs guo et al 2017 therefore the conclusions of this study are applicable to at least two different types of ppcps the main aims of this study were 1 to investigate the degradation efficiency of two kinds of ppcps ibp and npx during the uv nh2cl process and the effects of experimental parameters to the degradation rates 2 to elucidate the radical reaction mechanisms in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes and verify the findings by electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr and kinetic modeling 3 to compare the degradation of ppcps during the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes using simulated water of different ph values and natural water and 4 to explore the dbp formation and theoretical cytotoxicity of the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ammonium chloride nh4cl disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahyrate na2hpo4 12h2o potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 sodium thiosulfate

low pressure mercury lamp 172 w emission spectrum in fig s1 the experiments using synthetic water were performed with 1 6 mg l ppcp ibp or npx and 0 3 mm oxidant nh2cl or naclo ten millimolar phosphate buffer was added to control the ph of the reaction solution to 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 to study the effects of the solution matrixes 2 8 mm hco3 or 2 8 mg l nom was mixed in the solution to make the results of this study applicable as references for other photoreactors the solution was sampled at the set uv dose instead of the set time one milliliter of solution was sampled each time then quenched immediately with 0 1 ml 200 mm na2s2o3 the sampling times for experiments involving uv irradiation were calculated according to the method reported by bolton and linde bolton and linden 2003 this method combines the uv irradiance at the surface is petri factor water factor divergence factor and reflection factor to calculate the correspondence between the sampling times and set uv dose under different experiment conditions for experiments in the dark direct oxidation without uv irradiation samples were collected at the same time interval as the corresponding aop process under the same experiment conditions oxidant 0 ph in section 3 2 and 3 3 the kinetics analysis is based on the sampling times the experiments using natural water were performed with 1 6 mg l ppcp ibp or npx and 0 3 mm oxidant nh2cl or naclo without adjusting the ph the sample collection followed the same protocol as described for the experiments with synthetic water additionally the solution was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm filter membrane before assaying all the samples were assayed within 24 h and every experiment was replicated independently at least two times the experiments on dbp formation were performed with 1 6 mg l ppcps ibp or npx and 0 3 mm oxidant nh2cl or naclo in synthetic water ph 7 with 10 mm phosphate buffer and natural water in aop experiments the solution was quenched immediately with na2s2o3 after uv irradiation at 500 mj cm2 in aop post chlor am ination experiments the solution was reacted in the dark for 24 h with residual chlor am ination after the aop 500 mj

estimate the ability to produce dbps under the same ppcp removal the dbp yield eq 14 was calculated from the ratio of the concentration of generated dbps to degraded concentration of ppcp ibp or npx

acetonitrile v v 3 7 at a flow rate of 1 ml min the uv detection wavelengths were 223 257 and 262 nm for ibp npx and nb respectively the concentrations of total chlorine and free chlorine were measured by a pocket colorimeter ‚Ö± hach usa revised from the dpd method the concentration of monochloramine stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically following a previously described

2 4 kinetic modeling the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes were modeled using the simbiology application in matlab 2016a this model considered 116 elementary reactions including photolysis chlorine hydroxide phosphate and nitrogenous reactions from previous literature table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of ppcps in the uv nh2cl process 3 1 1 degradation efficiency of ibp and npx the degradations of ibp and npx by nh2cl alone uv irradiation alone and the uv nh2cl process are shown in fig 1 based on the weak oxidizability of nh2cl the degradation of ibp and npx by direct oxidant is negligible ibp 3 and npx 1 furthermore only 9 16 of ibp was degraded by uv photolysis at 500 mj cm2 under the same conditions 16 36 of npx was degraded because the photolysis experiments were performed in deionized water without an oxidant the photodegradation of ibp and npx in this study almost exclusively originated from direct photolysis the photolysis rate is related to the properties and concentration of molecular and uv exposure chuang et al 2016 wols and hofman caris 2012 npx has a larger molar absorptivity and a lower quantum yield compared to ibp average parameters from previous studies are shown in table s2 under same uv irradiation but the theoretical photolysis rate equation shown in the photolysis part of table s5 of npx is larger than ibp thus the photodegradation of npx was faster as observed in the experiments in contrast both ibp and npx degraded fast in uv nh2cl process following pseudo fist order kinetics r2 0 97 as shown in fig 1 81 66 of ibp and 87 29 of npx were removed by uv nh2cl at 500 mj cm2 indicating a greater degree of efficiency compared with the use of nh2cl or uv irradiation the enhanced degradation of ppcps by uv nh2cl may be caused by the generation of reactive radicals detailed discussion in sections 3 2 and 3 3 3 1 2 effects of uv irradiance monochloramine dosage and ph the uv intensity is is an essential parameter having a marked effect on retention time and energy consumption in water treatment plants wang et al 2016 thus ibp and npx were degraded under different uv intensities is 0 3 or 1 0 mw cm2 to observe the effect of uv intensity as shown in fig 2 a b the degradation of the two ppcps did not differ under low and high uv intensities anova p ibp 0 88 0 05 p npx 0 93 0 05 suggesting that the production and quenching of radicals insignificantly differ within the range of is used in this study therefore a uv intensity of 1 0 mw cm2 was used in subsequent experiments the ph of water from dwtps usually ranges from 6 0 to 8 0 within this range the degradation of ppcps shows little ph dependence as shown in fig 2 c d according to anova all the p values for ibp are 0 94 and all p values of npx are 0 92 between different ph values since the pka value of ibp is 4 91 and the pka value of npx is 4 15 guo et al 2017 both ibp and npx have anionic forms at ph 6 0 8 0 the concentration of nh2cl remained steady at ph 6 0 8 0 the concentrations of nh2cl at different ph were calculated with a spectrophotometer method and the uv vis absorption spectrum is shown in fig s2 the minimal effect of ph on ppcp degradation indicates that the uv nh2cl process may be applied to different water sources the oxidant dosage is crucial to determine because it has both positive generation of more reactive radicals and negative consumption of reactive radicals by excess nh2cl and reactive radicals effects to degradation rate the reaction with increasing nh2cl dosage may be described by eqs 15 17 bu et al 2018 as the dosage of nh2cl increased from 0 15 mm to 0 75 mm kobs ibp the uv dose based kinetic constant increased evenly from 0 0029 to 0 0046 cm2 mj fig 2 e reflecting the benefit imparted by more reactive radicals from nh2cl in contrast kobs npx increased slowly from 0 3 mm to 0 75 mm fig 2 f because of excess nh2cl that competed for radicals with npx thus the dosage of nh2cl was set to 0 3 mm in this study 15 cl nh 2 cl nhcl cl h 16 cl 2 nh 2 cl nhcl 2 cl h 17 oh nh 2 cl nhcl h 2 o 3 1 3 effects of solution matrixes bicarbonate hco3 and nom are both common scavengers in natural water which react with radical species and thus negatively influence the degradation of ppcps wang et al 2016 thus the effect of different concentrations of hco3 0 8 mm and nom 0 8 mg l on the uv nh2cl process was investigated in this study fig 3 a b show that hco3 obviously inhibits the degradation of ibp and npx when the concentration of hco3 ranged from 0 mm to 8 mm the corresponding rate constant of ibp decreased from 0 0037 to 0 0018 cm2 mj and rate constant of npx decreased from 0 0044 to 0 0028 cm2 mj the inhibitory effect of hco3 is probably due to the consumption of radical species eqs 18 21 bu et al 2018 guo et al 2017 the hco3 reacts quickly with oh and cl with rate constants of 8 5 106 and 2 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively generating the co3 that has lower reaction rates towards ibp and npx kco3 ibp 7 9 105 m 1s 1 k co3 npx 5 6 107 m 1s 1 compared to oh guo et al 2017 based on sections 3 2 and 3 3 oh is the major radical involved in the ppcp degradation thus the transformation from oh to co3 may slow down the degradation 18 cl hco 3 co 3 cl h 19 oh hco 3 h 2 o co 3 20 cl 2 hco 3 co 3 2 cl h 21 nh 2 hco 3 nh 3 co 2 similarly the degradation rates of both ppcps decreased with the addition of nom fig 3 c d increasing the concentration of nom from 0 mg l to 8 mg l resulted in the corresponding decrease in the rate constants of ibp and npx from 0 0037 to 0 0007 cm2 mj and from 0 0044 to 0 0018 cm2 mj respectively nom reacts with oh and cl with rate constants of 2 5 104 mg l 1s 1 and 1 3 104 mg l 1s 1 respectively wu et al 2016 because the effect of absorption was excluded by the method for calculating uv dose in this study the inhibition of ppcp degradation based on the uv dose in fig 3 c d was attributed to the competitive effect of nom with radicals the inhibitory effects of hco3 and nom were also observed for other ppcps degraded by the uv nh2cl process bu et al 2018 3 2 reactive radicals in uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes a free radical contains an unpaired electron and can be identified by esr sundarapandiyan et al 2014 in this study a solution containing 0 75 mm oxidant was used to obtain stronger signals and the esr spectra were measured after 5 min of uv exposure although the ex situ experiment is not quantitative the result can be used to qualitatively determine principal radical species as shown in fig 4 a and c there was no signal of free radicals in the two dark processes indicating that the dark oxidant was not involved in radical reaction however different signals were observed in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes in previous studies a seven fold esr spectrum was observed when dmpo was oxidized to dmpox by rcs li et al 2016 s d stan 2003 sundarapandiyan et al 2014 a similar seven fold spectrum fig 4 d was observed in the uv naclo process in this study which can be attributed to the strong rcs in the uv naclo process based on previous studies guo et al 2017 2018 in contrast the characteristic spectrum of dmpo oh a four fold characteristic peak with an intensity of 1 2 2 1 ranguelova et al 2012 zhang et al 2018b was observed in uv nh2cl fig 4 b and the same spectrum was observed at ph values ranging from 6 0 to 8 0 fig s3 the different esr spectra indicates that uv nh2cl process has weaker rcs and a higher oh concentration than the uv naclo process to further study the reactive radicals in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes the data from kinetic modeling was shown in table 2 the oh and oxidant concentrations obtained in the model agreed with the data from the experiments oh shown in table 2 nh2cl varied among 3 3 naclo varied among 1 9 thus the information about radicals species and concentrations obtained from the model can be used as a reference to study the complex radicals in uv nh2cl and uv naclo the concentration of oh was higher in uv nh2cl than in the uv naclo according to the result of kinetic modeling and the experiments about the steady state radicals which was also observed in a previous model and experiment chuang et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the clo and clo2 concentrations in the uv naclo process were much higher both of these radicals can oxidize dmpo to dmpox ozawa et al 1996 sundarapandiyan et al 2014 which may result in the seven fold spectrum in uv naclo process higher oh and lower clo and clo 2 concentrations may explain the clear spectrum of dmpo oh shown in uv nh2cl process compared with the uv naclo process the result of esr and kinetic modeling illustrated the notable differences of radicals in uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes 3 3 comparison of uv nh2cl and uv naclo in synthetic and natural water 3 3 1 comparison in synthetic water in this study a widely reported method bu et al 2018 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 was used to determine the contributions of oh and rcs by adding nitrobenzene nb as the oh probe usually the probe is added to aop process without or with substrate in this study the probe was added to the aop ppcp process to better reflect the mechanism in actual degradation of different ppcps as the kinetic expression shows in eq 22 the degradation of ppcps in uv nh2cl is attributed to uv photolysis the direct oxidation of nh2cl and oxidation by radical species oh rcs and reactive nitrogen species rns 22 k ppcp k uv ppcp k nh 2 cl ppcp k oh ppcp k rcs ppcp k rns ppcp where k ppcp is the pseudo first order rate constant k uv ppcp k nh 2 cl ppcp k oh ppcp k rcs ppcp and k rns ppcp are the k values of ppcp degraded by uv photolysis nh2cl oh rcs and rns respectively the rate constants mentioned in section 3 3 1 are time based the contributions of nh2cl fig s4 was negligible thus eq 22 can be simplified as eq 23 23 k ppcp k uv ppcp k oh ppcp k rcs ppcp k rns ppcp 24 k oh ppcp k oh ppcp oh s s 25 k nb k oh nb oh s s the concentration of nb was chosen properly to bring as little influence on ppcp degradation as possible the effect 10 5 in this study data not shown and the pseudo first order rate constant of nb k nb was determined in this study fig s5 because nb has low reactivities with other radicals except for oh the second order rate constant k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1s 1 bu et al 2018 the degradation of nb is almost due to oh thus the steady state concentration of oh oh ss was obtained from eq 25 the values of k uv ppcp and kppcp were determined in this study fig s5 the k oh ppcp values of ibp and npx were obtained from previous studies guo et al 2017 2018 subsequently eqs 23 and 24 were solved unlike uv naclo oh in uv nh2cl process was not directly produced by photolysis of the added oxidant but by subsequent reactions table s5 however the higher oh concentration and weaker rcs were the important features of uv nh2cl compared with uv naclo section 3 2 in addition as shown in fig 5 the contribution of oh to ppcp degradation was notable for both ibp and npx in uv nh2cl which agreed with the result discussed in section 3 2 at a ph of 6 0 8 0 the nh2cl remains stable section 3 1 2 and no significant change of free radical conditions was showed in esr spectrum of uv nh2cl section 3 2 and fig s3 thus the degradation rates of ibp and npx as well as the contribution of different parts to ppcp degradation slightly varied at ph 6 0 8 0 although ibp is electron withdrawing and npx is electron donating guo et al 2018 oh always plays an important role section 3 2 and fig 5 and is nonselective which leads to an effective degradation of both two ppcps in uv nh2cl effective in uv naclo the method used to determine the contribution of different radicals uv irradiation and direct oxidation is described in text s1 and fig s6 the ppcp degradation both ibp and npx by the uv naclo process in synthetic water was more efficient in acidic solution because more hclo was generated at lower ph based on its pka value of 7 5 hclo has a higher quantum yield and smaller scavenging power for oh and rcs compared with clo guo et al 2017 pan et al 2018 fig 5 shows that in the uv naclo process oh is the main radical involved in the degradation of ibp at different ph values while rcs is the main radical involved in npx degradation in acidic solution the contribution of rcs to npx degradation increased from 24 at ph 8 to 68 at ph 6 and played an important role in the uv naclo process the rcs is highly reactive with electron donating groups such as oleflns and benzene derivatives guo et al 2017 and npx is electron donating and contains alkoxybenzenes guo et al 2018 the uv naclo has stronger rcs section 3 2 therefore the degradation rates and the main radicals of the two kinds of ppcps differed moreover the rate constant of npx degradation via naclo oxidation increased as ph decreased from 8 0 to 6 0 the degradation efficiency of ppcps in uv nh2cl showed little ph dependence while the degradation efficiency in uv naclo declined as ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the main contributive radical involved in ppcp degradation was always oh in the uv nh2cl process however main contributive radical involved in the uv naclo process depended on the ppcp involved and ph ibp was stably and efficiently degraded by uv nh2cl while the degradation of npx was notably faster in the uv naclo process because of its high reactivity to rcs 3 3 2 comparison in natural water the efficacy of uv nh2cl and uv naclo in degrading the target ppcps in natural water was investigated in degradation experiments conducted on sand filtered water from a dwtp water quality data is shown in table s3 the degradation of ibp and npx in natural water by uv nh2cl and uv naclo was inhibited and followed pseudo first order kinetics with the exception of the uv nh2cl process on npx fig s7 as shown in fig 6 a the degradation of ibp in natural water by uv nh2cl and uv naclo was comparable in contrast npx in natural water fig 6 b was degraded faster by uv naclo than by uv nh2cl similar to synthetic water fig 5 b the solution matrixes in natural water can compete free radicals and absorb uv irradiation the change of the absorbance was considered in the calculation of the uv dose the degradation of ppcps in uv nh2cl depended on the nonselective oh which can be consumed by dom and co3 2 hco3 kim et al 2009 thus an inhibitory effect of the solution matrixes on the uv nh2cl process was observed in synthetic water section 3 1 3 and natural water containing dom and hco3 at mg l levels table s3 with respect to uv naclo problems regarding the radical consumption and a lower degradation efficiency were observed under weakly alkaline conditions thus the degradation of ppcps in uv naclo was also inhibited in natural water 3 4 dbp formation and theoretical cytotoxicity of the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes to comprehensively explore dbp formation in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes 4 thms tcm bdcm cdbm tbm 9 haas mcaa mbaa dcaa tcaa bcaa bdcaa dbaa cdbaa tbaa and 6 n dbps tcan tcnm dcan tcp bcan dban were assayed in this study details in table 1 the concentration and yield of each dbp are both shown in following discussion to compare the absolute amount and generation ratio relative to ppcp removal of each generated dbp the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbps was also calculated to reveal potential health risks of the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes in natural water experiments using ibp or npx as the only carbon source in synthetic water were performed to investigate dbp formation from different kinds of ppcps electron withdrawing or electron donating and experiments under same conditions were also implemented on a mix of ppcp ibp or npx and natural water to explore the possible dbps formed in dwtps it is worth noting that there are background dbps present in natural water sand filtered water from a dwtp in beijing table s3 because of the use of pre chlorination to control algae in summer thus the dark experiments similar conditions as aop experiments but without uv exposure were conducted as control experiments in synthetic water the background dbps and the dark experiments were control experiments in natural water the dbp formation in natural water was complicated in this study which included the degradation of background dbps and the generation of new dbps from both nom and ppcps 3 4 1 thm formation tcm was the only thm formed from ibp and npx in synthetic water and the concentration of tcm was low 0 3 Œºg l under all conditions fig 7 a and b which indicates that ppcps are not likely to become precursors of thms in natural water bdcm was the major thm formed as shown in fig 7 a and b the concentration of bdcm varied a little in all experiments with nh2cl but increased in dark experiments with naclo since there were hardly any thms generated in synthetic water ppcp as the only carbon source the thm precursors in natural water a mix of nom and ppcp mostly came from nom experiments with natural water alone the bdcm varied among 15 in the experiments with nh2cl but tripled after 24 h dark experiments with naclo which agreed with the trend in fig 7 a and b in the uv nh2cl process as shown in fig 7 a and b the concentration of thm from ibp and npx in natural water decreased compared to background which may have been caused by the degradation of thms in uv nh2cl experiments with natural water alone the bdcm reduced by 13 7 in uv nh2cl during subsequent post chloramination after uv nh2cl thms from ibp in natural water increased to background level and thms from npx in natural water increased slightly higher than background level compared with the thms in aop or 24 h dark experiment alone the increased thms in post chloramination after uv nh2cl were not very obvious in the uv naclo process as shown in fig 7 a and b the concentration of thms from ibp and npx in natural water was higher than that in the uv nh2cl process during subsequent post chlorination the concentration of thms rose rapidly reaching more than twice the amount of the thms during post chloramination this was mainly due to the reactivity of chlorine the thms formed in naclo alone were much higher than nh2cl control experiments in fig 7 a and b which was also discovered decades ago wolfe et al 1984 besides a similar increase of thms during post chlorination after uv naclo was observed in another study that had also used natural water wang et al 2015 3 4 2 haa formation mcaa cdbaa tbaa were not detected under all conditions in this study as shown in fig 7 c and d in synthetic water dcaa was the major haa formed in the uv nh2cl process while dcaa and tcaa were the major haas formed in the uv naclo process this may be because of different radical reactions in uv nh2cl and uv naclo as discussion in section 3 2 and the haa concentration fig 7 c and d and haa yield shown in table s6 from npx were both higher than those from ibp in synthetic water since ppcp was the only carbon source this phenomenon may be explained by more sensitive reactivity between rcs and the electron donating group of npx guo et al 2017 the trend of total haa formation under different conditions was similar for ibp and npx in synthetic water therefore dbp formation from ibp and npx was discussed together next in the uv nh2cl process as shown in fig 7 c and d haa formation from ibp and npx increased compared to control experiments the same reaction time as aops and kept increasing during the subsequent 24 h period of post chloramination the haa concentration in uv nh2cl post chloramination was slightly lower than 24 h dark experiment which might be caused by nh2cl consumption table s6 in the uv naclo process as shown in fig 7 c and d haa formation from ibp and npx in synthetic water increased dramatically compared to the relevant control experiment the same reaction time as aops and more haas were generated than those from the uv nh2cl process moreover haa formation from ibp and npx continued to increase during the subsequent post chlorination after uv naclo the levels reached were much higher than during post chloramination the haa concentration in uv naclo post chlorination was even higher than the sum of haa concentration in uv naclo and 24 h dark experiment which might be because of the change of substrate after uv naclo as shown in table s6 haa yields in uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination were also higher than the respective yields from uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination the stronger rcs formed in uv naclo compared to that from uv nh2cl as discussed in section 3 2 may explain why haas were generated more easily in the uv naclo process in natural water as shown in fig 7 c and d the major haas in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes were both similar to the background and these consisted of dcaa tcaa mbaa and bcaa among these the concentration of bcaa remained almost unchanged during experiments in natural water in the uv nh2cl process as shown in fig 7 c and d the concentration of haas from ibp and npx in natural water even decreased slightly compared to the background which indicates that the rate of dbp degradation is higher than the rate of dbp generation in natural water which contains a mix of nom and ppcp during post chloramination after uv nh2cl the concentration of haas from ibp in natural water rose back to the background level but the concentration of haas from npx in natural water increased more rapidly in the uv naclo process as shown in fig 7 c and d the concentration of haas from ibp and npx in natural water increased compared to the background and was higher than that from the uv nh2cl process this may be explained by the stronger rcs reacting with electron rich moieties in nom and generating haa precursors sun et al 2019 during subsequent post chlorination after uv naclo the concentration of haas from ibp and npx in natural water continued to increase and reached a much higher level than that post chloramination especially tcaa since the haas in naclo and uv naclo were both larger than in nh2cl and uv nh2cl the similar rise of tcaa during post chlorination was also observed in synthetic water 3 4 3 n dbp formation the n dbps were measured in uv nh2cl in synthetic water and natural water and uv naclo only in natural water tcan was not detected under all conditions in synthetic water as shown in fig 7 e and f dcan and tcp were major n dbps in the uv nh2cl process in uv nh2cl process n dbp formation from ibp and npx increased compared to control experiments the same reaction time as aops especially n dbp formation from npx during post chloramination n dbp formation from ibp and npx continued to rise after uv nh2cl and higher than direct 24 h dark experiments moreover the n dbp formation and n dbp yield of npx in synthetic water were both higher than those from ibp which illustrates that npx was easier to be n dbp precursor than ibp in natural water as shown in fig 7 e and f tcnm dcan and tcp were major n dbps from a mixture of ibp and nom while tcnm dcan tcp and bcan were the major n dbps from a mixture of npx and nom in the uv nh2cl process the concentration of total n dbp concentration from ibp in natural water remained nearly unchanged compared to background however the specific n dbp species changed background tcnm was degraded and more dcan and tcp were generated from ibp and nom in natural water in the uv nh2cl process in the uv nh2cl process the concentration of total n dbp from npx in natural water especially dcan increased and exceeded the background value during subsequent post chloramination the concentration of total n dbp from ibp in natural water continued to increase after the uv nh2cl process with dcan and tcp increasing the most and the concentration of total n dbp especially dcan tcp and bcan from npx in natural water also increased during post chloramination after the uv nh2cl process tcp from ibp and npx in natural water trended to be formed in dark oxidation which was also observed in dark experiments with nh2cl in fig 7 e and f it is worth noting that dcan formation in natural water from ibp and npx during uv nh2cl or uv nh2cl post chloramination was lower than dcan formation in synthetic water at the same time ppcp removal was also lower in natural water section 3 3 furthermore the variation in trends of dcan formation in natural water from ibp and npx under uv nh2cl or uv nh2cl post chloramination was similar to that of dcan formation in synthetic water these two observations suggest that ppcp in natural water acting as a carbon resource may contribute more to dcan formation than nom under uv nh2cl or uv nh2cl post chloramination experiments with natural water alone the increment of dcan after uv nh2cl post chloramination was only 1 5 Œºg l another study has also found that dcan increases during chloramination of the antibiotic chloramphenicol after aop chu et al 2016 in natural water under uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination the n dbp concentration was higher than that under uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination the nitrogen containing in n dbps may come from both inorganic nitrogen and nitrogenous organic compounds liew et al 2016 shah et al 2011 ye et al 2018 moreover organic matter may change to become more hydrophobic under uv irradiation 254 nm which is likely to become precursors for hnms hu et al 2010 ye et al 2018 3 4 4 theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbp in natural water ppcps ibp and npx and nom both function as carbon resources which resulted in a wide variety and amount of dbps that have different degrees of toxicity thus a parameter dbp lc50 was used to calculate the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbps gao et al 2019 to comprehensively compare the potential toxicity of uv nh2cl and uv naclo in natural water table 1 as shown in fig s8 mbaa a kind of haas contributed most to theoretical cytotoxicity under all conditions and bcan also takes an important role in the degradation of npx under uv naclo and uv nh2cl post chloramination theoretical cytotoxicity continued to increase during subsequent post chlor am ination which is relevant to the risk of dbp formation in pipework it is worth noting that for both aop and aop post chlor am ination the calculated cytotoxicity under the naclo system is higher than that under the nh2cl system mainly because of mbaa in natural water the concentration of thms and n dbps from ibp or npx did not exceed the who standard for drinking water shown in table 1 under all conditions dark oxidation aop and aop post chlo ra mine for both nh2cl and naclo while dcaa a kind of haa was beyond the who standard in 1 condition with nh2cl npx uv nh2cl post chloramination and conditions with naclo ibp dark 24 h ibp uv naclo ibp uv naclo post chlorination npx dark 24 h npx uv naclo npx uv naclo post chlorination in natural water the ppcps in surface water were detected at ng l Œºg l concentrations worldwide liu and wong 2013 xu et al 2017 for mechanism research the dose of ppcps and oxidants used in this study was higher than dwtps thus the risk of dbps formed from ppcps by two aops in actual dwtps will be much smaller than this study the main aims of section 3 4 were 1 to investigate the subsequent generation of dbps after aops 2 to compare the dbp formation from uv nh2cl and uv naclo 3 to find the species of dbps needed focus though the mechanism of dbp formation needs further research this study generated the following important results 1 dbp formation increases during post chlor am ination especially post chlorination after uv naclo in natural water 2 uv nh2cl is associated with a smaller dbp risk in this study the concentration and yield of thms and haas from ibp and npx under the nh2cl system uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination were smaller than those from the naclo system uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination the concentration of n dbps and the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbp from ibp and npx in natural water under the nh2cl system were also smaller than those from the naclo system 3 the formation of mbaa and dcaa should be paid special attention 4 conclusions under uv irradiation nh2cl generates cl and nh2 meanwhile oh is generated by subsequent reactions and plays the leading role in the degradation of electron withdrawing ibp and electron donating npx at different ph values 6 0 8 0 as an aop relying on oh uv nh2cl process has the following characteristics a nonselective oh is nonselective thus the uv nh2cl process efficiently degraded ibp and npx following pseudo first order kinetics which indicates that the uv nh2cl process can be applied to both electron donating and electron withdrawing ppcps however this may also result in the consumption of radicals by the water matrixes the degradation rate decreased with the increasing hco3 2 8 mm and nom 2 8 mg l concentrations the inhibition of the water matrixes was observed using sand filtered water thus uv nh2cl is more suitable to be placed at the end of the water treatment process to reduce interference from the matrixes and make use of residual nh2cl b little ph dependence the degradation of ibp and npx remains effective under different ph values 6 0 8 0 this range of ph caused little change in radical contributions with oh always functioning as the key radical the stability of ppcp degradation at different ph values suggests that uv nh2cl may be widely applicable for drinking water c low dbp risk the risk of dbp formation in the nh2cl system uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination is smaller than that in the naclo system uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination because of the higher oh concentration weaker rcs and characteristics of the oxidant the ppcp degradation during the uv nh2cl process differs from that during the uv naclo process comparison of degradation efficiency of ppcps in uv nh2cl and uv naclo clearly shows the low ph preference of uv naclo moreover the degradation rate and the contribution of radicals in the uv naclo process vary according to the ppcp the uv nh2cl process is not as selective as uv naclo and has little ph dependence and substrate dependence it is associated with a lower risk of dbp formation considering the dbps involved in this study although the degradation of other ppcps and the methods of controlling dbp formation should be involved in further studies this study combines probe experiments esr and kinetic modeling to study the mechanism of uv nh2cl and thoroughly compare uv nh2cl and uv naclo which provides comprehensive evidence in favor of uv nh2cl as a new drinking water

17808,the uv nh2cl process is an emerging advanced oxidation process aop that is greatly effective in degrading pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps however detailed information regarding the process is lacking the degradation of ibuprofen ibp an electron withdrawing ppcp and naproxen npx an electron donating ppcp in uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes was performed to investigate the applicability and security of the uv nh2cl process and compare with those of uv naclo uv nh2cl was effective in degrading both ibp and npx and the degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics kibp 0 0037 cm2 mj and knpx 0 0044 cm2 mj this indicated the broad applicability of uv nh2cl to different kinds of ppcps ranges of values of uv intensity 0 3 1 0 mw cm2 and ph 6 0 8 0 showed little effect on the degradation of ppcps by uv nh2cl based on uv dose but hco3 2 8 mm natural organic matter nom 2 8 mg l and the natural water matrixes were inhibitory increasing the dosage of nh2cl from 0 15 mm to 0 75 mm resulted in an even increase of kibp however knpx increased slowly after 0 3 mm nh2cl mechanism experiments involving nitrobenzene showed that oh was the major radical involved in degrading ibp and npx via uv nh2cl the electron spin resonance spectroscopy and kinetic modeling results also indicated the larger amount of oh and weaker reactive chlorine species mainly clo and clo2 in uv nh2cl compared with uv naclo compared to uv naclo in synthetic and natural water uv nh2cl was a more stable degrader with little ph and substrate dependence while uv naclo preferred degrading the electron donating ppcp and at low ph the uv nh2cl produced less halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps even nitrogenous dbps and was less cytotoxic theoretically than uv naclo based on the dbps included in this study thus uv nh2cl process may be an effective aop for water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv nh2cl uv naclo pharmaceuticals and personal care products hydroxyl radical disinfection by products drinking water 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are widespread and are receiving considerable attention liu and wong 2013 yap et al 2018 which are important emerging contaminants ecs yap et al 2018 nearly 20 million tons of ppcps are produced every year via commercial processes xu et al 2017 and these are removed inefficiently by conventional water treatments castiglioni et al 2006 daughton and ternes 1999 lin et al 2018 santos et al 2007 thus the outpouring ppcps contain in surface and ground water sediments and soil xiang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 which constitute a threat to the whole ecosystem and human health ducey and sapkota 2010 khetan and collins 2007 oaks et al 2004 santos et al 2010 advanced treatment of drinking water is a developing society s response to deteriorating water quality and increased health concerns of citizens the most promising technologies for the removal of ppcps are adsorption and advanced oxidation processes aops xu et al 2017 the principle of aops is the generation of reactive free radicals to degrade or even completely mineralize contaminants the removal of ppcps via aops is actively studied kanakaraju et al 2018 mendez arriaga et al 2010 the most widely used and studied uv based aops in drinking water is uv h2o2 which generates the strong free radical oh e0 2 73 v via eq 1 schwarz and dodson 1984 wardman 1989 however oh tends to react nonselectively making the removal rate of the target contaminant depend on water matrixes westerhoff et al 1999 wols et al 2013 furthermore the residual h2o2 produced by this aop needs to be quenched glaze et al 1987 keen et al 2013 eq 2 chlorine and chloramine residues also need to meet disinfection requirements in pipeline networks in some countries which raises costs chuang et al 2017 sun et al 2012 since chlorination is the most widely utilized technologies to disinfect water deborde and von gunten 2008 an emerging aop combining uv and chlorine has attracted much interest in recent years aghdam et al 2017 dong et al 2017 fang et al 2018 guo et al 2017 sichel et al 2011 besides nonselective oh reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 and clo are also generated during the uv chlorine process eqs 3 11 buxton and subhani 1972a b chuang et al 2017 guo et al 2017 jayson et al 1973 these species preferentially react with benzene derivatives with electron donating groups they react at a high rate with specific contaminants such as phenols anilines and alkyl alkoxybenzenes guo et al 2017 thus the degradation rate of different ppcps using the uv chlorine process varies according to the result of a previous study the degradation rate constant of thirty four kinds of ppcps ranged from 4 min 1 to 0 025 min 1 and several ppcps cephalexin ciprofloxacin tetracycline terbutaline famotidine and cimetidine even degraded too fast to be determined under the same conditions in uv chlorine utilizing a borosilicate glass reactor with a quartz tube in the center ppcp 0 1 Œºg l chlorine 0 10 Œºm average uv fluence rate 0 78 mw cm2 guo et al 2017 furthermore the molar absorptivity …õ and quantum yield …∏ of hocl and ocl were higher than those of h2o2 under low pressure uv radiation feng et al 2007 liao and gurol 1995 morgan et al 1988 zhang et al 2018a which makes uv chlorine process produce radicals more efficiently than uv h2o2 and the uv chlorine may benefit from this to reduce energy or oxidant consumption compared with the uv h2o2 as to the same photoreactor chuang et al 2017 however the contribution of free radicals to contaminant degradation is still not well understood chuang et al 2017 moreover the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps needs to be more carefully

long lasting disinfectant that may reduce the levels of dbps due to its low reactivity compared to chlorine and a possible alternative disinfectant for chlorine as recommended by the world health organization who bu et al 2018 who 2011 wolfe et al 1984 it is therefore important to look deeper into the uv nh2cl process used for drinking water treatment the application of uv nh2cl process as an aop to degrade contaminant is just rising recently which produces cl nh2 and oh via eq 9 13 li and blatchley 2009 patton et al 2016 yu and barker 2003 the great efficacy of the uv nh2cl process in the degradation of ppcps has been demonstrated bu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a there is a possibility that uv nh2cl can effectively remove different kinds of ppcps non selectively and leaving behind nh2cl as a residual disinfectant however previous studies of the uv nh2cl process have mainly focused on disinfection risk uv was used in disinfecting poor water containing chloramine or removal of ammonia nh2cl photolysis and ammonia oxidation in uv nh2cl soltermann et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a 2015b thus the degradation of ppcps especially the reaction mechanism of the uv nh2cl process must be further studied 12 nh 2 cl hv nh 2 cl 13 cl nh 2 cl nhcl h cl when water is treated with chlorine or chloramine the dbp formation is a matter of great concern because of their toxicity chaves et al 2019 diana et al 2019 mian et al 2018 dbp formation during uv nh2cl is complex which includes the change in the hydrophilicity and molecular weight of the substrate by uv irradiation buchanan et al 2005 corin et al 1996 ye et al 2018 and the oxidation of free radicals and nh2cl the formation of dbps during chlor am ination may differ after uv nh2cl treatment this phenomenon has been observed after other aops uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv chlorine which enhances the risk of dbp formation in pipework after the implementation of such aops lu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 however there are only few studies on dbp formation during uv nh2cl or post chloramination thus it is necessary to explore the formation and theoretical cytotoxicity of common dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas and more toxicological nitrogenous dbps n dbps muellner et al 2007 during the uv nh2cl process and post chloramination subsequent to the uv nh2cl process here we systematically studied the degradation of typical ppcps that is ibuprofen ibp and naproxen npx details in table s2 these ppcps were chosen for two main reasons 1 ibp and npx are widely used ppcps and they are detected worldwide in water sources archer et al 2017 banaschik et al 2015 mendez arriaga et al 2010 pan et al 2018 hence there is an urgency to the task of removing ibp and npx from drinking water 2 ibp and npx are structurally different unlike ibp npx is electron donating and reacts rapidly with rcs guo et al 2017 therefore the conclusions of this study are applicable to at least two different types of ppcps the main aims of this study were 1 to investigate the degradation efficiency of two kinds of ppcps ibp and npx during the uv nh2cl process and the effects of experimental parameters to the degradation rates 2 to elucidate the radical reaction mechanisms in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes and verify the findings by electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr and kinetic modeling 3 to compare the degradation of ppcps during the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes using simulated water of different ph values and natural water and 4 to explore the dbp formation and theoretical cytotoxicity of the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ammonium chloride nh4cl disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahyrate na2hpo4 12h2o potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 sodium thiosulfate

synthetic experiments were prepared with 18 2 mœâ cm milli q water the natural water was sand filtered water from a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in beijing the water matrixes are shown in table

low pressure mercury lamp 172 w emission spectrum in fig s1 the experiments using synthetic water were performed with 1 6 mg l ppcp ibp or npx and 0 3 mm oxidant nh2cl or naclo ten millimolar phosphate buffer was added to control the ph of the reaction solution to 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 to study the effects of the solution matrixes 2 8 mm hco3 or 2 8 mg l nom was mixed in the solution to make the results of this study applicable as references for other photoreactors the solution was sampled at the set uv dose instead of the set time one milliliter of solution was sampled each time then quenched immediately with 0 1 ml 200 mm na2s2o3 the sampling times for experiments involving uv irradiation were calculated according to the method reported by bolton and linde bolton and linden 2003 this method combines the uv irradiance at the surface is petri factor water factor divergence factor and reflection factor to calculate the correspondence between the sampling times and set uv dose under different experiment conditions for experiments in the dark direct oxidation without uv irradiation samples were collected at the same time interval as the corresponding aop process under the same experiment conditions oxidant 0 ph in section 3 2 and 3 3 the kinetics analysis is based on the sampling times the experiments using natural water were performed with 1 6 mg l ppcp ibp or npx and 0 3 mm oxidant nh2cl or naclo without adjusting the ph the sample collection followed the same protocol as described for the experiments with synthetic water additionally the solution was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm filter membrane before assaying all the samples were assayed within 24 h and every experiment was replicated independently at least two times the experiments on dbp formation were performed with 1 6 mg l ppcps ibp or npx and 0 3 mm oxidant nh2cl or naclo in synthetic water ph 7 with 10 mm phosphate buffer and natural water in aop experiments the solution was quenched immediately with na2s2o3 after uv irradiation at 500 mj cm2 in aop post chlor am ination experiments the solution was reacted in the dark for 24 h with residual chlor am ination after the aop 500 mj

hydroxide phosphate and nitrogenous reactions from previous literature table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of ppcps in the uv nh2cl process 3 1 1 degradation efficiency of ibp and npx the degradations of ibp and npx by nh2cl alone uv irradiation alone and the uv nh2cl process are shown in fig 1 based on the weak oxidizability of nh2cl the degradation of ibp and npx by direct oxidant is negligible ibp 3 and npx 1 furthermore only 9 16 of ibp was degraded by uv photolysis at 500 mj cm2 under the same conditions 16 36 of npx was degraded because the photolysis experiments were performed in deionized water without an oxidant the photodegradation of ibp and npx in this study almost exclusively originated from direct photolysis the photolysis rate is related to the properties and concentration of molecular and uv exposure chuang et al 2016 wols and hofman caris 2012 npx has a larger molar absorptivity and a lower quantum yield compared to ibp average parameters from previous studies are shown in table s2 under same uv irradiation but the theoretical photolysis rate equation shown in the photolysis part of table s5 of npx is larger than ibp thus the photodegradation of npx was faster as observed in the experiments in contrast both ibp and npx degraded fast in uv nh2cl process following pseudo fist order kinetics r2 0 97 as shown in fig 1 81 66 of ibp and 87 29 of npx were removed by uv nh2cl at 500 mj cm2 indicating a greater degree of efficiency compared with the use of nh2cl or uv irradiation the enhanced degradation of ppcps by uv nh2cl may be caused by the generation of reactive radicals detailed discussion in sections 3 2 and 3 3 3 1 2 effects of uv irradiance monochloramine dosage and ph the uv intensity is is an essential parameter having a marked effect on retention time and energy consumption in water treatment plants wang et al 2016 thus ibp and npx were degraded under different uv intensities is 0 3 or 1 0 mw cm2 to observe the effect of uv intensity as shown in fig 2 a b the degradation of the two ppcps did not differ under low and high uv intensities anova p ibp 0 88 0 05 p npx 0 93 0 05 suggesting that the production and quenching of radicals insignificantly differ within the range of is used in this study therefore a uv intensity of 1 0 mw cm2 was used in subsequent experiments the ph of water from dwtps usually ranges from 6 0 to 8 0 within this range the degradation of ppcps shows little ph dependence as shown in fig 2 c d according to anova all the p values for ibp are 0 94 and all p values of npx are 0 92 between different ph values since the pka value of ibp is 4 91 and the pka value of npx is 4 15 guo et al 2017 both ibp and npx have anionic forms at ph 6 0 8 0 the concentration of nh2cl remained steady at ph 6 0 8 0 the concentrations of nh2cl at different ph were calculated with a spectrophotometer method and the uv vis absorption spectrum is shown in fig s2 the minimal effect of ph on ppcp degradation indicates that the uv nh2cl process may be applied to different water sources the oxidant dosage is crucial to determine because it has both positive generation of more reactive radicals and negative consumption of reactive radicals by excess nh2cl and reactive radicals effects to degradation rate the reaction with increasing nh2cl dosage may be described by eqs 15 17 bu et al 2018 as the dosage of nh2cl increased from 0 15 mm to 0 75 mm kobs ibp the uv dose based kinetic constant increased evenly from 0 0029 to 0 0046 cm2 mj fig 2 e reflecting the benefit imparted by more reactive radicals from nh2cl in contrast kobs npx increased slowly from 0 3 mm to 0 75 mm fig 2 f because of excess nh2cl that competed for radicals with npx thus the dosage of nh2cl was set to 0 3 mm in this study 15 cl nh 2 cl nhcl cl h 16 cl 2 nh 2 cl nhcl 2 cl h 17 oh nh 2 cl nhcl h 2 o 3 1 3 effects of solution matrixes bicarbonate hco3 and nom are both common scavengers in natural water which react with radical species and thus negatively influence the degradation of ppcps wang et al 2016 thus the effect of different concentrations of hco3 0 8 mm and nom 0 8 mg l on the uv nh2cl process was investigated in this study fig 3 a b show that hco3 obviously inhibits the degradation of ibp and npx when the concentration of hco3 ranged from 0 mm to 8 mm the corresponding rate constant of ibp decreased from 0 0037 to 0 0018 cm2 mj and rate constant of npx decreased from 0 0044 to 0 0028 cm2 mj the inhibitory effect of hco3 is probably due to the consumption of radical species eqs 18 21 bu et al 2018 guo et al 2017 the hco3 reacts quickly with oh and cl with rate constants of 8 5 106 and 2 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively generating the co3 that has lower reaction rates towards ibp and npx kco3 ibp 7 9 105 m 1s 1 k co3 npx 5 6 107 m 1s 1 compared to oh guo et al 2017 based on sections 3 2 and 3 3 oh is the major radical involved in the ppcp degradation thus the transformation from oh to co3 may slow down the degradation 18 cl hco 3 co 3 cl h 19 oh hco 3 h 2 o co 3 20 cl 2 hco 3 co 3 2 cl h 21 nh 2 hco 3 nh 3 co 2 similarly the degradation rates of both ppcps decreased with the addition of nom fig 3 c d increasing the concentration of nom from 0 mg l to 8 mg l resulted in the corresponding decrease in the rate constants of ibp and npx from 0 0037 to 0 0007 cm2 mj and from 0 0044 to 0 0018 cm2 mj respectively nom reacts with oh and cl with rate constants of 2 5 104 mg l 1s 1 and 1 3 104 mg l 1s 1 respectively wu et al 2016 because the effect of absorption was excluded by the method for calculating uv dose in this study the inhibition of ppcp degradation based on the uv dose in fig 3 c d was attributed to the competitive effect of nom with radicals the inhibitory effects of hco3 and nom were also observed for other ppcps degraded by the uv nh2cl process bu et al 2018 3 2 reactive radicals in uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes a free radical contains an unpaired electron and can be identified by esr sundarapandiyan et al 2014 in this study a solution containing 0 75 mm oxidant was used to obtain stronger signals and the esr spectra were measured after 5 min of uv exposure although the ex situ experiment is not quantitative the result can be used to qualitatively determine principal radical species as shown in fig 4 a and c there was no signal of free radicals in the two dark processes indicating that the dark oxidant was not involved in radical reaction however different signals were observed in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes in previous studies a seven fold esr spectrum was observed when dmpo was oxidized to dmpox by rcs li et al 2016 s d stan 2003 sundarapandiyan et al 2014 a similar seven fold spectrum fig 4 d was observed in the uv naclo process in this study which can be attributed to the strong rcs in the uv naclo process based on previous studies guo et al 2017 2018 in contrast the characteristic spectrum of dmpo oh a four fold characteristic peak with an intensity of 1 2 2 1 ranguelova et al 2012 zhang et al 2018b was observed in uv nh2cl fig 4 b and the same spectrum was observed at ph values ranging from 6 0 to 8 0 fig s3 the different esr spectra indicates that uv nh2cl process has weaker rcs and a higher oh concentration than the uv naclo process to further study the reactive radicals in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes the data from kinetic modeling was shown in table 2 the oh and oxidant concentrations obtained in the model agreed with the data from the experiments oh shown in table 2 nh2cl varied among 3 3 naclo varied among 1 9 thus the information about radicals species and concentrations obtained from the model can be used as a reference to study the complex radicals in uv nh2cl and uv naclo the concentration of oh was higher in uv nh2cl than in the uv naclo according to the result of kinetic modeling and the experiments about the steady state radicals which was also observed in a previous model and experiment chuang et al 2017 as shown in table 2 the clo and clo2 concentrations in the uv naclo process were much higher both of these radicals can oxidize dmpo to dmpox ozawa et al 1996 sundarapandiyan et al 2014 which may result in the seven fold spectrum in uv naclo process higher oh and lower clo and clo 2 concentrations may explain the clear spectrum of dmpo oh shown in uv nh2cl process compared with the uv naclo process the result of esr and kinetic modeling illustrated the notable differences of radicals in uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes 3 3 comparison of uv nh2cl and uv naclo in synthetic and natural water 3 3 1 comparison in synthetic water in this study a widely reported method bu et al 2018 guo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 was used to determine the contributions of oh and rcs by adding nitrobenzene nb as the oh probe usually the probe is added to aop process without or with substrate in this study the probe was added to the aop ppcp process to better reflect the mechanism in actual degradation of different ppcps as the kinetic expression shows in eq 22 the degradation of ppcps in uv nh2cl is attributed to uv photolysis the direct oxidation of nh2cl and oxidation by radical species oh rcs and reactive nitrogen species rns 22 k ppcp k uv ppcp k nh 2 cl ppcp k oh ppcp k rcs ppcp k rns ppcp where k ppcp is the pseudo first order rate constant k uv ppcp k nh 2 cl ppcp k oh ppcp k rcs ppcp and k rns ppcp are the k values of ppcp degraded by uv photolysis nh2cl oh rcs and rns respectively the rate constants mentioned in section 3 3 1 are time based the contributions of nh2cl fig s4 was negligible thus eq 22 can be simplified as eq 23 23 k ppcp k uv ppcp k oh ppcp k rcs ppcp k rns ppcp 24 k oh ppcp k oh ppcp oh s s 25 k nb k oh nb oh s s the concentration of nb was chosen properly to bring as little influence on ppcp degradation as possible the effect 10 5 in this study data not shown and the pseudo first order rate constant of nb k nb was determined in this study fig s5 because nb has low reactivities with other radicals except for oh the second order rate constant k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1s 1 bu et al 2018 the degradation of nb is almost due to oh thus the steady state concentration of oh oh ss was obtained from eq 25 the values of k uv ppcp and kppcp were determined in this study fig s5 the k oh ppcp values of ibp and npx were obtained from previous studies guo et al 2017 2018 subsequently eqs 23 and 24 were solved unlike uv naclo oh in uv nh2cl process was not directly produced by photolysis of the added oxidant but by subsequent reactions table s5 however the higher oh concentration and weaker rcs were the important features of uv nh2cl compared with uv naclo section 3 2 in addition as shown in fig 5 the contribution of oh to ppcp degradation was notable for both ibp and npx in uv nh2cl which agreed with the result discussed in section 3 2 at a ph of 6 0 8 0 the nh2cl remains stable section 3 1 2 and no significant change of free radical conditions was showed in esr spectrum of uv nh2cl section 3 2 and fig s3 thus the degradation rates of ibp and npx as well as the contribution of different parts to ppcp degradation slightly varied at ph 6 0 8 0 although ibp is electron withdrawing and npx is electron donating guo et al 2018 oh always plays an important role section 3 2 and fig 5 and is nonselective which leads to an effective degradation of both two ppcps in uv nh2cl effective in uv naclo the method used to determine the contribution of different radicals uv irradiation and direct oxidation is described in text s1 and fig s6 the ppcp degradation both ibp and npx by the uv naclo process in synthetic water was more efficient in acidic solution because more hclo was generated at lower ph based on its pka value of 7 5 hclo has a higher quantum yield and smaller scavenging power for oh and rcs compared with clo guo et al 2017 pan et al 2018 fig 5 shows that in the uv naclo process oh is the main radical involved in the degradation of ibp at different ph values while rcs is the main radical involved in npx degradation in acidic solution the contribution of rcs to npx degradation increased from 24 at ph 8 to 68 at ph 6 and played an important role in the uv naclo process the rcs is highly reactive with electron donating groups such as oleflns and benzene derivatives guo et al 2017 and npx is electron donating and contains alkoxybenzenes guo et al 2018 the uv naclo has stronger rcs section 3 2 therefore the degradation rates and the main radicals of the two kinds of ppcps differed moreover the rate constant of npx degradation via naclo oxidation increased as ph decreased from 8 0 to 6 0 the degradation efficiency of ppcps in uv nh2cl showed little ph dependence while the degradation efficiency in uv naclo declined as ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the main contributive radical involved in ppcp degradation was always oh in the uv nh2cl process however main contributive radical involved in the uv naclo process depended on the ppcp involved and ph ibp was stably and efficiently degraded by uv nh2cl while the degradation of npx was notably faster in the uv naclo process because of its high reactivity to rcs 3 3 2 comparison in natural water the efficacy of uv nh2cl and uv naclo in degrading the target ppcps in natural water was investigated in degradation experiments conducted on sand filtered water from a dwtp water quality data is shown in table s3 the degradation of ibp and npx in natural water by uv nh2cl and uv naclo was inhibited and followed pseudo first order kinetics with the exception of the uv nh2cl process on npx fig s7 as shown in fig 6 a the degradation of ibp in natural water by uv nh2cl and uv naclo was comparable in contrast npx in natural water fig 6 b was degraded faster by uv naclo than by uv nh2cl similar to synthetic water fig 5 b the solution matrixes in natural water can compete free radicals and absorb uv irradiation the change of the absorbance was considered in the calculation of the uv dose the degradation of ppcps in uv nh2cl depended on the nonselective oh which can be consumed by dom and co3 2 hco3 kim et al 2009 thus an inhibitory effect of the solution matrixes on the uv nh2cl process was observed in synthetic water section 3 1 3 and natural water containing dom and hco3 at mg l levels table s3 with respect to uv naclo problems regarding the radical consumption and a lower degradation efficiency were observed under weakly alkaline conditions thus the degradation of ppcps in uv naclo was also inhibited in natural water 3 4 dbp formation and theoretical cytotoxicity of the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes to comprehensively explore dbp formation in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes 4 thms tcm bdcm cdbm tbm 9 haas mcaa mbaa dcaa tcaa bcaa bdcaa dbaa cdbaa tbaa and 6 n dbps tcan tcnm dcan tcp bcan dban were assayed in this study details in table 1 the concentration and yield of each dbp are both shown in following discussion to compare the absolute amount and generation ratio relative to ppcp removal of each generated dbp the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbps was also calculated to reveal potential health risks of the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes in natural water experiments using ibp or npx as the only carbon source in synthetic water were performed to investigate dbp formation from different kinds of ppcps electron withdrawing or electron donating and experiments under same conditions were also implemented on a mix of ppcp ibp or npx and natural water to explore the possible dbps formed in dwtps it is worth noting that there are background dbps present in natural water sand filtered water from a dwtp in beijing table s3 because of the use of pre chlorination to control algae in summer thus the dark experiments similar conditions as aop experiments but without uv exposure were conducted as control experiments in synthetic water the background dbps and the dark experiments were control experiments in natural water the dbp formation in natural water was complicated in this study which included the degradation of background dbps and the generation of new dbps from both nom and ppcps 3 4 1 thm formation tcm was the only thm formed from ibp and npx in synthetic water and the concentration of tcm was low 0 3 Œºg l under all conditions fig 7 a and b which indicates that ppcps are not likely to become precursors of thms in natural water bdcm was the major thm formed as shown in fig 7 a and b the concentration of bdcm varied a little in all experiments with nh2cl but increased in dark experiments with naclo since there were hardly any thms generated in synthetic water ppcp as the only carbon source the thm precursors in natural water a mix of nom and ppcp mostly came from nom experiments with natural water alone the bdcm varied among 15 in the experiments with nh2cl but tripled after 24 h dark experiments with naclo which agreed with the trend in fig 7 a and b in the uv nh2cl process as shown in fig 7 a and b the concentration of thm from ibp and npx in natural water decreased compared to background which may have been caused by the degradation of thms in uv nh2cl experiments with natural water alone the bdcm reduced by 13 7 in uv nh2cl during subsequent post chloramination after uv nh2cl thms from ibp in natural water increased to background level and thms from npx in natural water increased slightly higher than background level compared with the thms in aop or 24 h dark experiment alone the increased thms in post chloramination after uv nh2cl were not very obvious in the uv naclo process as shown in fig 7 a and b the concentration of thms from ibp and npx in natural water was higher than that in the uv nh2cl process during subsequent post chlorination the concentration of thms rose rapidly reaching more than twice the amount of the thms during post chloramination this was mainly due to the reactivity of chlorine the thms formed in naclo alone were much higher than nh2cl control experiments in fig 7 a and b which was also discovered decades ago wolfe et al 1984 besides a similar increase of thms during post chlorination after uv naclo was observed in another study that had also used natural water wang et al 2015 3 4 2 haa formation mcaa cdbaa tbaa were not detected under all conditions in this study as shown in fig 7 c and d in synthetic water dcaa was the major haa formed in the uv nh2cl process while dcaa and tcaa were the major haas formed in the uv naclo process this may be because of different radical reactions in uv nh2cl and uv naclo as discussion in section 3 2 and the haa concentration fig 7 c and d and haa yield shown in table s6 from npx were both higher than those from ibp in synthetic water since ppcp was the only carbon source this phenomenon may be explained by more sensitive reactivity between rcs and the electron donating group of npx guo et al 2017 the trend of total haa formation under different conditions was similar for ibp and npx in synthetic water therefore dbp formation from ibp and npx was discussed together next in the uv nh2cl process as shown in fig 7 c and d haa formation from ibp and npx increased compared to control experiments the same reaction time as aops and kept increasing during the subsequent 24 h period of post chloramination the haa concentration in uv nh2cl post chloramination was slightly lower than 24 h dark experiment which might be caused by nh2cl consumption table s6 in the uv naclo process as shown in fig 7 c and d haa formation from ibp and npx in synthetic water increased dramatically compared to the relevant control experiment the same reaction time as aops and more haas were generated than those from the uv nh2cl process moreover haa formation from ibp and npx continued to increase during the subsequent post chlorination after uv naclo the levels reached were much higher than during post chloramination the haa concentration in uv naclo post chlorination was even higher than the sum of haa concentration in uv naclo and 24 h dark experiment which might be because of the change of substrate after uv naclo as shown in table s6 haa yields in uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination were also higher than the respective yields from uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination the stronger rcs formed in uv naclo compared to that from uv nh2cl as discussed in section 3 2 may explain why haas were generated more easily in the uv naclo process in natural water as shown in fig 7 c and d the major haas in the uv nh2cl and uv naclo processes were both similar to the background and these consisted of dcaa tcaa mbaa and bcaa among these the concentration of bcaa remained almost unchanged during experiments in natural water in the uv nh2cl process as shown in fig 7 c and d the concentration of haas from ibp and npx in natural water even decreased slightly compared to the background which indicates that the rate of dbp degradation is higher than the rate of dbp generation in natural water which contains a mix of nom and ppcp during post chloramination after uv nh2cl the concentration of haas from ibp in natural water rose back to the background level but the concentration of haas from npx in natural water increased more rapidly in the uv naclo process as shown in fig 7 c and d the concentration of haas from ibp and npx in natural water increased compared to the background and was higher than that from the uv nh2cl process this may be explained by the stronger rcs reacting with electron rich moieties in nom and generating haa precursors sun et al 2019 during subsequent post chlorination after uv naclo the concentration of haas from ibp and npx in natural water continued to increase and reached a much higher level than that post chloramination especially tcaa since the haas in naclo and uv naclo were both larger than in nh2cl and uv nh2cl the similar rise of tcaa during post chlorination was also observed in synthetic water 3 4 3 n dbp formation the n dbps were measured in uv nh2cl in synthetic water and natural water and uv naclo only in natural water tcan was not detected under all conditions in synthetic water as shown in fig 7 e and f dcan and tcp were major n dbps in the uv nh2cl process in uv nh2cl process n dbp formation from ibp and npx increased compared to control experiments the same reaction time as aops especially n dbp formation from npx during post chloramination n dbp formation from ibp and npx continued to rise after uv nh2cl and higher than direct 24 h dark experiments moreover the n dbp formation and n dbp yield of npx in synthetic water were both higher than those from ibp which illustrates that npx was easier to be n dbp precursor than ibp in natural water as shown in fig 7 e and f tcnm dcan and tcp were major n dbps from a mixture of ibp and nom while tcnm dcan tcp and bcan were the major n dbps from a mixture of npx and nom in the uv nh2cl process the concentration of total n dbp concentration from ibp in natural water remained nearly unchanged compared to background however the specific n dbp species changed background tcnm was degraded and more dcan and tcp were generated from ibp and nom in natural water in the uv nh2cl process in the uv nh2cl process the concentration of total n dbp from npx in natural water especially dcan increased and exceeded the background value during subsequent post chloramination the concentration of total n dbp from ibp in natural water continued to increase after the uv nh2cl process with dcan and tcp increasing the most and the concentration of total n dbp especially dcan tcp and bcan from npx in natural water also increased during post chloramination after the uv nh2cl process tcp from ibp and npx in natural water trended to be formed in dark oxidation which was also observed in dark experiments with nh2cl in fig 7 e and f it is worth noting that dcan formation in natural water from ibp and npx during uv nh2cl or uv nh2cl post chloramination was lower than dcan formation in synthetic water at the same time ppcp removal was also lower in natural water section 3 3 furthermore the variation in trends of dcan formation in natural water from ibp and npx under uv nh2cl or uv nh2cl post chloramination was similar to that of dcan formation in synthetic water these two observations suggest that ppcp in natural water acting as a carbon resource may contribute more to dcan formation than nom under uv nh2cl or uv nh2cl post chloramination experiments with natural water alone the increment of dcan after uv nh2cl post chloramination was only 1 5 Œºg l another study has also found that dcan increases during chloramination of the antibiotic chloramphenicol after aop chu et al 2016 in natural water under uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination the n dbp concentration was higher than that under uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination the nitrogen containing in n dbps may come from both inorganic nitrogen and nitrogenous organic compounds liew et al 2016 shah et al 2011 ye et al 2018 moreover organic matter may change to become more hydrophobic under uv irradiation 254 nm which is likely to become precursors for hnms hu et al 2010 ye et al 2018 3 4 4 theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbp in natural water ppcps ibp and npx and nom both function as carbon resources which resulted in a wide variety and amount of dbps that have different degrees of toxicity thus a parameter dbp lc50 was used to calculate the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbps gao et al 2019 to comprehensively compare the potential toxicity of uv nh2cl and uv naclo in natural water table 1 as shown in fig s8 mbaa a kind of haas contributed most to theoretical cytotoxicity under all conditions and bcan also takes an important role in the degradation of npx under uv naclo and uv nh2cl post chloramination theoretical cytotoxicity continued to increase during subsequent post chlor am ination which is relevant to the risk of dbp formation in pipework it is worth noting that for both aop and aop post chlor am ination the calculated cytotoxicity under the naclo system is higher than that under the nh2cl system mainly because of mbaa in natural water the concentration of thms and n dbps from ibp or npx did not exceed the who standard for drinking water shown in table 1 under all conditions dark oxidation aop and aop post chlo ra mine for both nh2cl and naclo while dcaa a kind of haa was beyond the who standard in 1 condition with nh2cl npx uv nh2cl post chloramination and conditions with naclo ibp dark 24 h ibp uv naclo ibp uv naclo post chlorination npx dark 24 h npx uv naclo npx uv naclo post chlorination in natural water the ppcps in surface water were detected at ng l Œºg l concentrations worldwide liu and wong 2013 xu et al 2017 for mechanism research the dose of ppcps and oxidants used in this study was higher than dwtps thus the risk of dbps formed from ppcps by two aops in actual dwtps will be much smaller than this study the main aims of section 3 4 were 1 to investigate the subsequent generation of dbps after aops 2 to compare the dbp formation from uv nh2cl and uv naclo 3 to find the species of dbps needed focus though the mechanism of dbp formation needs further research this study generated the following important results 1 dbp formation increases during post chlor am ination especially post chlorination after uv naclo in natural water 2 uv nh2cl is associated with a smaller dbp risk in this study the concentration and yield of thms and haas from ibp and npx under the nh2cl system uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination were smaller than those from the naclo system uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination the concentration of n dbps and the theoretical cytotoxicity of total dbp from ibp and npx in natural water under the nh2cl system were also smaller than those from the naclo system 3 the formation of mbaa and dcaa should be paid special attention 4 conclusions under uv irradiation nh2cl generates cl and nh2 meanwhile oh is generated by subsequent reactions and plays the leading role in the degradation of electron withdrawing ibp and electron donating npx at different ph values 6 0 8 0 as an aop relying on oh uv nh2cl process has the following characteristics a nonselective oh is nonselective thus the uv nh2cl process efficiently degraded ibp and npx following pseudo first order kinetics which indicates that the uv nh2cl process can be applied to both electron donating and electron withdrawing ppcps however this may also result in the consumption of radicals by the water matrixes the degradation rate decreased with the increasing hco3 2 8 mm and nom 2 8 mg l concentrations the inhibition of the water matrixes was observed using sand filtered water thus uv nh2cl is more suitable to be placed at the end of the water treatment process to reduce interference from the matrixes and make use of residual nh2cl b little ph dependence the degradation of ibp and npx remains effective under different ph values 6 0 8 0 this range of ph caused little change in radical contributions with oh always functioning as the key radical the stability of ppcp degradation at different ph values suggests that uv nh2cl may be widely applicable for drinking water c low dbp risk the risk of dbp formation in the nh2cl system uv nh2cl and uv nh2cl post chloramination is smaller than that in the naclo system uv naclo and uv naclo post chlorination because of the higher oh concentration weaker rcs and characteristics of the oxidant the ppcp degradation during the uv nh2cl process differs from that during the uv naclo process comparison of degradation efficiency of ppcps in uv nh2cl and uv naclo clearly shows the low ph preference of uv naclo moreover the degradation rate and the contribution of radicals in the uv naclo process vary according to the ppcp the uv nh2cl process is not as selective as uv naclo and has little ph dependence and substrate dependence it is associated with a lower risk of dbp formation considering the dbps involved in this study although the degradation of other ppcps and the methods of controlling dbp formation should be involved in further studies this study combines probe experiments esr and kinetic modeling to study the mechanism of uv nh2cl and thoroughly compare uv nh2cl and uv naclo which provides comprehensive evidence in favor of uv nh2cl as a new drinking water

17809,vibration membrane filtration has been confirmed as an effective method to improve algae separation from water however the fouling evolution process and the antifouling mechanism are not well understood in this study a novel hybrid method based on a dynamics model was proposed a comprehensive evaluation was conducted and the critical vibration frequency for accurate analysis and prediction of membrane fouling was developed the dynamics model was studied with an improved collision attachment model by considering all the concurrent and synergistic effects of the hydrodynamic interactions acting on algae from the perspective of potential energy the improved model systematically elucidated the reason why the antifouling performance was enhanced when the vibration frequency varied from 1 hz to 5 hz in addition the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution grey relational analysis topsis gra method with combined weights was incorporated for the first time to provide direct comprehensive evaluation evidence to determine the effect of the vibration frequency on membrane fouling it was found that increasing the vibration frequency could not alleviate membrane fouling caused by extracellular organic matter moreover the concept of a critical vibration frequency was proposed using genetic algorithm optimized back propagation neural network and the energy consumption was analyzed this combination could provide an effective means to choose the most appropriate vibration frequency thereby improving the efficiency of the vibration membrane system in the algae separation process graphical abstract image 1 keywords vibration membrane algae separation dynamics model topsis gra critical vibration frequency 1 introduction in recent years harmful algal blooms habs have become one of the most challenging environmental issues causing a rapid deterioration of water quality in countries across the world jin et al 2019 smith and schindler 2009 the habs mainly form as a result of increasing anthropogenic activities such as agricultural activities which affect water quality and lead to a turbid and anoxic state in aquatic environments brooks et al 2016 meanwhile the frequency and intensity of algal blooms are rising gran√©li 2006 smith and schindler 2009 therefore an effective algae separation method is crucial to protect drinking water security over the past few decades membrane technology has been applied more frequently during the algae separation process owing to its economic efficiency and its benefit of emitting no secondary pollutants jiang et al 2018 wicaksana et al 2012 however during the separation process algae particles and extracellular organic matter eom have been detected greatly augmenting the possibility of membrane fouling which not only shortens the service life of the membrane but it also reduces the water flux and the algae separation efficiency zhao et al 2016 enhancing hydrodynamic conditions can alleviate membrane fouling results from algae suspensions by increasing the shear rate at the membrane surface liao et al 2018 zhang and fu 2018 vibration membranes have been observed to optimize transport conditions for improving membrane filtration performance and can lead to a decline in fouling because they can create a shear rate at the liquid membrane interface with high vibration frequencies or amplitudes kola et al 2014 pourbozorg et al 2016 moreover the shear force generated by the vibration membrane system only works within the range of 0 0 5 mm from the membrane surface which can protect algae cells from damage liao et al 2018 our previous study has also proven that vibration membranes exhibited excellent antifouling performance during algae separation processes zhao et al 2019 effective control of membrane fouling by a vibration membrane is contingent upon a thorough understanding of the membrane fouling mechanism the primary membrane fouling mechanism during the membrane filtration process involves blocking models foulant adhesion models cake filtration models and concentration polarization models huang et al 2008 teng et al 2020 xiong et al 2016 however these mechanisms cannot satisfactorily explain the membrane fouling phenomena due to the complex interactions between foulants and membranes during vibration membrane filtration although a variety of methods have been explored to characterize the vibration membrane fouling mechanism previous studies have mainly focused on force analysis particle image velocimetry piv technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulations pourbozorg et al 2016 zamani et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the analysis process during membrane filtration is always a highly simplified assumption or only the observation of the fluid appearance these analytical results still cannot adequately explain the membrane fouling mechanism in fact it is even possible to misinterpret the experimental phenomenon associated with the fouling process due to the existence of concentration polarization a mass transfer surface and an agglomeration of colloidal particles amokrane et al 2015 hoek and elimelech 2003 schafer et al 2010 recently a novel collision attachment method to simulate the dynamics of colloidal fouling when the colloid size was smaller than 100 nm was reported liu et al 2018 the model took the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction energy arising from the drag force exerted on colloidal particles into consideration and predicted the effect of the water flux and an energy barrier in governing colloidal fouling due to the micron size of algae the influence of hydrodynamic factors such as inertial lift and shear induced diffusion cannot be ignored thus a systematic study of the concurrent and synergistic effects of hydrodynamic interactions acting on algae is required a systematic assessment of membrane fouling performance of a vibration membrane system entails not only an accurate description of the membrane fouling mechanism but it also necessitates a comprehensive discussion of membrane fouling indicators commonly employed indicators for studying and characterizing membrane fouling performance mainly emphasize water flux rejection rate etc gao et al 2020 ghaemi and khodakarami 2019 in most cases there is a trade off between these characteristics when selecting the optimal membrane system operating conditions therefore it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of membrane fouling indicators to easily compare the impact of different membrane system operating conditions on the membrane fouling performance thereby determining the optimal operating conditions multiple criteria decision making mcdm is a process that finds the optimum selection among a series of viable selections garc√≠a cascales and lamata 2012 the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution grey relational analysis topsis gra method can be regarded as an effective mcdm method for sorting the experimental scheme and it seems to be more pertinent than other studied methods kuo et al 2008 shih et al 2007 wu 2002 in terms of the environment and energy the topsis gra method is mainly used for water quality evaluation and polymer electrolyte fuel cell material selection li et al 2013a 2018 shanian and savadogo 2006 to date no previous studies have solved membrane filtration condition selection problems using the topsis gra method the goal of the current study is to propose a novel accurate analysis and prediction method in algae separation by incorporating a vibration membrane herein an improved collision attachment model was developed to holistically consider the algae interface and hydrodynamic interactions without ignoring any hydrodynamic forces acting on algae furthermore the topsis gra method was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the fouling performance combining the improved collision attachment model with a mathematical method the membrane fouling performance was discussed in depth further genetic algorithm optimized back propagation neural network ga bp method was applied in order to predict membrane fouling furthermore the concept of critical vibration frequency was proposed and the energy consumption was analyzed to provide theoretical guidance for actual algae separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of algae in this study chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 9 the institute of hydrobiology at the chinese academy of sciences china was cultured with basal medium prepared in sterilized distilled water with 1 g l of glucose in an incubator the cultivation temperature was kept at 30 0 5 c with cycles of 12 h light light intensity was 127 Œºmol m2 s and 12 h darkness the flasks were manually shaken twice per day in order to avoid sedimentation of the algae zhao et al 2017 2 2 filtration test a uniform shearing vibration membrane system was applied to unravel the effect of

vibration membrane system set up is shown in fig s1 the test tank had a working volume of 9 0 l the polyether sulfone pes flat membrane guochu china module nominal pore size of 0 05 Œºm effective filtration area of 0 021 m2 was attached onto a holding bracket before the filtration test the clean membranes were immersed in deionized water for 12 h to remove chemicals from the membrane surfaces during the filtration experiment the vibrations were conducted at a constant transmembrane pressure of 12 kpa according to the critical flux of the membrane by pouring the filtrate into the filtration tank the algae concentration in the tank was maintained at approximately 0 8 g l during the filtration process 2 3 characterization of membranes and foulants the eom solution was obtained by the centrifugation method zhao et al 2018 the content of proteins and polysaccharides were examined via the modified lowry method and the anthrone sulfuric acid method respectively zhao et al 2017 total

rinsed with ultrapure water and subsequently freeze dried heto powerdry ll 3000 gene for membrane fouling analysis 2 4 topsis gra method the evaluation indicators of membrane fouling could reflect the influence of different vibration frequencies on membrane fouling but different frequencies could exhibit different influences on the membrane performance therefore it was difficult to analyze the influence of vibration frequencies on membrane fouling directly through the experimental data the topsis gra method can be applied to comprehensively analyze the membrane fouling performance in this study the antifouling performance of the vibration membrane at different frequencies can be expressed by a relative closeness degree which represents the degree to which the alternative vibration condition is close to the ideal condition the specific calculation process for determining the relative closeness degree according to the topsis gra method was determined based on a previous study tripathy and tripathy 2016 the larger the relative closeness degree i e the shorter the distance from the ideal vibration condition the better the antifouling performance of the vibration membrane meanwhile the subjective weighting method and the objective weighting method were combined to calculate the weight of each index of the membrane fouling which was implemented in order to overcome the one sidedness of single weighting in this study the delphi method and entropy weight method were used as the subjective weight and objective weight to determine the weight of various membrane fouling indicators as shown in tables s1 and a comprehensive evaluation model of the improved topsis method was established based on gra frankenberger et al 2019 li et al 2011 sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 the procedures for conducting the calculations are displayed in fig s2 wu x 2018 2 5 statistical analysis the software spss for mathematical statistics was applied to calculate the mean and standard error of three independent experiments the software matlab r2019a was applied to solve the complex double integrals using the surface element integration sei method fit parameters by the least squares method and predict the water flux based on genetic algorithm optimized back propagation neural network ga bp supporting information s1 3 theoretical analysis 3 1 thermodynamic model for interaction energy during membrane filtration the thermodynamic interactions between algae particles and the membrane surface were primarily judged by extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory

position relationship between the foulant particle and the membrane surface is shown in fig s3 3 2 improved collision attachment model the original version of the collision attachment model could not accurately explain this experimental phenomenon due to this model neglecting the existence of hydrodynamic forces such as the inertial lift and shear induced diffusion liu et al 2018 in this study the improved collision attachment model took all the concurrent and synergistic effects of the hydrodynamic forces into account which could explain the experimental phenomena more comprehensively the specific derivation process is as follows during the algae separation process the rate of algae particle deposition onto a membrane surface can be expressed by the following equation liu et al 2018 5 d m f d t Œ± a j c m 6 Œ± a n 1 n 1 n 2 where m f is the mass of foulants deposited on the membrane surface t is the filtration time j is the permeation flux c m is the concentration of foulants near the membrane surface Œ± a is the attachment coefficient n 1 is the colloidal particles attached to a membrane surface n 2 is the free colloidal particles in the solution in accordance with the boltzmann equation the relationship between n 1 and n 2 can be expressed as follows valioulis and list 1984 7 n 1 n 2 exp Œ¥ e b Œ¥ e d k b t where Œ¥e b and Œ¥e d are the potential energy barrier and the total potential energy of hydrodynamic interaction respectively k b 1 38 10 23j k is the boltzmann s constant t 298 15k is the absolute temperature Œ¥e b is not only strongly dependent on the nature of the particles and membranes but it is also dependent on the solution chemistry the value of Œ¥e b can be calculated by equations 1 4 Œ¥e d arises from the interaction of total hydrodynamic forces in this study Œ¥e d can be expressed as follows 8 Œ¥ e d e d g e o t f d g f o t l d where edg and eot are the potential energy of the permeate drag force f dg supporting information s3 and the combined hydrodynamic forces excluding the drag force f ot which includes the inertial lift shear induced diffusion brownian diffusion and colloidal interactions respectively kang 2004 wiesner 1989 a schematic diagram depicting the force analysis of algae particles is displayed in fig s4 ld is the relative displacement of the algae particles under the influence of hydrodynamic forces substituting

j k p combining equation 9 with darcy s law the potential energy arising from hydrodynamic forces can be calculated by the least squares method and the relative displacement can also be obtained accordingly liu et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic and interfacial interaction 4 1 1 hydrodynamic forces acting on algae the hydrodynamic force can carry algae particles to the vicinity of the membrane surface in the uniform shearing vibration membrane system the f dg and inertial lift force f il supporting information s3 play major roles kang et al 2004 wiesner et al 1989 fig 1 shows the hydrodynamic forces on algae over a filtration time of 10 h ranging from 1 hz to 5 hz remarkably a nearly identical force behavior was observed at both f tot and f dg fig 1a meanwhile f il fig 1b increased as the vibration frequency increased and it was much higher than f dg thus alleviating membrane fouling as demonstrated in the variation of the flux fig 2 throughout the entire frequency range f il was much higher than f dg and f ot was markedly low the primary reasons attributed to this result may have been twofold 1 there was great energy dissipation during the vibration process 2 the strong attraction table s2 between algae cells made it possible for algae to aggregate in a dense pattern furthermore proper vibration could enhance the collision frequency between microparticles thereby promoting algae to form larger aggregates and become heavier enfrin et al 2019 4 1 2 hydrodynamic interaction energies acting on algae the hydrodynamic interaction energies were determined for vibration filtration conditions and the results are plotted in fig 3 Œ¥ed and edg exhibited similar variation trends fig 3a which forcefully relied on the variation of the water flux fig 2b for example within 100 min of filtration Œ¥ed sharply declined at frequencies of 1 hz and 2 hz from 100 to 200 min of filtration the Œ¥ed of 1 hz and 2 hz slowly declined and then afterwards remained relatively stable conversely the decline of Œ¥ed was relatively mild as the frequency varied from 3 hz to 5 hz during the first 100 min of filtration the Œ¥ed decreased rapidly and then it remained stable after a period of time clearly after 10 h filtration the Œ¥ed increased as the vibration frequency increased fig 3a which is the result of the combined effect between edg and eot this phenomenon seemed to contradict previous studies which documented that as the frequency increased membrane fouling dropped off zhao et al 2017 however a higher vibration frequency led to a shorter relative distance directed to the membrane surface inset of fig 3a and a more stabilized water flux fig 2b this study emphasized that as the vibration frequency increased f tot became larger and the relative distance between algae under the effect of f tot during a certain period of time should also theoretically increase the reason explaining the inverse relationship between hydrodynamic forces and relative distance may be as follows 1 the increase of the vibration frequency led to an increase in the shear rate so the shear action time on the algae particles became shorter and the shearing frequency was enhanced therefore increasing the vibration frequency could prevent the migration of the algae particles to the membrane surface but the relative distance decreased 2 the increase of the vibration frequency resulted in the enhancement of eot values fig 3b leading to an increase of more than 1 order of magnitude from 1 60 kbt to 15 86 kbt which was dominated by f il the value of eot was much less than the energies that arose from the initial lift force eil fig 3b demonstrating that there were other factors influencing the potential energy change which proved the rationality of the improved collision attachment model to further explore the effect of increasing the vibration frequency on reducing membrane fouling the deposition of algae particles was visualized fig s5 the results displayed that as the vibration frequency increased the deposition of algae particles declined which sufficiently confirmed the aforementioned finding that when the vibration frequency increased from 1 hz to 5 hz the chance of particles depositing on the membrane surface decreased 4 1 3 interfacial interaction between algae and the membrane surface initial adhesion of algae particles was brought about by interfacial interactions which determined whether or not algae particles could fasten to the membrane surface this was dictated by the physicochemical properties of algae cells and the membrane surface wang et al 2005 the Œ¥eb between algae particles and the rough membrane surface is shown in fig s6a as the algae particles approached the surface of the membrane they could only adhere to the membrane surface by having enough energy to overcome the repulsive energy barrier generated between the membrane and algae ding et al 2013 the Œ¥eb was in the order of 0 23 0 44 0 45 0 23 and 0 07 kbt for the new membrane and the membranes vibrating at frequencies of 0 1 3 and 5 hz after filtration for 10 h respectively the results showed that the new pes membrane was slightly resistant to membrane fouling however after membrane filtration at a frequency range of 1 hz 5 hz algae particles were attracted to the membrane surface table s2 indicating that increasing the vibration frequency could slow down but could not eliminate membrane fouling drawing a comparison between the Œ¥eb and Œ¥ed value fig s6a and fig 3a the Œ¥ed value was much larger than that of the Œ¥eb value which could not be ignored therefore the overarching goal of membrane fouling control was to determine the appropriate hydrodynamic interaction and prevent the adsorption of algae to the membrane surface 4 2 comprehensive evaluation of membrane fouling reasonable selection of indicators for evaluating membrane fouling was the basis for comprehensive evaluation the evaluation indicators for total reversible and irreversible membrane fouling at different vibration frequencies were discussed total fouling had eight evaluation indicators reversible fouling had five evaluation indicators and irreversible fouling had four evaluation indicators these evaluation indicators were interrelated and closely dependent on each other the framework of typical membrane fouling indicators resulting from the vibration frequency analyzed by the topsis gra method was conducted and it is illustrated in fig s7 measured values of evaluation indicators are displayed in table s3 by applying the topsis gra method the extent to which the vibration frequency affected membrane fouling could be clearly explained as depicted in fig 4 the larger the relative closeness value the better the antifouling performance comprehensive consideration of the impact of total fouling on the vibration frequency is displayed in fig 4a as the vibration frequency increased the relative closeness degree for total fouling also increased the result indicated that the higher the vibration frequency the lower the total membrane fouling degree which was consistent with the variation of the total membrane resistance fig s8 specifically there was a shorter relative closeness at higher vibration frequencies fig 4b indicating the declining resistance to reversible fouling interestingly the mass of algae deposition accounting for a higher proportion in reversible fouling weight table s1 declined as the vibration frequency increased it was reasonable to assume that increasing the vibration frequency could alleviate the deposition of large algae particles but it had almost no impact on relieving reversible eom on the one hand due to the little effect of shear action on macromolecules and the shorter relative displacement of algae associated with the vibration frequency inset of fig 3a the chance of eom attaching to the membrane surface is relatively high on the other hand the higher vibration frequency can compact and disrupt the algae cake layer causing algal cells to release more eom table s4 in contrast to the relative closeness for reversible fouling the relative closeness degree for irreversible fouling went up as the vibration frequency increased fig 4c this result showed that a higher vibration frequency exhibited a better anti irreversible fouling performance it could be inferred that concentration polarization on the membrane surface may prevent eom from entering the membrane pore based on the topsis gra analysis the higher the vibration frequency the less prevalent the total and irreversible membrane fouling but the more prevalent the reversible fouling in addition increasing the vibration frequency could reduce the irreversible eom but it had no positive effect on the reversible eom at the same vibration frequency the concentration of reversible eom was much higher than that of irreversible eom table s3 therefore in general increasing the vibration frequency could not reduce the eom concentration 4 3 theoretical prediction of membrane fouling it was assumed that the flow field was laminar under all conditions based on the reynolds number supporting information s7 the simulated water fluxes across the membrane as the vibration frequency ranged from 0 hz to 18 hz were evaluated fig 2a and b the incremental changes in the simulated water flux were substantially increased when the vibration frequency was lower than 8 hz j f 1 j f j f 5 j f and j f 1 represent the water flux versus vibration frequency but it became relatively small at higher vibration frequencies j f 1 j f j f 5 this may be attributed to two aspects 1 the rise in f il inset of fig 5 a as the vibration frequency increased prevented the deposition of algae on the membrane but it had negligible effects on the adhesion of eom 2 higher vibration frequencies can compact the cake layer into a more tense structure thereby restraining water transport the result was consistent with the above topsis gra analysis according to the simulation results it is reasonable to assume that there may exist a critical vibration frequency for a particular membrane system above which the water flux remained stable and membrane fouling was not prevalent the concurrent impact of the various forces on algae at different vibration frequencies from 1 hz to 18 hz was also demonstrated fig 5a both f dg and f ot rose steadily as the vibration frequency increased mainly because of the larger water flux and f il at the higher vibration frequencies as for f tot the value of f tot grew at frequencies lower than 8 hz but the value subsequently dropped at higher frequencies to illustrate the effect of the vibration frequency on f tot the incremental changes of predictive forces as a function of vibration frequency were evaluated fig 6 a a higher vibration frequency resulted in a reduced rate of increase of f dg but a higher rate of increase of f ot this effect was particularly evident for frequencies higher than 7 hz at this point the rate of increase of f ot exceeded that of f dg this could be attributed to the rapid rise of f il inset of fig 6a and the slight increase of the water flux above 7 hz fig 2a notably f tot was always negative and in the same direction as f dg which indicated that membrane fouling could only be alleviated but not eliminated under the predicted vibration condition due to the existence of eom this result may have a few implications 1 within the predicted frequency range unfavorable factors attractive interactions predominated and contaminated the membrane during filtration 2 during the vibration process shear action only acted on the membrane surface resulting in too low of an overall utilization rate of the vibration energy the effects also evidenced the reason why the predicted water flux barely increased as the vibration frequency increased fig 2a and b moreover according to the simulation results if the vibration frequency continued to increase to a value larger than 18 hz two results may be speculated to occur 1 the hydrodynamic resultant force on the algae particles would be zero in other words equilibrium would be achieved and no deposition of algae particles on the membrane surface would occur 2 due to the effects associated with eom the hydrodynamic resultant force on the algae particles would not be zero in other words equilibrium would never be reached but would only be approached a prediction of the hydrodynamic interaction energies of algae was subsequently conducted fig 5b the Œ¥ed of algae particles notably increased at the beginning then decreased slightly and gradually stabilized peaking at 6 hz fig 5b due to a combination of edg and eot from the result it could be inferred that the critical frequency could be reached when Œ¥ed no longer changed the incremental changes of the predictive potential energies of edg and eot were also analyzed it was clear that the incremental changes of the predictive potential energies initially decreased and then finally increased for both of the cases fig 6b above 7 hz the increase rate of eot was higher than that of edg mainly due to the large rate of increase associated with eil inset of fig 6b from fig 6 it could be seen that 7 hz was a key point beyond which the rate of increase of the favorable force repulsive interaction and potential energy were higher than that of the unfavorable forces indicating that the system kept approaching a reduction in membrane fouling taking the energy consumption into consideration fig s9 both the total power and specific energy exhibited a power law relationship as the vibration frequency varied from 0 hz to 18 hz an increase of the vibration frequency would increase the energy consumption of this membrane system for the highest predicted vibration frequency of 18 hz the total power was evaluated to be 5 4 w and the specific energy was 6 55 kwh m3 for permeate fluxes of 39 lmh 1 08e 5 m s a previous liner vibration system reported an energy consumption of 16 6 w for permeate fluxes of 30 lmh with a vibration frequency of 10 hz and an amplitude of 0 8 cm li et al 2013b energy consumption of this uniform vibration system was still very low thus the uniform vibration system had merits in reducing operating energy consumption but if the vibration frequency was too high the energy consumption would still increase therefore appropriately increasing the vibration frequency larger than 7 hz was conducive to enhancing membrane antifouling performance and saving energy 5 conclusions in this study the effects of vibration frequency on membrane fouling during the algae separation process were investigated using a novel hybrid method based on the elucidation of a dynamics model the conduction of a comprehensive evaluation and determination of the critical vibration frequency the key findings were as follows the hydrodynamic and interfacial interactions were investigated by an improved collision attachment model and thermodynamic model respectively the results illustrated that increasing the vibration frequency from 1 hz to 5 hz could reduce membrane fouling moreover it was also found that the Œ¥eb value was much lower than that of Œ¥ed suggesting the importance of controlling hydrodynamic interactions membrane fouling indexes were comprehensively evaluated by the topsis gra method with combined weights the results showed that a higher vibration frequency could effectively alleviate total membrane fouling and irreversible fouling but it could not reduce reversible fouling moreover it was also found that increasing the vibration frequency could not prevent eom from fouling the membrane prediction of the water flux and fouling mechanism were regulated by the ga bp method the results showed that there may exist a critical vibration frequency related to Œ¥ed and beyond 7 hz the vibration system could keep approaching the trend of alleviating membrane fouling the variation of energy consumption showed that the increase of the vibration frequency would lead to a higher energy consumption combining the critical vibration frequency with energy consumption could be a useful tool to plan for membrane fouling in advance thereby improving the efficiency of algae separation by vibration membranes

17809,vibration membrane filtration has been confirmed as an effective method to improve algae separation from water however the fouling evolution process and the antifouling mechanism are not well understood in this study a novel hybrid method based on a dynamics model was proposed a comprehensive evaluation was conducted and the critical vibration frequency for accurate analysis and prediction of membrane fouling was developed the dynamics model was studied with an improved collision attachment model by considering all the concurrent and synergistic effects of the hydrodynamic interactions acting on algae from the perspective of potential energy the improved model systematically elucidated the reason why the antifouling performance was enhanced when the vibration frequency varied from 1 hz to 5 hz in addition the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution grey relational analysis topsis gra method with combined weights was incorporated for the first time to provide direct comprehensive evaluation evidence to determine the effect of the vibration frequency on membrane fouling it was found that increasing the vibration frequency could not alleviate membrane fouling caused by extracellular organic matter moreover the concept of a critical vibration frequency was proposed using genetic algorithm optimized back propagation neural network and the energy consumption was analyzed this combination could provide an effective means to choose the most appropriate vibration frequency thereby improving the efficiency of the vibration membrane system in the algae separation process graphical abstract image 1 keywords vibration membrane algae separation dynamics model topsis gra critical vibration frequency 1 introduction in recent years harmful algal blooms habs have become one of the most challenging environmental issues causing a rapid deterioration of water quality in countries across the world jin et al 2019 smith and schindler 2009 the habs mainly form as a result of increasing anthropogenic activities such as agricultural activities which affect water quality and lead to a turbid and anoxic state in aquatic environments brooks et al 2016 meanwhile the frequency and intensity of algal blooms are rising gran√©li 2006 smith and schindler 2009 therefore an effective algae separation method is crucial to protect drinking water security over the past few decades membrane technology has been applied more frequently during the algae separation process owing to its economic efficiency and its benefit of emitting no secondary pollutants jiang et al 2018 wicaksana et al 2012 however during the separation process algae particles and extracellular organic matter eom have been detected greatly augmenting the possibility of membrane fouling which not only shortens the service life of the membrane but it also reduces the water flux and the algae separation efficiency zhao et al 2016 enhancing hydrodynamic conditions can alleviate membrane fouling results from algae suspensions by increasing the shear rate at the membrane surface liao et al 2018 zhang and fu 2018 vibration membranes have been observed to optimize transport conditions for improving membrane filtration performance and can lead to a decline in fouling because they can create a shear rate at the liquid membrane interface with high vibration frequencies or amplitudes kola et al 2014 pourbozorg et al 2016 moreover the shear force generated by the vibration membrane system only works within the range of 0 0 5 mm from the membrane surface which can protect algae cells from damage liao et al 2018 our previous study has also proven that vibration membranes exhibited excellent antifouling performance during algae separation processes zhao et al 2019 effective control of membrane fouling by a vibration membrane is contingent upon a thorough understanding of the membrane fouling mechanism the primary membrane fouling mechanism during the membrane filtration process involves blocking models foulant adhesion models cake filtration models and concentration polarization models huang et al 2008 teng et al 2020 xiong et al 2016 however these mechanisms cannot satisfactorily explain the membrane fouling phenomena due to the complex interactions between foulants and membranes during vibration membrane filtration although a variety of methods have been explored to characterize the vibration membrane fouling mechanism previous studies have mainly focused on force analysis particle image velocimetry piv technology and computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulations pourbozorg et al 2016 zamani et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the analysis process during membrane filtration is always a highly simplified assumption or only the observation of the fluid appearance these analytical results still cannot adequately explain the membrane fouling mechanism in fact it is even possible to misinterpret the experimental phenomenon associated with the fouling process due to the existence of concentration polarization a mass transfer surface and an agglomeration of colloidal particles amokrane et al 2015 hoek and elimelech 2003 schafer et al 2010 recently a novel collision attachment method to simulate the dynamics of colloidal fouling when the colloid size was smaller than 100 nm was reported liu et al 2018 the model took the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction energy arising from the drag force exerted on colloidal particles into consideration and predicted the effect of the water flux and an energy barrier in governing colloidal fouling due to the micron size of algae the influence of hydrodynamic factors such as inertial lift and shear induced diffusion cannot be ignored thus a systematic study of the concurrent and synergistic effects of hydrodynamic interactions acting on algae is required a systematic assessment of membrane fouling performance of a vibration membrane system entails not only an accurate description of the membrane fouling mechanism but it also necessitates a comprehensive discussion of membrane fouling indicators commonly employed indicators for studying and characterizing membrane fouling performance mainly emphasize water flux rejection rate etc gao et al 2020 ghaemi and khodakarami 2019 in most cases there is a trade off between these characteristics when selecting the optimal membrane system operating conditions therefore it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of membrane fouling indicators to easily compare the impact of different membrane system operating conditions on the membrane fouling performance thereby determining the optimal operating conditions multiple criteria decision making mcdm is a process that finds the optimum selection among

effective mcdm method for sorting the experimental scheme and it seems to be more pertinent than other studied methods kuo et al 2008 shih et al 2007 wu 2002 in terms of the environment and energy the topsis gra method is mainly used for water quality evaluation and polymer electrolyte fuel cell material selection li et al 2013a 2018 shanian and savadogo 2006 to date no previous studies have solved membrane filtration condition selection problems using the topsis gra method the goal of the current study is to propose a novel accurate analysis and prediction method in algae separation by incorporating a vibration membrane herein an improved collision attachment model was developed to holistically consider the algae interface and hydrodynamic interactions without ignoring any hydrodynamic forces acting on algae furthermore the topsis gra method was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the fouling performance combining the improved collision attachment model with a mathematical method the membrane fouling performance was discussed in depth further genetic algorithm optimized back propagation neural network ga bp method was applied in order to predict membrane fouling furthermore the concept of critical vibration frequency was proposed and the energy consumption was analyzed to provide theoretical guidance for actual algae separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of algae in this study chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 9 the institute of hydrobiology at the chinese academy of sciences china was cultured with basal medium prepared in sterilized distilled water with 1 g l of glucose in an incubator the cultivation temperature was kept at 30 0 5 c with cycles of 12 h light light intensity was 127 Œºmol m2 s and 12 h darkness the flasks were manually shaken twice per day in order to avoid sedimentation of the algae zhao et al 2017 2 2 filtration test a uniform shearing vibration membrane system was applied to unravel the effect of

vibration membrane system set up is shown in fig s1 the test tank had a working volume of 9 0 l the polyether sulfone pes flat membrane guochu china module nominal pore size of 0 05 Œºm effective filtration area of 0 021 m2 was attached onto a holding bracket before the filtration test the clean membranes were immersed in deionized water for 12 h to remove chemicals from the membrane surfaces during the filtration experiment the vibrations were conducted at a constant transmembrane pressure of 12 kpa according to the critical flux of the membrane by pouring the filtrate into the filtration tank the algae concentration in the tank was maintained at approximately 0 8 g l during the filtration process 2 3 characterization of membranes and foulants the eom solution was obtained by the centrifugation method zhao et al 2018 the content of proteins and polysaccharides were examined via the modified lowry method and the anthrone sulfuric acid method respectively zhao et al 2017 total

rinsed with ultrapure water and subsequently freeze dried heto powerdry ll 3000 gene for membrane fouling analysis 2 4 topsis gra method the evaluation indicators of membrane fouling could reflect the influence of different vibration frequencies on membrane fouling but different frequencies could exhibit different influences on the membrane performance therefore it was difficult to analyze the influence of vibration frequencies on membrane fouling directly through the experimental data the topsis gra method can be applied to comprehensively analyze the membrane fouling performance in this study the antifouling performance of the vibration membrane at different frequencies can be expressed by a relative closeness degree which represents the degree to which the alternative vibration condition is close to the ideal condition the specific calculation process for determining the relative closeness degree according to the topsis gra method was determined based on a previous study tripathy and tripathy 2016 the larger the relative closeness degree i e the shorter the distance from the ideal vibration condition the better the antifouling performance of the vibration membrane meanwhile the subjective weighting method and the objective weighting method were combined to calculate the weight of each index of the membrane fouling which was implemented in order to overcome the one sidedness of single weighting in this study the delphi method and entropy weight method were used as the subjective weight and objective weight to determine the weight of various membrane fouling indicators as shown in tables s1 and a comprehensive evaluation model of the improved topsis method was established based on gra frankenberger et al 2019 li et al 2011 sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 the procedures for conducting the calculations are displayed in fig s2 wu x 2018 2 5 statistical analysis the software spss for mathematical statistics was applied to calculate the mean and standard

position relationship between the foulant particle and the membrane surface is shown in fig s3 3 2 improved collision attachment model the original version of the collision attachment model could not accurately explain this experimental phenomenon due to this model neglecting the existence of hydrodynamic forces such as the inertial lift and shear induced diffusion liu et al 2018 in this study the improved collision attachment model took all the concurrent and synergistic effects of the hydrodynamic forces into account which could explain the experimental phenomena more comprehensively the specific derivation process is as follows during the algae separation process the rate of algae particle deposition onto a membrane surface can be expressed by the following equation liu et al 2018 5 d m f d t Œ± a j c m 6 Œ± a n 1 n 1 n 2 where m f is the mass of foulants deposited on the membrane surface t is the filtration time j is the permeation flux c m is the concentration of foulants near the membrane surface Œ± a is the attachment coefficient n 1 is the colloidal particles attached to a membrane surface n 2 is the free colloidal particles in the solution in accordance with the boltzmann equation the relationship between n 1 and n 2 can be expressed as follows valioulis and list 1984 7 n 1 n 2 exp Œ¥ e b Œ¥ e d k b t where Œ¥e b and Œ¥e d are the potential energy barrier and the total potential energy of hydrodynamic interaction respectively k b 1 38 10 23j k is the boltzmann s constant t 298 15k is the absolute temperature Œ¥e b is not only strongly dependent on the nature of the particles and membranes but it is also dependent on the solution chemistry the value of Œ¥e b can be calculated by equations 1 4 Œ¥e d arises from the interaction of total hydrodynamic forces in this study Œ¥e d can be expressed as follows 8 Œ¥ e d e d g e o t f d g f o t l d where edg and eot are the potential energy of the permeate drag force f dg supporting information s3 and the

j k p combining equation 9 with darcy s law the potential energy arising from hydrodynamic forces can be calculated by the least squares method and the relative displacement can also be obtained accordingly liu et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic and interfacial interaction 4 1 1 hydrodynamic forces acting on algae the hydrodynamic force can carry algae particles to the vicinity of the membrane surface in the uniform shearing vibration membrane system the f dg and inertial lift force f il supporting information s3 play major roles kang et al 2004 wiesner et al 1989 fig 1 shows the hydrodynamic forces on algae over a filtration time of 10 h ranging from 1 hz to 5 hz remarkably a nearly identical force behavior was observed at both f tot and f dg fig 1a meanwhile f il fig 1b increased as the vibration frequency increased and it was much higher than f dg thus alleviating membrane fouling as demonstrated in the variation of the flux fig 2 throughout the entire frequency range f il was much higher than f dg and f ot was markedly low the primary reasons attributed to this result may have been twofold 1 there was great energy dissipation during the vibration process 2 the strong attraction table s2 between algae cells made it possible for algae to aggregate in a dense pattern furthermore proper vibration could enhance the collision frequency between microparticles thereby promoting algae to form larger aggregates and become heavier enfrin et al 2019 4 1 2 hydrodynamic interaction energies acting on algae the hydrodynamic interaction energies were determined for vibration filtration conditions and the results are plotted in fig 3 Œ¥ed and edg exhibited similar variation trends fig 3a which forcefully relied on the variation of the water flux fig 2b for example within 100 min of filtration Œ¥ed sharply declined at frequencies of 1 hz and 2 hz from 100 to 200 min of filtration the Œ¥ed of 1 hz and 2 hz slowly declined and then afterwards remained relatively stable conversely the decline of Œ¥ed was relatively mild as the frequency varied from 3 hz to 5 hz during the first 100 min of filtration the Œ¥ed decreased rapidly and then it remained stable after a period of time clearly after 10 h filtration the Œ¥ed increased as the vibration frequency increased fig 3a which is the result of the combined effect between edg and eot this phenomenon seemed to contradict previous studies which documented that as the frequency increased membrane fouling dropped off zhao et al 2017 however a higher vibration frequency led to a shorter relative distance directed to the membrane surface inset of fig 3a and a more stabilized water flux fig 2b this study emphasized that as the vibration frequency increased f tot became larger and the relative distance between algae under the effect of f tot during a certain period of time should also theoretically increase the reason explaining the inverse relationship between hydrodynamic forces and relative distance may be as follows 1 the increase of the vibration frequency led to an increase in the shear rate so the shear action time on the algae particles became shorter and the shearing frequency was enhanced therefore increasing the vibration frequency could prevent the migration of the algae particles to the membrane surface but the relative distance decreased 2 the increase of the vibration frequency resulted in the enhancement of eot values fig 3b leading to an increase of more than 1 order of magnitude from 1 60 kbt to 15 86 kbt which was dominated by f il the value of eot was much less than the energies that arose from the initial lift force eil fig 3b demonstrating that there were other factors influencing the potential energy change which proved the rationality of the improved collision attachment model to further explore the effect of increasing the vibration frequency on reducing membrane fouling the deposition of algae particles was visualized fig s5 the results displayed that as the vibration frequency increased the deposition of algae particles declined which sufficiently confirmed the aforementioned finding that when the vibration frequency increased from 1 hz to 5 hz the chance of particles depositing on the membrane surface decreased 4 1 3 interfacial interaction between algae and the membrane surface initial adhesion of algae particles was brought about by interfacial interactions which determined whether or not algae particles could fasten to the membrane surface this was dictated by the physicochemical properties of algae cells and the membrane surface wang et al 2005 the Œ¥eb between algae particles and the rough membrane surface is shown in fig s6a as the algae particles approached the surface of the membrane they could only adhere to the membrane surface by having enough energy to overcome the repulsive energy barrier generated between the membrane and algae ding et al 2013 the Œ¥eb was in the order of 0 23 0 44 0 45 0 23 and 0 07 kbt for the new membrane and the membranes vibrating at frequencies of 0 1 3 and 5 hz after filtration for 10 h respectively the results showed that the new pes membrane was slightly resistant to membrane fouling however after membrane filtration at a frequency range of 1 hz 5 hz algae particles were attracted to the membrane surface table s2 indicating that increasing the vibration frequency could slow down but could not eliminate membrane fouling drawing a comparison between the Œ¥eb and Œ¥ed value fig s6a and fig 3a the Œ¥ed value was much larger than that of the Œ¥eb value which could not be ignored therefore the overarching goal of membrane fouling control was to determine the appropriate hydrodynamic interaction and prevent the adsorption of algae to the membrane surface 4 2 comprehensive evaluation of membrane fouling reasonable selection of indicators for evaluating membrane fouling was the basis for comprehensive evaluation the evaluation indicators for total reversible and irreversible membrane fouling at different vibration frequencies were discussed total fouling had eight evaluation indicators reversible fouling had five evaluation indicators and irreversible fouling had four evaluation indicators these evaluation indicators were interrelated and closely dependent on each other the framework of typical membrane fouling indicators resulting from the vibration frequency analyzed by the topsis gra method was conducted and it is illustrated in fig s7 measured values of evaluation indicators are displayed in table s3 by applying the topsis gra method the extent to which the vibration frequency affected membrane fouling could be clearly explained as depicted in fig 4 the larger the relative closeness value the better the antifouling performance comprehensive consideration of the impact of total fouling on the vibration frequency is displayed in fig 4a as the vibration frequency increased the relative closeness degree for total fouling also increased the result indicated that the higher the vibration frequency the lower the total membrane fouling degree which was consistent with the variation of the total membrane resistance fig s8 specifically there was a shorter relative closeness at higher vibration frequencies fig 4b indicating the declining resistance to reversible fouling interestingly the mass of algae deposition accounting for a higher proportion in reversible fouling weight table s1 declined as the vibration frequency increased it was reasonable to assume that increasing the vibration frequency could alleviate the deposition of large algae particles but it had almost no impact on relieving reversible eom on the one hand due to the little effect of shear action on macromolecules and the shorter relative displacement of algae associated with the vibration frequency inset of fig 3a the chance of eom attaching to the membrane surface is relatively high on the other hand the higher vibration frequency can compact and disrupt the algae cake layer causing algal cells to release more eom table s4 in contrast to the relative closeness for reversible fouling the relative closeness degree for irreversible fouling went up as the vibration frequency increased fig 4c this result showed that a higher vibration frequency exhibited a better anti irreversible fouling performance it could be inferred that concentration polarization on the membrane surface may prevent eom from entering the membrane pore based on the topsis gra analysis the higher the vibration frequency the less prevalent the total and irreversible membrane fouling but the more prevalent the reversible fouling in addition increasing the vibration frequency could reduce the irreversible eom but it had no positive effect on the reversible eom at the same vibration frequency the concentration of reversible eom was much higher than that of irreversible eom table s3 therefore in general increasing the vibration frequency could not reduce the eom concentration 4 3 theoretical prediction of membrane fouling it was assumed that the flow field was laminar under all conditions based on the reynolds number supporting information s7 the simulated water fluxes across the membrane as the vibration frequency ranged from 0 hz to 18 hz were evaluated fig 2a and b the incremental changes in the simulated water flux were substantially increased when the vibration frequency was lower than 8 hz j f 1 j f j f 5 j f and j f 1 represent the water flux versus vibration frequency but it became relatively small at higher vibration frequencies j f 1 j f j f 5 this may be attributed to two aspects 1 the rise in f il inset of fig 5 a as the vibration frequency increased prevented the deposition of algae on the membrane but it had negligible effects on the adhesion of eom 2 higher vibration frequencies can compact the cake layer into a more tense structure thereby restraining water transport the result was consistent with the above topsis gra analysis according to the simulation results it is reasonable to assume that there may exist a critical vibration frequency for a particular membrane system above which the water flux remained stable and membrane fouling was not prevalent the concurrent impact of the various forces on algae at different vibration frequencies from 1 hz to 18 hz was also demonstrated fig 5a both f dg and f ot rose steadily as the vibration frequency increased mainly because of the larger water flux and f il at the higher vibration frequencies as for f tot the value of f tot grew at frequencies lower than 8 hz but the value subsequently dropped at higher frequencies to illustrate the effect of the vibration frequency on f tot the incremental changes of predictive forces as a function of vibration frequency were evaluated fig 6 a a higher vibration frequency resulted in a reduced rate of increase of f dg but a higher rate of increase of f ot this effect was particularly evident for frequencies higher than 7 hz at this point the rate of increase of f ot exceeded that of f dg this could be attributed to the rapid rise of f il inset of fig 6a and the slight increase of the water flux above 7 hz fig 2a notably f tot was always negative and in the same direction as f dg which indicated that membrane fouling could only be alleviated but not eliminated under the predicted vibration condition due to the existence of eom this result may have a few implications 1 within the predicted frequency range unfavorable factors attractive interactions predominated and contaminated the membrane during filtration 2 during the vibration process shear action only acted on the membrane surface resulting in too low of an overall utilization rate of the vibration energy the effects also evidenced the reason why the predicted water flux barely increased as the vibration frequency increased fig 2a and b moreover according to the simulation results if the vibration frequency continued to increase to a value larger than 18 hz two results may be speculated to occur 1 the hydrodynamic resultant force on the algae particles would be zero in other words equilibrium would be achieved and no deposition of algae particles on the membrane surface would occur 2 due to the effects associated with eom the hydrodynamic resultant force on the algae particles would not be zero in other words equilibrium would never be reached but would only be approached a prediction of the hydrodynamic interaction energies of algae was subsequently conducted fig 5b the Œ¥ed of algae particles notably increased at the beginning then decreased slightly and gradually stabilized peaking at 6 hz fig 5b due to a combination of edg and eot from the result it could be inferred that the critical frequency could be reached when Œ¥ed no longer changed the incremental changes of the predictive potential energies of edg and eot were also analyzed it was clear that the incremental changes of the predictive potential energies initially decreased and then finally increased for both of the cases fig 6b above 7 hz the increase rate of eot was higher than that of edg mainly due to the large rate of increase associated with eil inset of fig 6b from fig 6 it could be seen that 7 hz was a key point beyond which the rate of increase of the favorable force repulsive interaction and potential energy were higher than that of the unfavorable forces indicating that the system kept approaching a reduction in membrane fouling taking the energy consumption into consideration fig s9 both the total power and specific energy exhibited a power law relationship as the vibration frequency varied from 0 hz to 18 hz an increase of the vibration frequency would increase the energy consumption of this membrane system for the highest predicted vibration frequency of 18 hz the total power was evaluated to be 5 4 w and the specific energy was 6 55 kwh m3 for permeate fluxes of 39 lmh 1 08e 5 m s a previous liner vibration system reported an energy consumption of 16 6 w for permeate fluxes of 30 lmh with a vibration frequency of 10 hz and an amplitude of 0 8 cm li et al 2013b energy consumption of this uniform vibration system was still very low thus the uniform vibration system had merits in reducing operating energy consumption but if the vibration frequency was too high the energy consumption would still increase therefore appropriately increasing the vibration frequency larger than 7 hz was conducive to enhancing membrane antifouling performance and saving energy 5 conclusions in this study the effects of vibration frequency on membrane fouling during the algae separation process were investigated using a novel hybrid method based on the elucidation of a dynamics model the conduction of a comprehensive evaluation and determination of the critical vibration frequency the key findings were as follows the hydrodynamic and interfacial interactions were investigated by an improved collision attachment model and thermodynamic model respectively the results illustrated that increasing the vibration frequency from 1 hz to 5 hz could reduce membrane fouling moreover it was also found that the Œ¥eb value was much lower than that of Œ¥ed suggesting the importance of controlling hydrodynamic interactions membrane fouling indexes were comprehensively evaluated by the topsis gra method with combined weights the results showed that a higher vibration frequency could effectively alleviate total membrane fouling and irreversible fouling but it could not reduce reversible fouling moreover it was also found that increasing the vibration frequency could not prevent eom from fouling the membrane prediction of the water flux and fouling mechanism were regulated by the ga bp method the results showed that there may exist a critical vibration frequency related to Œ¥ed and beyond 7 hz the vibration system could keep approaching the trend of alleviating membrane fouling the variation of energy consumption showed that the increase of the vibration frequency would lead to a higher energy consumption combining the critical vibration frequency with energy consumption could be a useful tool to plan for membrane fouling in advance thereby improving the efficiency of algae separation by vibration membranes
