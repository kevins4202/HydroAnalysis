605,a critical aspect of multiphase flow in porous media is the displacement efficiency which measures the amount of fluid that can be pushed by another fluid driven by pressure gradient migration of contaminants and reservoir waterflooding are typical applications where understanding the dynamics of immiscible fluid displacement helps mitigating water resources contamination and improving hydrocarbons production respectively due to large viscosity ratios flow instabilities at fluids interface may arise leading to the formation of fingers i e uneven fronts with elongation at the outside edge of fluids interface with strong impact on the displacement efficiency initial studies of viscous instabilities indicated that the development of fingers mostly depends on mobility and capillary forces however heterogeneity of the porous domain may also affect the onset of instabilities therefore the main aim of this work is to numerically investigate formation and growth of viscous fingers in heterogeneous porous media the model used here is based on a novel control volume finite element method cvfem formulation with families of fe pairs p n dg p m and p n dg p m dg specially tailored for darcean flows dynamic mesh adaptivity enables capturing fingers development whilst saving computational overheads numerical experiments were performed to investigate the impact of viscosity ratio and heterogeneity on saffmann taylor instabilities numerical simulations demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the domain triggers the early onset formation of fingers under prescribed viscosity ratio conditions also effective numerical capture of growth in particular tip splitting and coalescence of dendritic finger branching induced by large viscosity ratio largely depends on mesh resolution at the fluids interface keywords multi fluid flows porous media viscous instabilities mobility ratio 1 introduction numerical investigation of multiphase darcy flows has attracted the attention of the porous media community over the past 40 years characterisation and prediction of such flows are the foundation of groundwater and oil gas reservoirs studies description of physics and mechanisms of multiphase porous media flows was reported by wooding and morel seytoux 1976 with focus on capillary pressure and flow regimes a comprehensive review of force balances at the interface between immiscible fluids and resulting mechanisms for flow instabilities can be found in homsy 1987 this work focused on flow instabilities in two phase systems due to viscous and stress forces often referred as viscous instabilities or viscous fingering muskat 1934 used hele shaw cells i e parallel flat plates separated by an infinitesimal gap to study fluid flow and the impact of the capillary number n c on the flow dynamics this experimental apparatus enabled instabilities to be qualitatively investigated by simplifying the flow in both porous and non porous media to a 2d problem mclean and saffman 1981 developed a semi analytic solution for flows in hele shaw cells which was later used by guan and pitchumani 2003 to investigate fingers formation dimensions and branchiness more recently howison 2000 and praud and swinney 2005 provided a comprehensive description of the mathematical formulation of immiscible two phase flows in hele shaw cells for a hele shaw cell of a given size flow development depends only on the capillary number therefore if nc is too high saffman 1959a see also saffman 1959b homsy 1987 tabeling et al 1987 demonstrated that the flow develops to a single steady state finger which moves throughout the cell with constant velocity multi fluid flow dynamics in porous media are described by continuity and momentum conservative equations for each fluid with coupling terms appearing in both sets of equations finite difference methods fdm have been extensively used in most industry standard reservoir simulators to solve this set of equations however they are often limited to relatively simple geometries and often lead to excessive numerical dispersion when strong heterogeneity is present chavent and jaffré 1986 the geometrical flexibility associated with high order numerical accuracy of finite element methods fem has proven to be more efficient than fdm to solve fluid flow dynamics in complex geometries among fem based formulations for porous media flows the control volume finite element method cvfem fung et al 1992 was designed to guarantee local mass conservation and high order numerical accuracy as well as being able to use geometry conforming elements e g triangles tetrahedra pyramids etc in traditional cvfem formulations pressure and velocity are interpolated using piecewise linear fe basis functions while material properties and flow conditions e g phase saturation density temperature species concentration etc are interpolated with cv basis functions voller 2009 since geometries are captured by fe constructed cvs typically extend on each side of the interface which may have different properties therefore average values of coupled velocity pressure variables are applied across the cvs at the interfaces this often leads to excessive numerical dispersion especially in highly heterogeneous media in order to reduce artificial numerical diffusion associated to the upwind weighting of the advected quantity in regions of strong heterogeneity a discontinuous hybrid finite element finite volume method dfefvm formulation was introduced by nick and matthai 2011a b this discretisation scheme was designed to simulate flows through discrete fractured rocks in which cvs are divided along the interfaces of different materials coupled control volume distributed cvd flux limiting method and high order convection schemes were introduced by edward 2006 to reduce anisotropic numerical diffusion in flows through semi impervious barriers i e flow across regions of large permeability gradient solution for such particular numerical diffusion problem was recently revisited by salinas et al 2018 using the model formulation outlined in section 2 the impact of viscosity ratio and flow rate on fingering development was experimentally investigated with coreflood and micromodels by doorwar and mohanty 2016 through numerical experiments based on pore network model they demonstrated that fingers dynamics i e growth splitting and coalescence are also strongly dependent on the domain s aspect ratio and capillary forces see doorwar and mohanty 2014 and proposed a new instability dimensionless number to assess breakthrough recovery of an extensive set of experimental data therefore the main aim of this work is to numerically investigate the onset of viscous instabilities in heterogeneous porous media flows through a novel computational multi fluid dynamics model gomes et al 2017 the two main aspects of this work are a qualitative and quantitative validation of the model section 4 3 for viscous flow instabilities and b impact of mesh resolution on capturing the onset formation and growth of viscous fingers section 4 4 a brief description of the numerical formulation and viscous flow instabilities are introduced in sections 2 and 3 respectively model set up and results including initial model benchmark are presented in section 4 finally concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 model formulation the two phase immiscible and incompressible fluid flow through a porous media domain ω may be described by the coupled extended darcy and saturation equations 1 μ α s α k k r α 1 u α σ α u α p s u α 2 ϕ s α t u α s α s c t y α with xi ω t 0 μ k p and ϕ are viscosity absolute permeability pressure and porosity respectively u α is the saturation weighted darcy velocity of the α phase s u α and s c t y α are source terms of the α phase related to the momentum e g gravity capillarity forces etc and continuity e g mass transfer across fluids phases geochemical reactions etc equations respectively finally k r α is the relative permeability and sα is the α phase saturation with mass conservation constraints of α 1 n p s α 1 where n p denotes the number of phases σ α is an absorption like term that represents the implicit linearisation of the viscous frictional forces the formulation introduced here is based on two families of fe pairs p n dg p m dg and p n dg p m cotter et al 2009 consistent with the dual pressure velocity representation in cv space in these families of fe pairs velocity is represented by n th order polynomials that are discontinuous across elements whereas pressure is represented by mth order polynomials that may be either continuous or discontinuous thus the notation p n dg p m and p n dg p m dg respectively across elements mass balance continuity equations are solved in cv space and a petrov galerkin fem is used to obtain high order fluxes on cv boundaries smooth transition between first and high order fluxes are enforced through an extrema detection scheme based on normalised variable diagram nvd jasak et al 1999 darwish and moukalled 2003 applied across faces of neighbouring cvs resulting normalised upwind face values are used to calculate flux limited solutions based on total variation diminishing criteria tvd piperno and depeyre 1998 to yield bounded fields e g positive densities saturations bounded between 0 and 1 etc see gomes et al 2012 for more details on the flux limiting scheme within the model simulations performed for this work were conducted using three types of elements p1dg p1 p1dg p2 sections 4 3 and 4 4 and p1dg p1dg section 4 5 finite element basis functions for velocity and pressure fields are introduced in the discretisation of force balance equations hybrid basis functions are also used to allow cv based velocity to be extrapolated across the entire element the extended darcy equation eq 1 is discretrised using a fe representation of v α σ α u α and p with fe basis functions qj and pj respectively note that σ α lies in both cv and fem spaces each component of the weak form of the extended darcy equation is tested with the v α basis function qj to obtain 3 e ω e q i v α p s u α d v γ e q i n p p d γ γ ω q i n p p bc d γ 0 where ω e and γ e are the volume and boundary of element e respectively and γω is the boundary of the computational domain the numerical pressure p appearing in the jump condition second term in eq 3 is the arithmetic mean of the potentially discontinuous pressure across the element e consistent with the p n dg p m dg element pairs this term vanishes when a continuous formulation is used to discretise the pressure field with p n dg p m element pairs the last term in eq 3 is used to weakly enforce the pressure level to p bc on the computational domain boundary whilst saturation and all saturation dependent material properties such as relative permeability and capillary pressure is calculated in cv space absolute permeability k is assumed piecewise constant in fe space saturation equations eq 2 are discretised in space with cv basis function mi and with the θ method in time gomes et al 2012 velocities across cv interfaces within and between elements are calculated through a directional weighted flux limited scheme based on upwind value of σ at individual cv as described by gomes et al 2017 summing the discretised eq 2 over all phases yields the global mass balance equation 4 α 1 n p ω c v i m i ϕ s α i n 1 s α i n δ t d v γ c v i θ n 1 2 n u α n 1 s α n 1 1 θ n 1 2 u α n s α n d γ ω c v i m i s c t y α n θ d v 0 where ω cvi and γ cvi are the volume and boundary of cv i respectively mi are cv basis functions n is the outward pointing unit normal vector to the surface of cvi and n is the current time level θ varies smoothly between 0 5 corresponding to crank nicolson method and 1 corresponding to backward euler scheme to avoid the introduction of spurious oscillations for large grid courant numbers the discretised global mass and force balance equations are solved using a multigrid like approach the numerical formulation is fully described by gomes et al 2017 see also salinas et al 2015 2018 adam et al 2016 3 brief summary of viscous instabilities viscous flow instabilities are relatively common in waterflooding for heavy oil reservoirs resulting in inefficient flow sweeping which can bypass significant quantities of recoverable oil this may also lead to early breakthrough of water in neighbour production wells under the assumption that fluids remain immiscible along the interface surface tension plays an important role in determining shape and progress of the fingers howison 2000 during the displacement of a fluid by a less viscous one the expected uniform front buckley and leverett 1942 sheldon and cardwell 1959 is perturbed leading to an uneven front with elongations at the outside edge of the fluid interface in immiscible displacements viscous fingering occurs when the viscosity ratio is greater than unity as surface tension becomes weak the interface is stressed and becomes unstable leading to the formation of fingers the interface of the main finger collapses and starts splitting into new lobes of fingers one of these new fingers may eventually outgrow the others and then spreads to occupy an increasingly larger width in the process the finger reaches a critical width while the saturation gradient at the front becomes steep as a result of stretching caused by the cross flow causing the tip of the finger to become unstable and splitting again and the pattern repeats therefore surface tension plays an essential dual role it must be weak enough for the tip front to be unstable but it is also the physical force causing the spreading and ensuing repeated branching tan and homsy 1988 carvalho et al 2013 in heterogeneous domains such instability may be triggered by permeability differences across regions as shown in section 4 3 as demonstrated by habermann 1960 see also budek et al 2017 mobility ratio mr is a key parameter to assess fluid displacement and is defined as the ratio of mobility of the displacing fluid i to that of the displaced fluid j 5 mr k r i μ j k r j μ i mr is a function not only of fluids viscosity but also of the parameterised relative permeability k r α which is often expressed as a function of local residual and maximum phase saturations prescribed in the pore rock matrix in the simulations conducted in section 4 the modified brooks and corey 1964 model was used alpak et al 1999 6 k r w s w k r w s w s w i r r 1 s w i r r s n w r n w k r n w s n w k r n w s n w s n w r 1 s w i r r s n w r n n w where subscripts w and nw stand for wetting and non wetting phases respectively k r w and k r n w are end point relative permeability to wetting and non wetting phases s w irr and s nw r are irreducible wetting and residual non wetting phase saturations respectively exponents nw and nnw are both set to 2 the mr expression eq 5 contains phase saturations sw xi t and snw xi t eq 6 however it is clear that during fluid displacement they change in time and space according to the global mass conservation equation assuming that phase viscosities remain invariant throughout the simulated fluid displacement in this work with no lack of generality the mr can be replaced by the viscosity ratio vr vr μ i μ j which will be used in the parametrisation of the numerical simulations conducted in section 4 analysis performed in the following sections will make use of this simplified definition as phase saturation sα is a time and spatial dependent field which is calculated along with pressure p and velocity u α in the next section the numerical formulation used to simulate multi fluid flow in porous media is briefly validated section 4 2 against laboratory experiments qualitative validation the impact of vr quantitative validation and heterogeneity on the onset of interface instability and growth of fingers are numerically investigated in section 4 3 section 4 4 demonstrates the importance of appropriate mesh resolution to adequately capture the initial stages of viscous fingers formation and development finally flow pathway channelling is the focus of section 4 5 4 results 4 1 model set up numerical simulations were conducted with the model

gravity driven displacement etc in radünz et al 2014 jackson et al 2015 salinas et al 2015 and pavlidis et al 2016 in this work all test cases were performed in idealised geometries discretised with unstructured triangular and tetrahedral mesh using the p1dg p2 p1dg p1 fig 1 sections 4 2 4 4 and p1dg p1dg section 4 5 fe pairs an implicit crank nicolson time stepping scheme was used with a posteriori adaptive time step size targeting a maximum courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl courant et al 1941 of 2 in most simulations the domain was initially fully saturated with non wetting fluid which was displaced by a pure wetting fluid at a prescribed initial velocity u α for simplicity the porosity ϕ of the domain was kept constant at 0 2 in all simulations whereas the absolute permeability k varied in space i e k k x i fluids are assumed incompressible also gravity and capillary pressure were neglected initial set up for the numerical simulations is summarised in table 1 4 2 initial model validation numerical simulations based on lab experiments due to evans and dawe 1994 dawe and grattoni 2008 were conducted to demonstrate the model s capability to capture viscous crossflow during immiscible displacement in heterogeneous porous media the 2d domain shown in fig 2 a is 4 2 unit length and fully saturated with fluid 2 vr 1 fluid 1 is injected from the left hand side of the domain with constant velocity of u x 8 33 10 3 boundary conditions also include no flux across upper and lower borders the domain consists of four regions in which each quarter is represented by a permeability value a two phase immiscible flow along homogeneous and parallel layers of contrasting permeability is initially simulated during fluid displacement crossflow between adjacent layers often occur due to viscous capillary and or gravitational forces in discontinuous spatial permeability distribution such preferential flows are shown in fig 3 in this case crossflow behaviour from first to fourth quadrants of the domain is in good qualitative agreement with experiments conducted by dawe and grattoni 2008 fig 2 b 4 3 flow simulations in hele shaw cells at different viscosity ratio conditions in order to investigate the impact of viscosity ratio on the flow dynamics numerical simulations of fluid displacement were conducted in hele shaw cells following the work of saffman 1986 in this manuscript the onset of viscous flow instabilities following his seminal work in saffman and taylor 1958 is investigated along with the impact of boundary conditions in the problem s mathematical formulation and solutions here 2d simulations were conducted in a 5 5 cm domain fig 5a fully saturated with a fluid wetting phase fluid is driven from the bottom left hand corner of the domain with velocity of 1 cm s 1 magnitude no flux boundary conditions were imposed to all borders of the domain except at the top right hand side corner named as sink and pressure gradient between source and sink regions was initially imposed to the system solution mesh independence was achieved through comparison of non wetting phase saturation profiles along a line between source and sink regions diagonal across the domain with several mesh resolutions mesh convergence criterion was a maximum residual of 10 2 and it was achieved with approximately 3 5k elements fig 4 thus all simulations shown in this section used mesh with resolution larger than 3546 p1dg p2 triangular elements figs 5 7 show fluid displacement in simulations conducted with vr 3 10 150 respectively with homogeneous permeability distribution k 10 10 cm 2 at relatively low viscosity ratio conditions i e vr 3 saturation evolves in time with a smooth front throughout most of the domain and no finger could be observed elongated saturation profile at later stages of the simulation is due to pressure gradient near the sink region however formation of fingers can be readily noticed at early stages of simulations conducted with viscosity ratios of 10 and 150 viscous finger morphologies were investigated by guan and pitchumani 2003 based on mathematical formulation and semi analytic solutions of the coupled darcy and continuity equations developed by mclean and saffman 1981 they conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate fingers formation dimensions and branchiness for a range of viscosity ratios 102 vr 104 and modified capillary numbers 632 n c 6 32 10 7 with n c u f μ γ 1 w b 2 where uf is the velocity of the finger w is half hele shaw cell width and b is the cell thickness finger width λf and volumetric flow rate q at the outflow region were correlated through 7 q u f b λ f here numerical simulations performed with viscosity ratio of 10 and 150 indicated maximum fingers width of approximately 0 45 0 70 and 0 50 0 90 cm fig 8a and b respectively assuming b 1 mm this is in close agreement with expected values obtained from eq 7 which indicates maximum finger width ranging from 0 13 to 0 75 for vr 10 and from 0 30 to 0 75 vr 150 table 2 fluid flow dynamics through heterogeneous porous media are sensibly more complex than in homogeneous media and strongly depend on problem properties studies by langtangen et al 1992 on fluid flow dynamics in heterogeneous porous media analytical and numerical solutions demonstrated that hyperbolic buckley leverett model is inherently unstable i e the expected uniform interface front collapses as any perturbation in physical parameters are imposed to the problem spatial variation in geological formations occurs in all length scales where heterogeneity characteristics in small length scales i e pore are statistically embedded into permeability absolute and relative and porosity parameters such multi scale heterogeneity induces preferential flow pathways and plays a significant role in the onset of fluid instabilities as it triggers fingers formation and their accelerated growth see wing et al 1989 tchelepi and orr jr 1994 in order to qualitatively investigate the impact of heterogeneity here represented by changing in the permeability field numerical simulations were conducted using a prescribed permeability distribution and viscosity ratios of 10 and 150 absolute permeability ranging from 1 0 10 12 to 5 0 10 10 cm2 i e 0 1 k 50 milidarcy was used in the simulations which were performed with the same geometry mesh resolution boundary and initial conditions as in previous homogeneous cases figs 5 8 b figs 9 and 10 show formation of multi scale elongations with continuous growth and coalescence of dendritic finger branching in simulations performed with viscosity ratio of 10 and 150 respectively in both simulations maximum fingers width of approximately 0 44 0 56 vr 10 and 0 24 0 44 cm were found whereas estimated values based on eq 7 were 0 25 4 50 vr 10 and 0 88 3 00 cm vr 150 fig 8c d and table 2 such calculated ranges i e theoretical values based on analytic solutions due to mclean and saffman 1981 clearly overestimate fingers dimensions as the mathematical formulation and therefore eq 7 assumes incompressible flows in homogeneous porous medium i e it does not take into account any spatial variability of heterogeneity 4 4 capturing flow dynamics and fingering growth impact of mesh resolution in most numerical simulations involving geo fluid dynamics local geometric constraints e g faults fractures etc and spatial multi scale variability of flow properties are often ignored as the underlying computational mesh grid is too coarse to reliably represent any of these features whilst structured grids often struggle to conform to complex domain boundaries with consistent mesh connectivity unstructured mesh techniques often relax cells neighbourhood relationship constraints by dividing the domain into polytopes in which elements share adjacent faces this leads to mesh grids that conform to the domain topography and can make the best use of state of the art self adaptive computational methods in section 4 3 the impact of viscosity ratio on the growth of fingers and the triggering effect of heterogeneity on instability s nucleation were demonstrated in modified simulated hele shaw cells in order to capture the continuous development of viscous instabilities mesh grids with sufficient resolution need to be applied over the interface between fluids fig 11 shows a numerical simulation performed with the same geometry boundary and initial conditions as the one shown in fig 10 but with noticeable lower resolution 3734 instead of 26 313 elements i e marginally above the solution mesh independent resolution of 3 5k elements shown in fig 4 as it can be seen the lower the resolution the more difficult is to capture the fingers formations growth and branching the dynamic mesh adaptive algorithm embedded in the fluidity ic ferst model utilises a metric tensor field dependent on solution interpolation error estimates which locally control the topology of elements in the metric pain et al 2001 power et al 2006 mesh optimisation generates unstructured finer mesh in regions where flow properties change faster and coarser mesh in regions where properties change more slowly piggott et al 2006 hiester et al 2014 mostaghimi et al 2016 in the simulations shown in this section mesh grid adapts as a response to oscillations of phase saturations with a minimum value for length of elements of 0 05 unit length b maximum number of nodes of 5 104 and c prescribed interpolation error estimate of 10 2 here numerical simulations were conducted with fixed and adaptive mesh resolutions to qualitatively assess model capability to capture fingers dynamics in order to trigger the formation of fingers regions with sharp permeability gradient were introduced the computational domain fig 12a consists of a rectangular geometry fully saturated with a fluid except by a squared region containing 50 of a second fluid wetting fluid phase fig 12c and divided into 5 regions with prescribed synthetic permeability distribution with values between 1 and 5 fig 12b a no flux boundary condition was imposed across upper and lower borders whilst pure wetting fluid phase i e s 1 1 is driven into the domain from the left hand side face at velocity u 1 x 1 viscosity ratio was set to 10 figs 13 and 14 show fluid displacement in simulations performed with fixed and adaptive meshes both simulations started with a mesh of 13 068 triangular p1dg p2 elements however as flow dynamics evolve the number of elements of the simulation conducted with adaptive mesh oscillates from a minimum of 4400 to a maximum of 16 430 fig 15 in both cases fingers development formation growth and coalescence and fluid cross flows through regions of sharp permeability gradient at the top of the domain k 2 3 can be readily noticed the simulation performed with a fixed and relatively fine mesh was able to capture the progressive development of fingers as shown in fig 16b prompted by sharp permeability gradient at the interface of regions with k 1 5 in regions with no permeability gradient formation and development of fingers fig 16c were not captured by the simulation conducted with fixed mesh in both cases dynamic adaptive mesh based on perturbation of phase saturations with imposed interpolation error estimate proved to be able to capture the onset of instabilities and fingers development with relatively little computational overhead as indicated in fig 15 4 5 3 d channel flows in geological formations preferential pathways flows may result in fast polutant transport advection diffusion dispersion after industrial spillage therefore leading to contamination of groundwater or low hydrocarbon recovery rates in water co2 and or polymer flooding operations in oil gas field exploration in this section 3d simulations are conducted to investigate preferential flow pathways through semi pervious and impervious geological layers simulations were performed in a hexahedron domain of 4 cm 2 5 cm 10 cm with permeability distribution of 10 4 k 10 5 milidarcy fig 17 the computational domain was designed to naturally capture preferential flow pathways through channels of large absolute permeability pure wetting fluid is added into the domain with uniform velocity of 0 5 cm s 1 from the left hand side face no flux boundary conditions are applied to all borders except at the inlet left hand side and outflow right hand side faces initially the domain was partially saturated with non wetting fluid i e s n w t 0 0 80 which was continuously displaced by the wetting fluid as the simulation progress the domain was discretised with 235k tetrahedral p1dg p1dg element pairs as demonstrated in the preliminary model validation section 4 2 crossflow towards the upper region of the initial part of the domain is due to boundary pressures and diffusivities both at different vertical layers i e caused by large permeability gradients fig 18 as the simulation progresses non wetting fluid is driven from regions with lower fluid resistance central channel although adjacent region with low permeability remains stagnant such preferential flow pathways are clearly indicated in fig 19 where darcy velocity vectors overlapped with wetting phase fluid saturation are shown fluid displacement occurs mainly in regions of relatively larger permeability leaving other parts of the domain i e regions with low permeability distribution with little or no momentum indicating that at these regions the non wetting fluid i e fluid 2 is not effectively displaced in sections 4 3 4 4 finger s formation growth and branching were triggered by domain heterogeneity represented by permeability differences the progress of the saturation front and formation and growth of fingers in time and space can be seen in more details in isosurfaces fig 20 a similar numerical simulation i e same geometry initial mesh resolution initial and boundary conditions was also performed using dynamically adaptive mesh during the simulation mesh resolution ranged from 235k to 643k p1dg p1dg element pairs fig 21 a distinct preferable flow pathways and fingers are shown in fig 21 23 saturation of the wetting fluid during the course of the simulation is shown in fig 23 as expected both simulations fixed and adaptive mesh figs 18 and 23 respectively led to similar results i e similar flow pathways and fingers development low order accuracy of p1dg p1dg element pairs in comparison with p1dg p2 used in previous sections were used in this set of simulations due to the computational overhead for full investigation on numerical accuracy associated with these element pairs see salinas et al 2015 2016 2018 adam et al 2016 gomes et al 2017 however results in this section have shown larger smeared spatial saturation distribution obtained from the fixed mesh simulation indicating numerical diffusion in flows across large permeability gradient 5 conclusions during immiscible multi fluid flow displacements the expected uniform front becomes unstable due to a density ratio b viscosity ratio and c heterogeneity if viscosity ratio is relatively large vr 3 surface tension becomes weak and the interface between two fluids is unstable in the presence of tangential velocity discontinuities leading to the formation of fingers saffman 1986 heterogeneity in the porous media domain also leads to solution instabilities in the hyperbolic buckley leverett problem langtangen et al 1992 this paper aims to numerically investigate the dynamics of viscous flow instabilities in porous media triggered by permeability heterogeneity simulations involving formation and growth of viscous fingers were conducted with the cvfem based multi fluid flow simulator fluidity ic ferst model the numerical formulation was initially validated against laboratory experiments dawe and grattoni 2008 to qualitatively assess model functionality to simulate crossflow i e preferential flow pathways in a chequerboard permeability domain formation and development of viscous fingers in hele shaw cells homogeneous domain were investigated to demonstrate that the onset of interface flow instability occur when vr 3 maximum dendritic finger widths obtained from numerical simulations performed with vr 10 and vr 150 largely agree with expected parametric analytic solutions mclean and saffman 1981 guan and pitchumani 2003 however when perturbations are imposed into the domain s geophysical properties i e spatial variability of absolute permeability numerical solutions partially agree with analytic solutions table 2 this may be due to the domain homogeneity assumption in the analytic solution eq 7 determining the early onset flow instability is critical to accurately simulate formation growth and coalescence of fingers and therefore to a predict displacement sweep efficiency and b design strategies to either mitigate or avoid fingering and preferential flow pathways mesh resolution is thus crucial to investigate saffmann taylor instabilities and adaptive dynamic mesh technology has proved to be an efficient tool to capture initial interface perturbations numerical simulations were performed with vr 10 using fixed and adaptive p1dg p2 element pairs results figs 15 and 16 demonstrated that by dynamically adapting the mesh to follow saturation gradients i e fluids interfaces early onset flow instability and further formation of long multi fluid fingers which have themselves split into sub fingers can be readily captured see figs 13i and 14i overall computational cost of the simulation conducted with dynamically adapting the mesh were significantly smaller than the simulation conducted with fixed mesh as indicated by the number of elements nodes figs 15 investigation of preferential flow pathways was the focus of section 4 5 where 3d numerical simulations of multi fluid flow through semi pervious impervious channelised domain were performed numerical data indicated preferential flow through regions of larger permeability leaving adjacent region with low permeability with nearly stagnant fluids figs 18 and 19 order of accuracy of the element pair and mesh resolution play key roles to capture directional flow pathways

associated with high order numerical accuracy of finite element methods fem has proven to be more efficient than fdm to solve fluid flow dynamics in complex geometries among fem based formulations for porous media flows the control volume finite element method cvfem fung et al 1992 was designed to guarantee local mass conservation and high order numerical accuracy as well as being able to use geometry conforming elements e g triangles tetrahedra pyramids etc in traditional cvfem formulations pressure and velocity are interpolated using piecewise linear fe basis functions while material properties and flow conditions e g phase saturation density temperature species concentration etc are interpolated with cv basis functions voller 2009 since geometries are captured by fe constructed cvs typically extend on each side of the interface which may have different properties therefore average values of coupled velocity pressure variables are applied across the cvs at the interfaces this often leads to excessive numerical dispersion especially in highly heterogeneous media in order to reduce artificial numerical diffusion associated to the upwind weighting of the advected quantity in regions of strong heterogeneity a discontinuous hybrid finite element finite volume method dfefvm formulation was introduced by nick and matthai 2011a b this discretisation scheme was designed to simulate flows through discrete fractured rocks in which cvs are divided along the interfaces of different materials coupled control volume distributed cvd flux limiting method and high order convection schemes were introduced by edward 2006 to reduce anisotropic numerical diffusion in flows through semi impervious barriers i e flow across regions of large permeability gradient solution for such particular numerical diffusion problem was recently revisited by salinas et al 2018 using the model formulation outlined in section 2 the impact of viscosity ratio and flow rate on fingering development was experimentally investigated with coreflood and micromodels by doorwar and mohanty 2016 through numerical experiments based on pore network model they demonstrated that fingers dynamics i e growth splitting and coalescence are also strongly dependent on the domain s aspect ratio and capillary forces see doorwar and mohanty 2014 and proposed a new instability dimensionless number to assess breakthrough recovery of an extensive set of experimental data therefore the main aim of this work is to numerically investigate the onset of viscous instabilities in heterogeneous porous media flows through a novel computational multi fluid dynamics model gomes et al 2017 the two main aspects of this work are a qualitative and quantitative validation of the model section 4 3 for viscous flow instabilities and b impact of mesh resolution on capturing the onset formation and growth of viscous fingers section 4 4 a brief description of the numerical formulation and viscous flow instabilities are introduced in sections 2 and 3 respectively model set up and results including initial model benchmark are presented in section 4 finally concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 model formulation the two phase immiscible and incompressible fluid flow through a porous media domain ω may be described by the coupled extended darcy and saturation equations 1 μ α s α k k r α 1 u α σ α u α p s u α 2 ϕ s α t u α s α s c t y α with xi ω t 0 μ k p and ϕ are viscosity absolute permeability pressure and porosity respectively u α is the saturation weighted darcy velocity of the α phase s u α and s c t y α are source terms of the α phase related to the momentum e g gravity capillarity forces etc and continuity e g mass transfer across fluids phases geochemical reactions etc equations respectively finally k r α is the relative permeability and sα is the α phase saturation with mass conservation constraints of α 1 n p s α 1 where n p denotes the number of phases σ α is an absorption like term that represents the implicit linearisation of the viscous frictional forces the formulation introduced here is based on two families of fe pairs p n dg p m dg and p n dg p m cotter et al 2009 consistent with the dual pressure velocity representation in cv space in these families of fe pairs velocity is represented by n th order polynomials that are discontinuous across elements whereas pressure is represented by mth order polynomials that may be either continuous or discontinuous thus the notation p n dg p m and p n dg p m dg respectively across elements mass balance continuity equations are solved in cv space and a petrov galerkin fem is used to obtain high order fluxes on cv boundaries smooth transition between first and high order fluxes are enforced through an extrema detection scheme based on normalised variable diagram nvd jasak et al 1999 darwish and moukalled 2003 applied across faces of neighbouring cvs resulting normalised upwind face values are used to calculate flux limited solutions based on total variation diminishing criteria tvd piperno and depeyre 1998 to yield bounded fields e g positive densities saturations bounded between 0 and 1 etc see gomes et al 2012 for more details on the flux limiting scheme within the model simulations performed for this work were conducted using three types of elements p1dg p1 p1dg p2 sections 4 3 and 4 4 and p1dg p1dg section 4 5 finite element basis functions for velocity and pressure fields are introduced in the discretisation of force balance equations hybrid basis functions are also used to allow cv based velocity to be extrapolated across the entire element the extended darcy equation eq 1 is discretrised using a fe representation of v α σ α u α and p with fe basis functions qj and pj respectively note that σ α lies in both cv and fem spaces each component of the weak form of the extended darcy equation is tested with the v α basis function qj to obtain 3 e ω e q i v α p s u α d v γ e q i n p p d γ γ ω q i n p p bc d γ 0 where ω e and γ e are the volume and boundary of element e respectively and γω is the boundary of the computational domain the numerical pressure p appearing in the jump condition second term in eq 3 is the arithmetic mean of the potentially discontinuous pressure across the element e consistent with the p n dg p m dg element pairs this term vanishes when a continuous formulation is used to discretise the pressure field with p n dg p m element pairs the last term in eq 3 is used to weakly enforce the pressure level to p bc on the computational domain boundary whilst saturation and all saturation dependent material properties such as relative permeability and capillary pressure is calculated in cv space absolute permeability k is assumed piecewise constant in fe space saturation equations eq 2 are discretised in space with cv basis function mi and with the θ method in time gomes et al 2012 velocities across cv interfaces within and between elements are calculated through a directional weighted flux limited scheme based on upwind value of σ at individual cv as described by gomes et al 2017 summing the discretised eq 2 over all phases yields the global mass balance equation 4 α 1 n p ω c v i m i ϕ s α i n 1 s α i n δ t d v γ c v i θ n 1 2 n u α n 1 s α n 1 1 θ n 1 2 u α n s α n d γ ω c v i m i s c t y α n θ d v 0 where ω cvi and γ cvi are the volume and boundary of cv i respectively mi are cv basis functions n is the outward pointing unit normal vector to the surface of cvi and n is the current time level θ varies smoothly between 0 5 corresponding to crank nicolson method and 1 corresponding to backward euler scheme to avoid the introduction of spurious oscillations for large grid courant numbers the discretised global mass and force balance equations are solved using a multigrid like approach the numerical formulation is fully described by gomes et al 2017 see also salinas et al 2015 2018 adam et al 2016 3 brief summary of viscous instabilities viscous flow instabilities are relatively common in waterflooding for heavy oil reservoirs resulting in inefficient flow sweeping which can bypass significant quantities of recoverable oil this may also lead to early breakthrough of water in neighbour production wells under the assumption that fluids remain immiscible along the interface surface tension plays an important role in determining shape and progress of the fingers howison 2000 during the displacement of a fluid by a less viscous one the expected uniform front buckley and leverett 1942 sheldon and cardwell 1959 is perturbed leading to an uneven front with elongations at the outside edge of the fluid interface in immiscible displacements viscous fingering occurs when the viscosity ratio is greater than unity as surface tension becomes weak the interface is stressed and becomes unstable leading to the formation of fingers the interface of the main finger collapses and starts splitting into new lobes of fingers one of these new fingers may eventually outgrow the others and then spreads to occupy an increasingly larger width in the process the finger reaches a critical width while the saturation gradient at the front becomes steep as a result of stretching caused by the cross flow causing the tip of the finger to become unstable and splitting again and the pattern repeats therefore surface tension plays an essential dual role it must be weak enough for the tip front to be unstable but it is also the physical force causing the spreading and ensuing repeated branching tan and homsy 1988 carvalho et al 2013 in heterogeneous domains such instability may be triggered by permeability differences across regions as shown in section 4 3 as demonstrated by habermann 1960 see also budek et al 2017 mobility ratio mr is a key parameter to assess fluid displacement and is defined as the ratio of mobility of the displacing fluid i to that of the displaced fluid j 5 mr k r i μ j k r j μ i mr is a function not only of fluids viscosity but also of the parameterised relative permeability k r α which is often expressed as a function of local residual and maximum phase saturations prescribed in the pore rock matrix in the simulations conducted in section 4 the modified brooks and corey 1964 model was used alpak et al 1999 6 k r w s w k r w s w s w i r r 1 s w i r r s n w r n w k r n w s n w k r n w s n w s n w r 1 s w i r r s n w r n n w where subscripts w and nw stand for wetting and non wetting phases respectively k r w and k r n w are end point relative permeability to wetting and non wetting phases s w irr and s nw r are irreducible wetting and residual non wetting phase saturations respectively exponents nw and nnw are both set to 2 the mr expression eq 5 contains phase saturations sw xi t and snw xi t eq 6 however it is clear that during fluid displacement they change in time and space according to the global mass conservation equation assuming that phase viscosities remain invariant throughout the simulated fluid displacement in this work with no lack of generality the mr can be replaced by the viscosity ratio vr vr μ i μ j which will be used in the parametrisation of the numerical simulations conducted in section 4 analysis performed in the following sections will make use of this simplified definition as phase saturation sα is a time and spatial dependent field which is calculated along with pressure p and velocity u α in the next section the numerical formulation used to simulate multi fluid flow in porous media is briefly validated section 4 2 against laboratory experiments qualitative validation the impact of vr quantitative validation and heterogeneity on the onset of interface instability and growth of fingers are numerically investigated in section 4 3 section 4 4 demonstrates the importance of appropriate mesh resolution to adequately capture the initial stages of viscous fingers formation and development finally flow pathway channelling is the focus of section 4 5 4 results 4 1 model set up numerical simulations were conducted with the model summarised in section 2 and embedded in the next generation flow simulator fluidity ic ferst model software 1 1 http multifluids github io a full description of the model can be found in gomes et al

gravity driven displacement etc in radünz et al 2014 jackson et al 2015 salinas et al 2015 and pavlidis et al 2016 in this work all test cases were performed in idealised geometries discretised with unstructured triangular and tetrahedral mesh using the p1dg p2 p1dg p1 fig 1 sections 4 2 4 4 and p1dg p1dg section 4 5 fe pairs an implicit crank nicolson time stepping scheme was used with a posteriori adaptive time step size targeting a maximum courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl courant et al 1941 of 2 in most simulations the domain was initially fully saturated with non wetting fluid which was displaced by a pure wetting fluid at a prescribed initial velocity u α for simplicity the porosity ϕ of the domain was kept constant at 0 2 in all simulations whereas the absolute permeability k varied in space i e k k x i fluids are assumed incompressible also gravity and capillary pressure were neglected initial set up for the numerical simulations is summarised in table 1 4 2 initial model validation numerical simulations based on lab experiments due to evans and dawe 1994 dawe and grattoni 2008 were conducted to demonstrate the model s capability to capture viscous crossflow during immiscible displacement in heterogeneous porous media the 2d domain shown in fig 2 a is 4 2 unit length and fully saturated with fluid 2 vr 1 fluid 1 is injected from the left hand side of the domain with constant velocity of u x 8 33 10 3 boundary conditions also include no flux across upper and lower borders the domain consists of four regions in which each quarter is represented by a permeability value a two phase immiscible flow along homogeneous and parallel layers of contrasting permeability is initially simulated during fluid displacement crossflow between adjacent layers often occur due to viscous capillary and or gravitational forces in discontinuous spatial permeability distribution such preferential flows are shown in fig 3 in this case crossflow behaviour from first to fourth quadrants of the domain is in good qualitative agreement with experiments conducted by dawe and grattoni 2008 fig 2 b 4 3 flow simulations in hele shaw cells at different viscosity ratio conditions in order to investigate the impact of viscosity ratio on the flow dynamics numerical simulations of fluid displacement were conducted in hele shaw cells following the work of saffman 1986 in this manuscript the onset of viscous flow instabilities following his seminal work in saffman and taylor 1958 is investigated along with the impact of boundary conditions in the problem s mathematical formulation and solutions here 2d simulations were conducted in a 5 5 cm domain fig 5a fully saturated with a fluid wetting phase fluid is driven from the bottom left hand corner of the domain with velocity of 1 cm s 1 magnitude no flux boundary conditions were imposed to all borders of the domain except at the top right hand side corner named as sink and pressure gradient between source and sink regions was initially imposed to the system solution mesh independence was achieved through comparison of non wetting phase saturation profiles along a line between source and sink regions diagonal across the domain with several mesh resolutions mesh convergence criterion was a maximum residual of 10 2 and it was achieved with approximately 3 5k elements fig 4 thus all simulations shown in this section used mesh with resolution larger than 3546 p1dg p2 triangular elements figs 5 7 show fluid displacement in simulations conducted with vr 3 10 150 respectively with homogeneous permeability distribution k 10 10 cm 2 at relatively low viscosity ratio conditions i e vr 3 saturation evolves in time with a smooth front throughout most of the domain and no finger could be observed elongated saturation profile at later stages of the simulation is due to pressure gradient near the sink region however formation of fingers can be readily noticed at early stages of simulations conducted with viscosity ratios of 10 and 150 viscous finger morphologies were investigated by guan and pitchumani 2003 based on mathematical formulation and semi analytic solutions of the coupled darcy and continuity equations developed by mclean and saffman 1981 they conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate fingers formation dimensions and branchiness for a range of viscosity ratios 102 vr 104 and modified capillary numbers 632 n c 6 32 10 7 with n c u f μ γ 1 w b 2 where uf is the velocity of the finger w is half hele shaw cell width and b is the cell thickness finger width λf and volumetric flow rate q at the outflow region were correlated through 7 q u f b λ f here numerical simulations performed with viscosity ratio of 10 and 150 indicated maximum fingers width of approximately 0 45 0 70 and 0 50 0 90 cm fig 8a and b respectively assuming b 1 mm this is in close agreement with expected values obtained from eq 7 which indicates maximum finger width ranging from 0 13 to 0 75 for vr 10 and from 0 30 to 0 75 vr 150 table 2 fluid flow dynamics through heterogeneous porous media are sensibly more complex than in homogeneous media and strongly depend on problem properties studies by langtangen et al 1992 on fluid flow dynamics in heterogeneous porous media analytical and numerical solutions demonstrated that hyperbolic buckley leverett model is inherently unstable i e the expected uniform interface front collapses as any perturbation in physical parameters are imposed to the problem spatial variation in geological formations occurs in all length scales where heterogeneity characteristics in small length scales i e pore are statistically embedded into permeability absolute and relative and porosity parameters such multi scale heterogeneity induces preferential flow pathways and plays a significant role in the onset of fluid instabilities as it triggers fingers formation and their accelerated growth see wing et al 1989 tchelepi and orr jr 1994 in order to qualitatively investigate the impact of heterogeneity here represented by changing in the permeability field numerical simulations were conducted using a prescribed permeability distribution and viscosity ratios of 10 and 150 absolute permeability ranging from 1 0 10 12 to 5 0 10 10 cm2 i e 0 1 k 50 milidarcy was used in the simulations which were performed with the same geometry mesh resolution boundary and initial conditions as in previous homogeneous cases figs 5 8 b figs 9 and 10 show formation of multi scale elongations with continuous growth and coalescence of dendritic finger branching in simulations performed with viscosity ratio of 10 and 150 respectively in both simulations maximum fingers width of approximately 0 44 0 56 vr 10 and 0 24 0 44 cm were found whereas estimated values based on eq 7 were 0 25 4 50 vr 10 and 0 88 3 00 cm vr 150 fig 8c d and table 2 such calculated ranges i e theoretical values based on analytic solutions due to mclean and saffman 1981 clearly overestimate fingers dimensions as the mathematical formulation and therefore eq 7 assumes incompressible flows in homogeneous porous medium i e it does not take into account any spatial variability of heterogeneity 4 4 capturing flow dynamics and fingering growth impact of mesh resolution in most numerical simulations involving geo fluid dynamics local geometric constraints e g faults fractures etc and spatial multi scale variability of flow properties are often ignored as the underlying computational mesh grid is too coarse to reliably represent any of these features whilst structured grids often struggle to conform to complex domain boundaries with consistent mesh connectivity unstructured mesh techniques often relax cells neighbourhood relationship constraints by dividing the domain into polytopes in which elements share adjacent faces this leads to mesh grids that conform to the domain topography and can make the best use of state of the art self adaptive computational methods in section 4 3 the impact of viscosity ratio on the growth of fingers and the triggering effect of heterogeneity on instability s nucleation were demonstrated in modified simulated hele shaw cells in order to capture the continuous development of viscous instabilities mesh grids with sufficient resolution need to be applied over the interface between fluids fig 11 shows a numerical simulation performed with the same geometry boundary and initial conditions as the one shown in fig 10 but with noticeable lower resolution 3734 instead of 26 313 elements i e marginally above the solution mesh independent resolution of 3 5k elements shown in fig 4 as it can be seen the lower the resolution the more difficult is to capture the fingers formations growth and branching the dynamic mesh adaptive algorithm embedded in the fluidity ic ferst model utilises a metric tensor field dependent on solution interpolation error estimates which locally control the topology of elements in the metric pain et al 2001 power et al 2006 mesh optimisation generates unstructured finer mesh in regions where flow properties change faster and coarser mesh in regions where properties change more slowly piggott et al 2006 hiester et al 2014 mostaghimi et al 2016 in the simulations shown in this section mesh grid adapts as a response to oscillations of phase saturations with a minimum value for length of elements of 0 05 unit length b maximum number of nodes of 5 104 and c prescribed interpolation error estimate of 10 2 here numerical simulations were conducted with fixed and adaptive mesh resolutions to qualitatively assess model capability to capture fingers dynamics in order to trigger the formation of fingers regions with sharp permeability gradient were introduced the computational domain fig 12a consists of a rectangular geometry fully saturated with a fluid except by a squared region containing 50 of a second fluid wetting fluid phase fig 12c and divided into 5 regions with prescribed synthetic permeability distribution with values between 1 and 5 fig 12b a no flux boundary condition was imposed across upper and lower borders whilst pure wetting fluid phase i e s 1 1 is driven into the domain from the left hand side face at velocity u 1 x 1 viscosity ratio was set to 10 figs 13 and 14 show fluid displacement in simulations performed with fixed and adaptive meshes both simulations started with a mesh of 13 068 triangular p1dg p2 elements however as flow dynamics evolve the number of elements of the simulation conducted with adaptive mesh oscillates from a minimum of 4400 to a maximum of 16 430 fig 15 in both cases fingers development formation growth and coalescence and fluid cross flows through regions of sharp permeability gradient at the top of the domain k 2 3 can be readily noticed the simulation performed with a fixed and relatively fine mesh was able to capture the progressive development of fingers as shown in fig 16b prompted by sharp permeability gradient at the interface of regions with k 1 5 in regions with no permeability gradient formation and development of fingers fig 16c were not captured by the simulation conducted with fixed mesh in both cases dynamic adaptive mesh based on perturbation of phase saturations with imposed interpolation error estimate proved to be able to capture the onset of instabilities and fingers development with relatively little computational overhead as indicated in fig 15 4 5 3 d channel flows in geological formations preferential pathways flows may result in fast polutant transport advection diffusion dispersion after industrial spillage therefore leading to contamination of groundwater or low hydrocarbon recovery rates in water co2 and or polymer flooding operations in oil gas field exploration in this section 3d simulations are conducted to investigate preferential flow pathways through semi pervious and impervious geological layers simulations were performed in a hexahedron domain of 4 cm 2 5 cm 10 cm with permeability distribution of 10 4 k 10 5 milidarcy fig 17 the computational domain was designed to naturally capture preferential flow pathways through channels of large absolute permeability pure wetting fluid is added into the domain with uniform velocity of 0 5 cm s 1 from the left hand side face no flux boundary conditions are applied to all borders except at the inlet left hand side and outflow right hand side faces initially the domain was partially saturated with non wetting fluid i e s n w t 0 0 80 which was continuously displaced by the wetting fluid as the simulation progress the domain was discretised with 235k tetrahedral p1dg p1dg element pairs as demonstrated in the preliminary model validation section 4 2 crossflow towards the upper region of the initial part of the domain is due to boundary pressures and diffusivities both at different vertical layers i e caused by large permeability gradients fig 18 as the simulation progresses non wetting fluid is driven from regions with lower fluid resistance central channel although adjacent region with low permeability remains stagnant such preferential flow pathways are clearly indicated in fig 19 where darcy velocity vectors overlapped with wetting phase fluid saturation are shown fluid displacement occurs mainly in regions of relatively larger permeability leaving other parts of the domain i e regions with low permeability distribution with little or no momentum indicating that at these regions the non wetting fluid i e fluid 2 is not effectively displaced in sections 4 3 4 4 finger s formation growth and branching were triggered by domain heterogeneity represented by permeability differences the progress of the saturation front and formation and growth of fingers in time and space can be seen in more details in isosurfaces fig 20 a similar numerical simulation i e same geometry initial mesh resolution initial and boundary conditions was also performed using dynamically adaptive mesh during the simulation mesh resolution ranged from 235k to 643k p1dg p1dg element pairs fig 21 a distinct preferable flow pathways and fingers are shown in fig 21 23 saturation of the wetting fluid during the course of the simulation is shown in fig 23 as expected both simulations fixed and adaptive mesh figs 18 and 23 respectively led to similar results i e similar flow pathways and fingers development low order accuracy of p1dg p1dg element pairs in comparison with p1dg p2 used in previous sections were used in this set of simulations due to the computational overhead for full investigation on numerical accuracy associated with these element pairs see salinas et al 2015 2016 2018 adam et al 2016 gomes et al 2017 however results in this section have shown larger smeared spatial saturation distribution obtained from the fixed mesh simulation indicating numerical diffusion in flows across large permeability gradient 5 conclusions during immiscible multi fluid flow displacements the expected uniform front becomes unstable due to a density ratio b viscosity ratio and c heterogeneity if viscosity ratio is relatively large vr 3 surface tension becomes weak and the interface between two fluids is unstable in the presence of tangential velocity discontinuities leading to the formation of fingers saffman 1986 heterogeneity in the porous media domain also leads to solution instabilities in the hyperbolic buckley leverett problem langtangen et al 1992 this paper aims to numerically investigate the dynamics of viscous flow instabilities in porous media triggered by permeability heterogeneity simulations involving formation and growth of viscous fingers were conducted with the cvfem based multi fluid flow simulator fluidity ic ferst model the numerical formulation was initially validated against laboratory experiments dawe and grattoni 2008 to qualitatively assess model functionality to simulate crossflow i e preferential flow pathways in a chequerboard permeability domain formation and development of viscous fingers in hele shaw cells homogeneous domain were investigated to demonstrate that the onset of interface flow instability occur when vr 3 maximum dendritic finger widths obtained from numerical simulations performed with vr 10 and vr 150 largely agree with expected parametric analytic solutions mclean and saffman 1981 guan and pitchumani 2003 however when perturbations are imposed into the domain s geophysical properties i e spatial variability of absolute permeability numerical solutions partially agree with analytic solutions table 2 this may be due to the domain homogeneity assumption in the analytic solution eq 7 determining the early onset flow instability is critical to accurately simulate formation growth and coalescence of fingers and therefore to a predict displacement sweep efficiency and b design strategies to either mitigate or avoid fingering and preferential flow pathways mesh resolution is thus crucial to investigate saffmann taylor instabilities and adaptive dynamic mesh technology has proved to be an efficient tool to capture initial interface perturbations numerical simulations were performed with vr 10 using fixed and adaptive p1dg p2 element pairs results figs 15 and 16 demonstrated that by dynamically adapting the mesh to follow saturation gradients i e fluids interfaces early onset flow instability and further formation of long multi fluid fingers which have themselves split into sub fingers can be readily captured see figs 13i and 14i overall computational cost of the simulation conducted with dynamically adapting the mesh were significantly smaller than the simulation conducted with fixed mesh as indicated by the number of elements nodes figs 15 investigation of preferential flow pathways was the focus of section 4 5 where 3d numerical simulations of multi fluid flow through semi pervious impervious channelised domain were performed numerical data indicated preferential flow through regions of larger permeability leaving adjacent region with low permeability with nearly stagnant fluids figs 18 and 19 order of accuracy of the element pair and mesh resolution play key roles to capture directional flow pathways and fingers in 3d simulations this work focuses on complexity associated with flow channelling and instability dynamics in heterogeneous porous media methods used to simulate such flows are based in a novel high order cvfem formulation that accurately preserves sharp fluid saturation gradients associated with contrasting permeability distribution future work will include numerical investigation of

606,the aim of this paper is to analyze the statistical properties of non reactive solute concentrations in natural aquifers taking into account the hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity quantifying the uncertainty in the evaluation of solute concentrations in aquifers is an important issue for human health and in ecological risk analysis in particular the concentration cumulative distribution function cdf is a key element as it informs the decision makers of the probability that the concentration at an environmental target is below a maximum contaminant level the analysis presented in this paper is performed in a lagrangian framework according to the reverse formulation the origin of the particle being sampled is sought instead of considering the destination of the injected particles based on this formulation a closed form for the unconditioned concentration cdf is derived the same procedure is applied to obtain a closed form for the concentration conditioned by measurements at sampling points in an aquifer keywords contaminant transport solute concentration waste control groundwater monitoring pollution control 1 introduction the ability to predict the behavior of chemical contaminants in natural aquifers represents one of the most important topics in water resources management public health and environmental protection as highlighted in fiori et al 2015 the relevance of the problem is outlined by environmental regulations mostly defining water quality and acceptability in terms of concentration thresholds depending on the specific contaminant and water use in natural aquifers this prediction must be performed with reference to the concentration probability of excess relative to the relevant threshold value in fact intensely monitored field tracer tests reveal irregular spatial distribution of concentration even in mildly heterogeneous aquifers this derives from the heterogeneous nature of the flow that results from the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity as evidenced by field tests like the well known borden site mackay et al 1986 and the cape cod leblanc et al 1991 experiments the information gap related to aquifer permeability can be filled by the use of a stochastic approach the results of a stochastic approach are random variables which can be described in terms of probability functions and moments in these contexts caroni and fiorotto 2000 provided evidence that to approximate the numerical results of the concentration probability density function pdf the β type distribution function gives a better fit in comparison with the normal or log normal distributions for large péclet numbers pe where the effect of the pore scale dynamics can be neglected in this case the concentration pdf tends to a bimodal distribution dagan 1989 bellin and tonina 2007 showed that the β type distribution function converges to a well known analytical solution for two extreme cases 1 zero local dispersion case pe and 2 complete mixing case pe 0 the pore scale effects largely affect the evaluation of the trajectory and the concentration moments of an order greater than one e g fiori 1996 fiori and dagan 2000 and consequently the concentration pdf this issue was further developed by fiorotto and caroni 2002 taking into account the pore scale dispersion in the linear theory framework a major question arises whether a departure from the linear hypothesis can lead to noticeable changes in the concentration probabilistic distributions and moments this topic was investigated by caroni and fiorotto 2005 up to σ y 2 2 in the ergodic conditions satisfied when the solute initial characteristic lengths are much larger than the heterogeneity correlation scale as investigated by dagan 1991 where σ y 2 log conductivity variance this study demonstrated the ability of the β type distribution function to fit the concentration pdf in the nonlinear contexts especially for the small and large values of pe fiorotto and caroni 2005 defined a conceptual scheme for the concentration pdf this was solved via a monte carlo procedure using this procedure in a linear theory framework nicolini et al 2006 2007 highlighted the limitations of the ergodic hypothesis in the concentration pdf considering the uncertainty in the plume centroid position for both passive and reactive substances affected by the linear biochemical degradation bellin and tonina 2007 developed a theoretical model for the concentration pdf of a conservative plume subjected to spreading pore scale dispersion and mechanical mixing the aim of this study was to give a physical interpretation and a theoretical justification to the choice of the β type distribution function used in the work of fiorotto and caroni 2002 2005 bellin and tonina 2007 demonstrated that under statistical stationarity the local solute concentration is distributed according to the β type distribution function the analysis of the bromide concentration measurements from the cape cod tracer experiments confirmed the validity of the β type pdf for interpretation of the concentration data currently this is an active field of research and although recent results showed that the β type distribution function approximates the concentration pdf very well its generality cannot be confirmed see e g sanchez vila et al 2009 dentz and tartakovsky 2010 boso et al 2014 recently de barros and fiori 2014 according to the first order approximation developed a general expression for the concentration cdf in agreement with the classic eulerian concentration scheme they defined an analytical expression for the concentration cdf at the centroid of a plume in the case of small source size with respect to the hydraulic conductivity correlation scale comparing these results with the β cdf a reasonable agreement is shown providing additional evidence in favor of using the β type distribution function de barros and fiori 2014 fiori et al 2015 presented a few developments in some key areas of stochastic modeling of solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers with reference to risk analysis they highlighted that the topic is still of particular interest and lacks a comprehensive understanding of the concentration statistics in this framework approaches based on the flux averaged concentration instead of the resident concentration can be found in the literature e g moslehi and de barros 2017 a discussion on resident and flux averaged concentrations in modeling of solute transport is reported in the appendix the analysis reported by caroni and fiorotto 2005 was devoted to the practical engineering aspects of groundwater quality assessment in which the concentration pdf was evaluated via a monte carlo approach according to a conceptual scheme of the phenomena the present paper further develops the analysis of caroni and fiorotto 2005 the aim of the paper is to define theoretically 1 a closed form for the concentration pdf to check the accuracy of the β type pdf and 2 a closed form for the conditional concentration pdf based on tracer data 2 concentration pdf formulation in a lagrangian framework at the darcy scale a solute plume can be considered as composed of a set of elementary particles each one moving along a trajectory xt t a t 0 where a represents the particle s initial location at time t t 0 this trajectory is conditioned by heterogeneity effects which act on the eulerian velocity field usually reported dagan and fiori 1997 as a superposition of two components 1 an advection displacement x t a t0 pe at the darcy scale as characterized by the length scale λ and 2 a pore scale related displacement xd t with a characteristic length scale λ d of the same order of magnitude as the representative grain size of the soil 1 x t j t a t 0 x j t a t 0 p e x d j t t 0 t v j x t τ a t 0 d τ x d j t where τ t t 0 and j axis direction the velocity vj x at position x is the eulerian velocity field at the darcy scale that is related to the aquifer heterogeneity the pore scale displacement is due to the water flowing through the erratic structure of the soil pores generally it is modeled as a brownian motion with a zero mean and a variance matrix xdij 2ddij t t 0 where ddij is the dispersion tensor component at the pore scale and i and j represent the axis directions dagan 1989 fiori 1996 salandin and fiorotto 2000 according to tonina and bellin 2008 the brownian motion models the pore scale dispersion a process occurring at a scale smaller than the darcy scale λ which represents the difference between the particle trajectory and the particle advection displacement the relative importance of the two effects is represented by pe uλ d d11 where d d11 is the pore scale dispersion tensor component along the mean flow direction with a mean velocity u the pore scale displacement derives from a velocity field v d j that can be assumed as statistically independent from vj being associated with physical phenomena with a scale ratio λ λd o 102 o 104 this statistical independence cannot be extended to the particle displacement components because as evidenced by eq 1 the displacement xj vj xj x d j dτ depends on x d j the particles that move according to the darcian velocity vj x have a correlation length λ v j a correlation function ρ v j x j v j 0 v j x j v j 0 v j 0 v j velocity fluctuation and a microscale length ε v j 2 2 ρ v j x j 2 0 λ v j inside which the velocity field can be considered fully correlated tennekes and lumley 1972 in comparison the velocity associated with the description of the pore scale effects v d j x has a correlation length λ d ε v j for this reason the solute particle at the darcy scale of size o ε v j can be considered as composed of a large number of particles having a size smaller than λ d the study of the particle motion according to eq 1 can take advantage of the reverse scheme vanderborght 2001 fiorotto and caroni 2002 instead of moving forward from the injection volume v 0 the method computes the initial location of the particle at time t located at position x 0 within the sampling volume v fig 1 this method is employed to derive the unconditional and conditional concentration cdfs in the case of point samplings it is characterized by v with a dimension of o ε v j for any size lj with j 1 2 and 3 of the hyper rectangle injection volume this is the case for the concentration measurements in sampling wells the following scheme was adopted by caroni and fiorotto 2005 in a 2d monte carlo numerical procedure in four steps 1 generation of a hydraulic conductivity field with a prescribed statistical structure 2 evaluation of the eulerian flow field by solving the flux balance equations with appropriate boundary conditions 3 identification of the instantaneous position at time t 0 of np particles released in v and 4 evaluation of the number of particles n inside v 0 after a travel time τ and computation of the concentration c c 0 n n p where c 0 initial uniform concentration from a theoretical point of view this means that the sampling volume is considered as a single particle at the darcy scale and as a collection of np particles at the pore scale at the darcy scale the displacement in the backward direction starting from v is distributed with pdf of the particle displacement pdf f x while at the pore scale the displacement is normally distributed with pdf of the pore scale pdf ϕ with null mean and variance equal to 2dd τ given that the total displacement of each particle is x xd the probability that a single particle falls in v 0 having taken origin from v according to the reverse scheme in fig 1 conditional on x is p x v 0 φ ξ x x 0 d ξ here the auxiliary variable ξ has its origin at the center of mass of v 0 placed at a distance x 0 from v fig 1 this probability is the same for all the np particles in v whose displacement is mutually independent if n of the np particles fall in v 0 the actual concentration in v is c c 0 n n p thus the probability of c can be computed as the probability of n successes out of npindependent trials and its distribution is binomial benjamin and cornell 1970 the particle displacements at the darcy scale along the three directions in the space xj are independent as a consequence the probability of c is 2 p r o b c c 0 n n p c 0 n p n j 1 3 f j x j p x n 1 p x n p n d x j where n p n is a binomial coefficient and px 1 2 j 1 3 e r f x j l j x j 2 x d j j e r f x j l j x j 2 x d j j the concentration moments can be obtained via eq 2 inferring that np is equal to one in a small sampling volume hypothesis the probability that a single particle at the darcy scale the sampling volume is considered as a single particle with a concentration c 0 falls in the solute area according to eq 2 is 3 p r o b c c 0 c 0 j 1 3 f j x j p x d x j that gives the mean concentration value c x t at x therefore the higher concentration moments of m order are 4 c m x t c m 0 j 1 3 f j x j p x m d x j eqs 3 and 4 for m 2 are equal to equations 30 and 34 in dagan and fiori 1997 for the first and second concentration moments respectively this highlights the congruence between the two approaches in the statistical moments as derived by physical considerations in the dispersion process when it is assumed lagrangian time stationary fiori and dagan 2000 this assumption is implied in the particle diffusion by a random walk process used in the monte carlo approach where a large number of independent particles are tracked in time starting from the same point in a random velocity field via eq 1 e g salandin and fiorotto 1998 caroni and fiorotto 2005 bellin and tonina 2007 from eq 2 one can observe that only the diagonal displacement covariance matrix xjj is taken into account this issue is highlighted in vanderborght 2001 where via the monte carlo approach in a lagrangian framework the spatial covariance of the local concentration is numerically studied using a two particle statistical analysis computing the total particle displacement covariance matrix fiori and dagan 2000 observed that the pore scale particle velocities do not satisfy the lagrangian time stationary hypothesis assumed in dagan and fiori 1997 this fact leads to an incorrect estimation of the concentration variance in order to consider the non stationary process the two particle statistical criteria need to be applied this implies that the total particle trajectory covariance matrix must be considered including the non diagonal terms zij t x x pe where x x is the separator vector between the two particles when the separator vector tends to zero zij t 0 pe is different from xjj t pe showing a jump at this limit and a correlation coefficient ρ zij xjj smaller than one occurs fiori and dagan 2000 as a consequence eq 2 with two particles starting from the same point and both having the trajectories at the darcy scale x and y becomes 5 p r o b c c 0 n x n y 2 n p c 0 n p n x n p n y j 1 3 f j x j y j p x n x 1 p x n p n x p y n y 1 p y n p n y d x j d y j this pdf gives the same c x t at x as eq 3 while the second moment is the probability that both particles x and y fall in the solute area 6 c 2 x t c 0 2 j 1 3 f j x j y j p x p y d x j d y j this result is significantly different from the one achieved by eq 4 assuming the lagrangian time stationary hypothesis via a one particle statistical method dagan and fiori 1997 the lagrangian time stationary occurs for pe case where eq 5 tends to eq 2 decreasing the péclet number the lagrangian time stationary occurs for smaller travel time t that is tu λpe 1 the presented procedure for the evaluation of the concentration pdf can be extended to the case where the concentration ck c 0 n k n p is known at some sampling points located at xk as indicated in fig 1 with k 1 2 and k the observation well where the concentration must be estimated is indicated with k 0 formally the conditional concentration probability at point x 0 conditioned with the concentration measured at the surrounding wells was computed by the following equation benjamin and cornell 1970 7 p c x 0 c x 1 c x k p c x 0 c x 1 c x k p c x 1 c x k according to eq 5 the conditioned variables are the particle displacement xk from the kth sampling points xk with k 1 2 and k while x 0 represents the particle displacement from the generic point x 0 where c must be evaluated therefore eq 7 becomes 8 p r o b c c 0 n 0 n p c 1 c k f x 0 x 1 x k k 0 k j 1 3 n p n k p x j k n k 1 p x j k n p n k d

e r f x j k l j x j k 2 x d j j the computations of eqs 5 to 8 need the definition of the particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale f x 0 x 1 x k this is theoretically derivable according to the first order approximation for σ y 2 1 it can be derived numerically via a monte carlo procedure by increasing the log conductivity variance e g salandin and fiorotto 1998 vanderborght 2001 srzic et al 2013 this analysis is important in groundwater monitoring and risk evaluation as it allows an estimation of the spatial distribution of concentration starting from the ones detected at the sampling points papapetridis and paleologos 2011 3 unconditional concentration pdf first order analysis according to the first order analysis f x 0 x 1 x k is gaussian assuming the independence of the plume centroid fluctuations x b in respect to the particle trajectory fluctuations x e g salandin and fiorotto 1993 nicolini et al 2006 the particle displacement variance is equal to x j j x j j x b j j while the mean particle displacement is x t ut this assumption allows the computation of the unconditional pdf in the lagrangian time stationary condition according to the normal distribution to evaluate the unconditional pdf in a non stationary condition eq 5 and the conditional concentration eq 8 the definition of the non diagonal displacement covariance matrix zjk t x x pe where j and k 1

d d p q t d k the numerical integrations here are performed in a 2d framework in agreement with the majority of the previous studies using the monte carlo approach this means that the results are valid in a regional scale context where the horizontal extent of the aquifer is in the order of kilometers dagan 1989 at this scale all the variables are averaged over the depth of the aquifer and they depend on the horizontal coordinates solely locally the additional degree of freedom in 3d produces a larger stretch and deformation in the pollutant cloud triggering local mass flux and therefore creating a situation that is more favorable to dilution and mixing recently the study of jankovic et al 2017 presented the results of extensive and accurate 3d simulations of flow and transport for five different log conductivity structures for σ y 2 8 the results suggest a universality that distinguishes 3d simulations of flow and transport from 2d simulations at a regional scale and in a 2d framework fig 1 according to fourier analysis van lent and kitanidis 1989 the spectral component of the velocity covariance function u i j k can be obtained in terms of the fourier series of the log transmissivity covariance s y y m n with k m n where m and n are wave numbers on directions j 1 2 respectively performing quadratures in eqs 9 and 10 one obtains fiorotto and caroni 2002 11

centroid being x 0 ut where the maximum value of concentration is expected since l 2 the plume length is much larger than the darcy length scale the ergodic conditions are assured salandin and fiorotto 1993 in the ergodic conditions x b j j tends to zero so that it can be neglected in the computation the concentration cdf computed according to eqs 2 and 5 are compared and discussed initially within the one particle monte carlo approach framework caroni and fiorotto 2005 the effect of the choice of np on the accuracy of the concentration cdf is evaluated according to eq 2 for np 10 50 100 200 500 and 1000 with t 5λ u pe uλ dd 11 100 and x 0 λ 5 0 as shown in fig 2 while the mean concentration results are independent of the choice of np the upper moments show a slight variability due to an increment in the accuracy of the evaluation of the cdf especially on the tails from fig 2 it can be observed that choosing np in the range of 100 200 in the cdf computation a good balance is obtained in terms of accuracy of the results and computational efficiency therefore np 150 was chosen for further numerical simulations in fig 2 the concentration cdf computed according to the β type distribution function is also reported here the first ten theoretical moments calculated using eq 4 are compared with the β type distribution function moments fiorotto and caroni 2002 caroni and fiorotto 2005 comparing the numerical evaluation of the concentration cdf with the moment fitting of the β type distribution function highlighted the feasibility of the β type distribution function in describing the concentration cdf especially at high σ y 2 values the use of the β type cdf can give a well defined shape of the concentration cdf as obtained by the monte carlo simulations the ability of the β type distribution function in evaluation of the concentration cdf has been widely investigated in the literature e g bellin and tonina 2007 cirpka et al 2008 bellin et al 2011 and numerically verified schwede et al 2008 meyer et al 2010 srzic et al 2013 despite the evidence in favor of the β type distribution function in the works mentioned above de barros and fiori 2014 provided additional and more rigorous verification according to eq 5 in a two particle statistical framework the results showed the potential of the β type cdf function as a preliminary prediction tool in applications and or as prior information at early stages of site characterizations in fig 3 a comparison between the cdf computed via eqs 2 and 5 at the plume centroid is shown in this figure the solution obtained via the integration of eq 2 is plotted using a continuous line and the solution obtained by integration of eq 5 is reported by dashed lines from the comparison it is evident that the lagrangian time non stationary tends to reduce the probability of occurrence for the smaller values of the concentration while tending to increase the probability of occurrence for the larger ones because the mean concentration is equal in both cases this implies a reduction in the concentration variance and the concentration coefficient of variation in respect to the lagrangian time stationary scheme in agreement with the results of dagan and fiori 2000 this is highlighted in fig 4 where the ratio between the concentration variance σ c 2 computed via eqs 6 and 4 is plotted on the dimensionless parameter tu λpe in the range 10 pe 1000 and 5 t u λ 20 the same behavior is expected for the associated coefficient of variation because the mean concentration is equal in both cases the reduction in the concentration variance increasing tu λpe is a favorable effect from an environmental standpoint for tu λpe 0 where pe or t 0 fig 4 shows that the ratio between the two concentration variances tends to one reducing the pore scale effects in pollutant dispersion process fiori 1996 reducing the pore scale effects the process tends to the lagrangian time stationary fiori and dagan 2000 in this case as evidenced in fig 3 the concentration cdf tends toward the bimodal distribution f c c 1 c c 0 δ c c c 0 δ c c 0 dagan 1989 for pe the concentration standard deviation is σ c c c 0 c that assumes its maximum value 0 5 c 0 at points where the mean concentration is c 0 5 c 0 the coefficient of variation tends to a constant value equal to one fiori and dagan 2000 in real life cases this is attained for high pe values and for short travel time t 0 where in determining the particle dispersion the darcy scale effects are predominant over the pore scale effects with reference to the use of the β type distribution function fig 2 shows a rough approximation of the cdf that does not take into account the difference in the cdf between the stationary and non stationary cases fig 3 from a theoretical point of view this can be useful as a preliminary prediction tool in application de barros and fiori 2014 this issue is shown in fig 5 where for t 10λ u and for pe 10 100 and 1000 the β type distribution functions computed for the stationary and non stationary cases are compared with the respective theoretical cdfs fig 5 evidences that the β type distribution function increases its accuracy in the cdf interpolation by increasing pe as pointed out by caroni and fiorotto 2000 this does not happen for pe 10 in discrepancy with bellin and tonina 2007 even for pe 0 which is the complete mixing case the β type distribution function must converge theoretically to the gaussian one in fig 5a one can observe that the β type distribution function has practically a gaussian shape in the case of fig 1 with point sampling and rectangular injection areas and assuming gaussian particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale the mean concentration can be computed as fiori and dagan 2000 fiorotto and caroni 2002 14 c x t c 0 j 1 3 1 2 e r f x j l j τ u j 2 w j e r f x j l j τ u j 2 w j with wj xjj 2d d jj τ the second moment of eq 6 becomes 15 c 2 x

identical results in concentration moments from eqs 2 and 6 with eqs 14 and 15 are justified because the binomial distribution tends to the gaussian distribution when increasing np benjamin and cornell 1970 this allows computing the β type distribution function easily which depends on these two moments making it a useful tool in groundwater management where budget constraints can limit a detailed knowledge of the concentration field this provides a quick estimate of the spatial distribution of concentration by means of suitable spatial statistical transport measures boso et al 2013 in this framework the use of a methodology based on the conditional concentration analysis could be useful to improve the reliability of these tools as well as in the design of optimal groundwater monitoring wells network sreekanth et al 2017 4 conditional concentration pdf first order analysis in groundwater management the monitoring of concentrations at some points in an aquifer is generally available so that the concentrations are known at some points in this context the one point cdf must be conditioned with the measured data by obtaining the conditional concentration using eq 8 in figs 6 10 according to the first order analysis the conditional and unconditional concentrations cdfs are compared with different concentrations at the sampling point locations pe log conductivity variance and travel time the aim is to highlight the effect of the conditioning on the concentration cdf at the observation point x 0 with reference to fig 1 the concentration cdf is evaluated at the point x 0 λ 5 0 according to the concentration as measured at one of the points xk λ as stated by eq 7 the conditional probability p c x 0 c xk is 15 p c x 0 c x k p c x 0 c x k p c x k where p c x 0 c xk represents the joint probability for σ y 2 0 2 and pe 100 in fig 6a the conditioning is performed according to the concentration measurements transversal to the mean flow direction so that xk λ 5 0 1 xk λ 5 0 5 and xk λ 5 1 correspond to ζ λ ζ 0 and η λ η 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively the measured concentrations at these points are c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 from fig 6a by comparing the unconditional and conditional cdfs the effect of the conditioning on cdf is evident this effect decreases by increasing the transversal distance when the transversal distance is larger than λ this effect tends to be practically irrelevant the conditioning effect is related to the particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale as the pore scale displacement is uncorrelated increasing the distance r x 0 xk the particle displacement at the darcy scale becomes more and more uncorrelated and the concentration pdf at x 0 tends to become independent from the concentration measured at xk as a consequence the joint concentration p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 p c xk and the conditional probability tends to the unconditional probability p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 this fact is manifested in fig 6a for the case of η 1 for σ y 2 0 2 and pe 100 in fig 6b the conditioning is performed according to the concentration measurements along the mean flow direction so that x λ 4 9 0 x λ 4 5 0 and x λ 4 0 correspond to η λ η 0 and ζ λ ζ 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively the measured concentrations are c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 in the case of small distance between the points xk and x 0 where r 0 1λ the conditional concentration cdf is quite similar to the case of fig 6a for this small distance the difference in the covariance matrix by changing the direction of r and starting from x 0 is small increasing the distance r a significant difference in the conditional cdf behavior is observed with respect to the case of fig 6a increasing r p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 p c xk and p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 in the longitudinal direction the distance r to obtain the statistical independence between the concentrations c x 0 and c xk is one order of magnitude larger than in the transversal direction this is evidenced by the behavior of zjk t x 0 xk pe varying the distance r for example along the longitudinal direction the ratio z 11 5 λ 0 100 z 11 5 0 0 100 0 94 while in the transversal direction the ratio z 11 5 0 λ 100 z 11 5 0 0 100 0 39 so increasing the distance r the conditioning effect is more relevant along the longitudinal flow direction in respect to the transversal direction this can be observed by comparing fig 6a with b from fig 6a and b with reference to the distance r 0 1λ where the conditioning effect is more marked one can note that the conditioning increases the probability of occurrence of the concentrations at x 0 close to the one as measured at xk in the case of fig 6a the ratios between conditional and unconditional probabilities at x 0 142 133 and 196 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the case of fig 6b the ratios 168 144 and 230 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in fig 7 a and b the same cases as reported in fig 6a and b are shown increasing pe from 100 to 1000 by increasing pe the relative effect of the pore scale in the dispersion process decreases from a physical point of view pores are responsible for the mixing of clean and solute containing waters this effect is due to the fringes of clean and solute containing waters tending to mutually infiltrate whenever pore scale effects are negligible the movement through a heterogeneous medium produces a plume deformation with negligible dilution thus point samplings always produce a dichotomous answer 0 c 0 according to the actual position of the plume this tendency is well defined in fig 7a and b with reference to the unconditional cdf by converse when the relative role of pores increases some mixing can be expected and intermediate concentrations are possible fig 6 from fig 7a and b the conditioning effect increases the mixing of the plume which increases the probability of intermediate concentrations that is well evident for ζ and η 0 1 this effect tends to be reduced when increasing η in agreement with the comments above on fig 6a also in this case the conditioning effect is more relevant along ζ in respect to η from fig 7a and b with reference to the case of r 0 1λ in the transversal direction the conditional probability ratios at x 0 200 190 and 540 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the longitudinal direction the conditional probability ratios 168 144 and 230 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively comparing these results with the ones of fig 6 increments in the probability ratios with pe is evident this is due to a decrement in spreading of the pore scale particles the conditioning effect is related to the particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale as the pore scale displacement is uncorrelated for this reason an enhancement of the conditioning effect is expected when increasing the darcy scale particle displacement variance this can be due to an increment in the log conductivity variance and or in travel time the effect of the increment in the log conductivity variance is shown in fig 8 where it is fixed equal to 1 0 comparing the results shown in this figure with the ones shown in fig 6 σ y 2 0 2 the effect of an increment in the log conductivity variance in the concentration cdf can be detected with reference to the unconditional cdf one can note that the same mixing effect is detected for larger value of c c 0 with the same value of pe while an increment in the probability close to a null concentration is manifested this fact can be explained from a physical point of view considering that an increment in the particle displacement variance corresponds to an increase in spreading of the particle at the darcy scale this reduces the number of darcy scale particles close to v 0 starting from v according to the reverse formulation fiorotto and caroni 2002 that are able to produce a finite value in the concentration due to the pore dispersion effects with the same pe and np this change in the unconditional cdf shape also influences the conditioning effect as evidenced by comparing figs 6 and 7 for example fixing the value of c x 0 for σ y 2 1 the conditional cdf is always smaller than the unconditional one on the contrary this does not happen for σ y 2 0 2 from fig 8a and b with reference to the case of r 0 1λ in the transversal direction the conditional probability ratios at x 0 165 212 and 278 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the longitudinal direction the ratios 185 229 and 328 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively comparing these results with the ones of fig 6 an increment in the ratio between conditional and unconditional probabilities is evident increasing the log conductivity variance this is due to an increment in spreading of the particles at the darcy scale at early travel time from the injection the pore scale related to the mixing occurs mostly at the plume boundary followed by a progressive dilution effect in both directions that are spreading solute towards the outer unpolluted region and intrusion of clean water towards the plume core increasing the travel time with the same pe the dilution increases as the displacement variance at the pore scale particle increases this is evident comparing figs 6 with 9 where with reference to the unconditional probability the probability for the higher concentrations decreases the effect of the increment in particles mixing at the pore scale is also evident in the conditioning for the higher concentrations in fact at x 0 λ 20 the cdf curves with c c 0 0 5 and c c 0 0 9 are closer to each other while in fig 6 at x 0 λ 5 the two cdf curves are well separated increasing the travel time an increment in the spreading of the particle at the darcy scale is detected similar to the case of σ y 2 1 fig 8 furthermore an increment in the unconditional probability for smaller concentrations occurs in respect to the case of fig 6 also in this case for a fixed value of c x 0 the cdf is always smaller than the unconditional one from fig 9a and b with reference to the case of r 0 1λ the conditional probability ratios 138 209 and 223 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the longitudinal direction the ratios 142 209 and 223 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively comparing these results with the ones of fig 6 increments in the ratios between the conditional and unconditional probabilities are evident increasing the travel time for c c 0 0 5 and 0 9 while a small decrement is detected for c c 0 0 1 this is due to the opposite role of the increment in variance of the particle displacement at the darcy scale and at the pore scale the first one increases the ratio fig 8 and the second one decreases the ratio this case is the opposite of fig 7 the effect of the pore scale in the conditional concentration is well evidenced for pe 10 as shown in fig 10 in this case the pore scale dispersion tends to predominate the dispersion at the darcy scale as a consequence the difference between the conditional and unconditional cdfs becomes unimportant from a practical point of view in natural aquifers pe is in the range of 100 10 000 thus from figs 6 to 10 the effect of the conditioning can be estimated varying the log conductivity variance pe and travel time for the cases investigated here with r 0 1λ the ratio between the conditional and unconditional concentrations has a mean value 220 and a standard deviation 85 these results highlight the importance of the conditioning analysis with reference to eu directive 1999 31 eu on the landfill of waste in water resource risk evaluation this directive states that to detect contaminant concentrations above regulatory threshold values sampling for monitoring purposes must be performed papapetridis and paleologos 2011 the conditional cdf can be used to improve the forecast of point concentration when the concentration time measured in observation wells is available the first order analysis states a relationship between the time and space coordinates according to the taylor hypothesis taylor 1938 in this context a space time relationship is assessed e g barjastehmaleki et al 2016a barjastehmaleki et al 2015 as ς λ tu λ this gives a time space relationship that is t ς u as a consequence the conditional concentration cdf shown in figs 6 10 with reference to the separator dimensionless distance ς also corresponds to a lag dimensionless time t 5 conclusions in this paper the unconditional and conditional concentration pdfs in natural aquifers are theoretically investigated the statistical moments of this new formulation correspond to the ones known in the literature as defined theoretically based on physical considerations of the phenomena this is drawn out by the theoretical analysis of a former monte carlo simulation procedure and it is in agreement with these numerical results it is highlighted that the particle monte carlo simulation gives a lagrangian time stationary solution according to dagan and fiori 1997 this solution is valid for tu λpe 0 when the darcy scale effects are predominant over the pore scale effects in the dispersion process dagan and fiori 2000 observed that the pore scale particle displacement does not satisfy the lagrangian time stationary hypothesis that was assumed in dagan and fiori 1997 in this case the unconditional pdf is derived theoretically by the use of the two particle statistical criteria the comparison between the non stationary and stationary pdfs highlighted a remarkable difference when increasing tu λpe this is evidenced by a decrease in the concentration variance ratio increasing tu λpe the stationary case gives larger value in the concentration variance in agreement with the theoretical analyses of dagan and fiori 2000 the β type distribution function compared with the theoretical results shows a rough approximation that is unable to take into account the differences between the stationary and non stationary solutions starting from the unconditional pdf the conditional concentration pdf measured in sampling wells is derived from the comparison between the results obtained by the two pdfs changing the sampling points concentration and position pe log conductivity variance and travel time the importance of conditioning in water resource monitoring and risk evaluation is demonstrated with reference to eu directive 1999 31 eu the numerical analysis is performed in a 2d regional case pollutant transport and in an ergodic condition via the linear theory these analyses underlined that the conditioning effect is enhanced increasing the particle displacement variance at the darcy scale while it is reduced when the particle displacement variance at the pore scale increases according to the taylor hypothesis these effects as observed in space can be transformed in time this hypothesis is congruent with the first order analysis appendix hydro geophysical methods are capable of defining the volume averaged resident concentration i e the mass of a sample divided by its volume interrogating a volume of the subsurface in situ this is the case of the present analysis based on the resident concentration evaluation on well samples when the water is pumped at a point for analysis it is implied that measured concentrations are flux averaged i e the mass rate divided by the flow rate different theoretical transport models may be required to interpret concentration derived from tracer tests in the volume averaged and flux averaged cases becker and tsoflias 2010 conservation of the mass requires that the cumulative mass passed through a given control plane at location x through time t must be equal to the total mass downstream of x at time t so that 15a v 0 t c f x t d t x c x t d x where v and cf are the water velocity and flux concentration respectively eq 15a leads to the following relationship between the resident and flux concentrations 16 c f x t 1 v t x c x t d x this relationship was studied by zang et al 2006 in the non fickian diffusion case defining a relationship between the resident and flux concentrations that are diverse this also implies a difference between the resident and flux concentration pdfs the flux concentration describes the mass that has moved downstream of a sample point eq 15a this measure is important when estimating the risk posed by a toxic solute de barros et al 2012 the purpose of the transport models in risk analysis is to predict an environmental performance metric epm α de barros et al 2012 that is 1 α c if the resident concentration exceeds a predefined maximum concentration this is the epm of the abovementioned approach and 2 α τ if a contamination reaches a control plane at x before a specified travel time τ in this case the flux concentration cf is the relevant variable according to eq 15a other epms can be defined with reference to the human health risk the use of the correct concept of epm depends on the specific problem with reference tomeasurement method monitoring setup goltz et al 2007 and authorities directives average quantities are often used to reduce the epm variance in fact to increase the robustness of the resident concentration evaluation boso et al 2013 described the probability of exceeding a given threshold regardless of where this actually occurs averaging the point concentration in space this approach is applied in risk analysis starting from the point resident concentration modeled by the β type distribution function the flux averaged concentration in risk analysis was used by moslehi and de barros 2017 as the epm was assumed equal to the peak flux averaged concentration α c cp at a given control plane located at position x perpendicular to the mean flow direction cp x max m t qw where m t is the mass discharge rate through the control plane and qw is the volumetric discharge at the control plane position numerical analysis pointed out a log normal probability distribution for cp this distribution is in agreement with the previous studies moslehi and de barros 2017 where the pdf of the increase lifetime cancer risk which is proportional to the flux averaged concentration was inferred to be log normal this pdf in cp is based on the flux concentration analysis and it is different from the one defined via the resident concentration in boso et al 2013 in conclusion the approaches based on the resident or flux concentration are theoretically analogous the choice depends on the specific problem expecting results in the epm and concentration measurement procedures in situ resident or flux concentration however confusion between the two approaches may lead to a gross misinterpretation of observations serious model miscalibration and errors in the transport process analysis 
606,the aim of this paper is to analyze the statistical properties of non reactive solute concentrations in natural aquifers taking into account the hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity quantifying the uncertainty in the evaluation of solute concentrations in aquifers is an important issue for human health and in ecological risk analysis in particular the concentration cumulative distribution function cdf is a key element as it informs the decision makers of the probability that the concentration at an environmental target is below a maximum contaminant level the analysis presented in this paper is performed in a lagrangian framework according to the reverse formulation the origin of the particle being sampled is sought instead of considering the destination of the injected particles based on this formulation a closed form for the unconditioned concentration cdf is derived the same procedure is applied to obtain a closed form for the concentration conditioned by measurements at sampling points in an aquifer keywords contaminant transport solute concentration waste control groundwater monitoring pollution control 1 introduction the ability to predict the behavior of chemical contaminants in natural aquifers represents one of the most important topics in water resources management public health and environmental protection as highlighted in fiori et al 2015 the relevance of the problem is outlined by environmental regulations mostly defining water quality and acceptability in terms of concentration thresholds depending on the specific contaminant and water use in natural aquifers this prediction must be performed with reference to the concentration probability of excess relative to the relevant threshold value in fact intensely monitored field tracer tests reveal irregular spatial distribution of concentration even in mildly heterogeneous aquifers this derives from the heterogeneous nature of the flow that results from the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity as evidenced by field tests like the well known borden site mackay et al 1986 and the cape cod leblanc et al 1991 experiments the information gap related to aquifer permeability can be filled by the use of a stochastic approach the results of a stochastic approach are random variables which can be described in terms of probability functions and moments in these contexts caroni and fiorotto 2000 provided evidence that to approximate the numerical results of the concentration probability density function pdf the β type distribution function gives a better fit in comparison with the normal or log normal distributions for large péclet numbers pe where the effect of the pore scale dynamics can be neglected in this case the concentration pdf tends to a bimodal distribution dagan 1989 bellin and tonina 2007 showed that the β type distribution function converges to a well known analytical solution for two extreme cases 1 zero local dispersion case pe and 2 complete mixing case pe 0 the pore scale effects largely affect the evaluation of the trajectory and the concentration moments of an order greater than one e g fiori 1996 fiori and dagan 2000 and consequently the concentration pdf this issue was further developed by fiorotto and caroni 2002 taking into account the pore scale dispersion in the linear theory framework a major question arises whether a departure from the linear hypothesis can lead to noticeable changes in the concentration probabilistic distributions and moments this topic was investigated by caroni and fiorotto 2005 up to σ y 2 2 in the ergodic conditions satisfied when the solute initial characteristic lengths are much larger than the heterogeneity correlation scale as investigated by dagan 1991 where σ y 2 log conductivity variance this study demonstrated the ability of the β type distribution function to fit the concentration pdf in the nonlinear contexts especially for the small and large values of pe fiorotto and caroni 2005 defined a conceptual scheme for the concentration pdf this was solved via a monte carlo procedure using this procedure in a linear theory framework nicolini et al 2006 2007 highlighted the limitations of the ergodic hypothesis in the concentration pdf considering the uncertainty in the plume centroid position for both passive and reactive substances affected by the linear biochemical degradation bellin and tonina 2007 developed a theoretical model for the concentration pdf of a conservative plume subjected to spreading pore scale dispersion and mechanical mixing the aim of this study was to give a physical interpretation and a theoretical justification to the choice of the β type distribution function used in the work of fiorotto and caroni 2002 2005 bellin and tonina 2007 demonstrated that under statistical stationarity the local solute concentration is distributed according to the β type distribution function the analysis of the bromide concentration measurements from the cape cod tracer experiments confirmed the validity of the β type pdf for interpretation of the concentration data currently this is an active field of research and although recent results showed that the β type distribution function approximates the concentration pdf very well its generality cannot be confirmed see e g sanchez vila et al 2009 dentz and tartakovsky 2010 boso et al 2014 recently de barros and fiori 2014 according to the first order approximation developed a general expression for the concentration cdf in agreement with the classic eulerian concentration scheme they defined an analytical expression for the concentration cdf at the centroid of a plume in the case of small source size with respect to the hydraulic conductivity correlation scale comparing these results with the β cdf a reasonable agreement is shown providing additional evidence in favor of using the β type distribution function de barros and fiori 2014 fiori et al 2015 presented a few developments in some key areas of stochastic modeling of solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers with reference to risk analysis they highlighted that the topic is still of particular interest and lacks a comprehensive understanding of the concentration statistics in this framework approaches based on the flux averaged concentration instead of the resident concentration can be found in the literature e g moslehi and de barros 2017 a discussion on resident and flux averaged concentrations in modeling of solute transport is reported in the appendix the analysis reported by caroni and fiorotto 2005 was devoted to the practical engineering aspects of groundwater quality assessment in which the concentration pdf was evaluated via a monte carlo approach according to a conceptual scheme of the phenomena the present paper further develops the analysis of caroni and fiorotto 2005 the aim of the paper is to define theoretically 1 a closed form for the concentration pdf to check the accuracy of the β type pdf and 2 a closed form for the conditional concentration pdf based on tracer data 2 concentration pdf formulation in a lagrangian framework at the darcy scale a solute plume can be considered as composed of a set of elementary particles each one moving along a trajectory xt t a t 0 where a represents the particle s initial location at time t t 0 this trajectory is conditioned by heterogeneity effects which act on the eulerian velocity field usually reported dagan and fiori 1997 as a superposition of two components 1 an advection displacement x t a t0 pe at the darcy scale as characterized by the length scale λ and 2 a pore scale related displacement xd t with a characteristic length scale λ d of the same order of magnitude as the representative grain size of the soil 1 x t j t a t 0 x j t a t 0 p e x d j t t 0 t v j x t τ a t 0 d τ x d j t where τ t t 0 and j axis direction the velocity vj x at position x is the eulerian velocity field at the darcy scale that is related to the aquifer heterogeneity the pore scale displacement is due to the water flowing through the erratic structure of the soil pores generally it is modeled as a brownian motion with a zero mean and a variance matrix xdij 2ddij t t 0 where ddij is the dispersion tensor component at the pore scale and i and j represent the axis directions dagan 1989 fiori 1996 salandin and fiorotto 2000 according to tonina and bellin 2008 the brownian motion models the pore scale dispersion a process occurring at a scale smaller than the darcy scale λ which represents the difference between the particle trajectory and the particle advection displacement the relative importance of the two effects is represented by pe uλ d d11 where d d11 is the pore scale dispersion tensor component along the mean flow direction with a mean velocity u the pore scale displacement derives from a velocity field v d j that can be assumed as statistically independent from vj being associated with physical phenomena with a scale ratio λ λd o 102 o 104 this statistical independence cannot be extended to the particle displacement components because as evidenced by eq 1 the displacement xj vj xj x d j dτ depends on x d j the particles that move according to the darcian velocity vj x have a correlation length λ v j a correlation function ρ v j x j v j 0 v j x j v j 0 v j 0 v j velocity fluctuation and a microscale length ε v j 2 2 ρ v j x j 2 0 λ v j inside which the velocity field can be considered fully correlated tennekes and lumley 1972 in comparison the velocity associated with the description of the pore scale effects v d j x has a correlation length λ d ε v j for this reason the solute particle at the darcy scale of size o ε v j can be considered as composed of a large number of particles having a size smaller than λ d the study of the particle motion according to eq 1 can take advantage of the reverse scheme vanderborght 2001 fiorotto and caroni 2002 instead of moving forward from the injection volume v 0 the method computes the initial location of the particle at time t located at position x 0 within the sampling volume v fig 1 this method is employed to derive the unconditional and conditional concentration cdfs in the case of point samplings it is characterized by v with a dimension of o ε v j for any size lj with j 1 2 and 3 of the hyper rectangle injection volume this is the case for the concentration measurements in sampling wells the following scheme was adopted by caroni and fiorotto 2005 in a 2d monte carlo numerical procedure in four steps 1 generation of a hydraulic conductivity field with a prescribed statistical structure 2 evaluation of the eulerian flow field by solving the flux balance equations with appropriate boundary conditions 3 identification of the instantaneous position at time t 0 of np particles released in v and 4 evaluation of the number of particles n inside v 0 after a travel time τ and computation of the concentration c c 0 n n p where c 0 initial uniform concentration from a theoretical point of view this means that the sampling volume is considered as a single particle at the darcy scale and as a collection of np particles at the pore scale at the darcy scale the displacement in the backward direction starting from v is distributed with pdf of the particle displacement pdf f x while at the pore scale the displacement is normally distributed with pdf of the pore scale pdf ϕ with null mean and variance equal to 2dd τ given that the total displacement of each particle is x xd the probability that a single particle falls in v 0 having taken origin from v according to the reverse scheme in fig 1 conditional on x is p x v 0 φ ξ x x 0 d ξ here the auxiliary variable ξ has its origin at the center of mass of v 0 placed at a distance x 0 from v fig 1 this probability is the same for all the np particles in v whose displacement is mutually independent if n of the np particles fall in v 0 the actual concentration in v is c c 0 n n p thus the probability of c can be computed as the probability of n successes out of npindependent trials and its distribution is binomial benjamin and cornell 1970 the particle displacements at the darcy scale along the three directions in the space xj are independent as a consequence the probability of c is 2 p r o b c c 0 n n p c 0 n p n j 1 3 f j x j p x n 1 p x n p n d x j where n p n is a binomial coefficient and px 1 2 j 1 3 e r f x j l j x j 2 x d j j e r f x j l j x j 2 x d j j the concentration moments can be obtained via eq 2 inferring that np is equal to one in a small sampling volume hypothesis the probability that a single particle at the darcy scale the sampling volume is considered as a single particle with a concentration c 0 falls in the solute area according to eq 2 is 3 p r o b c c 0 c 0 j 1 3 f j x j p x d x j that gives the mean concentration value c x t at x therefore the higher concentration moments of m order are 4 c m x t c m 0 j 1 3 f j x j p x m d x j eqs 3 and 4 for m 2 are equal to equations 30 and 34 in dagan and fiori 1997 for the first and second concentration moments respectively this highlights the congruence between the two approaches in the statistical moments as derived by physical considerations in the dispersion process when it is assumed lagrangian time stationary fiori and dagan 2000 this assumption is implied in the particle diffusion by a random walk process used in the monte carlo approach where a large number of independent particles are tracked in time starting from the same point in a random velocity field via eq 1 e g salandin and fiorotto 1998 caroni and fiorotto 2005 bellin and tonina 2007 from eq 2 one can observe that only the diagonal displacement covariance matrix xjj is taken into account this issue is highlighted in vanderborght 2001 where via the monte carlo approach in a lagrangian framework the spatial covariance of the local concentration is numerically studied using a two particle statistical analysis computing the total particle displacement covariance matrix fiori and dagan 2000 observed that the pore scale particle velocities do not satisfy the lagrangian time stationary hypothesis assumed in dagan and fiori 1997 this fact leads to an incorrect estimation of the concentration variance in order to consider the non stationary process the two particle statistical criteria need to be applied this implies that the total particle trajectory covariance matrix must be considered including the non diagonal terms zij t x x pe where x x is the separator vector between the two particles when the separator vector tends to zero zij t 0 pe is different from xjj t pe showing a jump at this limit and a correlation coefficient ρ zij xjj smaller than one occurs fiori and dagan 2000 as a consequence eq 2 with two particles starting from the same point and both having the trajectories at the darcy scale x and y becomes 5 p r o b c c 0 n x n y 2 n p c 0 n p n x n p n y j 1 3 f j x j y j p x n x 1 p x n p n x p y n y 1 p y n p n y d x j d y j this pdf gives the same c x t at x as eq 3 while the second moment is the probability that both particles x and y fall in the solute area 6 c 2 x t c 0 2 j 1 3 f j x j y j p x p y d x j d y j this result is significantly different from the one achieved by eq 4 assuming the lagrangian time stationary hypothesis via a one particle statistical method dagan and fiori 1997 the lagrangian time stationary occurs for pe case where eq 5 tends to eq 2 decreasing the péclet number the lagrangian time stationary occurs for smaller travel time t that is tu λpe 1 the presented procedure for the evaluation of the concentration pdf can be extended to the case where the concentration ck c 0 n k n p is known at some sampling points located at xk as indicated in fig 1 with k 1 2 and k the observation well where the concentration must be estimated is indicated with k 0 formally the conditional concentration probability at point x 0 conditioned with the concentration measured at the surrounding wells was computed by the following equation benjamin and cornell 1970 7 p c x 0 c x 1 c x k p c x 0 c x 1 c x k p c x 1 c x k according to eq 5 the conditioned variables are the particle displacement xk from the kth sampling points xk with k 1 2 and k while x 0 represents the particle displacement from the generic point x 0 where c must be evaluated therefore eq 7 becomes 8 p r o b c c 0 n 0 n p c 1 c k f x 0 x 1 x k k 0 k j 1 3 n p n k p x j k n k 1 p x j k n p n k d x j k f x 1 x k k 1 k j 1 3 n p n k p x j k n k 1 p x j k n p n k d x j k the displacement pdf f x 0 x 1 x k is a multivariate distribution while p x j k is p x j k 1 2 e r f x j k l j x j k 2 x d j j e r f x j k l j x j k 2 x d j j the computations of eqs 5 to 8 need the definition of the particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale f x 0 x 1 x k this is theoretically derivable according to the first order approximation for σ y 2 1 it can be derived numerically via a monte carlo procedure by increasing the log conductivity variance e g salandin and fiorotto 1998 vanderborght 2001 srzic et al 2013 this analysis is important in groundwater monitoring and risk evaluation as it allows an estimation of the spatial distribution of concentration starting from the ones detected at the sampling points papapetridis and paleologos 2011 3 unconditional concentration pdf first order analysis according to the first order analysis f x 0 x 1 x k is gaussian assuming the independence of the plume centroid fluctuations x b in respect to the particle trajectory fluctuations x e g salandin and fiorotto 1993 nicolini et al 2006 the particle displacement variance is equal to x j j x j j x b j j while the mean particle displacement is x t ut this assumption allows the computation of the unconditional pdf in the lagrangian time stationary condition according to the normal distribution to evaluate the unconditional pdf in a non stationary condition eq 5 and the conditional concentration eq 8 the definition of the non diagonal displacement covariance matrix zjk t x x pe where j and k 1 2 and 3 is needed starting from the log conductivity covariance structure assuming t 0 0 the elements of this matrix are computed according to the following formula fiori and dagan 1999 2000 9 z i j t

d d p q t d k the numerical integrations here are performed in a 2d framework in agreement with the majority of the previous studies using the monte carlo approach this means that the results are valid in a regional scale context where the horizontal extent of the aquifer is in the order of kilometers dagan 1989 at this scale all the variables are averaged over the depth of the aquifer and they depend on the horizontal coordinates solely locally the additional degree of freedom in 3d produces a larger stretch and deformation in the pollutant cloud triggering local mass flux and therefore creating a situation that is more favorable to dilution and mixing recently the study of jankovic et al 2017 presented the results of extensive and accurate 3d simulations of flow and transport for five different log conductivity structures for σ y 2 8 the results suggest a universality that distinguishes 3d simulations of flow and transport from 2d simulations at a regional scale and in a 2d framework fig 1 according to fourier analysis van lent and kitanidis 1989 the spectral component of the velocity covariance function u i j k can be obtained in terms of the fourier series of the log transmissivity covariance s y y m n with k m n where m and n are wave numbers on directions j 1 2 respectively performing quadratures in eqs 9 and 10 one obtains fiorotto and caroni 2002 11

centroid being x 0 ut where the maximum value of concentration is expected since l 2 the plume length is much larger than the darcy length scale the ergodic conditions are assured salandin and fiorotto 1993 in the ergodic conditions x b j j tends to zero so that it can be neglected in the computation the concentration cdf computed according to eqs 2 and 5 are compared and discussed initially within the one particle monte carlo approach framework caroni and fiorotto 2005 the effect of the choice of np on the accuracy of the concentration cdf is evaluated according to eq 2 for np 10 50 100 200 500 and 1000 with t 5λ u pe uλ dd 11 100 and x 0 λ 5 0 as shown in fig 2 while the mean concentration results are independent of the choice of np the upper moments show a slight variability due to an increment in the accuracy of the evaluation of the cdf especially on the tails from fig 2 it can be observed that choosing np in the range of 100 200 in the cdf computation a good balance is obtained in terms of accuracy of the results and computational efficiency therefore np 150 was chosen for further numerical simulations in fig 2 the concentration cdf computed according to the β type distribution function is also reported here the first ten theoretical moments calculated using eq 4 are compared with the β type distribution function moments fiorotto and caroni 2002 caroni and fiorotto 2005 comparing the numerical evaluation of the concentration cdf with the moment fitting of the β type distribution function highlighted the feasibility of the β type distribution function in describing the concentration cdf especially at high σ y 2 values the use of the β type cdf can give a well defined shape of the concentration cdf as obtained by the monte carlo simulations the ability of the β type distribution function in evaluation of the concentration cdf has been widely investigated in the literature e g bellin and tonina 2007 cirpka et al 2008 bellin et al 2011 and numerically verified schwede et al 2008 meyer et al 2010 srzic et al 2013 despite the evidence in favor of the β type distribution function in the works mentioned above de barros and fiori 2014 provided additional and more rigorous verification according to eq 5 in a two particle statistical framework the results showed the potential of the β type cdf function as a preliminary prediction tool in applications and or as prior information at early stages of site characterizations in fig 3 a comparison between the cdf computed via eqs 2 and 5 at the plume centroid is shown in this figure the solution obtained via the integration of eq 2 is plotted using a continuous line and the solution obtained by integration of eq 5 is reported by dashed lines from the comparison it is evident that the lagrangian time non stationary tends to reduce the probability of occurrence for the smaller values of the concentration while tending to increase the probability of occurrence for the larger ones because the mean concentration is equal in both cases this implies a reduction in the concentration variance and the concentration coefficient of variation in respect to the lagrangian time stationary scheme in agreement with the results of dagan and fiori 2000 this is highlighted in fig 4 where the ratio between the concentration variance σ c 2 computed via eqs 6 and 4 is plotted on the dimensionless parameter tu λpe in the range 10 pe 1000 and 5 t u λ 20 the same behavior is expected for the associated coefficient of variation because the mean concentration is equal in both cases the reduction in the concentration variance increasing tu λpe is a favorable effect from an environmental standpoint for tu λpe 0 where pe or t 0 fig 4 shows that the ratio between the two concentration variances tends to one reducing the pore scale effects in pollutant dispersion process fiori 1996 reducing the pore scale effects the process tends to the lagrangian time stationary fiori and dagan 2000 in this case as evidenced in fig 3 the concentration cdf tends toward the bimodal distribution f c c 1 c c 0 δ c c c 0 δ c c 0 dagan 1989 for pe the concentration standard deviation is σ c c c 0 c that assumes its maximum value 0 5 c 0 at points where the mean concentration is c 0 5 c 0 the coefficient of variation tends to a constant value equal to one fiori and dagan 2000 in real life cases this is attained for high pe values and for short travel time t 0 where in determining the particle dispersion the darcy scale effects are predominant over the pore scale effects with reference to the use of the β type distribution function fig 2 shows a rough approximation of the cdf that does not take into account the difference in the cdf between the stationary and non stationary cases fig 3 from a theoretical point of view this can be useful as a preliminary prediction tool in application de barros and fiori 2014 this issue is shown in fig 5 where for t 10λ u and for pe 10 100 and 1000 the β type distribution functions computed for the stationary and non stationary cases are compared with the respective theoretical cdfs fig 5 evidences that the β type distribution function increases its accuracy in the cdf interpolation by increasing pe as pointed out by caroni and fiorotto 2000 this does not happen for pe 10 in discrepancy with bellin and tonina 2007 even for pe 0 which is the complete mixing case the β type distribution function must converge theoretically to the gaussian one in fig 5a one can observe that the β type distribution function has practically a gaussian shape in the case of fig 1 with point sampling and rectangular injection areas and assuming gaussian particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale the mean concentration can be computed as fiori and dagan 2000 fiorotto and caroni 2002 14 c x t c 0 j 1 3 1 2 e r f x j l j τ u j 2 w j e r f x j l j τ u j 2 w j with wj xjj 2d d jj τ the second moment of eq 6 becomes 15 c 2 x

identical results in concentration moments from eqs 2 and 6 with eqs 14 and 15 are justified because the binomial distribution tends to the gaussian distribution when increasing np benjamin and cornell 1970 this allows computing the β type distribution function easily which depends on these two moments making it a useful tool in groundwater management where budget constraints can limit a detailed knowledge of the concentration field this provides a quick estimate of the spatial distribution of concentration by means of suitable spatial statistical transport measures boso et al 2013 in this framework the use of a methodology based on the conditional concentration analysis could be useful to improve the reliability of these tools as well as in the design of optimal groundwater monitoring wells network sreekanth et al 2017 4 conditional concentration pdf first order analysis in groundwater management the monitoring of concentrations at some points in an aquifer is generally available so that the concentrations are known at some points in this context the one point cdf must be conditioned with the measured data by obtaining the conditional concentration using eq 8 in figs 6 10 according to the first order analysis the conditional and unconditional concentrations cdfs are compared with different concentrations at the sampling point locations pe log conductivity variance and travel time the aim is to highlight the effect of the conditioning on the concentration cdf at the observation point x 0 with reference to fig 1 the concentration cdf is evaluated at the point x 0 λ 5 0 according to the concentration as measured at one of the points xk λ as stated by eq 7 the conditional probability p c x 0 c xk is 15 p c x 0 c x k p c x 0 c x k p c x k where p c x 0 c xk represents the joint probability for σ y 2 0 2 and pe 100 in fig 6a the conditioning is performed according to the concentration measurements transversal to the mean flow direction so that xk λ 5 0 1 xk λ 5 0 5 and xk λ 5 1 correspond to ζ λ ζ 0 and η λ η 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively the measured concentrations at these points are c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 from fig 6a by comparing the unconditional and conditional cdfs the effect of the conditioning on cdf is evident this effect decreases by increasing the transversal distance when the transversal distance is larger than λ this effect tends to be practically irrelevant the conditioning effect is related to the particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale as the pore scale displacement is uncorrelated increasing the distance r x 0 xk the particle displacement at the darcy scale becomes more and more uncorrelated and the concentration pdf at x 0 tends to become independent from the concentration measured at xk as a consequence the joint concentration p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 p c xk and the conditional probability tends to the unconditional probability p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 this fact is manifested in fig 6a for the case of η 1 for σ y 2 0 2 and pe 100 in fig 6b the conditioning is performed according to the concentration measurements along the mean flow direction so that x λ 4 9 0 x λ 4 5 0 and x λ 4 0 correspond to η λ η 0 and ζ λ ζ 0 1 0 5 and 1 respectively the measured concentrations are c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 in the case of small distance between the points xk and x 0 where r 0 1λ the conditional concentration cdf is quite similar to the case of fig 6a for this small distance the difference in the covariance matrix by changing the direction of r and starting from x 0 is small increasing the distance r a significant difference in the conditional cdf behavior is observed with respect to the case of fig 6a increasing r p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 p c xk and p c x 0 c xk p c x 0 in the longitudinal direction the distance r to obtain the statistical independence between the concentrations c x 0 and c xk is one order of magnitude larger than in the transversal direction this is evidenced by the behavior of zjk t x 0 xk pe varying the distance r for example along the longitudinal direction the ratio z 11 5 λ 0 100 z 11 5 0 0 100 0 94 while in the transversal direction the ratio z 11 5 0 λ 100 z 11 5 0 0 100 0 39 so increasing the distance r the conditioning effect is more relevant along the longitudinal flow direction in respect to the transversal direction this can be observed by comparing fig 6a with b from fig 6a and b with reference to the distance r 0 1λ where the conditioning effect is more marked one can note that the conditioning increases the probability of occurrence of the concentrations at x 0 close to the one as measured at xk in the case of fig 6a the ratios between conditional and unconditional probabilities at x 0 142 133 and 196 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the case of fig 6b the ratios 168 144 and 230 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in fig 7 a and b the same cases as reported in fig 6a and b are shown increasing pe from 100 to 1000 by increasing pe the relative effect of the pore scale in the dispersion process decreases from a physical point of view pores are responsible for the mixing of clean and solute containing waters this effect is due to the fringes of clean and solute containing waters tending to mutually infiltrate whenever pore scale effects are negligible the movement through a heterogeneous medium produces a plume deformation with negligible dilution thus point samplings always produce a dichotomous answer 0 c 0 according to the actual position of the plume this tendency is well defined in fig 7a and b with reference to the unconditional cdf by converse when the relative role of pores increases some mixing can be expected and intermediate concentrations are possible fig 6 from fig 7a and b the conditioning effect increases the mixing of the plume which increases the probability of intermediate concentrations that is well evident for ζ and η 0 1 this effect tends to be reduced when increasing η in agreement with the comments above on fig 6a also in this case the conditioning effect is more relevant along ζ in respect to η from fig 7a and b with reference to the case of r 0 1λ in the transversal direction the conditional probability ratios at x 0 200 190 and 540 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the longitudinal direction the conditional probability ratios 168 144 and 230 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively comparing these results with the ones of fig 6 increments in the probability ratios with pe is evident this is due to a decrement in spreading of the pore scale particles the conditioning effect is related to the particle displacement pdf at the darcy scale as the pore scale displacement is uncorrelated for this reason an enhancement of the conditioning effect is expected when increasing the darcy scale particle displacement variance this can be due to an increment in the log conductivity variance and or in travel time the effect of the increment in the log conductivity variance is shown in fig 8 where it is fixed equal to 1 0 comparing the results shown in this figure with the ones shown in fig 6 σ y 2 0 2 the effect of an increment in the log conductivity variance in the concentration cdf can be detected with reference to the unconditional cdf one can note that the same mixing effect is detected for larger value of c c 0 with the same value of pe while an increment in the probability close to a null concentration is manifested this fact can be explained from a physical point of view considering that an increment in the particle displacement variance corresponds to an increase in spreading of the particle at the darcy scale this reduces the number of darcy scale particles close to v 0 starting from v according to the reverse formulation fiorotto and caroni 2002 that are able to produce a finite value in the concentration due to the pore dispersion effects with the same pe and np this change in the unconditional cdf shape also influences the conditioning effect as evidenced by comparing figs 6 and 7 for example fixing the value of c x 0 for σ y 2 1 the conditional cdf is always smaller than the unconditional one on the contrary this does not happen for σ y 2 0 2 from fig 8a and b with reference to the case of r 0 1λ in the transversal direction the conditional probability ratios at x 0 165 212 and 278 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the longitudinal direction the ratios 185 229 and 328 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively comparing these results with the ones of fig 6 an increment in the ratio between conditional and unconditional probabilities is evident increasing the log conductivity variance this is due to an increment in spreading of the particles at the darcy scale at early travel time from the injection the pore scale related to the mixing occurs mostly at the plume boundary followed by a progressive dilution effect in both directions that are spreading solute towards the outer unpolluted region and intrusion of clean water towards the plume core increasing the travel time with the same pe the dilution increases as the displacement variance at the pore scale particle increases this is evident comparing figs 6 with 9 where with reference to the unconditional probability the probability for the higher concentrations decreases the effect of the increment in particles mixing at the pore scale is also evident in the conditioning for the higher concentrations in fact at x 0 λ 20 the cdf curves with c c 0 0 5 and c c 0 0 9 are closer to each other while in fig 6 at x 0 λ 5 the two cdf curves are well separated increasing the travel time an increment in the spreading of the particle at the darcy scale is detected similar to the case of σ y 2 1 fig 8 furthermore an increment in the unconditional probability for smaller concentrations occurs in respect to the case of fig 6 also in this case for a fixed value of c x 0 the cdf is always smaller than the unconditional one from fig 9a and b with reference to the case of r 0 1λ the conditional probability ratios 138 209 and 223 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively in the longitudinal direction the ratios 142 209 and 223 are computed for c c 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 respectively comparing these results with the ones of fig 6 increments in the ratios between the conditional and unconditional probabilities are evident increasing the travel time for c c 0 0 5 and 0 9 while a small decrement is detected for c c 0 0 1 this is due to the opposite role of the increment in variance of the particle displacement at the darcy scale and at the pore scale the first one increases the ratio fig 8 and the second one decreases the ratio this case is the opposite of fig 7 the effect of the pore scale in the conditional concentration is well evidenced for pe 10 as shown in fig 10 in this case the pore scale dispersion tends to predominate the dispersion at the darcy scale as a consequence the difference between the conditional and unconditional cdfs becomes unimportant from a practical point of view in natural aquifers pe is in the range of 100 10 000 thus from figs 6 to 10 the effect of the conditioning can be estimated varying the log conductivity variance pe and travel time for the cases investigated here with r 0 1λ the ratio between the conditional and unconditional concentrations has a mean value 220 and a standard deviation 85 these results highlight the importance of the conditioning analysis with reference to eu directive 1999 31 eu on the landfill of waste in water resource risk evaluation this directive states that to detect contaminant concentrations above regulatory threshold values sampling for monitoring purposes must be performed papapetridis and paleologos 2011 the conditional cdf can be used to improve the forecast of point concentration when the concentration time measured in observation wells is available the first order analysis states a relationship between the time and space coordinates according to the taylor hypothesis taylor 1938 in this context a space time relationship is assessed e g barjastehmaleki et al 2016a barjastehmaleki et al 2015 as ς λ tu λ this gives a time space relationship that is t ς u as a consequence the conditional concentration cdf shown in figs 6 10 with reference to the separator dimensionless distance ς also corresponds to a lag dimensionless time t 5 conclusions in this paper the unconditional and conditional concentration pdfs in natural aquifers are theoretically investigated the statistical moments of this new formulation correspond to the ones known in the literature as defined theoretically based on physical considerations of the phenomena this is drawn out by the theoretical analysis of a former monte carlo simulation procedure and it is in agreement with these numerical results it is highlighted that the particle monte carlo simulation gives a lagrangian time stationary solution according to dagan and fiori 1997 this solution is valid for tu λpe 0 when the darcy scale effects are predominant over the pore scale effects in the dispersion process dagan and fiori 2000 observed that the pore scale particle displacement does not satisfy the lagrangian time stationary hypothesis that was assumed in dagan and fiori 1997 in this case the unconditional pdf is derived theoretically by the use of the two particle statistical criteria the comparison between the non stationary and stationary pdfs highlighted a remarkable difference when increasing tu λpe this is evidenced by a decrease in the concentration variance ratio increasing tu λpe the stationary case gives larger value in the concentration variance in agreement with the theoretical analyses of dagan and fiori 2000 the β type distribution function compared with the theoretical results shows a rough approximation that is unable to take into account the differences between the stationary and non stationary solutions starting from the unconditional pdf the conditional concentration pdf measured in sampling wells is derived from the comparison between the results obtained by the two pdfs changing the sampling points concentration and position pe log conductivity variance and travel time the importance of conditioning in water resource monitoring and risk evaluation is demonstrated with reference to eu directive 1999 31 eu the numerical analysis is performed in a 2d regional case pollutant transport and in an ergodic condition via the linear theory these analyses underlined that the conditioning effect is enhanced increasing the particle displacement variance at the darcy scale while it is reduced when the particle displacement variance at the pore scale increases according to the taylor hypothesis these effects as observed in space can be transformed in time this hypothesis is congruent with the first order analysis appendix hydro geophysical methods are capable of defining the volume averaged resident concentration i e the mass of a sample divided by its volume interrogating a volume of the subsurface in situ this is the case of the present analysis based on the resident concentration evaluation on well samples when the water is pumped at a point for analysis it is implied that measured concentrations are flux averaged i e the mass rate divided by the flow rate different theoretical transport models may be required to interpret concentration derived from tracer tests in the volume averaged and flux averaged cases becker and tsoflias 2010 conservation of the mass requires that the cumulative mass passed through a given control plane at location x through time t must be equal to the total mass downstream of x at time t so that 15a v 0 t c f x t d t x c x t d x where v and cf are the water velocity and flux concentration respectively eq 15a leads to the following relationship between the resident and flux concentrations 16 c f x t 1 v t x c x t d x this relationship was studied by zang et al 2006 in the non fickian diffusion case defining a relationship between the resident and flux concentrations that are diverse this also implies a difference between the resident and flux concentration pdfs the flux concentration describes the mass that has moved downstream of a sample point eq 15a this measure is important when estimating the risk posed by a toxic solute de barros et al 2012 the purpose of the transport models in risk analysis is to predict an environmental performance metric epm α de barros et al 2012 that is 1 α c if the resident concentration exceeds a predefined maximum concentration this is the epm of the abovementioned approach and 2 α τ if a contamination reaches a control plane at x before a specified travel time τ in this case the flux concentration cf is the relevant variable according to eq 15a other epms can be defined with reference to the human health risk the use of the correct concept of epm depends on the specific problem with reference tomeasurement method monitoring setup goltz et al 2007 and authorities directives average quantities are often used to reduce the epm variance in fact to increase the robustness of the resident concentration evaluation boso et al 2013 described the probability of exceeding a given threshold regardless of where this actually occurs averaging the point concentration in space this approach is applied in risk analysis starting from the point resident concentration modeled by the β type distribution function the flux averaged concentration in risk analysis was used by moslehi and de barros 2017 as the epm was assumed equal to the peak flux averaged concentration α c cp at a given control plane located at position x perpendicular to the mean flow direction cp x max m t qw where m t is the mass discharge rate through the control plane and qw is the volumetric discharge at the control plane position numerical analysis pointed out a log normal probability distribution for cp this distribution is in agreement with the previous studies moslehi and de barros 2017 where the pdf of the increase lifetime cancer risk which is proportional to the flux averaged concentration was inferred to be log normal this pdf in cp is based on the flux concentration analysis and it is different from the one defined via the resident concentration in boso et al 2013 in conclusion the approaches based on the resident or flux concentration are theoretically analogous the choice depends on the specific problem expecting results in the epm and concentration measurement procedures in situ resident or flux concentration however confusion between the two approaches may lead to a gross misinterpretation of observations serious model miscalibration and errors in the transport process analysis 
607,there exists an increasing need to understand the impact of climate change on the hydrological extremes of flood and drought collectively referred to as hydro hazards at present current methodology are limited in their scope particularly with respect to inadequate representation of the uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain this paper proposes spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots hotspots of change where concurrent increase in mean annual flood and drought events is projected we apply a quasi ergodic analysis of variance qe anova framework to detail both the magnitude and the sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain for the mean projected mean change signal whilst accounting for non stationarity the framework is designed for application across a wide geographical range and is thus readily transferable we illustrate the ability of the framework through application to 239 uk catchments based on hydroclimatological projections from the edge project 5 cmi5 gcms and 3 hms forced under rcp8 5 the results indicate that half of the projected hotspots are temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year exacerbating potential impacts on society the north east of scotland and south west of the uk were identified as spatio temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern this intensification of the hydrologic dynamic timing and seasonality of hydro hazards over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability in some instances exceeding 80 of the total variance critically clear spatial variability in the sources of modelling uncertainty was also observed highlighting the need to apply a spatially consistent methodology such as that presented this application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty in terms of water management planning such findings allow for more focussed studies with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process keywords climate change climate change impacts uncertainty water management compound hydro hazards multi model ensemble 1 introduction hydrological hazards are defined as extreme events associated with the occurrence movement and distribution of water specifically floods and droughts national research council 1999 collet et al 2018 flood hazards are the result of excess water from one or multiple sources e g coastal fluvial or surface sub surface water while drought hazards arise from a deficit of river flow or precipitation over a prolonged period henceforward we collectively term flood and drought as hydro hazards climate change is significantly altering hydrological dynamics with a general tendency to amplify hydrological extremes fischer and knutti 2016 schleussner et al 2017 marx et al 2018 samaniego et al 2018 thober et al 2018 vousdoukas et al 2018 and thus increase the influence on exposed populations and economic assets at present these changes are not widely understood due to the complex interactions between climate hydrological systems and their regional variations e g manfreda and caylor 2013 devkota and gyawali 2015 collet et al 2018 li et al 2018 during the period 2000 2015 hydro hazards directly affected almost one million people in the uk at a total estimated cost of 36 billion gbp guha sapir et al 2018 accordingly it is necessary to consider changes in hydrological dynamics and flow regimes at present and in the future typically hydro hazards are considered independently in water management planning in the uk hydrological impact assessments of climate change have largely focussed exclusively on either high flows prudhomme et al 2012 kay et al 2014a 2014b sayers et al 2016 collet et al 2017 or low flows christierson et al 2012 watts et al 2015 marx et al 2018 further inconsistencies in methodology lead to conflicting reports of the hydrological impact of climate change in the uk examples include disparities at the spatial scale kay et al 2014a 2014b watts et al 2015 or in the climate projections used collet et al 2017 marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 overall collet et al 2018 marx et al 2018 and thober et al 2018 suggest a general increase in hydrological extremes across the uk especially in the south west of england west of wales and north east of scotland whilst kay et al 2014a and b report the greatest change in high flows in the north west of scotland to ensure a holistic understanding there is a clear need to consider changing hydro hazards concurrently i e both ends of the hydrological cycle must be explored at the same time in addition to the increased severity and frequency of hydro hazards under climate change compound events may exacerbate the impact on society hao et al 2018 in ipcc 2012 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc define compound events as 1 two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously or successively 2 combinations of extreme events with underlying conditions that amplify the impact of the events or 3 combinations of events that are not extremes in themselves but lead to an extreme event or impact when combined i e clustered multiple events these compound events need not occur simultaneously they may also be the result of successive contrasting extremes such as drought and flood ipcc 2012 examples include the successive drought and flood events of 2010 2012 and 2015 2016 in the uk parry et al 2013 and tasmania australia respectively csiro 2018 and the ongoing concurrent drought flood in queensland australia butterworth and margolis 2019 in order to build resilience for climate change adaptation there is a need to further characterise the spatial and temporal clustering of compound extremes hao et al 2018 the flow projections used in climate change impact assessment studies are the outputs of a long and complex modelling chain general circulation models gcms are forced by emissions scenarios the outputs of which are downscaled to the regional scale where hydrological models hms propagate the climate signal producing hydrological outputs such as discharge soil moisture and groundwater recharge with each of these modelling steps uncertainty in the model structure input and parameters cascades propagating or constraining the uncertainty through the modelling chain warmink et al 2010 smith et al 2018 differences in hm structure have been identified as a source of uncertainty that should not be neglected dankers et al 2014 donnelly et al 2017 gosling et al 2017 one approach to the portioning of uncertainty is the quasi ergodic analysis of variance qe anova hawkins and sutton 2009 hingray and saïd 2014 vidal et al 2016 hingray et al 2019 which through a quasi ergodic assumption is able to account for the non stationarity of climate change this paper proposes a spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots in the context of the framework four classes of compound hydro hazard hotspots are defined table 1 compound spatially compound temporally compound and spatio temporally compound the framework sees the determination of the concurrent change in the mean annual hydro hazard from the baseline to future in this way it is possible to identify hotspots of change where hydro hazards intensify or emerge under a changing climate we term these compound hydro hazard hotspots i e intra annual successive contrasting extremes as per the ipcc definition previously consideration of the spatial and temporal clustering of hotspots determines whether these compound hydro hazard hotspots are spatial and or temporally clustered the framework is presented through application to 239 catchments across the uk using transient climate projections 1970 2099 compound hydro hazard hotspots are identified for the far future 2071 2099 the objectives of the framework are two fold 1 to identify classify table 1 and analyse compound hydro hazard hotspots 2 to quantify and characterise the sources of uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain using a qe anova framework with a view to understanding the total and fractional uncertainty associated with the hydro hazard projections the novelty of this impact and uncertainty framework lies in the classification of the compound hydro hazard extremes in a spatial and temporal context the proposed framework allows for the explicit quantification of the uncertainty in the projected hydro hazard hotspots thereby facilitating a greater understanding of future water in security 2 data in this study the methodological framework was applied across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland uk daily flow projections were drawn from the edge project end to end demonstrator for improved decision making in the water sector in europe c3s 2018 a two year proof of concept funded by the copernicus climate change service the edge project combined climate data and state of the art hydrological modelling to estimate river flows as well as a range of sectoral climate impact indicators across the european domain http edge climate copernicus eu for additional information see wanders et al 2018 2 1 models the edge project utilised a multi model ensemble of gcms and hms to capture uncertainty in

marx et al 2018 the four hms used in edge are mhm samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 noah mp niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 vic liang et al 1996 cherkauer et al 2003 and pcr globwb2 sutanudjaja et al 2018 the hms simulate surface and subsurface runoff as well as other land states fluxes e g evapotranspiration and soil moisture the models noah mp and vic are classified as land surface models capturing land atmosphere interactions whilst mhm and pcr globwb2 are focussed on water balance components only for consistency and efficiency a single river routing model mrm samaniego et al 2010 was used to derive river flows based on gridded runoff calculations output by the hms the mrm model is based on the muskingum algorithm and is able to estimate streamflow at various spatial resolutions without recalibration of parameters thober et al 2018 2019 the hms were validated for high medium and low flows across a diverse range of european catchments marx et al 2018 samaniego et al 2018 thober et al 2018 in the validation of the flow projections outputs from pcrglob wb2 were often uniform in nature failing to capture the processes leading to high low flows the lack of clearly defined peak flows meant that the necessary event extraction was not possible see section 3 1 consequently flow projections from pcrglob wb2 were not considered in this study the validation of the edge flow projections is further considered in appendix a 1 2 2 emissions scenarios the edge project considered simulations of transient historical 1971 2000 and future 2011 2099 climate under both rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the lowest and highest representative concentration pathways rcps respectively the focus of this study is rcp8 5 which formed part of the core experiments under cmip5 taylor et al 2011 rcp8 5 represents a high emission trajectory the result of no explicit implementation of climate policy leading to a global mean temperature increase of 2 6 4 8 c by the end of the century riahi et al 2011 2 3 catchments the catchment selection process is detailed in appendix a 2 in this study a total of 239 gauges were considered across 142 parent and 97 child sub catchments the total catchment area covers 47 785 km2 of the uk their spatial distribution is illustrated in fig 1 fig 1 also highlights a north south division in population distribution ranging from 100 000 in the north of scotland to over 3 000 000 in the east midlands and south east england thirty six percent of the population of the uk based on an estimate of 66 million in november 2018 ons 2018 are located within the modelled catchment areas from the perspective of the number of people exposed a greater proportion of the population is likely to be impacted due to incurred losses e g water supply infrastructure crop yield etc 3 methods this paper proposes a spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots an overview of the three stages of the proposed framework is presented in fig 2 in stage 1 hydro hazard events are identified and event metrics extracted per modelling chain per catchment from this annual summary metrics and mean annual metrics are determined the second stage sees the determination of the change signal the mean change across the modelling chains in the mean annual metrics from the baseline 1971 2000 to the far future 2071 2099 per catchment compound hydro hazard hotspots are subsequently classified table 1 in stage 3 the uncertainty is characterised following the qe anova approach a noise free signal is determined per modelling chain per catchment followed by application of the anova at the catchment level the application of the framework is discussed with reference to the 239 catchments across the uk described in the previous section 3 1 stage 1 identification of hydro hazards stage 1 begins with event extraction fig 2 1 1 following collet et al 2018 catchment streamflow thresholds for the extraction of flood and drought events were defined on the baseline historic simulations 1971 2000 for a mean of three independent events per annum across the 15 hydroclimatological modelling chains 5 gcms and 3 hms for each catchment and modelling chain flood events were extracted from the peak over threshold pot time series following bayliss and jones 1993 where a flood event is defined as a period when daily flow is continuously above the defined threshold for an average of three pot per annum drought equivalent characteristics were determined using the r package lfstat version 0 9 4 koffler et al 2016 in lfstat a drought event occurs when daily flow falls below a given threshold here a varying q90 threshold defined as the flow equally or exceeded 90 of the time was specified per julian day i e 365 thresholds independent drought events were identified by applying the inter event time and volume criterion method gustard and demuth 2009 koffler et al 2016 events were pooled where the inter event time is less than 5 days and the drought to inter event volume ratio fell below 0 1 three event metrics 1 2 describing the duration timing day of year and magnitude peak flow and flow deficit volume below threshold for flood and drought respectively were determined for each independent event for details see fig a3 from these event metrics annual summary metrics 1 3 were subsequently determined a count of the number of independent events per year frequency was also made the annual mean per metric was then determined 1 4 for the historic simulation 1971 2000 this represents the 30 year mean whilst for the transient future projections 2005 2099 a 30 year rolling mean was determined for example 2011 2040 2012 2041 and so on the mean annual metrics represent the data input to stages 2 and 3 fig 2 3 2 stage 2 compound hydro hazard classification stage 2 utilises the outputs from stage 1 1 4 for each catchment the mean change signal 2 1 from the baseline 1971 2000 to far future 2071 2099 was determined for the frequency magnitude and duration metrics per catchment per modelling chain the mean change signal across the 15 modelling chains was subsequently determined per catchment in the framework a compound hydro hazard is the concurrent increase in the mean annual frequency magnitude and duration of flood and drought events total six metrics a compound hydro hazard hotspot represents a concurrent increase in these six metrics above a defined threshold t table 1 and fig 3 region iv after collet et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis was applied to determine exceedance thresholds above which 20 of the catchments lie 2 2 table 2 the hydro hazard hotspots 2 3 were further classified 2 4 into different types of compound hydro hazard as per table 1 the temporal aspect is represented by the mean annual time of year and the degree of seasonality in the far future 2071 2099 1 4b seasonality is defined as the concentration of events around the 30 year mean julian day determined using circular statistics following the approach of bayliss and jones 1993 and institute of hydrology 1999 for example calculations see supplement in formetta et al 2018 a value of zero indicates a lack of seasonality where events are widely dispersed throughout the year whilst a value greater than 0 6 indicates that events are concentrated at a particular time of year formetta et al 2018 i e seasonally occurring events 3 3 stage 3 characterisation of uncertainty the spatial variability of the hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty associated with the annual mean frequency magnitude and duration metrics was determined through the application of a qe anova approach per catchment thus the total uncertainty may be partitioned in terms of the relative contribution of each source of uncertainty this method is based on the quasi ergodic assumption for transient climate simulations hingray and saïd 2014 where for a sufficiently long time period it is assumed that all possible states are captured thereby reducing the extrapolation out with the sample space the qe anova approach accounts for both modelling uncertainty and internal variability the internal variability represents the variation of climate on both a large and local scale representing natural fluctuations of climate and variation in local meteorology respectively this variation may be observed through multiple evolutions of a given gcm and downscaling model in this study the residuals capture both the internal variability and statistical downscaling uncertainty as only one method is applied based on geostatistical external drift kriging see marx et al 2018 it should be noted that the quasi ergodic assumption is only applicable for sufficiently large sample sizes the ratio of the time series length to the size of the sliding window here the sample size of 4 17 1971 2099 125 30 yr is deemed suitable being comparable with previous studies such as vidal et al 2016 sample size 4 25 1980 2065 85 20 yr the first stage of the qe anova approach sees the determination of the noise free signal nfs 3 1 per catchment per modelling chain for each metric linear trendlines were fitted to both the baseline simulations and transient projections after vidal et al 2016 a linear trend model was selected to prevent overfitting of inter annual fluctuations the baseline linear model was also fixed due to a relatively short baseline period the nfs per modelling chain m at time t represents the change in the trend model output y relative to the average of the baseline trend model y0 following hingray and saïd 2014 the nfs is defined as 1 n f s m t y m t y o for the absolute change in frequency and duration and 2 n f s m t y m t y o 1 for the relative change in magnitude following a classical two way anova framework 3 2 without interaction the nfs was partitioned into the variance associated with the gcm hm and residuals for a three way anova see vidal et al 2016 for further details see hingray and saïd 2014 the sum of these variances is equal to the total uncertainty t t the fraction of total variance t t explained by each source of uncertainty u t was determined as u t t t 3 3 4 results 4 1 compound hydro hazard hotspots 4 1 1 classification under rcp8 5 for the mean change signal mean result from the multi model ensemble a total of 230 out of 239 catchments see an increase in the compound hydro hazard in the far future 2071 2099 fig 4 a of these 230 more than half 144 lie within region ii fig 3 i e the concurrent increase in the mean annual flood metrics is in excess of the table 2 flood thresholds conversely only 39 catchments lie within region iii forty seven compound hydro hazard hotspots region iv were identified accounting for 35 47 785 km2 of the total catchment area considered in this study the 47 compound hydro hazard hotspots were further classified as per table 1 taking spatially clustered catchments first the majority of these hotspots are concentrated in the south west of england and wales as well as localised areas in the midlands and east of england see fig 1 for regions in scotland hotspots are located across east scotland and the highlands islands northern ireland features a single hotspot in the east on the upper bann at movallen these hotspot regions may be described as being spatially compound at the inter catchment level nine further catchments were identified as spatially compound at the intra catchment level i e contain child catchments identified as hotspots fig 4b e across the uk the hotspots are primarily headwater sub catchments or headwaters and the downstream outlet fig 5 further highlights two spatio temporally compound hydro hazard hotspot regions the first is the north and east of scotland region containing six hotspots including the loch ness and river tay catchments the largest lake and river by volume in the uk respectively drought is projected to occur in the summer months jja for all hotspots in the region the pressure in the region is further increased by the presence of the two concurrent hotspots the second spatio temporally compound hotspot region is located in the south west encompassing the south of wales and south west england as shown in fig 4 a number of the catchments in this region are nested with a number of headwaters identified as hotspots in this region there is a clustering of consecutive flood and drought events occurring over mam and jja respectively with flood events preceding the drought there may be an opportunity to store floodwaters and thereby offset the effect of drought in these regions 4 1 2 change signal fig 6 shows the projected mean change signal for the frequency magnitude and duration metrics for the 47 compound hydro hazard hotspots identified beginning with drought frequency fig 6a a uniform increase of one event per annum is projected for all hotspots this limited change is in part due to their longer temporal nature relative to high flow events and is therefore unsurprising collet et al 2018 with regards to flood frequency fig 6b the largest increases up to 8 events per annum are projected in scotland east and highlands and islands and the south west more generally england and wales the projected change in magnitude fig 6c and d reveals greater spatial variation across the compound hydro hazard hotspots in scotland floods are projected to increase by up to 14 compared to a doubling for droughts i e 110 in the south west of england there is a similar picture for floods by contrast across east wales and the west midlands droughts generally see the greater increase in magnitude for the drought mean change signal a clear north south divide is evident with the flow deficit volume in the south at least double that of the north fig 6e and f reveals regional changes in event duration in the south west of the uk wales the west midlands and the south west of england the drought duration is projected to be 2 2 5 times greater than the rest of the uk this trend is reversed for floods with the largest increases projected across scottish catchments up to 20 days by contrast in the south the increase in flood duration is on average 5 10 days in summary the mean change signal suggests that the projected increase in drought magnitude is likely a product of the increase in duration rather than frequency 1 event per annum by comparison flood events are projected to become more frequent with smaller increases in the magnitude and duration of individual events the spatial distribution and scale of the projections for magnitude and duration are consistent with collet et al 2018 cmip3 sres a1b medium emissions scenario the principle difference lies in the projected change in event frequency with collet et al 2018 reporting parity in flood and drought frequency the use of different emissions scenarios hms and gcms may account for some of this lack of agreement despite these differences it is appreciable to see the similarity in results 4 2 partitioned uncertainty 4 2 1 all 239 catchments the focus herein is on the uncertainty corresponding to the mean change signal projections and compound hydro hazard hotspots i e the far future 2071 2099 fig 7 shows the fraction of total variance associated with each source of uncertainty for all 239 catchments for the mean annual frequency magnitude and duration metrics by generalising across all catchments in this way it can be seen that the hms consistently represent the largest source of variability whilst gcms are the smallest this finding is consistent with the validation where gcms were observed to converge for the majority of catchments by metric the overall greatest certainty can be seen to lie in the duration projections as indicated by the limited range of values 4 2 2 compound hydro hazard hotspots figs 8 and 9 for drought and flood respectively highlight spatial variability in the fraction of total variance across the compound hydro hazard hotspots it should also be noted that this is a uk specific finding and may not be the case in other parts of the world in scotland the fraction of total variance associated with drought frequency is relatively evenly distributed across the three sources fig 8a c whilst in the south the hms represent the dominant source of uncertainty the dominance of the hms continues across the magnitude and duration fig 8d i with limited localised variation van lanen et al 2013 show that groundwater representation and parameterisation was the dominant influence in hms when reproducing drought characteristics consequently the dominance of the hms is most likely due to the fact that flows during drought conditions are typically dominated by groundwater which is represented in different ways in the hms in spite of the general trends observed in fig 7 previously the gcms represent the dominant source of uncertainty in flood frequency projections in scotland fig 9a in the midlands and south of england this is more strongly dominated by the hm uncertainty fig 9b whilst in the south west of england and south wales the uncertainty is equally split across the sources this may be attributed to the hydrogeological composition of the catchments northern catchments tend to be faster responding low baseflow index bfi e g the wensum at fakenham whilst catchments in the south tend to be dominated by groundwater high bfi e g the dee at polhollick for flood magnitude fig 9d f the gcms have very little influence on the total variance across the uk in the south west and wales the total variance is most strongly influenced by the structure of the hm e g the model s ability to reproduce fast runoff processes this is mirrored albeit less strongly in duration fig 9g i broadly figs 8 and 9 show agreement in the sources of uncertainty in the compound hydro hazard hotspots and the catchments more generally the additional understanding of the spatial variability of the total variance uncertainty and its components reveals a broad consistency for droughts with the exception of drought frequency where differences in the north south are in evidence the sources of flood uncertainty are subject to greater localised variability which may in part be due to topographical variation having a greater influence on results 5 discussion in the context of future water insecurity it is clear that consideration of the impact of compound hydro hazards is essential to build the necessary resilience for climate change adaptation there is a need to characterise the spatial and temporal clustering of compound extremes hao et al 2018 and the associated uncertainty to address this research gap this study proposed a multi stage fig 2 impact and uncertainty framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots in terms of the spatial distribution of the hazards the results are consistent with multiple studies thereby engendering greater confidence in the outputs marx et al 2018 and thober et al 2018 saw similar regional trends for low and high flows respectively whilst these studies do use the same underlying data these findings remain encouraging as the flow analyses are independent and employ different methods additionally as noted in the results the location and scale of the mean change signals are also consistent with collet et al 2018 where the hydro hazard hotspots arising from the sres a1b emissions scenario across great britain were investigated 5 1 compound hydro hazard hotspots satisfying objective one the classification of compound hydro hazard hotspots facilitates greater understanding of the spatial and temporal extent of concurrent changes in hydro hazards by focussing on the change per annum the increase in intra annual pressure was highlighted to better understand the impact of the increase in hydro hazard extremes the identified compound hydro hazard hotspots where further classified spatially and temporally whilst the impacts may propagate downstream it is notable that in a number of cases the hydro hazard is less extreme in the lowest catchment half of the catchments were identified as temporally compound with the majority projected as successive flood drought events consideration of the spatio temporally compound hydro hazard identified two hotspot regions the north east and south west of the uk in the north east approximately 10 000 m2 is projected to be in drought in the summer months with concurrent drought and flood in two catchments whilst fig 1 indicates that the population in these catchments is small the large number of private water supplies in the region means the financial burden may still be high successive flood droughts projected over mam jja for a number of catchments in the south west with this improved understanding of the spatio temporal nature of the hydro hazards it is possible to guide suitable adaptations for example storing flood waters for use during periods of drought these findings clearly highlight the need for informed and tailored adaptation to improve overall resilience lastly it is notable that the majority of the identified hotspots are projected to experience drought conditions in jja suggesting that a large proportion of the country may be subject to high levels of stress at the same time on an annual basis 5 1 1 spatial distribution when we explore the mean change signal associated with each metric we can see that under rcp8 5 confidence is greatest least uncertainty for changes in magnitude for both flood and drought see fig 6 this change signal suggests that the uk should prepare for up to a 25 increase in high flow magnitude and a more extreme increase of 100 150 in the annual low flow deficit volume greater uncertainty surrounds the frequency and duration metrics differences in the mean change signal are clear across the uk alongside variation in the source of this uncertainty the high spatial discretisation across the uk makes these results particularly useful to modellers consultants water managers and planners discussed in section 5 3 implications for water management 5 1 2 characterisation of uncertainty in this study the dominant source of uncertainty associated with the hydroclimatological modelling arises from the hms the gcms are broadly shown to converge consistent with findings in marx et al 2018 and thober et al 2018 across the uk knutti and sedláček 2012 suggest that over the uk there is good robustness in model projections thus a reasonably consistent change signal for the uk could indeed be expected however these findings are not replicated across europe where gcms are shown to play a greater role in the uncertainty in the mean change signal marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 similarly studies in australia suggest that the gcms and rcms contributed greater uncertainty than the hms bennett et al 2012 consequently it is important to understand the dominant controls upon uncertainty in climate modelling chains and their roles locally as observed in this study hydrological modelling may introduce substantial uncertainty vidal et al 2016 their calibration to specific characteristics of the hydrological regime e g high flows westerberg et al 2011 pushpalatha et al 2012 can play a significant role in this additional complexity is added when there is a lack of uniformity across the catchments considered for example due to the hydrology snowmelt marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 or groundwater collet et al 2017 or geomorphology karst hartmann 2017 an additional source of hm uncertainty is the portioning of precipitation into direct runoff and groundwater recharge this is especially relevant in regions that have a strong groundwater influence e g south east uk or where flow paths are short disconnected from groundwater e g urban areas 5 2 limitations 5 2 1 edge dataset the hms within the edge project were calibrated to provide high model performance over the european domain using one parameter set per model the specific catchments used in edge are not used to adjust the general pan european parameter fields it has been shown in earlier work that coherent parameter estimation on larger regions and catchments can help to reduce the difference in hydrological model parameterization samaniego et al 2017 and thus could prove a valuable way forward to further reduce the hydrological uncertainty over europe additionally the current version of the edge modelling chain does not include human water interactions reservoir operations water withdrawals and irrigation all have an impact on the hydrological cycle and are likely to affect flow projections particularly during periods of drought collet et al 2015 wanders and wada 2015 although some of the models have the capacity to consider these processes i e pcr globwb2 within edge increased consistency in the runoff routing by using the mrm module was deemed more important by the end users within edge both the hms have been deployed at a 5 km spatial resolution for the gcms specifically this is below their native resolution of 100 km which affects their realism at smaller spatial scales downscaling with e obs data ensures that the statistical distribution of the meteorological variables within europe is consistent with observations most importantly accounting for the effect of hills and mountains that are not resolved at the native resolution of the gcms however larger trends are consistent with the 100 km resolution in addition due to computational demands the large spatial extent of the edge domain necessitated the use of hms which are known to perform well at coarser spatial resolutions consequently at the local catchment scale this might lead to a misrepresentation of the dominant hydrological processes in smaller uk catchments a potential reason for the reduced performance of the hm pcr globwb2 specifically see appendix a 1 5 2 2 metrics pronounced differences in the frequency of flood and drought events were observed a number of catchments see all metrics exceed the hotspot threshold with the exception of drought frequency consequently catchments exhibiting severe relative changes may not have been selected as hotspots following collet et al 2018 the inherent differences in flood and drought were accounted for using thresholds defined to obtain a mean of three independent events per year on the baseline period framework stage 1 redundancy is present across the metrics of change with magnitude and duration directly linked to frequency suggestive perhaps that the metrics may be better substituted for change per event per year rather than simply per year 5 2 3 uncertainty an advantage of the qe anova framework is that it facilitates the disentangling of internal variability from the modelling uncertainty thereby providing a more robust measure of the overall modelling uncertainty hingray and saïd 2014 however in this study it has not been possible to partition the uncertainty associated with internal variability into its component parts this is due to 1 each modelling chain being run once and 2 the consideration of a single statistical downscaling methodology the effects of these component parts are however embedded within the residual uncertainty hingray and saïd 2014 the need for transient projections may be considered the main drawback of the qe anova framework 5 3 implications for water management the results suggest that the future water security of the uk is dependent on the ability to adapt to projected changes in hydro hazards the first step towards adaptation is improving knowledge and understanding of regional changes thereby allowing policy and decision makers to identify where in the uk compound hydro hazards are most likely to intensify i e hotspots consequently a phased and focussed regional study can be directed towards such regions understanding of the dominant sources of uncertainty in projections arising from the hydroclimatological modelling chain means that these studies are able to utilise more focused localised approaches that are aimed at constraining the dominant sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain examples include the application of sophisticated detailed modelling and the use of hydrodynamic models beevers et al 2012 balica et al 2013 which may serve to constrain the uncertainty range of the new outputs dependent on the physical characteristics of the catchments e g aitken et al 2018 further a larger multi model ensemble capturing multiple evolutions of gcms as well as multiple downscaling approaches would allow to better quantify the sources of modelling uncertainty and internal variability this would provide more detailed and valuable information to better deal with changes in the future and needed adaptation strategies in water management the intensification of the hydrologic dynamic timing and seasonality of hydro hazards over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management in light of these observations the incorporation of timing into the description of hydro hazards is useful for example events not meeting the critical thresholds may still put a significant pressure on the system through concurrent action if we can improve our projections and quantify the associated uncertainty we can then use this information in the adaptation process more explicitly for example understanding that we can be reasonably confident in the magnitude of change to high and low flows as defined in this study and by collet et al 2018 allows for water managers to make better decisions in the design of adaptation measures 6 conclusions climate change is projected to amplify hydrological extremes at both ends of the spectrum raising concerns and challenges for future water security in response there is a clear need to build resilience and improve adaptation for climate change the first step towards achieving this requires knowledge and understanding of the degree of change in these extremes at the outset of this paper we argued that previous studies investigating this change have been inconsistent and limited in their focus collet et al 2018 introduced a spatially coherent methodological framework for the projection of change in the compound hydro hazards of flood and drought however the ability to examine spatial and temporal trends was absent additionally the sources of the uncertainty associated with the climate projections were not assessed which are particularly important for targeting future adaptation efforts this paper sets out a novel comprehensive approach to address both components for the uk in the far future 2071 2099 this study suggests an increase in compound hydro hazard hotspots mean change signal across the country spatially compound hydro hazards at the inter catchment level are anticipated in the south west of england and wales and into the midlands where there is a high population density these areas are also indicated as spatially compound at the intra catchment level potentially further exacerbating impacts this is also anticipated in the less densely populated north east of scotland half of the identified hotspots are anticipated to be temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year again exacerbating potential impacts on society the north east of scotland and south west of the uk were identified as spatio temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern the uncertainty in climate projections represents a key challenge in their practical application in response this study introduces a comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the assessment of projected changes in hydro hazards the qe anova framework is used in this study quantifying and partitioning the uncertainties associated with the flood and drought concurrently and across multiple metrics frequency magnitude and duration this holistic depiction of uncertainty facilitates greater understanding of future water insecurity benefitting both researchers and water managers alike the former constantly seeking to quantify and understand uncertainty are better informed as to where to focus their efforts whilst the latter have access to information supporting more robust adaptation planning the ability and advantages of the framework were highlighted through application across the uk using projections from the edge database the hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability in the projections of the mean change signal in some instances exceeding 80 of total variance this application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty in terms of water management planning the findings allow for more focussed studies on significant areas of the country with spatially and or temporally compound hydro hazard increases with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process reasonable confidence in the magnitude of the change in high and low flows across the uk at the end of the century might provide for immediate implementation contributions lb is the pi of the water resilient cities climate

nrfa observed flow data on the baseline period 1971 2000 through graphical comparison of catchment cumulative distribution functions cdf given the focus on hydro hazards the tails of the distribution 0 10th and 90 100th percentile were graded from a to c table a1 based on the replication of 1 the shape and 2 the flow magnitude of the cdf variation in flow magnitude scale is expected due to the spread of uncertainty though the ensemble mean should follow the observed cdf as observed in marx et al 2018 the validation revealed strong similarities across the five gcms with noticeable differences among the hms the hms with the exception of pcrglob wb showed a reasonable reproduction of the observed cdf with 60 of catchments graded b and above table a1 and fig a1 however flow projections output by pcrglob wb2 were often uniform in nature failing to capture high low flow processes given the need to capture the range of uncertainty this was not considered grounds for removal however the lack of clearly defined peak flows meant that extraction of events was not possible in the same manner as the other three hms consequently flow projections from pcrglob wb2 were removed a 2 catchment selection in identifying catchments for inclusion two lists were combined catchments included in the national hydrological monitoring programme nrfa 2018 which are of significant interest for uk water resources management and the catchments from the future flows hydrology dataset prudhomme et al 2013 utilised by collet et al 2018 in the development of the hydro hazard hotspot methodology the data requirements for the validation and quantification of uncertainty led to the rejection of catchments with less than 15 years of observed flow data on the baseline period 1971 2000 reducing the number of catchments from 254 to 239 the distribution of the selected catchments is detailed in fig 1 due to the pan european domain of edge projections are produced at a 5 km spatial resolution 25 km2 grid cell consequently catchments with an upstream area of less than 25 km2 were excluded in this study given the coarse resolution it was necessary to manually correct to the nearest edge grid cell on the river network with an upstream contributing area as close to the nrfa catchment area as possible rounded to the nearest 25 km2 all selected catchment areas demonstrated a percentage difference of less than 200 with 105 out of 239 exhibiting no difference fig a2 a 3 event extraction 
607,there exists an increasing need to understand the impact of climate change on the hydrological extremes of flood and drought collectively referred to as hydro hazards at present current methodology are limited in their scope particularly with respect to inadequate representation of the uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain this paper proposes spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots hotspots of change where concurrent increase in mean annual flood and drought events is projected we apply a quasi ergodic analysis of variance qe anova framework to detail both the magnitude and the sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain for the mean projected mean change signal whilst accounting for non stationarity the framework is designed for application across a wide geographical range and is thus readily transferable we illustrate the ability of the framework through application to 239 uk catchments based on hydroclimatological projections from the edge project 5 cmi5 gcms and 3 hms forced under rcp8 5 the results indicate that half of the projected hotspots are temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year exacerbating potential impacts on society the north east of scotland and south west of the uk were identified as spatio temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern this intensification of the hydrologic dynamic timing and seasonality of hydro hazards over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability in some instances exceeding 80 of the total variance critically clear spatial variability in the sources of modelling uncertainty was also observed highlighting the need to apply a spatially consistent methodology such as that presented this application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty in terms of water management planning such findings allow for more focussed studies with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process keywords climate change climate change impacts uncertainty water management compound hydro hazards multi model ensemble 1 introduction hydrological hazards are defined as extreme events associated with the occurrence movement and distribution of water specifically floods and droughts national research council 1999 collet et al 2018 flood hazards are the result of excess water from one or multiple sources e g coastal fluvial or surface sub surface water while drought hazards arise from a deficit of river flow or precipitation over a prolonged period henceforward we collectively term flood and drought as hydro hazards climate change is significantly altering hydrological dynamics with a general tendency to amplify hydrological extremes fischer and knutti 2016 schleussner et al 2017 marx et al 2018 samaniego et al 2018 thober et al 2018 vousdoukas et al 2018 and thus increase the influence on exposed populations and economic assets at present these changes are not widely understood due to the complex interactions between climate hydrological systems and their regional variations e g manfreda and caylor 2013 devkota and gyawali 2015 collet et al 2018 li et al 2018 during the period 2000 2015 hydro hazards directly affected almost one million people in the uk at a total estimated cost of 36 billion gbp guha sapir et al 2018 accordingly it is necessary to consider changes in hydrological dynamics and flow regimes at present and in the future typically hydro hazards are considered independently in water management planning in the uk hydrological impact assessments of climate change have largely focussed exclusively on either high flows prudhomme et al 2012 kay et al 2014a 2014b sayers et al 2016 collet et al 2017 or low flows christierson et al 2012 watts et al 2015 marx et al 2018 further inconsistencies in methodology lead to conflicting reports of the hydrological impact of climate change in the uk examples include disparities at the spatial scale kay et al 2014a 2014b watts et al 2015 or in the climate projections used collet et al 2017 marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 overall collet et al 2018 marx et al 2018 and thober et al 2018 suggest a general increase in hydrological extremes across the uk especially in the south west of england west of wales and north east of scotland whilst kay et al 2014a and b report the greatest change in high flows in the north west of scotland to ensure a holistic understanding there is a clear need to consider changing hydro hazards concurrently i e both ends of the hydrological cycle must be explored at the same time in addition to the increased severity and frequency of hydro hazards under climate change compound events may exacerbate the impact on society hao et al 2018 in ipcc 2012 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc define compound events as 1 two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously or successively 2 combinations of extreme events with underlying conditions that amplify the impact of the events or 3 combinations of events that are not extremes in themselves but lead to an extreme event or impact when combined i e clustered multiple events these compound events need not occur simultaneously they may also be the result of successive contrasting extremes such as drought and flood ipcc 2012 examples include the successive drought and flood events of 2010 2012 and 2015 2016 in the uk parry et al 2013 and tasmania australia respectively csiro 2018 and the ongoing concurrent drought flood in queensland australia butterworth and margolis 2019 in order to build resilience for climate change adaptation there is a need to further characterise the spatial and temporal clustering of compound extremes hao et al 2018 the flow projections used in climate change impact assessment studies are the outputs of a long and complex modelling chain general circulation models gcms are forced by emissions scenarios the outputs of which are downscaled to the regional scale where hydrological models hms propagate the climate signal producing hydrological outputs such as discharge soil moisture and groundwater recharge with each of these modelling steps uncertainty in the model structure input and parameters cascades propagating or constraining the uncertainty through the modelling chain warmink et al 2010 smith et al 2018 differences in hm structure have been identified as a source of uncertainty that should not be neglected dankers et al 2014 donnelly et al 2017 gosling et al 2017 one approach to the portioning of uncertainty is the quasi ergodic analysis of variance qe anova hawkins and sutton 2009 hingray and saïd 2014 vidal et al 2016 hingray et al 2019 which through a quasi ergodic assumption is able to account for the non stationarity of climate change this paper proposes a spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots in the context of the framework four classes of compound hydro hazard hotspots are defined table 1 compound spatially compound temporally compound and spatio temporally compound the framework sees the determination of the concurrent change in the mean annual hydro hazard from the baseline to future in this way it is possible to identify hotspots of change where hydro hazards intensify or emerge under a changing climate we term these compound hydro hazard hotspots i e intra annual successive contrasting extremes as per the ipcc definition previously consideration of the spatial and temporal clustering of hotspots determines whether these compound hydro hazard hotspots are spatial and or temporally clustered the framework is presented through application to 239 catchments across the uk using transient climate projections 1970 2099 compound hydro hazard hotspots are identified for the far future 2071 2099 the objectives of the framework are two fold 1 to identify classify table 1 and analyse compound hydro hazard hotspots 2 to quantify and characterise the sources of uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain using a qe anova framework with a view to understanding the total and fractional uncertainty associated with the hydro hazard projections the novelty of this impact and uncertainty framework lies in the classification of the compound hydro hazard extremes in a spatial and temporal context the proposed framework allows for the explicit quantification of the uncertainty in the projected hydro hazard hotspots thereby facilitating a greater understanding of future water in security 2 data in this study the methodological framework was applied across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland uk daily

capturing land atmosphere interactions whilst mhm and pcr globwb2 are focussed on water balance components only for consistency and efficiency a single river routing model mrm samaniego et al 2010 was used to derive river flows based on gridded runoff calculations output by the hms the mrm model is based on the muskingum algorithm and is able to estimate streamflow at various spatial resolutions without recalibration of parameters thober et al 2018 2019 the hms were validated for high medium and low flows across a diverse range of european catchments marx et al 2018 samaniego et al 2018 thober et al 2018 in the validation of the flow projections outputs from pcrglob wb2 were often uniform in nature failing to capture the processes leading to high low flows the lack of clearly defined peak flows meant that the necessary event extraction was not possible see section 3 1 consequently flow projections from pcrglob wb2 were not considered in this study the validation of the edge flow projections is further considered in appendix a 1 2 2 emissions scenarios the edge project considered simulations of transient historical 1971 2000 and future 2011 2099 climate under both rcp2 6 and

stages of the proposed framework is presented in fig 2 in stage 1 hydro hazard events are identified and event metrics extracted per modelling chain per catchment from this annual summary metrics and mean annual metrics are determined the second stage sees the determination of the change signal the mean change across the modelling chains in the mean annual metrics from the baseline 1971 2000 to the far future 2071 2099 per catchment compound hydro hazard hotspots are subsequently classified table 1 in stage 3 the uncertainty is characterised following the qe anova approach a noise free signal is determined per modelling chain per catchment followed by application of the anova at the catchment level the application of the framework is discussed with reference to the 239 catchments across the uk described in the previous section 3 1 stage 1 identification of hydro hazards stage 1 begins with event extraction fig 2 1 1 following collet et al 2018 catchment streamflow thresholds for the extraction of flood and drought events were defined on the baseline historic simulations 1971 2000 for a mean of three independent events per annum across the 15 hydroclimatological modelling chains 5 gcms and 3 hms for each catchment and modelling chain flood events were extracted from the peak over threshold pot time series following bayliss and jones 1993 where a flood event is defined as a period when daily flow is continuously above the defined threshold for an average of three pot per annum drought equivalent characteristics were determined using the r package lfstat version 0 9 4 koffler et al 2016 in lfstat a drought event occurs when daily flow falls below a given threshold here a varying q90 threshold defined as the flow equally or exceeded 90 of the time was specified per julian day i e 365 thresholds independent drought events were identified by applying the inter event time and volume criterion method gustard and demuth 2009 koffler et al 2016 events were pooled where the inter event time is less than 5 days and the drought to inter event volume ratio fell below 0 1 three event metrics 1 2 describing the duration timing day of year and magnitude peak flow and flow deficit volume below threshold for flood and drought respectively were determined for each independent event for details see fig a3 from these event metrics annual summary metrics 1 3 were subsequently determined a count of the number of independent events per year frequency was also made the annual mean per metric was then determined 1 4 for the historic simulation 1971 2000 this represents the 30 year mean whilst for the transient future projections 2005 2099 a 30 year rolling mean was determined for example 2011 2040 2012 2041 and so on the mean annual metrics represent the data input to stages 2 and 3 fig 2 3 2 stage 2 compound hydro hazard classification stage 2 utilises the outputs from stage 1 1 4 for each catchment the mean change signal 2 1 from the baseline 1971 2000 to far future 2071 2099 was determined for the frequency magnitude and duration metrics per catchment per modelling chain the mean change signal across the 15 modelling chains was subsequently determined per catchment in the framework a compound hydro hazard is the concurrent increase in the mean annual frequency magnitude and duration of flood and drought events total six metrics a compound hydro hazard hotspot represents a concurrent increase in these six metrics above a defined threshold t table 1 and fig 3 region iv after collet et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis was applied to determine exceedance thresholds above which 20 of the catchments lie 2 2 table 2 the hydro hazard hotspots 2 3 were further classified 2 4 into different types of compound hydro hazard as per table 1 the temporal aspect is represented by the mean annual time of year and the degree of seasonality in the far future 2071 2099 1 4b seasonality is defined as the concentration of events around the 30 year mean julian day determined using circular statistics following the approach of bayliss and jones 1993 and institute of hydrology 1999 for example calculations see supplement in formetta et al 2018 a value of zero indicates a lack of seasonality where events are widely dispersed throughout the year whilst a value greater than 0 6 indicates that events are concentrated at a particular time of year formetta et al 2018 i e seasonally occurring events 3 3 stage 3 characterisation of uncertainty the spatial variability of the hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty associated with the annual mean frequency magnitude and duration metrics was determined through the application of a qe anova approach per catchment thus the total uncertainty may be partitioned in terms of the relative contribution of each source of uncertainty this method is based on the quasi ergodic assumption for transient climate simulations hingray and saïd 2014 where for a sufficiently long time period it is assumed that all possible states are captured thereby reducing the extrapolation out with the sample space the qe anova approach accounts for both modelling uncertainty and internal variability the internal variability represents the variation of climate on both a large and local scale representing natural fluctuations of climate and variation in local meteorology respectively this variation may be observed through multiple evolutions of a given gcm and downscaling model in this study the residuals capture both the internal variability and statistical downscaling uncertainty as only one method is applied based on geostatistical external drift kriging see marx et al 2018 it should be noted that the quasi ergodic assumption is only applicable for sufficiently large sample sizes the ratio of the time series length to the size of the sliding window here the sample size of 4 17 1971 2099 125 30 yr is deemed suitable being comparable with previous studies such as vidal et al 2016 sample size 4 25 1980 2065 85 20 yr the first stage of the qe anova approach sees the determination of the noise free signal nfs 3 1 per catchment per modelling chain for each metric linear trendlines were fitted to both the baseline simulations and transient projections after vidal et al 2016 a linear trend model was selected to prevent overfitting of inter annual fluctuations the baseline linear model was also fixed due to a relatively short baseline period the nfs per modelling chain m at time t represents the change in the trend model output y relative to the average of the baseline trend model y0 following hingray and saïd 2014 the nfs is defined as 1 n f s m t y m t y o for the absolute change in frequency and duration and 2 n f s m t y m t y o 1 for the relative change in magnitude following a classical two way anova framework 3 2 without interaction the nfs was partitioned into the variance associated with the gcm hm and residuals for a three way anova see vidal et al 2016 for further details see hingray and saïd 2014 the sum of these variances is equal to the total uncertainty t t the fraction of total variance t t explained by each source of uncertainty u t was determined as u t t t 3 3 4 results 4 1 compound hydro hazard hotspots 4 1 1 classification under rcp8 5 for the mean change signal mean result from the multi model ensemble a total of 230 out of 239 catchments see an increase in the compound hydro hazard in the far future 2071 2099 fig 4 a of these 230 more than half 144 lie within region ii fig 3 i e the concurrent increase in the mean annual flood metrics is in excess of the table 2 flood thresholds conversely only 39 catchments lie within region iii forty seven compound hydro hazard hotspots region iv were identified accounting for 35 47 785 km2 of the total catchment area considered in this study the 47 compound hydro hazard hotspots were further classified as per table 1 taking spatially clustered catchments first the majority of these hotspots are concentrated in the south west of england and wales as well as localised areas in the midlands and east of england see fig 1 for regions in scotland hotspots are located across east scotland and the highlands islands northern ireland features a single hotspot in the east on the upper bann at movallen these hotspot regions may be described as being spatially compound at the inter catchment level nine further catchments were identified as spatially compound at the intra catchment level i e contain child catchments identified as hotspots fig 4b e across the uk the hotspots are primarily headwater sub catchments or headwaters and the downstream outlet fig 5 further highlights two spatio temporally compound hydro hazard hotspot regions the first is the north and east of scotland region containing six hotspots including the loch ness and river tay catchments the largest lake and river by volume in the uk respectively drought is projected to occur in the summer months jja for all hotspots in the region the pressure in the region is further increased by the presence of the two concurrent hotspots the second spatio temporally compound hotspot region is located in the south west encompassing the south of wales and south west england as shown in fig 4 a number of the catchments in this region are nested with a number of headwaters identified as hotspots in this region there is a clustering of consecutive flood and drought events occurring over mam and jja respectively with flood events preceding the drought there may be an opportunity to store floodwaters and thereby offset the effect of drought in these regions 4 1 2 change signal fig 6 shows the projected mean change signal for the frequency magnitude and duration metrics for the 47 compound hydro hazard hotspots identified beginning with drought frequency fig 6a a uniform increase of one event per annum is projected for all hotspots this limited change is in part due to their longer temporal nature relative to high flow events and is therefore unsurprising collet et al 2018 with regards to flood frequency fig 6b the largest increases up to 8 events per annum are projected in scotland east and highlands and islands and the south west more generally england and wales the projected change in magnitude fig 6c and d reveals greater spatial variation across the compound hydro hazard hotspots in scotland floods are projected to increase by up to 14 compared to a doubling for droughts i e 110 in the south west of england there is a similar picture for floods by contrast across east wales and the west midlands droughts generally see the greater increase in magnitude for the drought mean change signal a clear north south divide is evident with the flow deficit volume in the south at least double that of the north fig 6e and f reveals regional changes in event duration in the south west of the uk wales the west midlands and the south west of england the drought duration is projected to be 2 2 5 times greater than the rest of the uk this trend is reversed for floods with the largest increases projected across scottish catchments up to 20 days by contrast in the south the increase in flood duration is on average 5 10 days in summary the mean change signal suggests that the projected increase in drought magnitude is likely a product of the increase in duration rather than frequency 1 event per annum by comparison flood events are projected to become more frequent with smaller increases in the magnitude and duration of individual events the spatial distribution and scale of the projections for magnitude and duration are consistent with collet et al 2018 cmip3 sres a1b medium emissions scenario the principle difference lies in the projected change in event frequency with collet et al 2018 reporting parity in flood and drought frequency the use of different emissions scenarios hms and gcms may account for some of this lack of agreement despite these differences it is appreciable to see the similarity in results 4 2 partitioned uncertainty 4 2 1 all 239 catchments the focus herein is on the uncertainty corresponding to the mean change signal projections and compound hydro hazard hotspots i e the far future 2071 2099 fig 7 shows the fraction of total variance associated with each source of uncertainty for all 239 catchments for the mean annual frequency magnitude and duration metrics by generalising across all catchments in this way it can be seen that the hms consistently represent the largest source of variability whilst gcms are the smallest this finding is consistent with the validation where gcms were observed to converge for the majority of catchments by metric the overall greatest certainty can be seen to lie in the duration projections as indicated by the limited range of values 4 2 2 compound hydro hazard hotspots figs 8 and 9 for drought and flood respectively highlight spatial variability in the fraction of total variance across the compound hydro hazard hotspots it should also be noted that this is a uk specific finding and may not be the case in other parts of the world in scotland the fraction of total variance associated with drought frequency is relatively evenly distributed across the three sources fig 8a c whilst in the south the hms represent the dominant source of uncertainty the dominance of the hms continues across the magnitude and duration fig 8d i with limited localised variation van lanen et al 2013 show that groundwater representation and parameterisation was the dominant influence in hms when reproducing drought characteristics consequently the dominance of the hms is most likely due to the fact that flows during drought conditions are typically dominated by groundwater which is represented in different ways in the hms in spite of the general trends observed in fig 7 previously the gcms represent the dominant source of uncertainty in flood frequency projections in scotland fig 9a in the midlands and south of england this is more strongly dominated by the hm uncertainty fig 9b whilst in the south west of england and south wales the uncertainty is equally split across the sources this may be attributed to the hydrogeological composition of the catchments northern catchments tend to be faster responding low baseflow index bfi e g the wensum at fakenham whilst catchments in the south tend to be dominated by groundwater high bfi e g the dee at polhollick for flood magnitude fig 9d f the gcms have very little influence on the total variance across the uk in the south west and wales the total variance is most strongly influenced by the structure of the hm e g the model s ability to reproduce fast runoff processes this is mirrored albeit less strongly in duration fig 9g i broadly figs 8 and 9 show agreement in the sources of uncertainty in the compound hydro hazard hotspots and the catchments more generally the additional understanding of the spatial variability of the total variance uncertainty and its components reveals a broad consistency for droughts with the exception of drought frequency where differences in the north south are in evidence the sources of flood uncertainty are subject to greater localised variability which may in part be due to topographical variation having a greater influence on results 5 discussion in the context of future water insecurity it is clear that consideration of the impact of compound hydro hazards is essential to build the necessary resilience for climate change adaptation there is a need to characterise the spatial and temporal clustering of compound extremes hao et al 2018 and the associated uncertainty to address this research gap this study proposed a multi stage fig 2 impact and uncertainty framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots in terms of the spatial distribution of the hazards the results are consistent with multiple studies thereby engendering greater confidence in the outputs marx et al 2018 and thober et al 2018 saw similar regional trends for low and high flows respectively whilst these studies do use the same underlying data these findings remain encouraging as the flow analyses are independent and employ different methods additionally as noted in the results the location and scale of the mean change signals are also consistent with collet et al 2018 where the hydro hazard hotspots arising from the sres a1b emissions scenario across great britain were investigated 5 1 compound hydro hazard hotspots satisfying objective one the classification of compound hydro hazard hotspots facilitates greater understanding of the spatial and temporal extent of concurrent changes in hydro hazards by focussing on the change per annum the increase in intra annual pressure was highlighted to better understand the impact of the increase in hydro hazard extremes the identified compound hydro hazard hotspots where further classified spatially and temporally whilst the impacts may propagate downstream it is notable that in a number of cases the hydro hazard is less extreme in the lowest catchment half of the catchments were identified as temporally compound with the majority projected as successive flood drought events consideration of the spatio temporally compound hydro hazard identified two hotspot regions the north east and south west of the uk in the north east approximately 10 000 m2 is projected to be in drought in the summer months with concurrent drought and flood in two catchments whilst fig 1 indicates that the population in these catchments is small the large number of private water supplies in the region means the financial burden may still be high successive flood droughts projected over mam jja for a number of catchments in the south west with this improved understanding of the spatio temporal nature of the hydro hazards it is possible to guide suitable adaptations for example storing flood waters for use during periods of drought these findings clearly highlight the need for informed and tailored adaptation to improve overall resilience lastly it is notable that the majority of the identified hotspots are projected to experience drought conditions in jja suggesting that a large proportion of the country may be subject to high levels of stress at the same time on an annual basis 5 1 1 spatial distribution when we explore the mean change signal associated with each metric we can see that under rcp8 5 confidence is greatest least uncertainty for changes in magnitude for both flood and drought see fig 6 this change signal suggests that the uk should prepare for up to a 25 increase in high flow magnitude and a more extreme increase of 100 150 in the annual low flow deficit volume greater uncertainty surrounds the frequency and duration metrics differences in the mean change signal are clear across the uk alongside variation in the source of this uncertainty the high spatial discretisation across the uk makes these results particularly useful to modellers consultants water managers and planners discussed in section 5 3 implications for water management 5 1 2 characterisation of uncertainty in this study the dominant source of uncertainty associated with the hydroclimatological modelling arises from the hms the gcms are broadly shown to converge consistent with findings in marx et al 2018 and thober et al 2018 across the uk knutti and sedláček 2012 suggest that over the uk there is good robustness in model projections thus a reasonably consistent change signal for the uk could indeed be expected however these findings are not replicated across europe where gcms are shown to play a greater role in the uncertainty in the mean change signal marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 similarly studies in australia suggest that the gcms and rcms contributed greater uncertainty than the hms bennett et al 2012 consequently it is important to understand the dominant controls upon uncertainty in climate modelling chains and their roles locally as observed in this study hydrological modelling may introduce substantial uncertainty vidal et al 2016 their calibration to specific characteristics of the hydrological regime e g high flows westerberg et al 2011 pushpalatha et al 2012 can play a significant role in this additional complexity is added when there is a lack of uniformity across the catchments considered for example due to the hydrology snowmelt marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 or groundwater collet et al 2017 or geomorphology karst hartmann 2017 an additional source of hm uncertainty is the portioning of precipitation into direct runoff and groundwater recharge this is especially relevant in regions that have a strong groundwater influence e g south east uk or where flow paths are short disconnected from groundwater e g urban areas 5 2 limitations 5 2 1 edge dataset the hms within the edge project were calibrated to provide high model performance over the european domain using one parameter set per model the specific catchments used in edge are not used to adjust the general pan european parameter fields it has been shown in earlier work that coherent parameter estimation on larger regions and catchments can help to reduce the difference in hydrological model parameterization samaniego et al 2017 and thus could prove a valuable way forward to further reduce the hydrological uncertainty over europe additionally the current version of the edge modelling chain does not include human water interactions reservoir operations water withdrawals and irrigation all have an impact on the hydrological cycle and are likely to affect flow projections particularly during periods of drought collet et al 2015 wanders and wada 2015 although some of the models have the capacity to consider these processes i e pcr globwb2 within edge increased consistency in the runoff routing by using the mrm module was deemed more important by the end users within edge both the hms have been deployed at a 5 km spatial resolution for the gcms specifically this is below their native resolution of 100 km which affects their realism at smaller spatial scales downscaling with e obs data ensures that the statistical distribution of the meteorological variables within europe is consistent with observations most importantly accounting for the effect of hills and mountains that are not resolved at the native resolution of the gcms however larger trends are consistent with the 100 km resolution in addition due to computational demands the large spatial extent of the edge domain necessitated the use of hms which are known to perform well at coarser spatial resolutions consequently at the local catchment scale this might lead to a misrepresentation of the dominant hydrological processes in smaller uk catchments a potential reason for the reduced performance of the hm pcr globwb2 specifically see appendix a 1 5 2 2 metrics pronounced differences in the frequency of flood and drought events were observed a number of catchments see all metrics exceed the hotspot threshold with the exception of drought frequency consequently catchments exhibiting severe relative changes may not have been selected as hotspots following collet et al 2018 the inherent differences in flood and drought were accounted for using thresholds defined to obtain a mean of three independent events per year on the baseline period framework stage 1 redundancy is present across the metrics of change with magnitude and duration directly linked to frequency suggestive perhaps that the metrics may be better substituted for change per event per year rather than simply per year 5 2 3 uncertainty an advantage of the qe anova framework is that it facilitates the disentangling of internal variability from the modelling uncertainty thereby providing a more robust measure of the overall modelling uncertainty hingray and saïd 2014 however in this study it has not been possible to partition the uncertainty associated with internal variability into its component parts this is due to 1 each modelling chain being run once and 2 the consideration of a single statistical downscaling methodology the effects of these component parts are however embedded within the residual uncertainty hingray and saïd 2014 the need for transient projections may be considered the main drawback of the qe anova framework 5 3 implications for water management the results suggest that the future water security of the uk is dependent on the ability to adapt to projected changes in hydro hazards the first step towards adaptation is improving knowledge and understanding of regional changes thereby allowing policy and decision makers to identify where in the uk compound hydro hazards are most likely to intensify i e hotspots consequently a phased and focussed regional study can be directed towards such regions understanding of the dominant sources of uncertainty in projections arising from the hydroclimatological modelling chain means that these studies are able to utilise more focused localised approaches that are aimed at constraining the dominant sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain examples include the application of sophisticated detailed modelling and the use of hydrodynamic models beevers et al 2012 balica et al 2013 which may serve to constrain the uncertainty range of the new outputs dependent on the physical characteristics of the catchments e g aitken et al 2018 further a larger multi model ensemble capturing multiple evolutions of gcms as well as multiple downscaling approaches would allow to better quantify the sources of modelling uncertainty and internal variability this would provide more detailed and valuable information to better deal with changes in the future and needed adaptation strategies in water management the intensification of the hydrologic dynamic timing and seasonality of hydro hazards over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management in light of these observations the incorporation of timing into the description of hydro hazards is useful for example events not meeting the critical thresholds may still put a significant pressure on the system through concurrent action if we can improve our projections and quantify the associated uncertainty we can then use this information in the adaptation process more explicitly for example understanding that we can be reasonably confident in the magnitude of change to high and low flows as defined in this study and by collet et al 2018 allows for water managers to make better decisions in the design of adaptation measures 6 conclusions climate change is projected to amplify hydrological extremes at both ends of the spectrum raising concerns and challenges for future water security in response there is a clear need to build resilience and improve adaptation for climate change the first step towards achieving this requires knowledge and understanding of the degree of change in these extremes at the outset of this paper we argued that previous studies investigating this change have been inconsistent and limited in their focus collet et al 2018 introduced a spatially coherent methodological framework for the projection of change in the compound hydro hazards of flood and drought however the ability to examine spatial and temporal trends was absent additionally the sources of the uncertainty associated with the climate projections were not assessed which are particularly important for targeting future adaptation efforts this paper sets out a novel comprehensive approach to address both components for the uk in the far future 2071 2099 this study suggests an increase in compound hydro hazard hotspots mean change signal across the country spatially compound hydro hazards at the inter catchment level are anticipated in the south west of england and wales and into the midlands where there is a high population density these areas are also indicated as spatially compound at the intra catchment level potentially further exacerbating impacts this is also anticipated in the less densely populated north east of scotland half of the identified hotspots are anticipated to be temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year again exacerbating potential impacts on society the north east of scotland and south west of the uk were identified as spatio temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern the uncertainty in climate projections represents a key challenge in their practical application in response this study introduces a comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the assessment of projected changes in hydro hazards the qe anova framework is used in this study quantifying and partitioning the uncertainties associated with the flood and drought concurrently and across multiple metrics frequency magnitude and duration this holistic depiction of uncertainty facilitates greater understanding of future water insecurity benefitting both researchers and water managers alike the former constantly seeking to quantify and understand uncertainty are better informed as to where to focus their efforts whilst the latter have access to information supporting more robust adaptation planning the ability and advantages of the framework were highlighted through application across the uk using projections from the edge database the hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability in the projections of the mean change signal in some instances exceeding 80 of total variance this application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty in terms of water management planning the findings allow for more focussed studies on significant areas of the country with spatially and or temporally compound hydro hazard increases with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process reasonable confidence in the magnitude of the change in high and low flows across the uk at the end of the century might provide for immediate implementation contributions lb is the pi of the water resilient cities climate

nrfa observed flow data on the baseline period 1971 2000 through graphical comparison of catchment cumulative distribution functions cdf given the focus on hydro hazards the tails of the distribution 0 10th and 90 100th percentile were graded from a to c table a1 based on the replication of 1 the shape and 2 the flow magnitude of the cdf variation in flow magnitude scale is expected due to the spread of uncertainty though the ensemble mean should follow the observed cdf as observed in marx et al 2018 the validation revealed strong similarities across the five gcms with noticeable differences among the hms the hms with the exception of pcrglob wb showed a reasonable reproduction of the observed cdf with 60 of catchments graded b and above table a1 and fig a1 however flow projections output by pcrglob wb2 were often uniform in nature failing to capture high low flow processes given the need to capture the range of uncertainty this was not considered grounds for removal however the lack of clearly defined peak flows meant that extraction of events was not possible in the same manner as the other three hms consequently flow projections from pcrglob wb2 were removed a 2 catchment selection in identifying catchments for inclusion two lists were combined catchments included in the national hydrological monitoring programme nrfa 2018 which are of significant interest for uk water resources management and the catchments from the future flows hydrology dataset prudhomme et al 2013 utilised by collet et al 2018 in the development of the hydro hazard hotspot methodology the data requirements for the validation and quantification of uncertainty led to the rejection of catchments with less than 15 years of observed flow data on the baseline period 1971 2000 reducing the number of catchments from 254 to 239 the distribution of the selected catchments is detailed in fig 1 due to the pan european domain of edge projections are produced at a 5 km spatial resolution 25 km2 grid cell consequently catchments with an upstream area of less than 25 km2 were excluded in this study given the coarse resolution it was necessary to manually correct to the nearest edge grid cell on the river network with an upstream contributing area as close to the nrfa catchment area as possible rounded to the nearest 25 km2 all selected catchment areas demonstrated a percentage difference of less than 200 with 105 out of 239 exhibiting no difference fig a2 a 3 event extraction 
608,finite depth sediment layers are common in natural water bodies the presence of underlying bedrock strata covered by erodible bed layers is ubiquitous in rivers and estuaries in the last years the development of models based on the non capacity sediment transport assumption also called non equilibrium assumption has offered a new theoretical background to deal with complex non erodible bed configurations and the associated numerical problems bedload non capacity sediment transport models consider that the actual solid transport state can be different from the equilibrium state and depending on the temporal evolution of the flow the treatment of finite depth erodible bed layers i e partially erodible beds in bedload models based on the equilibrium approach has usually been made using numerical fixes which correct the unphysical results obtained in some cases generally the presence of a finite depth erodible layer implies the introduction of a kind of non equilibrium condition in the bedload transport state nevertheless this common natural bed configuration has not been previously considered in the development of numerical models in this work a finite volume model fvm for bedload transport based on non capacity approach and dealing with finite depth erodible layers is proposed new expressions for the actual bedload transport rate and the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface are used to develop a numerical scheme which solves the coupled shallow water and non capacity bedload transport system of equations the reconstruction of the intermediate states for the local riemann problem at each intercell edge is designed to correctly model the presence of non erodible strata avoiding the appearance of unphysical results in the approximate solution without reducing the time step the new coupled scheme is tested against laboratory benchmarking experiments in order to demonstrate its stability and accuracy pointing out the properties of both equilibrium and non equilibrium formulations keywords finite volume method shallow water equations non capacity bedload transport fully coupled method augmented roe s scheme finite depth erodible layer 1 introduction sediment transport is an important process which is commonly seen in natural water bodies such as rivers dams and estuaries the sediment particles can be transported by two basic mechanisms suspended load which is composed by the particles moving inside the flow with the same velocity as the fluid and bedload which involves the particles moving in a relatively thin layer over the static bed in this bedload layer or active layer the sediment particles remain in contact with the bed and their velocity is generally much lower than the fluid velocity yang 1996 although the total load transported by suspension can be much larger than the sediment weight moving in the active bed layer wu 2007 the bedload mechanism plays an important role and it can cause marked and rapid changes in the bed bathymetry relevant investigations have been carried out by means of laboratory experiments or field measurements spinewine and zech 2007 zech et al 2008 fent et al 2019 wong and parker 2006 pitlick and cress 2002 soares frazão et al 2007 brooks and lawrence 1999 but they are mostly limited by the small scale of the laboratory flumes or the fact that field measurements are very time consuming expensive and extremely difficult to perform therefore numerical modelling is an attractive tool to understand and predict the morphodynamical evolution of rivers and reservoirs however uncertainties arise in computational simulations due to simplifications assumptions and empirical relationships introduced into the mathematical models used for sediment transport prediction yang 1996 moreover modelling sediment transport involves an increasing complexity with respect to static bed shallow water models saint venant 1871 cunge et al 1980 due to the presence of variable sediment fluid mixture properties coupling of physical processes and multiple layers phenomena dewals et al 2011 the solid particles can be transported under equilibrium capacity or saturated conditions or non capacity non equilibrium or unsaturated conditions the classical equilibrium approach assumes that the actual sediment transport rates for suspended and bedload are equal to the capacity of the flow to carry solid weight they are only determined by instantaneous local flow features and can be formulated by different empirical closure relations found in literature yang 1996 models based on this assumption are commonly called equilibrium or capacity transport models tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 cao et al 2002 lyn and altinakar 2002 hudson and sweby 2003 goutière et al 2008 castro díaz et al 2008 murillo and garcia navarro 2010 juez et al 2014 gunawan and lhébrard 2015 martínez aranda et al 2019 on the other hand in non capacity models the actual transport rates are computed through advection and mass exchange with the static erodible bed non equilibrium i e non capacity sediment transport models have been proposed armanini and di silvio 1988 fraccarollo et al 2003 wu and wang 2007 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 zhang and duan 2011 benkhaldoun et al 2012 cao et al 2012 fernández nieto et al 2014 liu et al 2015 bohorquez and ancey 2016 for both suspended and bedload transport natural morphodynamical systems such as alluvial rivers are always changing in time and space and hence absolute equilibrium states rarely exist in natural conditions therefore intuitively non capacity approaches are more suitable than models based on the equilibrium assumption since they account for the temporal and spatial delay of the actual sediment transport rate with respect to its potential capacity however if this adaptation delay is sufficiently small equilibrium models can be also applied at least in theory wu 2007 unlike purely suspended load models where it has been demonstrated that the non capacity assumption is necessary to compute correctly the solid suspended concentration and the bed evolution cao et al 2007 2012 the importance of assuming non equilibrium conditions in bedload numerical models remains uncertain van rijn 1993 suggested that the actual bedload transport rate in unsteady flows can be assumed equal to the bedload capacity because the adjustment of the transported sediment particles to the new flow conditions proceeds rapidly close to the bed surface this assumption was conceptual and without a theoretical or numerical justification cao et al 2011 2012 analysed numerically the multiple time scales involved in bedload transport for fluvial processes they found that at least for flood cases the bedload transport rate was able to rapidly adapt to the local flow features which justifies the widespread application of the equilibrium models cao et al 2011 however a comparative analysis of both capacity and non capacity bedload models in highly erosive unsteady flows as dam break waves or overtopping dyke collapses remains unperformed especially including experimental benchmarking cases and accurate numerical schemes this comparative analysis is the first main contribution of the present work the assumption of non equilibrium conditions in a bedload mathematical model leads to the requirement of computing the temporal evolution of the active layer thickness and the velocity of the bedload particles in order to predict the actual transport rate as well as the net exchange flux between static and moving bed layers this requirement introduces a high uncertainty in non capacity models due to the calibration of the parameters associated to solid particles velocity active layer thickness and bedload erosion deposition rates for transient flows which can be an annoying task with few empirical supporting data different strategies have been proposed in order to overcome this uncertainty wu 2007 and el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 proposed to approximate the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface by the difference between the actual and capacity transport rates affected by an adaptation length and to assume a non storage mass condition for the active bed layer leading to the quasi steady solid flux relaxation models a more complex approach was also proposed by wu and wang 2007 zhang and duan 2011 soliman and ushijima 2013 based on the same adaptation length parameter to determine the net exchange flux through the interface but accounting now for the mass storage in the active bed layer this approach leads to the direct computation of the actual transport rate as one of the unknown conserved variables assuming that the velocity in the active layer can be evaluated by one of the empirical closure relations for capacity conditions found in literature van rijn 1984 lee and hsu 1994 ferreira et al 2009 recently new and more complex approaches to the bedload non equilibrium transport phenomenon have been derived based on a pioneering work charru 2006 the physical interaction between flow and sediment particles at the static moving bed layer interface was studied at a grain scale zech et al 2008 modelled the net exchange flux through the interface as a function of the shear stress at the moving layer and at the upper boundary of the static layer fernández nieto et al 2014 2017 proposed new empirical formulae for the erosion and deposition rates at the interface as well as a new closure relation for the actual sediment transport rate which reduces to the classical one under equilibrium conditions bohorquez and ancey 2016 also analysed erosion and deposition rates at the static moving interface including a new diffusion term in the bedload conservation equations furthermore the presence of bedrock strata underlying the erodible alluvial layers is ubiquitous in natural rivers and estuaries when a non erodible layer is reached by erosion the actual bedload transport rate over it can be affected and becomes different from the transport capacity of the flow leading to a non equilibrium transport state even under nearly uniform flow regimes some recent approaches to this topic consist on small adaptations of the classical bedload transport theory or on simple numerical fixes struiksma 1999 proposed to reduce the capacity transport rate in regions where the sediment becomes partially unavailable using a parameter based on the actual sediment thickness over the non erodible layer and the theoretical active layer thickness for the capacity transport state rulot et al 2012 proposed an iterative method to correct the over eroded cells by affecting the sediment distribution after each time step computation caviedes voullième et al 2017 implemented a numerical fix based on the limitation of the numerical solid flux at the intercell edges as a function of the available sediment volume at the involved cells although these simplified approaches to the finite depth erodible layer problem seem to work reasonably well in some conditions they offer a limited modelling ability of the real physical phenomenon and require a more detailed analysis in this work a new finite volume numerical scheme fvm is proposed based on the non equilibrium bedload transport assumption a modified version of the augmented roe riemann solver a roe murillo and garcía navarro 2010 martínez aranda et al 2019 has been used to compute an approximate solution for the coupled system of equations shallow water and non capacity bedload transport at each intercell local riemann problem the presence of finite depth erodible layers is directly taken into account for the computation of the actual bedload transport rate and the reconstruction of intermediate states of the approximate solution avoiding the unphysical negative sediment thickness appearance also the proposed formulation includes the equilibrium condition as a particular case therefore the numerical method developed is unique and offers identical properties for the evaluation of the relative performance of both formulations this paper is structured as follows in section 2 an expression for the net exchange flux through the interface separating the static and the moving bed layers is proposed based on a grain scale inertial analysis of the erosion deposition phenomenon and a new generalized grass type formula for the actual bedload transport rate is derived section 3 is devoted to the mathematical model assuming finite sediment thickness conditions and the non capacity bedload transport approach in section 4 the proposed a roe scheme is introduced analysing its stability region also the updating procedure is reported in section 5 the characteristics of the approximate solution at each local rp are analysed and new reconstruction techniques based on murillo and navas montilla 2016 are proposed to avoid unphysical results without affecting the stability region numerical results are reported in section 6 consisting of a hypothetical case with the aim of analysing the effects of non equilibrium formulation in the bedload transport and several experimental benchmarking tests in order to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed model finally the conclusions have been drawn in section 7 furthermore in appendix a d some extra details about the mathematical model and the numerical scheme have been provided 2 generalized non capacity formulation for bedload transport the conservation property for the sediment mass involved in bedload transport processes fig 1 can be expressed by means of the 1d continuity equation for both the erodible bed layer 1 z b t ξ q s x 0 and the static bed layer 2 z f t ξ η d η e with ξ 1 1 p being p the bed porosity and q s l 2 t 1 the actual bedload transport rate zb l the bed elevation above the datum zf l the static layer elevation above the datum and η d η e l t 1 the net mass exchange flux through the interface separating the moving active and the static bed layers operating 1 and 2 the mass conservation equation for the active layer can also be derived 3 η t ξ q s x ξ η d η e where η z b z f l is the thickness of the active bed layer from a grain scale inertial analysis charru 2006 new closure relations for the erosion and deposition rates η e and η d respectively can be derived as 4 η e k e δ θ s s 1 g d s 3 d s η d k d η d s s 1 g d s 3 d s being ke an erosion constant kd a deposition constant s ρ s ρ w the sediment relative density ds l the median diameter of the sediment particles the complete derivation of these expressions for the erosion and deposition rates is presented in appendix a the function δθ involves the incipient motion criterion for the bedload transport process and is expressed as 5 δ θ θ θ c if θ θ c 0 otherwise where θ τ b ρ s ρ w g d s is the non dimensional shields stress θc is the critical value of the shields stress for the incipient motion threshold g l t 2 is the gravity acceleration and τ b ρ w g n 2 u 2 h 1 3 m l 1 t 2 is the shear stress at the bed surface being n t l 3 the manning s roughness parameter h l the flow depth and u l t 1 the flow velocity closure relations found in literature for the solid transport rate under capacity equilibrium conditions q s can be written generally as 6 q s c θ m 1 δ θ m 2 s 1 g d s 3 with θ n 2 u 2 s 1 d s h 1 3 for all the formulations in table 1 it can be demonstrated that q s h 1 2 u 3 and hence a general formulation for the solid transport rate based on the grass law q s g u 3 has been adopted by other authors murillo and garcia navarro 2010 juez et al 2014 martínez aranda et al 2019 this formulation relates the equilibrium bedload sediment discharge with the depth averaged flow velocity by means of factor g h θ t 2 l 1 which represents the interaction between the flow and the bed layer and which depends only on the flow characteristics nevertheless when finite depth erodible layers are involved the sediment depth can be smaller than the theoretical thickness required to develop the capacity active layer or it can even become unavailable in some regions temporally in these cases the actual solid transport rate should be reduced respect to its equilibrium value 6 even under steady and uniform flow conditions the actual transport rate depends not only on the flow features but also on the sediment availability hence the common formulation for the grass interaction factor g is no longer valid new formulations for the solid transport rate taking into account the availability of sediment have to be considered when finite depth erodible layers are present moreover in the capacity approach the erosion and deposition rates are equal η d η e and hence using 4 the active layer thickness under equilibrium conditions η can be expressed as 7 η k e s k d δ θ d s note that in this case the moving layer thickness depends only on the shields dimensionless stress excess and the grain size therefore under equilibrium conditions 2 can be neglected and 1 reduces to the well known exner equation exner 1925 combining the expressions for the erosion and deposition rates in 4 the following relation can be derived 8 η η e η d k e d s s k d δ θ η η d η e η assuming a direct proportionality between the active layer thickness and actual solid transport rate from 6 and 8 it is possible to derive a closure relation for the non capacity solid transport rate 9 q s c θ m 1 δ θ m 2 1 s k d η k e d s s 1 g d s 3 note that 9 can be rewritten as 10 q s u s η where u s l t 1 is the mean velocity of the bedload sediment mass in the active layer 11 u s c θ m 1 δ θ m 2 1 s k d k e s 1 g d s 3 d s rewriting 9 in the grass law form the sediment fluid interaction parameter g becomes not only a function of the water depth h and the shields parameter θ but it also depends on the moving layer thickness η 12 q s g h θ η u 2 u with g γ 1 h γ 2 θ γ 3 η as displayed in table 2 the parameter γ3 is similar for all the empirical relations considered whereas the parameters γ1 and γ2 depend on the selected formulation this is the first of the novelties presented in the present work the new expression for the grass interaction factor g takes into account the actual thickness of the moving bed layer and allows to limit the actual solid discharge qs when non erodible strata are reached moreover if time flow features and sediment availability are enough to develop steady states in the bedload transport process the erosion and deposition rates tend to be equal and the solid transport rate recovers the common closure relation 6 for equilibrium transport conditions in the present model the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface can be calculated as η d η e using 4 other authors wu et al 2004 soliman and ushijima 2013 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 assumed a length lb l for the bedload discharge adaptation to its equilibrium state and calculated this exchange flux as q s q s l b l t 1 where q s is the capacity bedload transport rate and qs the actual transport rate comparison of both methods to determine the erosion deposition net flux indicates that the proposed model assumes a dynamic value for the adaptation length lb which is scaled following 13 l b θ k e d s according to 13 the reduction of the erosion constant ke leads to increasing dynamic adaptation length values and enhances non equilibrium bedload transport states on the other hand the higher the shields stress the longer the distance that the bedload discharge needs to reach its equilibrium state and hence highly erosive flows require higher values of the adaptation length lb this dependency of the adaptation length with the shear stress has not been previously derived instead most of the models assume a global value based on the dominant bed form wu 2007 as a summary the main features of the new generalized formulation for the bedload transport are the following for both capacity or non capacity hypothesis the bed layer continuity is modelled using 1 z b t ξ q s x 0 the generalized solid discharge is calculated using 12 q s g h θ η u 2 u with g γ 1 h γ 2 θ γ 3 η the assumption of non capacity implies to calculate the temporal evolution of the active layer thickness η using 3 η t ξ q s x ξ η d η e alternatively the capacity hypothesis consists of a particular case of the generalized bedload formulation the bedload transport rate qs collapses to the capacity transport rate q s assuming an equilibrium active layer thickness η calculated using 7 η k e s k d δ θ d s 3 governing equations for bedload transport with finite depth erodible layers the bedload transport process is controlled by the mass and momentum conservation equations for the flow and the mass conservation equations for the bed layer the potential presence of a non erodible layer fig 2 requires to decompose the bed elevation into two parts 14 z b x t z r x ϵ b x t being zr x l the non erodible layer elevation and ϵ b x t l the thickness of sediments over the non erodible stratum i e the depth of the finite erodible layer it is worth stressing that this sediment layer thickness is not the same as the active layer thickness η then the depth averaged system of governing equations for a 1d flow per unit width can be written as 15 h t q x 0 q t x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 g h z r x g h ϵ b x g h s f ϵ b t ξ q s x 0 being h q h u and ϵ b the conserved variables s f n 2 u u h 4 3 the friction slope caused by the shear stress on the bed layer and qs the actual solid transport rate using 12 it is possible to split the solid discharge derivative as follows 16 ξ q s x x ξ g u 3 ξ g u 3 x ξ u 3 g x ξ g u d h x d q x ξ u 3 g x being d 3 u 2 h therefore the spatial derivative of the solid flux is divided in two terms related with the flow features variation and a third term depending on the grass factor variation this allows to separate the convective flux vector as 17 f u x f j u x f g u x defining the jacobian component of the convective flux f j u x as 18 f j u x q x x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 ξ g u 3 x and the corrector flux vector f g u x 19 f g u x 0 0 ξ u 3 g x note that the flux variation term f g u x represents a corrector component for the solid flux variation in 18 and is caused by the spatial changes on the flow sediment interaction parameter g this corrector flux vector is mainly influenced by the presence of non erodible layers which can reduce the value of the physical solid discharge regardless of the local flow conditions according to 17 and adding the non conservative term g h ϵ b x to the right hand side of the momentum equation the system 15 can be rewritten in vector form as 20 u t j u u x h u u x f g u x s u with j u f j u 0 1 0 c 2 u 2 2 u 0 ξ g u d ξ g d 0 h u 0 0 0 0 0 g h 0 0 0 s u 0 g h z r x g h s f 0 t being u h q ϵ b t the vector of conserved variables j u the jacobian matrix of the convective fluxes h u the matrix of the non conservative fluxes s u the remaining source terms vector and c g h the celerity of the infinitesimal waves moreover an additional equation should be considered for the temporal evolution of the active layer thickness η under non capacity conditions 21 η t ξ q s x ξ η d η e 4 numerical scheme the system of eq 20 is solved according to a finite volume method fvm the numerical method proposed here for bed load transport is based on the reconstruction evolution and averaging steps method proposed originally by godunov 1959 the domain is divided in computational cells of size δ x x i 1 2 x i 1 2 and a piecewise constant representation of the exact solution u is assumed the theory of riemann problems can be applied to the intercell discontinuities even when the exact solution of the rp is unknown it is possible to estimate its variation by integrating 21 over a suitable control volume moreover to compute the solution evolution godunov methods allow the use of linearized approximate or weak solutions for the local rp at the intercell edges therefore assuming known piecewise constant values of u for the i cell at the time tn the first order godunov s method provides updated cell averaged values for the conserved variables at the next time t n 1 using the following explicit expression 22 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x f i 1 2 f i 1 2 where δt is the time step and f i 1 2 represents the numerical flux at the intercell edges the numerical flux contains all the information regarding convective jacobian fluxes corrector solid flux and source terms and will be formulated using an upwind scheme derived from the original augmented roe s scheme aroe proposed by murillo and garcía navarro 2010 the proposed aroe scheme for bedload transport solves an approximate linear rp of constant coefficients associated to the edge i 1 2 expressed as 23 u t m i 1 2 u x f i 1 2 g x s i 1 2 u x 0 u i if x 0 u i 1 if x 0 being u i u i n u i 1 u i 1 n and u x t the approximate solution the approximate jacobian matrix and corrector flux vector and the integrated source terms vector depend on the values of the conserved variables at the left and right cells that is m i 1 2 m u i u i 1 f i 1 2 g f g u i u i 1 and s i 1 2 s u i u i 1 the constant coefficient matrix m i 1 2 for the linearized rp at the intercell edge is defined as 24 m i 1 2 j u i u i 1 h u i u i 1 0 1 0 c 2 u 2 2 u c 2 ξ g u d ξ g d 0 integrating both the exact non conservative system 20 and the linearized system 23 over a suitable control volume and imposing the consistency condition for the approximated solution u x t n 25 δ x 2 δ x 2 u x t n d x δ x 2 δ x 2 u x t n d x leads to 26

for the linearized jacobian matrix m i 1 2 and corrector flux vector f i 1 2 g 27 δ x 2 δ x 2 f j x h u x d x δ f i 1 2 m m i 1 2 δ u i 1 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 f g x d x δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u 3 δ g i 1 2 t being δ f i 1 2 m the part of the convective fluxes that is modelled by means of the approximate jacobian matrix m at the interface edge the source terms have been integrated assuming the following time linearization 28 δ x 2 δ x 2 t n t n 1 s d t d x δ t δ x 2 δ x 2 s u i u i 1 t n d x δ t δ x 2 δ x 2 s i 1 2 d x δ t s i 1 2 δ t 0 g h δ z r g h s f δ x 0 i 1 2 being h h i h i 1 2 s f n u u h 4 3 n n i n i 1 2 and δ x x i 1 x i therefore following 27 the derivation of the edge averaged c u d and g has been done imposing 29 δ f i 1 2 m m u i u i 1 δ u i 1 2 m u i u i m u i with δ f i 1 2 m δ q δ h u 2 1 2 g h 2 g h δ ϵ b ξ g δ u 3 i 1 2 and using 16 an additional condition is also imposed to ensure the solid mass conservation property 30 δ ξ q s i 1 2 ξ g δ u i 1 2 3 ξ u 3 δ g i 1 2 according to 29 and 30 the following explicit expressions can be obtained for the edge averaged quantities c u d 31 c g h u u i h i u i 1 h i 1 h i h i 1 d u i 2 u i 1 2 u i u i 1 h i h i 1 h i h i 1 h i h i 1 and for the edge averaged grass factor g 32 g g i h i 1 3 2 g i 1 h i 3 2 h i h i 1 3 3 h i h i 1 h i h i 1 g i u i 2 g i 1 u i 1 2 3 u i u i 1 g i h i h i 1 g i 1 h i h i 1 h i h i 1 3 u i 2 u i 1 2 u i u i 1 this edge averaged flow sediment interaction factor g depends not only on the values of the grass parameter at the left and right cells of the edge but also on the local flow features at both cells hence it follows the eigenstructure of the roe s matrix m i 1 2 and its properties for some especial numerical situations have been analized in appendix b the linearized matrix m i 1 2 is assumed diagonalizable with 3 different approximate real eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 which must be computed from the characteristic polynomial using the cardano vieta formula martínez aranda et al 2019 explicit expressions for the calculation of the eigenvalues of the linearized matrix have been provided in appendix c it is worth stressing that one eigenvalue is always opposite to the velocity direction and two of them have the same sign 33 λ 1 0 λ 2 λ 3 if u 0 λ 1 λ 2 0 λ 3 if u 0 therefore m i 1 2 can be expressed as 34 m i 1 2 p λ p 1 i 1 2 with λ i 1 2 λ 1 0 0 0 λ 2 0 0 0 λ 3 where matrix p i 1 2 is constructed as p e 1 e 2 e 3 being e m the eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue λ m and obtained imposing the condition m i 1 2 e m λ m e m 35 e m 1 λ m λ m u 2 c 2 c 2 i 1 2 t following toro 1997 the conserved variable differences δ u i 1 2 and source term spatial integral s i 1 2 at the intercell edge are projected on the eigenvector basis in order to obtain the wave and source strength vectors a i 1 2 and b i 1 2 respectively 36 a i 1 2 α 1 α 2 α 3 t p 1 δ u i 1 2 δ u i 1 2 m α m e m b i 1 2 β 1 β 2 β 3 t p 1 s i 1 2 s i 1 2 m β m e m a complete description of the explicit expressions obtained for the wave and source strengths can be found in appendix c furthermore the corrector flux vector 27 can be split as δ f i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 g defining 37 δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u 3 δ g i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u 3 δ g i 1 2 being δ g i 1 2 g g i and δ g i 1 2 g i 1 g this splitting of the corrector vector is directly controlled by the value of the grass interaction parameter g at the intercell edge an hence it is directly linked to the jacobian matrix eigenstructure the corrector flux at the left cell δ f i 1 2 g can be associated to the fastest wave traveling with negative velocity whereas the corrector flux at the right cell δ f i 1 2 g can be associated to the fastest wave travelling with positive velocity the rankine hugoniot conditions for the split corrector fluxes lead to 38 δ f i 1 2 g λ 1 δ u i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 g λ 3 δ u i 1 2 g being δ u i 1 2 g and δ u i 1 2 g the intermediate solution variation associated to the corrector fluxes the second novelty of the present work is this upwind splitting of the convective solid flux associated to the grass factor variation between cells an explanation about the necessity of including this corrector flux to ensure the solid mass conservation in the local rp has been included in appendix d one consequence of roe s linearization is that the resulting approximate solution of the local rp at the incercell edge is reconstructed using only discontinuities and u x t consists of a sum of jumps or shocks the construction of the upwind numerical fluxes required in 22 is based on the properties of the linearized jacobian matrix eigenstructure murillo and navas montilla 2016 according to godunov s method it is sufficient to provide the solution for u x t at the intercell edge position x x i 1 2 in order to obtain the associated numerical fluxes the reconstruction of the approximate solution at the left and right side of the intercell edge u i and u i 1 respectively can be expressed as 39 u i u i m γ m e m i 1 2 δ u i 1 2 g u i 1 u i 1 m γ m e m i 1 2 δ u i 1 2 g where γ m α m β m λ m and the subscript index m and m under the sums indicate waves traveling with negative and positive velocities respectively therefore the intermediate numerical fluxes at the left and right side of the intercell edge f i 1 2 and f i 1 2 respectively can be expressed as 40 f i 1 2 f i f i m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g f i 1 2 f i 1 f i 1 m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g finally the first order godunov s updating formulation 22 can be rewritten for the cell i as 41 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x f i f i also it is possible to rewrite 41 in fluctuation form as 42 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x δ f i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 with 43 δ f i 1 2 m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g therefore the approximate solution of u x t for the linearized rp at the intercell edge i 1 2 consists of 5 regions connected by 4 waves the three waves corresponding to the linearized matrix eigenvalues λ m plus one additional steady wave with null celerity accounting for the source terms fig 3 considering a positive average velocity u 0 and using 39 the intermediate states for the conserved variables can be expressed as 44 u i 1 u i γ 1 e 1 δ u g u i 1 2 u i 1 3 γ 2 e 2 u i 1 3 u i 1 γ 3 e 3 δ u g so that using 40 the associated fluxes for each intermediate state are 45 f i 1 f i λ 1 γ 1 e 1 δ f g f i 1 2 f i 1 3 λ 2 γ 2 e 2 f i 1 3 f i 1 λ 3 γ 3 e 3 δ f g for the sake of clarity the subscript index i 1 2 has been omitted in 44 and 45 the reconstruction of the approximate solution should be analysed in order to ensure positivity of the water depth values murillo and garcía navarro 2010 furthermore the unphysical over erosion when finite depth erodible layers are presented has to be avoided that is the positivity of the sediment layer thickness has to be ensured a detailed explanation of the approximate solution reconstruction method proposed in this work is reported in section 5 4 1 resolution method with capacity and non capacity approaches starting from known values of the conserved variables h q ϵ b i n in the cell i at the time tn and the value of the active layer thickness at the same time η i n applying 41 or 42 allows us to update the solution of the conserved variables to the next time t n 1 i e h q ϵ b i n 1 regardless of the capacity or non capacity approach has been considered however the updating procedure for active layer thickness depends on the assumption made for the bedload transport using the capacity formulation 7 the active layer thickness at the next time step t n 1 is directly computed as 46 η i n 1 k e s k d δ θ i n 1 d s where δ θ i n 1 is the non dimensional shields excess 5 at the cell i computed with the conserved variables updated to time n 1 47 δ θ i n 1 θ i n 1 θ c if θ i n 1 θ c 0 otherwise however the assumption of the non equilibrium approach leads to the necessity of solving eq 21 for each time step in order to update the solution of the active layer thickness η i n 1 a semi implicit procedure is used in the present work 1 an intermediate state is predicted using only the convective fluxes 48 η i n 1 2 η i n δ t δ x f 3 i f 3 i being f 3 i the numerical solid fluxes at the intercell edge 40 2 intermediate values of the erosion and deposition rates η e i n 1 2 and η d i n 1 2 respectively are computed using 49 η e i n 1 2 k e δ θ i n 1 s s 1 g d s 3 d s η d i n 1 2 k d η i n 1 2 d s s 1 g d s 3 d s 3 the value of η is finally updated to the next time t n 1 incorporating the net exchange flux at the static moving bed layers interface 50 η i n 1 η i n 1 2 δ t ξ η d i n 1 2 η e i n 1 2 independently of capacity or non capacity assumption once the active layer thickness has been updated its value has to be limited in presence of non erodible layers 51 if η i n 1 ϵ b i n 1 η i n 1 ϵ b i n 1 and the actual solid rate for the next time step n 1 is computed as 52 q s i n 1 g i n 1 u i n 1 2 u i n 1 with 53 g i n 1 γ 1 h i n 1 γ 2 θ i n 1 γ 3 η i n 1 this mechanism effectively reduces the actual solid transport rate qs in cells which are close to be fully scoured by the flow and hence it improves the stability of the proposed scheme in regions where finite depth erodible layers exist 4 2 stability region the time step should be dynamically limited to ensure that there is no interaction of waves from neighboring riemann problems if the positivity of the water depth h and the erodible layer thickness ϵ b values at the intermediate states of the solution is guaranteed in order to construct an updated cell average solution u i n 1 it is only necessary that the average values at the intercell edges remain constant in time over the entire time step this unique requirement allows us to define an upper limit for the time step depending only on the characteristic waves celerity and the spatial cell size in consequence the stability region at the intercell edge i 1 2 is defined as 54 δ t λ i 1 2 δ x max m λ m i 1 2 therefore the global time step for the updated solution calculation is obtained applying a cfl condition 55 δ t cfl min i 1 n 1 δ t λ i 1 2 where cfl 1 and n is the total number of cells in which the conserved variables should be solved at each time calculation 5 approximate solution reconstruction and positivity control with finite depth erodible layers 5 1 active control of the sediment thickness positivity ac stp this is a common issue in sediment transport numerical schemes dealing with finite depth sediment layers dewals et al 2011 fernández nieto et al 2014 rulot et al 2012 struiksma 1999 caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 which requires to control the numerical solution in order to ensure non negative values of the sediment mass i e avoiding over eroded cells where sediment mass is numerically created leading to accuracy conservation and stability issues a widely extended strategy struiksma 1999 caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 to deal with this drawback is to reduce the time step ensuring in this way the positivity of the cell averaged ϵ b n 1 values but leading to an important increase of the computational effort on the other hand in the context of sw equations over static bed murillo and garcía navarro 2010 proposed for the water depth variable h a new reconstruction strategy based on enforcing positivity on the intermediate solutions of the linearized rp at the intercell edge the method offers a twofold benefit it avoids unphysical negative values of the cell averaged water depth and the time step is preserved this approach is adapted in this work to sw equations involving erodible bed where the number of waves is increased focusing on the active control of the sediment thickness ϵ b positivity ac stp this reconstruction procedure for the approximate solution is the third main novelty presented in this work considering u 0 and 44 the solution at the next time ϵ b n 1 at the left cell fig 4 can be evaluated as 56 ϵ b i n 1 ϵ b i n λ 1 δ t δ x 2 ϵ b i 1 ϵ b i n 0 with ϵ b i 1 ϵ b i n γ 1 e 1 3 δ ϵ b g being ϵ b i 1 the sediment thickness intermediate state associated to the wave 1 and δ ϵ b g the sediment thickness jump due to the variation of the grass factor between cell center i and cell edge i 1 2 38 for the right cell it can be expressed as 57 ϵ b

thickness intermediate states associated to the waves 2 and 3 and δ ϵ b g the sediment thickness jump due to the variation of the grass factor between cell edge i 1 2 and cell center i 1 38 the right cell approximate solution in 57 can be rewritten defining an averaged intermediate sediment thickness ϵ b i 1 32 at the right side of the edge 58 ϵ b i 1 32 ϵ b i 1 3 λ 2 λ 3 γ 2 e 2 3 introducing 58 in 57 the right sediment thickness average solution can be rewritten in the following way 59 ϵ b i 1 n 1 ϵ b i 1 n λ 3 δ t δ x 2 ϵ b i 1 32 ϵ b i 1 n 0 the stability condition requires both λ 1 δ t δ x 2 1 and λ 3 δ t δ x 2 1 hence from 56 and 59 we can derive the conditions ϵ b i 1 0 and ϵ b i 1 32 0 respectively to ensure positive cell averaged solutions since the presence of a finite depth erodible layer and its influence in the solid intercell flux is mainly contained in the corrector flux vector the following limits for the corrector sediment thickness jump are proposed 60 δ ϵ b g δ ϵ

actual moving layer thickness η when a non erodible stratum is reached the step 4 of the above strategy is a guarantee for extreme cases 5 2 wet dry treatment for sediment fronts a special situation can occur when a sediment front arrives to a non erodible step higher than the erodible bed elevation fig 5 in a discrete approach considering a positive velocity u 0 at the edge i 1 2 the direction of the numerical solid flux at the intercell edge ξ q s i 1 2 is also positive and hence the sediment mass is transfered from cell i to cell i 1 but if the bed level at the left cell z r i ϵ b i is lower than the non erodible stratum elevation at the right cell z r i 1 the solid mass transfer can suffer of a physical obstacle that is not considered in the numerical scheme if the non erodible step is high enough the sediment mass transfer between cells is canceled by means of a nil numerical solid flux at the intercell edge to model this physical situation the following strategy is adopted in the present work if z r ϵ b i z r i 1 and ξ q s i 1 2 0 a if z r ϵ b 1 i z r i 1 the sediment progresses normally and the numerical solid flux ξ q s i 1 2 is computed as in 40 b if z r ϵ b 1 i z r i 1 the sediment can not progress to the cell i 1 and hence ξ q s i 1 2 is set null applying the following strategy 63 1 δ ϵ b g ξ q s i λ 1 γ 1 e 1 3 λ 1 2 δ f g 0 0 λ 1 δ ϵ b g δ f g δ f i 1 2 g δ f

ensuring the solid mass conservation and avoiding marked time step reductions 6 numerical tests 6 1 transport of a finite depth rectangular dune the aim of this original test case is to study the influence of the non capacity assumption on the transport of a non cohesive rectangular dune over a non erodible layer with positive slope a domain 100 m long δ x 1 m is considered with a non erodible layer constant slope of 0 1 the rectangular dune is placed at 20 m x 40 m and its initial thickness is set to 1 m a constant inlet water discharge of q i n 5 m 2 s is considered and the water depth at the outlet is set to h o u t 1 99 m the manning s roughness coefficient is n 0 02 sm 1 3 for both the sediment material and the non erodible layer the sediment features are density ρ s 2650 kg m 3 particle diameter d s 1 mm internal friction angle ϕ e 35 porosity p 0 4 the effects of both the deposition constant value and the relation between erosion and deposition constants will be analized in detail using this erosive numerical test the initial state for the sediment transport simulation was calculated developing the flow for static bed conditions until steady state was reached fig 6 the initial flow regime was subcritical in the whole domain except at 39 m x 40 m where a supercritical regime was reached to compute the bed load solid transport rate the proposed meyer peter müller formulation see table 2 was chosen the deposition constant was initially set to k e 0 3 with a relation k e k d 10 according to literature values fernández nieto et al 2017 bohorquez and ancey 2016 also the initial value for active layer thickness η was set to its value under equilibrium state η using 7 the temporal bed level evolution has been depicted in fig 7 considering capacity and non capacity approaches a visual comparison of the bed profiles at different time steps shows the most marked differences between both approaches at the tail of the dune where the shield stress excess δθ had the highest initial values and hence the adaptation length was longer as time progressed and the dune moved downstream the erosion and deposition rates are high enough to allow a fast transition to equilibrium transport conditions on the bedload layer and hence the capacity and non capacity solutions tended to approximate calibration of the erosion and deposition rates i e the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface is a key point in non capacity bed load models and it has a huge influence on the numerical results a wide range of values for the erosion and deposition constants can be found in literature charru 2006 fernández nieto et al 2014 bohorquez and ancey 2016 lajeunesse et al 2010 leading to high uncertainty in the numerical results obtained with non capacity models usually values for the erosion constant are of the order k e o 10 2 10 1 whereas the relation ke kd varies from 2 to 30 fig 8 shows the bed level profile at different times considering non capacity approach and ke increasing from 0 3 to 1 0 k d k e 10 reduction of the erosion constant ke led to an increment of the equivalent bedload adaptation length 13 and hence the transport rate differs more from the equilibrium value at the dune downward slope this non equilibrium state reduced the solid transport rate at the head of the downward slope and increased the transport rates at the toe with respect to the corresponding capacity transport rates this fact caused a high erosion effect downstream the bed dune where the flow regime changes from subcritical to supercritical even with the same relation ke kd comparison of the erosion deposition net exchange flux see fig 9 right column along the dune domain shows the highest non equilibrium zones at the upward and downward slopes of the rectangular dune for the first stages of the bed movement negative values of η d η e imply erosion of the static layer taking place whereas positive values lead to aggradation of static bed layer an important erosive net flux appears at the downward slope of the dune associated to a strong shear stress change the flow is changing from subcritical to supercritical regime and to lower values of the moving layer thickness see fig 9 left column furthermore two important points should be noted first as the bed movement progresses with time the imbalance between erosion and deposition rates tends to disappear which is in agreement with the non equilibrium assumption second as the erosion constant ke decreases the imbalance between erosion and deposition rates at the downward slope of the dune tends to become more marked and to extend in time demonstrating an agreement between the erosion deposition formulation proposed in this work and the classical approach for the net exchange flux adopted by other authors wu 2007 paquier and el kadi 2008 finally fig 10 depicts the active layer thickness η computed with the non capacity formulation at different times along the dune profile it is worth noting that the reduction of the relation ke kd led to a reduction of the moving layer thickness however as ke kd decreased the non equilibrium in the bedload transport state did not show marked modifications 6 2 dam break over light weight sediment flat bed the aim of this benckmak test is to analyze the behavior of the proposed model against highly erosive unsteady flows this experimental test spinewine and zech 2007 consists of an idealized dam break flow over a light weight sediment flat bed made of cylindrical pvc pellets with equivalent diameter d s 3 9 mm density ρ 1580 kg m 3 internal friction angle ϕ 30 and porosity p 0 42 the experiment was carried out in a 6 m long and 0 25 m width the flume was uniformly filled to a height of 0 1 m over the flume floor with the light weight sediment breaking of the dam was reproduced by the downward movement of a pneumatically actuated thin gate placed at the middle of the flume the initial water level was 0 35 m upstream the gate and nil downstream once the gate was open and the dam break wave progressed downstream an intense sediment transport process started instantaneously caused by the high fluid velocity and the low sediment density the temporal evolutions of the free water surface bed surface and static moving bed layer interface were reported experimentally until 1 5 sec after the gate opening each 0 25 s the simulations have been performed with a cell size δ x 0 01 m manning roughness coefficient n 0 028 s m 3 deposition constant k d 0 03 erosion constant k e 0 2 and cfl 0 95 the actual transport rate has been estimated using a modified version of the mpm model with the coefficient c 16 in order to correctly capture the influence of the low density of the erodible layer particles zech et al 2008 fig 11 shows the numerical results for the temporal evolution of the free water surface bed level and static moving bed layers interface with the equilibrium approach left column and the non capacity approach right column in general a good agreement with measured data can be found with both assumptions especially at times greater than t 0 50 s for the first stages after the gate opening 0 s t 0 75 s both models underestimate the thickness of the moving bed layer η see table 3 and fig 12 this discrepancy can be generated by the marked vertical velocities that appear at the first instants of the fluid movement fent et al 2019 that can not be captured by the depth averaged model however the free water surface and the bed level were well predicted table 3 and the propagation velocity of the dam break wave was accurately captured see fig 11 some differences between numerical results and observed data appeared at the gate region this region is the most affected by vertical fluid velocities at the first stages of the dam break flow and suffers an intense erosion process during the whole experiment it is worth mentioning that the non equilibrium formulation was not able to improve the agreement of the computed static moving interface level zf and bed level zb with those observed experimentally compared with the results obtained using the capacity formulation nevertheless the prediction of the free water surface level wsl computed with the non capacity bedload transport formulation showed lower deviations respect to the experimental data than the capacity results for all the dam break stages fig 12 shows the moving bed layer thickness distribution at three different times during the dam break wave propagation both approaches underestimated η but the results can be considered reasonable specially for the later stages table 3 for the first stages the sediment thickness computed using the equilibrium model offer a better approximation to those observed in laboratory than the result obtained with non capacity model however as time progresses and the fluid moves downstream the non capacity model predicts better the active thickness distribution with lower rmse for times larger than 0 75 s the net exchange flux η d η e through the static moving bed layers interface shows a marked erosive non equilibrium for the firsts stages of the wave advance 0 t 0 75 s at the whole dam break wave domain see fig 13 top nevertheless as the flow moves downstream this net exchange flux tends to reduce generally approaching progressively to the equilibrium state at t 1 5 s i e null net exchange flux except at the dam break wave front and the gate region where flow changes from subcritical to supercritical conditions in these two regions marked erosive net exchange fluxes are maintained through the static moving bed layers interface during the whole simulation time note that in the region between the gate and the wave front a quasi uniform net exchange flux appears for the later stages 0 75 s t 1 5 s in this region the relationship between the dimensionless active layer thickness η d s 1 and the excess of shields stress δθ also tends progressively to near equilibrium conditions signaled by the fact that the slope of the η d s 1 δ θ curve is reducing as the dam break flow progresses see fig 13 bottom therefore the slope of the η d s 1 δ θ curve tends to be nil as near equilibrium states are progressively reached during the dam break wave advance it is worth mentioning that the equilibrium state is a particular case where from 7 the relation η d s 1 δ θ c o n s t k e s k d can be derived 6 3 dike breaking by overtopping as in the previous case the aim of this benchmark test is to analyze the behavior of the proposed model against highly erosive unsteady flows this experimental test case was carried out tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 in a straight rectangular cross section flume 35 m long and 1 m wide a trapezoidal dyke was constructed in the middle of the flume with a non cohesive sand of characteristic diameter d s 1 13 mm d 30 0 52 mm d 50 0 86 mm d 90 3 80 mm density ρ 2650 kg m 3 internal stability angle ϕ 30 and porosity p 0 22 the height over the non erodible flume bed and crest width of the dyke were 0 80 m and 0 30 m respectively a vertical plate was placed at the middle of the crest in order to achieve horizontal water surface elevations upstream the dyke in a first step a constant discharge was set at the flume inlet and the upstream reach was filled to a height of 3 cm over the dyke crest then the plate was suddenly lifted up to allow overflow to start maintaining the constant inlet discharge the dyke surface evolution was recorded by photography temporal bed elevation data are provided at p 1 15 cm p 2 65 cm and p 3 115 cm with distances measured from the midpoint of the dyke crest the temporal evolution of the discharge at the dyke crest and the upstream reservoir level were also reported two different experiment c1 and c2 have been used to test the proposed model capabilities the inlet discharge and the dyke upstream and downstream slopes su and sd respectively have been summarized in table 4 the cell size for the simulations was δ x 0 01 m the manning s roughness coefficient was calibrated as n 0 15 sm 1 3 and the cfl was set to 0 95 the erosion and deposition constants ke and kd respectively used in simulations for each benchmarking test have also been reported in table 4 6 3 1 case c1 fig 14 shows the numerical results considering the equilibrium transport assumption for the temporal evolutions of both the reservoir level and the discharge at the dyke crest with different empirical formulations for the bedload transport rate measured data have also been plotted for comparison the smart cbfs formulation juez et al 2013 offers the best results especially for the discharge at the dyke crest but overestimates the erosion of the dyke at the first stages after the overflow starting on the other hand both meyer peter müller and fernández luque closure relations underestimate the bedload transport rate resulting in a slower evolution of the dyke surface and leading to a lower peak in the discharge hydrograph the smart cbfs closure relation has been chosen to study the influence of the non capacity approach on the computed dyke surface evolution for case c1 fig 15 shows the numerical results considering both capacity and non capacity approaches for the temporal evolutions of the reservoir water level and discharge at the crest the obtained results have also been plotted against the measured data and the numerical results reported in juez et al 2014 where a 2d weakly coupled equilibrium model was used for simulations although the predicted peak in the discharge with non capacity formulation is lower than those observed in the laboratory in general the numerical results agree better with the measured data than those obtained with both the proposed 1d model under equilibrium hypothesis and the 2d model reported by juez et al 2014 improving the reservoir level and discharge predictions table 5 furthermore the dyke bed surface evolution has been plotted in fig 16 at probes p1 p2 and p3 considering the modified smart cbfs formulation under capacity and non capacity conditions the non equilibrium hypothesis is able to improve the agreement with bed evolution measured data at all the probes see table 5 at the first stages after the overflow starts marked non equilibrium states are obtained by the active layer thickness η nevertheless as time progresses the bedload transport tends to reach the equilibrium state and the active layer thickness approximates its value under capacity conditions 6 3 2 case c2 case c2 represents a more challenging benchmark for numerical models the steeper dyke downward slope leads to a more energetic overtopping flow with elevated erosion rates and also involving stability failures as in the previous case c1 the best agreement with observed data is achieved with the bedload transport rate computed with the modified smart cbfs closure relation fig 17 shows the dyke surface at times t 30 s and t 60 s after the overflow starts whereas fig 18 depicts the temporal evolutions of the reservoir water level and discharge at the crest numerical results considering both equilibrium and non capacity approaches have been plotted against measured data the equilibrium condition largely overestimates the erosion of the dyke surface at the firsts stages after the flow starts leading to a rapid decrease in the reservoir level and reaching the peak of the discharge hydrograph faster than observed in laboratory fig 18 on the other hand in general considering non equilibrium conditions improves the agreement between numerical results and measured data especially at the first stages after the gate opening despite the stability failures observed at the downward dyke slope during the experiment the measured and computed dyke surfaces considering the non equilibrium hypothesis show a good agreement the root mean square error for the non capacity results were lower for the dyke profile at time t 30 s and slightly higher for the time t 60 s than those obtained with the capacity bedload transport formulation table 6 furthermore the non equilibrium model improved both the reservoir level and the discharge at the dike crest predictions the root mean square error for the reservoir level prediction and the discharge at the dyke crest were much lower with the non capacity formulation than those obtained considering the equilibrium hypothesis however the numerical model considering non capacity solid transport formulation was not able to properly predict the magnitude of the hydrograph peak observed in laboratory fig 18 finally table 7 shows the cpu computational times for tests c1 and c2 using both capacity and non capacity approaches and the modified smart cbfs formula for the determination of the solid transport rate differences on computational effort associated to the assumption of capacity or non capacity formulation can be considered negligible in both benchmark tests 6 4 evolution of a trench over non erodible layer this experimental benchmark test aims to demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed active control of the sediment thickness positivity method ac stp compared with the classical time step reduction method tsr to avoid unphysical over eroded regions without increasing the required computational cost the experiments were carried out by struiksma 1999 consisting in the propagation of a trench excavated in a uniform sand bed over a 3 m long non erodible layer made of a medium gravel 8 16 mm the experiments were performed in a straight rectangular cross section flume with an effective length of 11 5 m and a width of 0 20 m the flume was filled with uniform sand d s 0 45 mm ρ 2650 kg m 3 ϕ 32 and p 0 38 to a height of 0 15 m above the flume concrete floor covering also the non erodible layer in a first step a constant discharge was set at the flume inlet and both water and sand were recirculated until uniform bed slope was achieved the water level was controlled by an adjustable tailgate at the flume outlet once a steady bed slope was reached a 2 m long and 0 04 m deep trench was excavated upstream the gravel layer the flow was restarted and this bed perturbation propagated downstream disappearing over the non erodible layer exposing the gravel stratum and reappearing downstream later struiksma 1999 proposed a solid transport rate formula q s κ u 5 to reproduce the advance velocity of the trench with κ being a tuning parameter which should be calibrated therefore an adapted expression to adjust g κ u 2 has been derived for the proposed scheme this case has previously been used for benchmarking by caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 dewals et al 2011 struiksma 1999 since it reproduces a process of great interest and measured bed elevation data are available two different experimental tests are reproduced in this work c1 and c2 the main difference between both experiments is that in c2 the initial sand thickness over the non erodible layer is lower than in the case c1 and hence the gravel stratum is exposed longer the cell size for the simulations is δ x 0 05 m the erosion and deposition constant are initially set to k e 2 10 3 and k d 1 10 5 respectively and the cfl is set to 0 95 the flow and sediment transport features used in simulations for both tests have been reported in table 8 whereas the initial profiles for both the gravel and the erodible layers as well as the water surface elevation are shown in fig 19 fig 20 depicts the temporal bed evolution for both cases and compares the measured data black points with the numerical results obtained by the proposed model considering non capacity point dashed blue lines and equilibrium solid blue lines approaches numerical results obtained with the coupled scheme reported by martínez aranda et al 2019 are also shown dashed red lines this model uses the capacity approach for the transport rate determination and the over erosion problems are controlled by reducing the dynamic time step to avoid cells with negative sediment thickness values tsr strategy the time step reduction is limited to 10 of the value determined by the original cfl condition hence solid mass conservation problems can appear at cells where this reduction is not enough the scheme proposed in this work is able to reproduce the trench propagation process over the gravel stratum considering both equilibrium and non capacity conditions the non capacity approach with k e 2 10 3 seems to introduce an extra diffusion term on the numerical solution comparing with the equilibrium approach although the trench propagation velocity is similar and agreeing with the observed data for both tests the present model using the ac stp method to avoid over erosion was able to improve largely the prediction of the trench propagation obtained with the scheme reported in martínez aranda et al 2019 using the tsr strategy see table 9 furthermore most numerical models dealing with these cases caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 dewals et al 2011 predict an excavated region downstream the gravel stratum which was not observed in experiments that excavated zone is also reproduced here using the equilibrium model martínez aranda et al 2019 with the classical time reduction tsr treatment for the non erodible layer the present non capacity formulation k e 2 10 3 is able to eliminate totally this excavation for case c1 and to reduce it significantly for case c2 the solid transport qs over the gravel stratum is reduced as an effect of the sediment unavailability using 51 this reduction interferes with the equivalent non equilibrium adaptation length leading to a solid transport rate smaller than the flow transport capacity downstream the gravel stratum therefore the solid transport rate at the downstream region is lower with non capacity formulation than that considering the equilibrium hypothesis reducing the excavation fig 21 shows the effects of the erosion constant ke increase on the evolution of the excavated region downstream the gravel stratum lower erosion constant ke values lead to an increment of the equivalent adaptation length 13 the reduction of the physical solid transport rate applied in cells where the theoretical active layer thickness η is greater than the available sediment thickness ϵ b leads to a more stable propagation of the trench over the gravel stratum and reduces the excavated region downstream as the erosion constant ke increases the equivalent adaptation length decreases and the non equilibrium solid transport states caused by the appearance of the non erodible layer are also reduced hence the non capacity solution tends approximate to the equilibrium bed evolution profile see fig 21 with k e 2 10 2 the non capacity results practically agree with the equilibrium prediction demonstrating the sensitivity of the model to the erosion deposition constants calibration finally the positivity control mechanism for the sediment thickness 61 and 62 is triggered many times during simulations as the gravel stratum is successively exposed and recovered during the trench advance in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ac stp method additional simulations were carried out considering the proposed model but using the classical tsr strategy to avoid unphysical over eroded cells using both equilibrium and non equilibrium hypothesis fig 22 shows the bed profiles for case c1 at t 3 h and case c2 at t 4 h times when the whole gravel stratum was exposed the bed level predictions computed with capacity ac stp and capacity tsr methods showed small variations caused by the different treatment of non erodible stratum similar small variations were found comparing non capacity ac stp and non capacity tsr methods however using the ac stp method the numerical solution remains stable and it is not necessary to reduce the time step to ensure the sediment mass conservation or numerical stability fig 23 unlike using tsr method caviedes voullième et al 2017 furthermore the time step reduction strategy demonstrates not to be able to avoid completely the over erosion problems without a marked reduction of the time step leading to much a higher computational effort for the simulations table 10 moreover as the time step reduction is limited to avoid an excessive computational effort solid mass conservation errors appear in cells which require higher limitations to remain positive sediment thickness values 7 conclusions in this work recently developed non equilibrium bedload transport concepts have been used to propose a new numerical model able to deal with highly unsteady flows and partially non erodible bed layers based on a grain scale analysis of the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface charru 2006 new expressions for the erosion and deposition rates η e and η d respectively have been obtained as well as a generalized formula for the non capacity bedload transport rate qs as a function of the active layer thickness η the equilibrium state consists of a particular case of the generalized bedload formulation derived the proposed transport rate formulation allows to limit the physical solid flux at cells in regions where the total sediment thickness ϵ b hinders the development of equilibrium solid transport states a new generalized grass type formulation is proposed for the non equilibrium bedload transport rate this is the first of the main novelties reported in the present work the system of equations composed by the one dimensional shallow water and the mass conservation equations for the bed layer 4 equations has been solved using a first order finite volume a roe scheme the convective flux vector is separated in a part accounting for the flow depending terms plus a corrector component associated to the grass factor g variation the second novelty of the present work is this upwind splitting of the convective solid flux an improved reconstruction strategy for the approximated solution at each local rp allows to avoid the appearance of unphysical results in the erodible layer thickness ϵ b one of the most important problems reported for equilibrium and non equilibrium bedload numerical models dealing with non erodible layers caviedes voullième et al 2017 dewals et al 2011 this new reconstruction strategy is the third novelty presented in this work currently a high uncertainty exists about the calibration of the non capacity parameters erosion deposition constants ke and kd or adaptation length lb in other models wu and wang 2007 zhang and duan 2011 soliman and ushijima 2013 and their effect on numerical predictions the model has been tested against a hypothetical case consisting of a rectangular dune made of non cohesive sand moving over a non erodible bed layer the sensitivity of the numerical evolution of the dune surface to the non capacity parameters calibration has been analysed one of our conclusions is that the relation ke kd controls the active layers thickness and hence the mean velocity at the moving sediment layer furthermore the reduction of ke leads to increasing non equilibrium conditions as it happens with the adaptation length lb increments in flux relaxation models the highest ke the fastest the bedload solid transport is able to achieve equilibrium states even for constant ke kd relation the proposed model has been benchmarked against different sediment transport laboratory experiments involving unsteady flows enhanced bed changes by light weight sediments and underlying non erodible layers scour the model is able to predict the measured data in all the cases tested the non equilibrium bedload transport assumption improves the results obtained in most of the cases especially for the dyke breaking by overtopping benchmarking test 6 3 and the trench propagation over a non erodible layer test 6 4 however the numerical results obtained are very sensitive to the calibration of the non capacity parameters which can become a difficult task on the other hand the proposed reconstruction strategy to avoid negative values in the sediment thickness ϵ b demonstrates to improve the results obtained with the classical numerical fixes used up till now for cases involving finite depth erodible layers regardless of equilibrium or non equilibrium approaches this technique allows to ensure the solid mass conservation property allowing numerical stability with time steps larger than other approaches and hence improves the computational efficiency of scheme acknowledgements this work was partially funded by the mineco feder under research project cgl2015 66114 r and by diputacion general de aragon dga through fondo europeo de desarrollo regional feder appendix a erosion and deposition rates derivation the derivation of the expressions used in this work for the erosion and deposition rates η e and η d respectively was based on the physical background proposed by charru 2006 for the net exchange flux between the static and moving bed layers a1 deposition rate the particle deposition rate n d is related to the number of moving particles n and the characteristic deposition time td a 1 n d n t d p a r t t 1 the characteristic time of the deposition process is controlled by gravity and depends on the deposition velocity ωs and the particle diameter ds a 2 1 t d ω s d s 1 t d k d s 1 g d s d s and hence the particle deposition rate can be expressed as a 3 n d k d n d s s 1 g d s 3 d s being kd a deposition constant on the other hand the number of particles in movement on a bed surface of unit area δ a δ x δ y 1 and which are affected by deposition in a time step td are related to the thickness of the active bedload layer η a 4 n η δ a ξ d s 3 where ξ 1 1 p being p the porosity of the active layer which is considered the same as the static layer the relation between the particle deposition rate and the temporal variation of the active layer thickness due to deposition in a bed area δa is expressed as a 5 η d n d ξ d s 3 δ a therefore replacing a 4 and a 5 in a 3 the temporal variation of the moving layer thickness due to deposition can be expressed as a 6 η d k d η d s s 1 g d s 3 d s l t 1 a2 erosion rate the particle erosion rate n e is related to the number n of static particles exposed to the flow action and the characteristic erosion time te a 7 n e n t e p a r t t 1 the particles which are exposed to the flow shear stress in a bed surface of unit area δ a δ x δ y 1 and which can be incorporated to the moving layer in a time step te are placed on the top layer of the static sediment column and hence a 8 n d s δ a ξ d s 3 n e δ a t e ξ d s 2 the characteristic erosion time te for turbulent flow is proportional to the inertial balance between the settling momentum of the sediment particles and the stress forces exerted by the flow on them a 9

value of the shields stress for the incipient motion τ the shear stress at the bed surface and ke an erosion constant the symbol indicates that the function only has values along the positive domain and is nil for the negative domain taking into account that the relation between the temporal variation of the moving layer thickness and the flux of sediment particles involved in the erosive process

608,finite depth sediment layers are common in natural water bodies the presence of underlying bedrock strata covered by erodible bed layers is ubiquitous in rivers and estuaries in the last years the development of models based on the non capacity sediment transport assumption also called non equilibrium assumption has offered a new theoretical background to deal with complex non erodible bed configurations and the associated numerical problems bedload non capacity sediment transport models consider that the actual solid transport state can be different from the equilibrium state and depending on the temporal evolution of the flow the treatment of finite depth erodible bed layers i e partially erodible beds in bedload models based on the equilibrium approach has usually been made using numerical fixes which correct the unphysical results obtained in some cases generally the presence of a finite depth erodible layer implies the introduction of a kind of non equilibrium condition in the bedload transport state nevertheless this common natural bed configuration has not been previously considered in the development of numerical models in this work a finite volume model fvm for bedload transport based on non capacity approach and dealing with finite depth erodible layers is proposed new expressions for the actual bedload transport rate and the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface are used to develop a numerical scheme which solves the coupled shallow water and non capacity bedload transport system of equations the reconstruction of the intermediate states for the local riemann problem at each intercell edge is designed to correctly model the presence of non erodible strata avoiding the appearance of unphysical results in the approximate solution without reducing the time step the new coupled scheme is tested against laboratory benchmarking experiments in order to demonstrate its stability and accuracy pointing out the properties of both equilibrium and non equilibrium formulations keywords finite volume method shallow water equations non capacity bedload transport fully coupled method augmented roe s scheme finite depth erodible layer 1 introduction sediment transport is an important process which is commonly seen in natural water bodies such as rivers dams and estuaries the sediment particles can be transported by two basic mechanisms suspended load which is composed by the particles moving inside the flow with the same velocity as the fluid and bedload which involves the particles moving in a relatively thin layer over the static bed in this bedload layer or active layer the sediment particles remain in contact with the bed and their velocity is generally much lower than the fluid velocity yang 1996 although the total load transported by suspension can be much larger than the sediment weight moving in the active bed layer wu 2007 the bedload mechanism plays an important role and it can cause marked and rapid changes in the bed bathymetry relevant investigations have been carried out by means of laboratory experiments or field measurements spinewine and zech 2007 zech et al 2008 fent et al 2019 wong and parker 2006 pitlick and cress 2002 soares frazão et al 2007 brooks and lawrence 1999 but they are mostly limited by the small scale of the laboratory flumes or the fact that field measurements are very time consuming expensive and extremely difficult to perform therefore numerical modelling is an attractive tool to understand and predict the morphodynamical evolution of rivers and reservoirs however uncertainties arise in computational simulations due to simplifications assumptions and empirical relationships introduced into the mathematical models used for sediment transport prediction yang 1996 moreover modelling sediment transport involves an increasing complexity with respect to static bed shallow water models saint venant 1871 cunge et al 1980 due to the presence of variable sediment fluid mixture properties coupling of physical processes and multiple layers phenomena dewals et al 2011 the solid particles can be transported under equilibrium capacity or saturated conditions or non capacity non equilibrium or unsaturated conditions the classical equilibrium approach assumes that the actual sediment transport rates for suspended and bedload are equal to the capacity of the flow to carry solid weight they are only determined by instantaneous local flow features and can be formulated by different empirical closure relations found in literature yang 1996 models based on this assumption are commonly called equilibrium or capacity transport models tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 cao et al 2002 lyn and altinakar 2002 hudson and sweby 2003 goutière et al 2008 castro díaz et al 2008 murillo and garcia navarro 2010 juez et al 2014 gunawan and lhébrard 2015 martínez aranda et al 2019 on the other hand in non capacity models the actual transport rates are computed through advection and mass exchange with the static erodible bed non equilibrium i e non capacity sediment transport models have been proposed armanini and di silvio 1988 fraccarollo et al 2003 wu and wang 2007 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 zhang and duan 2011 benkhaldoun et al 2012 cao et al 2012 fernández nieto et al 2014 liu et al 2015 bohorquez and ancey 2016 for both suspended and bedload transport natural morphodynamical systems such as alluvial rivers are always changing in time and space and hence absolute equilibrium states rarely exist in natural conditions therefore intuitively non capacity approaches are more suitable than models based on the equilibrium assumption since they account for the temporal and spatial delay of the actual sediment transport rate with respect to its potential capacity however if this adaptation delay is sufficiently small equilibrium models can be also applied at least in theory wu 2007 unlike purely suspended load models where it has been demonstrated that the non capacity assumption is necessary to compute correctly the solid suspended concentration and the bed evolution cao et al 2007 2012 the importance of assuming non equilibrium conditions in bedload numerical models remains uncertain van rijn 1993 suggested that the actual bedload transport rate in unsteady flows can be assumed equal to the bedload capacity because the adjustment of the transported sediment particles to the new flow conditions proceeds rapidly close to the bed surface this assumption was conceptual and without a theoretical or numerical justification cao et al 2011 2012 analysed numerically the multiple time scales involved in bedload transport for fluvial processes they found that at least for flood cases the bedload transport rate was able to rapidly adapt to the local flow features which justifies the widespread application of the equilibrium models cao et al 2011 however a comparative analysis of both capacity and non capacity bedload models in highly erosive unsteady flows as dam break waves or overtopping dyke collapses remains unperformed especially including experimental benchmarking cases and accurate numerical schemes this comparative analysis is the first main contribution of the present work the assumption of non equilibrium conditions in a bedload mathematical model leads to the requirement of computing the temporal evolution of the active layer thickness and the velocity of the bedload particles in order to predict the actual transport rate as well as the net exchange flux between static and moving bed layers this requirement introduces a high uncertainty in non capacity models due to the calibration of the parameters associated to solid particles velocity active layer thickness and bedload erosion deposition rates for transient flows which can be an annoying task with few empirical supporting data different strategies have been proposed in order to overcome this uncertainty wu 2007 and el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 proposed to approximate the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface by the difference between the actual and capacity transport rates affected by an adaptation length and to assume a non storage mass condition for the active bed layer leading to the quasi steady solid flux relaxation models a more complex approach was also proposed by wu and wang 2007 zhang and duan 2011 soliman and ushijima 2013 based on the same adaptation length parameter to determine the net exchange flux through the interface but accounting now for the mass storage in the active bed layer this approach leads to the direct computation of the actual transport rate as one of the unknown conserved variables assuming that the velocity in the active layer can be evaluated by one of the empirical closure relations for capacity conditions found in literature van rijn 1984 lee and hsu 1994 ferreira et al 2009 recently new and more complex approaches to the bedload non equilibrium transport phenomenon have been derived based on a pioneering work charru 2006 the physical interaction between flow and sediment particles at the static moving bed layer interface was studied at a grain scale zech et al 2008 modelled the net exchange flux through the interface as a function of the shear stress at the moving layer and at the upper boundary of the static layer fernández nieto et al 2014 2017 proposed new empirical formulae for the erosion and deposition rates at the interface as well as a new closure relation for the actual sediment transport rate which reduces to the classical one under equilibrium conditions bohorquez and ancey 2016 also analysed erosion and deposition rates at the static moving interface including a new diffusion term in the bedload conservation equations furthermore the presence of bedrock strata underlying the erodible alluvial layers is ubiquitous in natural rivers and estuaries when a non erodible layer is reached by erosion the actual bedload transport rate over it can be affected and becomes different from the transport capacity of the flow leading to a non equilibrium transport state even under nearly uniform flow regimes some recent approaches to this topic consist on small adaptations of the classical bedload transport theory or on simple numerical fixes struiksma 1999 proposed to reduce the capacity transport rate in regions where the sediment becomes partially unavailable using a parameter based on the actual sediment thickness over the non erodible layer and the theoretical active layer thickness for the capacity transport state rulot et al 2012 proposed an iterative method to correct the over eroded cells by affecting the sediment distribution after each time step computation caviedes voullième et al 2017 implemented a numerical fix based on the limitation of the numerical solid flux at the intercell edges as a function of the available sediment volume at the involved cells although these simplified approaches to the finite depth erodible layer problem seem to work reasonably well in some conditions they offer a limited modelling ability of the real physical phenomenon and require a more detailed analysis in this work a new finite volume numerical scheme fvm is proposed based on the non equilibrium bedload transport assumption a modified version of the augmented roe riemann solver a roe murillo and garcía navarro 2010 martínez aranda et al 2019 has been used to compute an approximate solution for the coupled system of equations shallow water and non capacity bedload transport at each intercell local riemann problem the presence of finite depth erodible layers is directly taken into account for the computation of the actual bedload transport rate and the reconstruction of intermediate states of the approximate solution avoiding the unphysical negative sediment thickness appearance also the proposed formulation includes the equilibrium condition as a particular case therefore the numerical method developed is unique and offers identical properties for the evaluation of the relative performance of both formulations this paper is structured as follows in section 2 an expression for the net exchange flux through the interface separating the static and the moving bed layers is proposed based on a grain scale inertial analysis of the erosion deposition phenomenon and a new generalized grass type formula for the actual bedload transport rate is derived section 3 is devoted to the mathematical model assuming finite sediment thickness conditions and the non capacity bedload transport approach in section 4 the proposed a roe scheme is introduced analysing its stability region also the updating procedure is reported in section 5 the characteristics of the approximate solution at each local rp are analysed and new reconstruction techniques based on murillo and navas montilla 2016 are proposed to avoid unphysical results without affecting the stability region numerical results are reported in section 6 consisting of a hypothetical case with the aim of analysing the effects of non equilibrium formulation in the bedload transport and several experimental benchmarking tests in order to demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed model finally the conclusions have been drawn in section 7 furthermore in appendix a d some extra details about the mathematical model and the numerical scheme have been provided 2 generalized non capacity formulation for bedload transport the conservation property for the sediment mass involved in bedload transport processes fig 1 can be expressed by means of the 1d continuity equation for both the erodible bed layer 1 z b t ξ q s x 0 and the static bed layer 2 z f t ξ η d η e with ξ 1 1 p being p the bed porosity and q s l 2 t 1 the actual bedload transport rate zb l the bed elevation above the datum zf l the static layer elevation above the datum and η d η e l t 1 the net mass exchange flux through the interface separating the moving active and the static bed layers operating 1 and 2 the mass conservation equation for the active layer can also be derived 3 η t ξ q s x ξ η d η e where η z b z f l is the thickness of the active bed layer from a grain scale inertial analysis charru 2006 new closure relations for the erosion and deposition rates η e and η d respectively can be derived as 4 η e k e δ θ s s 1 g d s 3 d s η d k d η d s s 1 g d s 3 d s being ke an erosion constant kd a deposition constant s ρ s ρ w the sediment relative density ds l the median diameter of the sediment particles the complete derivation of these expressions for the erosion and deposition rates is presented in appendix a the function δθ involves the incipient motion criterion for the bedload transport process and is expressed as 5 δ θ θ θ c if θ θ c 0 otherwise where θ τ b ρ s ρ w g d s is the non dimensional shields stress θc is the critical value of the shields stress for the incipient motion threshold g l t 2 is the gravity acceleration and τ b ρ w g n 2 u 2 h 1 3 m l 1 t 2 is the shear stress at the bed surface being n t l 3 the manning s roughness parameter h l the flow depth and u l t 1 the flow velocity closure relations found in literature for the solid transport rate under capacity equilibrium conditions q s can be written generally as 6 q s c θ m 1 δ θ m 2 s 1 g d s 3 with θ n 2 u 2 s 1 d s h 1 3 for all the formulations in table 1 it can be demonstrated that q s h 1 2 u 3 and hence a general formulation for the solid transport rate based on the grass law q s g u 3 has been adopted by other authors murillo and garcia navarro 2010 juez et al 2014 martínez aranda et al 2019 this formulation relates the equilibrium bedload sediment discharge with the depth averaged flow velocity by means of factor g h θ t 2 l 1 which represents the interaction between the flow and the bed layer and which depends only on the flow characteristics nevertheless when finite depth erodible layers are involved the sediment depth can be smaller than the theoretical thickness required to develop the capacity active layer or it can even become unavailable in some regions temporally in these cases the actual solid transport rate should be reduced respect to its equilibrium value 6 even under steady and uniform flow conditions the actual transport rate depends not only on the flow features but also on the sediment availability hence the common formulation for the grass interaction factor g is no longer valid new formulations for the solid transport rate taking into account the availability of sediment have to be considered when finite depth erodible layers are present moreover in the capacity approach the erosion and deposition rates are equal η d η e and hence using 4 the active layer thickness under equilibrium conditions η can be expressed as 7 η k e s k d δ θ d s note that in this case the moving layer thickness depends only on the shields dimensionless stress excess and the grain size therefore under equilibrium conditions 2 can be neglected and 1 reduces to the well known exner equation exner 1925 combining the expressions for the erosion and deposition rates in 4 the following relation can be derived 8 η η e η d k e d s s k d δ θ η η d η e η assuming a direct proportionality between the active layer thickness and actual solid transport rate from 6 and 8 it is possible to derive a closure relation for the non capacity solid transport rate 9 q s c θ m

d k e s 1 g d s 3 d s rewriting 9 in the grass law form the sediment fluid interaction parameter g becomes not only a function of the water depth h and the shields parameter θ but it also depends on the moving layer thickness η 12 q s g h θ η u 2 u with g γ 1 h γ 2 θ γ 3 η as displayed in table 2 the parameter γ3 is similar for all the empirical relations considered whereas the parameters γ1 and γ2 depend on the selected formulation this is the first of the novelties presented in the present work the new expression for the grass interaction factor g takes into account the actual thickness of the moving bed layer and allows to limit the actual solid discharge qs when non erodible strata are reached moreover if time flow features and sediment availability are enough to develop steady states in the bedload transport process the erosion and deposition rates tend to be equal and the solid transport rate recovers the common closure relation 6 for equilibrium transport conditions in the present model the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface can be calculated as η d η e using 4 other authors wu et al 2004 soliman and ushijima 2013 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 assumed a length lb l for the bedload discharge adaptation to its equilibrium state and calculated this exchange flux as q s q s l b l t 1 where q s is the capacity bedload transport rate and qs the actual transport rate comparison of both methods to determine the erosion deposition net flux indicates that the proposed model assumes a dynamic value for the adaptation length lb which is scaled following 13 l b θ k e d s according to 13 the reduction of the erosion constant ke leads to increasing dynamic adaptation length values and enhances non equilibrium bedload transport states on the other hand the higher the shields stress the longer the distance that the bedload discharge needs to reach its equilibrium state and hence highly erosive flows require higher values of the adaptation length lb this dependency of the adaptation length with the shear stress has not been previously derived instead most of the models assume a global value based on the dominant bed form wu 2007 as a summary the main features of the new generalized formulation for the bedload transport are the following for both capacity or non capacity hypothesis the bed layer continuity is modelled using 1 z b t ξ q s x 0 the generalized solid discharge is calculated using 12 q s g h θ η u 2 u with g γ 1 h γ 2 θ γ 3 η the assumption of non capacity implies to calculate the temporal evolution of the active layer thickness η using 3 η t ξ q s x ξ η d η e alternatively the capacity hypothesis consists of a particular case of the generalized bedload formulation the bedload transport rate qs collapses to the capacity transport rate q s assuming an equilibrium active layer thickness η calculated using 7 η k e s k d δ θ d s 3 governing equations for bedload transport with finite depth erodible layers the bedload transport process is controlled by the mass and momentum conservation equations for the flow and the mass conservation equations for the bed layer the potential presence of a non erodible layer fig 2 requires to decompose the bed elevation into two parts 14 z b x t z r x ϵ b x t being zr x l the non erodible layer elevation and ϵ b x t l the thickness of sediments over the non erodible stratum i e the depth of the finite erodible layer it is worth stressing that this sediment layer thickness is not the same as the active layer thickness η then the depth averaged system of governing equations for a 1d flow per unit width can be written as 15 h t q x 0 q t x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 g h z r x g h ϵ b x g h s f ϵ b t ξ q s x 0 being h q h u and ϵ b the conserved variables s f n 2 u u h 4 3 the friction slope caused by the shear stress on the bed layer and qs the actual solid transport rate using 12 it is possible to split the solid discharge derivative as follows 16 ξ q s x x ξ g u 3 ξ g u 3 x ξ u 3 g x ξ g u d h x d q x ξ u 3 g x being d 3 u 2 h therefore the spatial derivative of the solid flux is divided in two terms related with the flow features variation and a third term depending on the grass factor variation this allows to separate the convective flux vector as 17 f u x f j u x f g u x defining the jacobian component of the convective flux f j u x as 18 f j u x q x x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 ξ g u 3 x and the corrector flux vector f g u x 19 f g u x 0 0 ξ u 3 g x note that the flux variation term f g u x represents a corrector component for the solid flux variation in 18 and is caused by the spatial changes on the flow sediment interaction parameter g this corrector flux vector is mainly influenced by the presence of non erodible layers which can reduce the value of the physical solid discharge regardless of the local flow conditions according to 17 and adding the non conservative term g h ϵ b x to the right hand side of the momentum equation the system 15 can be rewritten in vector form as 20 u t j u u x h u u x f g u x s u with j u f j u 0 1 0 c 2 u 2 2 u 0 ξ g u d ξ g d 0 h u 0 0 0 0 0 g h 0 0 0 s u 0 g h z r x g h s f 0 t being u h q ϵ b t the vector of conserved variables j u the jacobian matrix of the convective fluxes h u the matrix of the non conservative fluxes s u the remaining source terms vector and c g h the celerity of the infinitesimal waves moreover an additional equation should be considered for the temporal evolution of the active layer thickness η under non capacity conditions 21 η t ξ q s x ξ η d η e 4 numerical scheme the system of eq 20 is solved according to a finite volume method fvm the numerical method proposed here for bed load transport is based on the reconstruction evolution and averaging steps method proposed originally by godunov 1959 the domain is divided in computational cells of size δ x x i 1 2 x i 1 2 and a piecewise constant representation of the exact solution u is assumed the theory of riemann problems can be applied to the intercell discontinuities even when the exact solution of the rp is unknown it is possible to estimate its variation by integrating 21 over a suitable control volume moreover to compute the solution evolution godunov methods allow the use of linearized approximate or weak solutions for the local rp at the intercell edges therefore assuming known piecewise constant values of u for the i cell at the time tn the first order godunov s method provides updated cell averaged values for the conserved variables at the next time t n 1 using the following explicit expression 22 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x f i 1 2 f i 1 2 where δt is the time step and f i 1 2 represents the numerical flux at the intercell edges the numerical flux contains all the information regarding convective jacobian fluxes corrector solid flux and source terms and will be formulated using an upwind scheme derived from the original augmented roe s scheme aroe

2 u i 1 2 u i u i 1 this edge averaged flow sediment interaction factor g depends not only on the values of the grass parameter at the left and right cells of the edge but also on the local flow features at both cells hence it follows the eigenstructure of the roe s matrix m i 1 2 and its properties for some especial numerical situations have been analized in appendix b the linearized matrix m i 1 2 is assumed diagonalizable with 3 different approximate real eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 which must be computed from the characteristic polynomial using the cardano vieta formula martínez aranda et al 2019 explicit expressions for the calculation of the eigenvalues of the linearized matrix have been provided in appendix c it is worth stressing that one eigenvalue is always opposite to the velocity direction and two of them have the same sign 33 λ 1 0 λ 2 λ 3 if u 0 λ 1 λ 2 0 λ 3 if u 0 therefore m i 1 2 can be expressed as 34 m i 1 2 p λ p 1 i 1 2 with λ i 1 2 λ 1 0 0 0 λ 2 0 0 0 λ 3 where matrix p i 1 2 is constructed as p e 1 e 2 e 3 being e m the eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue λ m and obtained imposing the condition m i 1 2 e m λ m e m 35 e m 1 λ m λ m u 2 c 2 c 2 i 1

and source strength vectors a i 1 2 and b i 1 2 respectively 36 a i 1 2 α 1 α 2 α 3 t p 1 δ u i 1 2 δ u i 1 2 m α m e m b i 1 2 β 1 β 2 β 3 t p 1 s i 1 2 s i 1 2 m β m e m a complete description of the explicit expressions obtained for the wave and source strengths can be found in appendix c furthermore the corrector flux vector 27 can be split as δ f i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 g defining 37 δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u 3 δ g i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u 3 δ g i 1 2 being δ g i 1 2 g g i and δ g i 1 2 g i 1 g this splitting of the corrector vector is directly controlled by the value of the grass interaction parameter g at the intercell edge an hence it is directly linked to the jacobian matrix eigenstructure the corrector flux at the left cell δ f i 1 2 g can be associated to the fastest wave traveling with negative velocity whereas the corrector flux at the right cell δ f i 1 2 g can be associated to the fastest wave travelling with positive velocity the rankine hugoniot conditions for the split corrector fluxes lead to 38 δ f i 1 2 g λ 1 δ u i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 g λ 3 δ u i 1 2 g being δ u i 1 2 g and δ u i 1 2 g the intermediate solution variation associated to the corrector fluxes the second novelty of the present work is this upwind splitting of the convective solid flux associated to the grass factor variation between cells an explanation about the necessity of including this corrector flux to ensure the solid mass conservation in the local rp has been included in appendix d one consequence of roe s linearization is that the resulting approximate solution of the local rp at the incercell edge is reconstructed using only discontinuities and u x t consists of a sum of jumps or shocks the construction of the upwind numerical fluxes required in 22 is based on the properties of the linearized jacobian matrix eigenstructure murillo and navas montilla 2016 according to godunov s method it is sufficient to provide the solution for u x t at the intercell edge position x x i 1 2 in order to obtain the associated numerical fluxes the reconstruction of the approximate solution at the left and right side of the intercell edge u i and u i 1 respectively can be expressed as 39 u i u i m γ m e m i 1 2 δ u i 1 2 g u i 1 u i 1 m γ m e m i 1 2 δ u i 1 2 g where γ m α m β m λ m and the subscript index m and m under the sums indicate waves traveling with negative and positive velocities respectively therefore the intermediate numerical fluxes at the left and right side of the intercell edge f i 1 2 and f i 1 2 respectively can be expressed as 40 f i 1 2 f i f i m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g f i 1 2 f i 1 f i 1 m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g finally the first order godunov s updating formulation 22 can be rewritten for the cell i as 41 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x f i f i also it is possible to rewrite 41 in fluctuation form as 42 u i n 1 u i n δ t δ x δ f i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 with 43 δ f i 1 2 m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g δ f i 1 2 m λ m γ m e m i 1 2 δ f i 1 2 g therefore the approximate solution of u x t for the linearized rp at the intercell edge i 1 2 consists of 5 regions connected by 4 waves the three waves corresponding to the linearized matrix eigenvalues λ m plus one additional steady wave with null celerity accounting for the source terms fig 3 considering a positive average velocity u 0 and using 39 the intermediate states for the conserved variables can be expressed as 44 u i 1 u i γ 1 e 1 δ u g u i 1 2 u i 1 3 γ 2 e 2 u i 1 3 u i 1 γ 3 e 3 δ u g so that using 40 the associated fluxes for each intermediate state are 45 f i 1 f i λ 1 γ 1 e 1 δ f g f i 1 2 f i 1 3 λ 2 γ 2 e 2 f i 1 3 f i 1 λ 3 γ 3 e 3 δ f g for the sake of clarity the subscript index i 1 2 has been omitted in 44 and 45 the reconstruction of the approximate solution should be analysed in order to ensure positivity of the water depth values murillo and garcía navarro 2010 furthermore the unphysical over erosion when finite depth erodible layers are presented has to be avoided that is the positivity of the sediment layer thickness has to be ensured a detailed explanation of the approximate solution reconstruction method proposed in this work is reported in section 5 4 1 resolution method with capacity and non capacity approaches starting from known values of the conserved variables h q ϵ b i n in the cell i at the time tn and the value of the active layer thickness at the same time η i n applying 41 or 42 allows us to update the solution of the conserved variables to the next time t n 1 i e h q ϵ b i n 1 regardless of the capacity or non capacity approach has been considered however the updating procedure for active layer thickness depends on the assumption made for the bedload transport using the capacity formulation 7 the active layer thickness at the next time step t n 1 is directly computed as 46 η i n 1 k e s k d δ θ i n 1 d s where δ θ i n 1 is the non dimensional shields excess 5 at the cell i computed with the conserved variables updated to time n 1 47 δ θ i n 1 θ i n 1 θ c if θ i n 1 θ c 0 otherwise however the assumption of the non equilibrium approach leads to the necessity of solving eq 21 for each time step in order to update the solution of the active layer thickness η i n 1 a semi implicit procedure is used in the present work 1 an intermediate state is predicted using only the convective fluxes 48 η i n 1 2 η i n δ t δ x f 3 i f 3 i being f 3 i the numerical solid fluxes at the intercell edge 40 2 intermediate values of the erosion and deposition rates η e i n 1 2 and η d i n 1 2 respectively are computed using 49 η e i n 1 2 k e δ θ i n 1 s s 1 g d s 3 d s η d i n 1 2 k d η i n 1 2 d s s 1 g d s 3 d s 3 the value of η is finally updated to the next time t n 1 incorporating the net exchange flux at the static moving bed layers interface 50 η i n 1 η i n 1 2 δ t ξ η d i n 1 2 η e i n 1 2 independently of capacity or non capacity assumption once the active layer thickness has been updated its value has to be limited in presence of non erodible layers 51 if η i n 1 ϵ b i n 1 η i n 1 ϵ b i n 1 and the actual solid rate for the next time step n 1 is computed as 52 q s i n 1 g i n 1 u i n 1 2 u i n 1 with 53 g i n 1 γ 1 h i n 1 γ 2 θ i n 1 γ 3 η i n 1 this mechanism effectively reduces the actual solid transport rate qs in cells which are close to be fully scoured by the flow and hence it improves the stability of the proposed scheme in regions where finite depth erodible layers exist 4 2 stability region the time step should be dynamically limited to ensure that there is no interaction of waves from neighboring riemann problems if the positivity of the water depth h and the erodible layer thickness ϵ b values at the intermediate states of the solution is guaranteed in order to construct an updated cell average solution u i n 1 it is only necessary that the average values at the intercell edges remain constant in time over the entire time step this unique requirement allows us to define an upper limit for the time step depending only on the characteristic waves celerity and the spatial cell size in consequence the stability region at the intercell edge i 1 2 is defined as 54 δ t λ i 1 2 δ x max m λ m i 1 2 therefore the global time step for the updated solution calculation is obtained applying a cfl condition 55 δ t cfl min i 1 n 1 δ t λ i 1 2 where cfl 1 and n is the total number of cells in which the conserved variables should be solved at each time calculation 5 approximate solution reconstruction and positivity control with finite depth erodible layers 5 1 active control of the sediment thickness positivity ac stp this is a common issue in sediment transport numerical schemes dealing with finite depth sediment layers dewals et al 2011 fernández nieto et al 2014 rulot et al 2012 struiksma 1999 caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 which requires to control the numerical solution in order to ensure non negative values of the sediment mass i e avoiding over eroded cells where sediment mass is numerically created leading to accuracy conservation and stability issues a widely extended strategy struiksma 1999 caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 to deal with this drawback is to reduce the time step ensuring in this way the positivity of the cell averaged ϵ b n 1 values but leading to an important increase of the computational effort on the other hand in the context of sw equations over static bed murillo and garcía navarro 2010 proposed for the water depth variable h a new reconstruction strategy based on enforcing positivity on the intermediate solutions of the linearized rp at the intercell edge the method offers a twofold benefit it avoids unphysical negative values of the cell averaged water depth and the time step is preserved this approach is adapted in this work to sw equations involving erodible bed where the number of waves is increased focusing on the active control of the sediment thickness ϵ b positivity ac stp this reconstruction procedure for the approximate solution is the third main novelty presented in this work considering u 0 and 44 the solution at the next time ϵ b n 1 at the left cell fig 4 can be evaluated as 56 ϵ b i n 1 ϵ b i n λ 1 δ t δ x 2 ϵ b i 1 ϵ b i n 0 with ϵ b i 1 ϵ b i n γ 1 e 1 3 δ ϵ b g being ϵ b i 1 the sediment thickness intermediate state associated to the wave 1 and δ ϵ b g the sediment thickness jump due to the variation of the grass factor between cell center i and cell edge i 1 2 38 for the right cell it can be expressed as 57 ϵ b i 1 n 1 ϵ b i 1 n λ 2 δ t δ x 2 ϵ b i 1 2 ϵ b i 1 3 λ 3 δ t δ x 2 ϵ b i 1 3 ϵ b i 1 n 0 with ϵ b i 1 2 ϵ b i 1 3 γ 2 e 2 3 ϵ b i 1 3 ϵ b i 1 n γ 3 e 3 3 δ ϵ b g being ϵ b i 1 2 ϵ b i 1 3 the sediment thickness intermediate states associated to the waves 2 and 3 and δ ϵ b g the sediment thickness jump due to the variation of the grass factor between cell edge i 1 2 and cell center i 1 38 the right cell approximate solution in 57 can be rewritten defining an averaged intermediate sediment thickness ϵ b i 1 32 at the right side of the edge 58 ϵ b i 1 32 ϵ b i 1 3 λ 2 λ 3 γ 2 e 2 3 introducing 58 in 57 the right sediment thickness average solution can be rewritten in the following way 59 ϵ b i 1 n 1 ϵ b i 1 n λ 3 δ t δ x 2 ϵ b i 1 32 ϵ b i 1 n 0 the stability condition requires both λ 1 δ t δ x 2 1 and λ 3 δ t δ x 2 1 hence from 56 and 59 we can derive the conditions ϵ b i 1 0 and ϵ b i 1 32 0 respectively to ensure positive cell averaged solutions since the presence of a finite depth erodible layer and its influence in the solid intercell flux is mainly contained in the corrector flux vector the following limits for the corrector sediment thickness jump are proposed 60 δ ϵ b g δ ϵ b g min ϵ b i n γ 1 e 1 3 δ ϵ b g δ ϵ b g max ϵ b i 1 n λ 2 λ 3 γ 2 e 2 3 γ 3 e 3 3 and the following strategy is suggested a if ϵ b i 1 0 and ϵ b i 1 32 0 61 1 δ ϵ b g δ ϵ b g min 2 δ f g 0 0 λ 1 δ ϵ b g δ f g δ f i 1 2 g δ f g 3 δ ϵ b g δ f g λ 3 4 if δ ϵ b g δ ϵ b g max reduce δ t until 59 becomes true b if ϵ b i 1 0 and ϵ b i 1 32 0 62 1 δ ϵ b g δ ϵ b g max 2 δ f g 0 0 λ 3 δ ϵ b g δ f g δ f i 1 2 g δ f g 3 δ ϵ b g δ f g λ 1 4 if δ ϵ b g δ ϵ b g min reduce δ t until 56 becomes true since the solid discharge qs and hence the grass parameter g have already been reduced at cells by limiting the actual moving layer thickness η when a non erodible stratum is reached the step 4 of the above strategy is a guarantee for extreme cases 5 2 wet dry treatment for sediment fronts a special situation can occur when a sediment front arrives to a non erodible step higher than the erodible bed elevation fig 5 in a discrete approach considering a positive velocity u 0 at the edge i 1 2 the direction of the numerical solid flux at the intercell edge ξ q s i 1 2 is also positive and hence the sediment mass is transfered from cell i to cell i 1 but if the bed level at the left cell z r i ϵ b i is lower than the non erodible stratum elevation at the right cell z r i 1 the solid mass transfer can suffer of a physical obstacle that is not considered in the numerical scheme if the non erodible step is high enough the sediment mass transfer between cells is canceled by means of a nil numerical solid flux at the intercell edge to model this physical situation the following strategy is adopted in the present work if z r ϵ b i z r i 1 and ξ q s i 1 2 0 a if z r ϵ b 1 i z r i 1 the sediment progresses normally and the numerical solid flux ξ q s i 1 2 is computed as in 40 b if z r ϵ b 1 i z r i 1 the sediment can not progress to the cell i 1 and hence ξ q s i 1 2 is set null applying the following strategy 63 1 δ ϵ b g ξ q s i λ 1 γ 1 e 1 3 λ 1 2 δ f g 0 0 λ 1 δ ϵ b g δ f g δ f i 1 2 g δ f g 3 δ ϵ b g δ f g λ 3 4 if δ ϵ b g δ ϵ b g max reduce δ t until 59 becomes true this technique allows the correct treatment of the advance of sediment front over steeped non erodible layers also ensuring the solid mass conservation and avoiding marked time step reductions 6 numerical tests 6 1 transport of a finite depth rectangular dune the aim of this original test case is to study the influence of the non capacity assumption on the transport of a non cohesive rectangular dune over a non erodible layer with positive slope a domain 100 m long δ x 1 m is considered with a non erodible layer constant slope of 0 1 the rectangular dune is placed at 20 m x 40 m and its initial thickness is set to 1 m a constant inlet water discharge of q i n 5 m 2 s is considered and the water depth at the outlet is set to h o u t 1 99 m the manning s roughness coefficient is n 0 02 sm 1 3 for both the sediment material and the non erodible layer the sediment features are density ρ s 2650 kg m 3 particle diameter d s 1 mm internal friction angle ϕ e 35 porosity p 0 4 the effects of both the deposition constant value and the relation between erosion and deposition constants will be analized in detail using this erosive numerical test the initial state for the sediment transport simulation was calculated developing the flow for static bed conditions until steady state was reached fig 6 the initial flow regime was subcritical in the whole domain except at 39 m x 40 m where a supercritical regime was reached to compute the bed load solid transport rate the proposed meyer peter müller formulation see table 2 was chosen the deposition constant was initially set to k e 0 3 with a relation k e k d 10 according to literature values fernández nieto et al 2017 bohorquez and ancey 2016 also the initial value for active layer thickness η was set to its value under equilibrium state η using 7 the temporal bed level evolution has been depicted in fig 7 considering capacity and non capacity approaches a visual comparison of the bed profiles at different time steps shows the most marked differences between both approaches at the tail of the dune where the shield stress excess δθ had the highest initial values and hence the adaptation length was longer as time progressed and the dune moved downstream the erosion and deposition rates are high enough to allow a fast transition to equilibrium transport conditions on the bedload layer and hence the capacity and non capacity solutions tended to approximate calibration of the erosion and deposition rates i e the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface is a key point in non capacity bed load models and it has a huge influence on the numerical results a wide range of values for the erosion and deposition constants can be found in literature charru 2006 fernández nieto et al 2014 bohorquez and ancey 2016 lajeunesse et al 2010 leading to high uncertainty in the numerical results obtained with non capacity models usually values for the erosion constant are of the order k e o 10 2 10 1 whereas the relation ke kd varies from 2 to 30 fig 8 shows the bed level profile at different times considering non capacity approach and ke increasing from 0 3 to 1 0 k d k e 10 reduction of the erosion constant ke led to an increment of the equivalent bedload adaptation length 13 and hence the transport rate differs more from the equilibrium value at the dune downward slope this non equilibrium state reduced the solid transport rate at the head of the downward slope and increased the transport rates at the toe with respect to the corresponding capacity transport rates this fact caused a high erosion effect downstream the bed dune where the flow regime changes from subcritical to supercritical even with the same relation ke kd comparison of the erosion deposition net exchange flux see fig 9 right column along the dune domain shows the highest non equilibrium zones at the upward and downward slopes of the rectangular dune for the first stages of the bed movement negative values of η d η e imply erosion of the static layer taking place whereas positive values lead to aggradation of static bed layer an important erosive net flux appears at the downward slope of the dune associated to a strong shear stress change the flow is changing from subcritical to supercritical regime and to lower values of the moving layer thickness see fig 9 left column furthermore two important points should be noted first as the bed movement progresses with time the imbalance between erosion and deposition rates tends to disappear which is in agreement with the non equilibrium assumption second as the erosion constant ke decreases the imbalance between erosion and deposition rates at the downward slope of the dune tends to become more marked and to extend in time demonstrating an agreement between the erosion deposition formulation proposed in this work and the classical approach for the net exchange flux adopted by other authors wu 2007 paquier and el kadi 2008 finally fig 10 depicts the active layer thickness η computed with the non capacity formulation at different times along the dune profile it is worth noting that the reduction of the relation ke kd led to a reduction of the moving layer thickness however as ke kd decreased the non equilibrium in the bedload transport state did not show marked modifications 6 2 dam break over light weight sediment flat bed the aim of this benckmak test is to analyze the behavior of the proposed model against highly erosive unsteady flows this experimental test spinewine and zech 2007 consists of an idealized dam break flow over a light weight sediment flat bed made of cylindrical pvc pellets with equivalent diameter d s 3 9 mm density ρ 1580 kg m 3 internal friction angle ϕ 30 and porosity p 0 42 the experiment was carried out in a 6 m long and 0 25 m width the flume was uniformly filled to a height of 0 1 m over the flume floor with the light weight sediment breaking of the dam was reproduced by the downward movement of a pneumatically actuated thin gate placed at the middle of the flume the initial water level was 0 35 m upstream the gate and nil downstream once the gate was open and the dam break wave progressed downstream an intense sediment transport process started instantaneously caused by the high fluid velocity and the low sediment density the temporal evolutions of the free water surface bed surface and static moving bed layer interface were reported experimentally until 1 5 sec after the gate opening each 0 25 s the simulations have been performed with a cell size δ x 0 01 m manning roughness coefficient n 0 028 s m 3 deposition constant k d 0 03 erosion constant k e 0 2 and cfl 0 95 the actual transport rate has been estimated using a modified version of the mpm model with the coefficient c 16 in order to correctly capture the influence of the low density of the erodible layer particles zech et al 2008 fig 11 shows the numerical results for the temporal evolution of the free water surface bed level and static moving bed layers interface with the equilibrium approach left column and the non capacity approach right column in general a good agreement with measured data can be found with both assumptions especially at times greater than t 0 50 s for the first stages after the gate opening 0 s t 0 75 s both models underestimate the thickness of the moving bed layer η see table 3 and fig 12 this discrepancy can be generated by the marked vertical velocities that appear at the first instants of the fluid movement fent et al 2019 that can not be captured by the depth averaged model however the free water surface and the bed level were well predicted table 3 and the propagation velocity of the dam break wave was accurately captured see fig 11 some differences between numerical results and observed data appeared at the gate region this region is the most affected by vertical fluid velocities at the first stages of the dam break flow and suffers an intense erosion process during the whole experiment it is worth mentioning that the non equilibrium formulation was not able to improve the agreement of the computed static moving interface level zf and bed level zb with those observed experimentally compared with the results obtained using the capacity formulation nevertheless the prediction of the free water surface level wsl computed with the non capacity bedload transport formulation showed lower deviations respect to the experimental data than the capacity results for all the dam break stages fig 12 shows the moving bed layer thickness distribution at three different times during the dam break wave propagation both approaches underestimated η but the results can be considered reasonable specially for the later stages table 3 for the first stages the sediment thickness computed using the equilibrium model offer a better approximation to those observed in laboratory than the result obtained with non capacity model however as time progresses and the fluid moves downstream the non capacity model predicts better the active thickness distribution with lower rmse for times larger than 0 75 s the net exchange flux η d η e through the static moving bed layers interface shows a marked erosive non equilibrium for the firsts stages of the wave advance 0 t 0 75 s at the whole dam break wave domain see fig 13 top nevertheless as the flow moves downstream this net exchange flux tends to reduce generally approaching progressively to the equilibrium state at t 1 5 s i e null net exchange flux except at the dam break wave front and the gate region where flow changes from subcritical to supercritical conditions in these two regions marked erosive net exchange fluxes are maintained through the static moving bed layers interface during the whole simulation time note that in the region between the gate and the wave front a quasi uniform net exchange flux appears for the later stages 0 75 s t 1 5 s in this region the relationship between the dimensionless active layer thickness η d s 1 and the excess of shields stress δθ also tends progressively to near equilibrium conditions signaled by the fact that the slope of the η d s 1 δ θ curve is reducing as the dam break flow progresses see fig 13 bottom therefore the slope of the η d s 1 δ θ curve tends to be nil as near equilibrium states are progressively reached during the dam break wave advance it is worth mentioning that the equilibrium state is a particular case where from 7 the relation η d s 1 δ θ c o n s t k e s k d can be derived 6 3 dike breaking by overtopping as in the previous case the aim of this benchmark test is to analyze the behavior of the proposed model against highly erosive unsteady flows this experimental test case was carried out tingsanchali and chinnarasri 2001 in a straight rectangular cross section flume 35 m long and 1 m wide a trapezoidal dyke was constructed in the middle of the flume with a non cohesive sand of characteristic diameter d s 1 13 mm d 30 0 52 mm d 50 0 86 mm d 90 3 80 mm density ρ 2650 kg m 3 internal stability angle ϕ 30 and porosity p 0 22 the height over the non erodible flume bed and crest width of the dyke were 0 80 m and 0 30 m respectively a vertical plate was placed at the middle of the crest in order to achieve horizontal water surface elevations upstream the dyke in a first step a constant discharge was set at the flume inlet and the upstream reach was filled to a height of 3 cm over the dyke crest then the plate was suddenly lifted up to allow overflow to start maintaining the constant inlet discharge the dyke surface evolution was recorded by photography temporal bed elevation data are provided at p 1 15 cm p 2 65 cm and p 3 115 cm with distances measured from the midpoint of the dyke crest the temporal evolution of the discharge at the dyke crest and the upstream reservoir level were also reported two different experiment c1 and c2 have been used to test the proposed model capabilities the inlet discharge and the dyke upstream and downstream slopes su and sd respectively have been summarized in table 4 the cell size for the simulations was δ x 0 01 m the manning s roughness coefficient was calibrated as n 0 15 sm 1 3 and the cfl was set to 0 95 the erosion and deposition constants ke and kd respectively used in simulations for each benchmarking test have also been reported in table 4 6 3 1 case c1 fig 14 shows the numerical results considering the equilibrium transport assumption for the temporal evolutions of both the reservoir level and the discharge at the dyke crest with different empirical formulations for the bedload transport rate measured data have also been plotted for comparison the smart cbfs formulation juez et al 2013 offers the best results especially for the discharge at the dyke crest but overestimates the erosion of the dyke at the first stages after the overflow starting on the other hand both meyer peter müller and fernández luque closure relations underestimate the bedload transport rate resulting in a slower evolution of the dyke surface and leading to a lower peak in the discharge hydrograph the smart cbfs closure relation has been chosen to study the influence of the non capacity approach on the computed dyke surface evolution for case c1 fig 15 shows the numerical results considering both capacity and non capacity approaches for the temporal evolutions of the reservoir water level and discharge at the crest the obtained results have also been plotted against the measured data and the numerical results reported in juez et al 2014 where a 2d weakly coupled equilibrium model was used for simulations although the predicted peak in the discharge with non capacity formulation is lower than those observed in the laboratory in general the numerical results agree better with the measured data than those obtained with both the proposed 1d model under equilibrium hypothesis and the 2d model reported by juez et al 2014 improving the reservoir level and discharge predictions table 5 furthermore the dyke bed surface evolution has been plotted in fig 16 at probes p1 p2 and p3 considering the modified smart cbfs formulation under capacity and non capacity conditions the non equilibrium hypothesis is able to improve the agreement with bed evolution measured data at all the probes see table 5 at the first stages after the overflow starts marked non equilibrium states are obtained by the active layer thickness η nevertheless as time progresses the bedload transport tends to reach the equilibrium state and the active layer thickness approximates its value under capacity conditions 6 3 2 case c2 case c2 represents a more challenging benchmark for numerical models the steeper dyke downward slope leads to a more energetic overtopping flow with elevated erosion rates and also involving stability failures as in the previous case c1 the best agreement with observed data is achieved with the bedload transport rate computed with the modified smart cbfs closure relation fig 17 shows the dyke surface at times t 30 s and t 60 s after the overflow starts whereas fig 18 depicts the temporal evolutions of the reservoir water level and discharge at the crest numerical results considering both equilibrium and non capacity approaches have been plotted against measured data the equilibrium condition largely overestimates the erosion of the dyke surface at the firsts stages after the flow starts leading to a rapid decrease in the reservoir level and reaching the peak of the discharge hydrograph faster than observed in laboratory fig 18 on the other hand in general considering non equilibrium conditions improves the agreement between numerical results and measured data especially at the first stages after the gate opening despite the stability failures observed at the downward dyke slope during the experiment the measured and computed dyke surfaces considering the non equilibrium hypothesis show a good agreement the root mean square error for the non capacity results were lower for the dyke profile at time t 30 s and slightly higher for the time t 60 s than those obtained with the capacity bedload transport formulation table 6 furthermore the non equilibrium model improved both the reservoir level and the discharge at the dike crest predictions the root mean square error for the reservoir level prediction and the discharge at the dyke crest were much lower with the non capacity formulation than those obtained considering the equilibrium hypothesis however the numerical model considering non capacity solid transport formulation was not able to properly predict the magnitude of the hydrograph peak observed in laboratory fig 18 finally table 7 shows the cpu computational times for tests c1 and c2 using both capacity and non capacity approaches and the modified smart cbfs formula for the determination of the solid transport rate differences on computational effort associated to the assumption of capacity or non capacity formulation can be considered negligible in both benchmark tests 6 4 evolution of a trench over non erodible layer this experimental benchmark test aims to demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed active control of the sediment thickness positivity method ac stp compared with the classical time step reduction method tsr to avoid unphysical over eroded regions without increasing the required computational cost the experiments were carried out by struiksma 1999 consisting in the propagation of a trench excavated in a uniform sand bed over a 3 m long non erodible layer made of a medium gravel 8 16 mm the experiments were performed in a straight rectangular cross section flume with an effective length of 11 5 m and a width of 0 20 m the flume was filled with uniform sand d s 0 45 mm ρ 2650 kg m 3 ϕ 32 and p 0 38 to a height of 0 15 m above the flume concrete floor covering also the non erodible layer in a first step a constant discharge was set at the flume inlet and both water and sand were recirculated until uniform bed slope was achieved the water level was controlled by an adjustable tailgate at the flume outlet once a steady bed slope was reached a 2 m long and 0 04 m deep trench was excavated upstream the gravel layer the flow was restarted and this bed perturbation propagated downstream disappearing over the non erodible layer exposing the gravel stratum and reappearing downstream later struiksma 1999 proposed a solid transport rate formula q s κ u 5 to reproduce the advance velocity of the trench with κ being a tuning parameter which should be calibrated therefore an adapted expression to adjust g κ u 2 has been derived for the proposed scheme this case has previously been used for benchmarking by caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 dewals et al 2011 struiksma 1999 since it reproduces a process of great interest and measured bed elevation data are available two different experimental tests are reproduced in this work c1 and c2 the main difference between both experiments is that in c2 the initial sand thickness over the non erodible layer is lower than in the case c1 and hence the gravel stratum is exposed longer the cell size for the simulations is δ x 0 05 m the erosion and deposition constant are initially set to k e 2 10 3 and k d 1 10 5 respectively and the cfl is set to 0 95 the flow and sediment transport features used in simulations for both tests have been reported in table 8 whereas the initial profiles for both the gravel and the erodible layers as well as the water surface elevation are shown in fig 19 fig 20 depicts the temporal bed evolution for both cases and compares the measured data black points with the numerical results obtained by the proposed model considering non capacity point dashed blue lines and equilibrium solid blue lines approaches numerical results obtained with the coupled scheme reported by martínez aranda et al 2019 are also shown dashed red lines this model uses the capacity approach for the transport rate determination and the over erosion problems are controlled by reducing the dynamic time step to avoid cells with negative sediment thickness values tsr strategy the time step reduction is limited to 10 of the value determined by the original cfl condition hence solid mass conservation problems can appear at cells where this reduction is not enough the scheme proposed in this work is able to reproduce the trench propagation process over the gravel stratum considering both equilibrium and non capacity conditions the non capacity approach with k e 2 10 3 seems to introduce an extra diffusion term on the numerical solution comparing with the equilibrium approach although the trench propagation velocity is similar and agreeing with the observed data for both tests the present model using the ac stp method to avoid over erosion was able to improve largely the prediction of the trench propagation obtained with the scheme reported in martínez aranda et al 2019 using the tsr strategy see table 9 furthermore most numerical models dealing with these cases caviedes voullième et al 2017 ortiz et al 2015 dewals et al 2011 predict an excavated region downstream the gravel stratum which was not observed in experiments that excavated zone is also reproduced here using the equilibrium model martínez aranda et al 2019 with the classical time reduction tsr treatment for the non erodible layer the present non capacity formulation k e 2 10 3 is able to eliminate totally this excavation for case c1 and to reduce it significantly for case c2 the solid transport qs over the gravel stratum is reduced as an effect of the sediment unavailability using 51 this reduction interferes with the equivalent non equilibrium adaptation length leading to a solid transport rate smaller than the flow transport capacity downstream the gravel stratum therefore the solid transport rate at the downstream region is lower with non capacity formulation than that considering the equilibrium hypothesis reducing the excavation fig 21 shows the effects of the erosion constant ke increase on the evolution of the excavated region downstream the gravel stratum lower erosion constant ke values lead to an increment of the equivalent adaptation length 13 the reduction of the physical solid transport rate applied in cells where the theoretical active layer thickness η is greater than the available sediment thickness ϵ b leads to a more stable propagation of the trench over the gravel stratum and reduces the excavated region downstream as the erosion constant ke increases the equivalent adaptation length decreases and the non equilibrium solid transport states caused by the appearance of the non erodible layer are also reduced hence the non capacity solution tends approximate to the equilibrium bed evolution profile see fig 21 with k e 2 10 2 the non capacity results practically agree with the equilibrium prediction demonstrating the sensitivity of the model to the erosion deposition constants calibration finally the positivity control mechanism for the sediment thickness 61 and 62 is triggered many times during simulations as the gravel stratum is successively exposed and recovered during the trench advance in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ac stp method additional simulations were carried out considering the proposed model but using the classical tsr strategy to avoid unphysical over eroded cells using both equilibrium and non equilibrium hypothesis fig 22 shows the bed profiles for case c1 at t 3 h and case c2 at t 4 h times when the whole gravel stratum was exposed the bed level predictions computed with capacity ac stp and capacity tsr methods showed small variations caused by the different treatment of non erodible stratum similar small variations were found comparing non capacity ac stp and non capacity tsr methods however using the ac stp method the numerical solution remains stable and it is not necessary to reduce the time step to ensure the sediment mass conservation or numerical stability fig 23 unlike using tsr method caviedes voullième et al 2017 furthermore the time step reduction strategy demonstrates not to be able to avoid completely the over erosion problems without a marked reduction of the time step leading to much a higher computational effort for the simulations table 10 moreover as the time step reduction is limited to avoid an excessive computational effort solid mass conservation errors appear in cells which require higher limitations to remain positive sediment thickness values 7 conclusions in this work recently developed non equilibrium bedload transport concepts have been used to propose a new numerical model able to deal with highly unsteady flows and partially non erodible bed layers based on a grain scale analysis of the net exchange flux through the static moving bed layers interface charru 2006 new expressions for the erosion and deposition rates η e and η d respectively have been obtained as well as a generalized formula for the non capacity bedload transport rate qs as a function of the active layer thickness η the equilibrium state consists of a particular case of the generalized bedload formulation derived the proposed transport rate formulation allows to limit the physical solid flux at cells in regions where the total sediment thickness ϵ b hinders the development of equilibrium solid transport states a new generalized grass type formulation is proposed for the non equilibrium bedload transport rate this is the first of the main novelties reported in the present work the system of equations composed by the one dimensional shallow water and the mass conservation equations for the bed layer 4 equations has been solved using a first order finite volume a roe scheme the convective flux vector is separated in a part accounting for the flow depending terms plus a corrector component associated to the grass factor g variation the second novelty of the present work is this upwind splitting of the convective solid flux an improved reconstruction strategy for the approximated solution at each local rp allows to avoid the appearance of unphysical results in the erodible layer thickness ϵ b one of the most important problems reported for equilibrium and non equilibrium bedload numerical models dealing with non erodible layers caviedes voullième et al 2017 dewals et al 2011 this new reconstruction strategy is the third novelty presented in this work currently a high uncertainty exists about the calibration of the non capacity parameters erosion deposition constants ke and kd or adaptation length lb in other models wu and wang 2007 zhang and duan 2011 soliman and ushijima 2013 and their effect on numerical predictions the model has been tested against a hypothetical case consisting of a rectangular dune made of non cohesive sand moving over a non erodible bed layer the sensitivity of the numerical evolution of the dune surface to the non capacity parameters calibration has been analysed one of our conclusions is that the relation ke kd controls the active layers thickness and hence the mean velocity at the moving sediment layer furthermore the reduction of ke leads to increasing non equilibrium conditions as it happens with the adaptation length lb increments in flux relaxation models the highest ke the fastest the bedload solid transport is able to achieve equilibrium states even for constant ke kd relation the proposed model has been benchmarked against different sediment transport laboratory experiments involving unsteady flows enhanced bed changes by light weight sediments and underlying non erodible layers scour the model is able to predict the measured data in all the cases tested the non equilibrium bedload transport assumption improves the results obtained in most of the cases especially for the dyke breaking by overtopping benchmarking test 6 3 and the trench propagation over a non erodible layer test 6 4 however the numerical results obtained are very sensitive to the calibration of the non capacity parameters which can become a difficult task on the other hand the proposed reconstruction strategy to avoid negative values in the sediment thickness ϵ b demonstrates to improve the results obtained with the classical numerical fixes used up till now for cases involving finite depth erodible layers regardless of equilibrium or non equilibrium approaches this technique allows to ensure the solid mass conservation property allowing numerical stability with time steps larger than other approaches

dga through fondo europeo de desarrollo regional feder appendix a erosion and deposition rates derivation the derivation of the expressions used in this work for the erosion and deposition rates η e and η d respectively was based on the physical background proposed by charru 2006 for the net exchange flux between the static and moving bed layers a1 deposition rate the particle deposition rate n d is related to the number of moving particles n and the characteristic deposition time td a 1 n d n t d p a r t t 1 the characteristic time of the deposition process is controlled by gravity and depends on the deposition velocity ωs and the particle diameter ds a 2 1 t d ω s d s 1 t d k d s 1 g d s d s and hence the particle deposition rate can be expressed as a 3 n d k d n d s s 1 g d s 3 d s being kd a deposition constant on the other hand the number of particles in movement on a bed surface of unit area δ a δ x δ y 1 and which are affected by deposition in a time step td are related to the thickness of the active bedload layer η a 4 n η δ a ξ d s 3 where ξ 1 1 p being p the porosity of the active layer which is considered the same as the static layer the relation between the particle deposition rate and the temporal variation of the active layer thickness due to deposition in a bed area δa is expressed as a 5 η d n d ξ d s 3 δ a therefore replacing a 4 and a 5 in a 3 the temporal variation of the moving layer thickness due to deposition can be expressed as a 6 η d k d η d s s 1 g d s 3 d s l t 1 a2 erosion rate the particle erosion rate n e is related to the number n of static particles exposed to the flow action and the characteristic erosion time te a 7 n e n t e p a r t t 1 the particles which are exposed to the flow shear stress in a bed surface of unit area δ a δ x δ y 1 and which can be incorporated to the moving layer in a time step te are placed on the top layer of the static sediment column and hence a 8 n d s δ a ξ d s 3 n e δ a t e ξ d s 2 the characteristic erosion time te for turbulent flow is proportional to the inertial balance between the settling momentum of the sediment particles and the stress forces exerted by the flow on them a 9 1 t e τ τ c d s 2 ρ s d s 3 ω s 1 t e k e θ θ c s d s s 1 g d s being s ρ s ρ w the relative density of the sediment particles θ τ ρ s ρ w g d s the non dimensional shields stress θc the critical value of the shields stress for the incipient motion τ the shear stress at the bed surface and ke an erosion constant the symbol indicates that the function only has values along the positive domain and is nil for the negative domain taking into account that the relation between the temporal variation of the moving layer thickness and the flux of sediment particles involved in the erosive process in a bed area δa can be written as a 10 η e n e ξ d s 3 δ a the temporal evolution of the bed load layer thickness caused by erosion can be expressed as a 11 η e k e θ θ c s s 1 g d s 3 d s l t 1 note that for the capacity case in which the erosion and deposition rates are equal η e η d the relation n d s 2 θ θ c is recovered this linear relation for the number of particles in the moving layer agrees with the experimental observations reported by luque and beek 1976 and bagnold 1973 and is used to derived most of the classical solid transport rate reported in literature appendix b properties of the edge averaged grass parameter g to explore the upwind behaviour of the edge averaged grass factor g i 1 2 32 in this appendix its value has been analysed in some numerical situations b1 constant grass parameter in left and right cells if both cells have equal interaction parameter then the edge averaged grass parameter is constant along the edge g i g i 1 g i 1 2 regardless of the flow conditions and hence the corrector flux vector δ f i 1 2 g are nil b2 transitions with non erodible layers supposing that the interaction parameter at the right cell is nil g i 1 0 then the edge average grass factor can be expressed as b 1 g i 1 2 g i h i 1 3 2 h i h i 1 3 3 g i h i h i 1 h i h i 1 u i 2 3 g i h i h i 1 u i u i 1 h i h i 1 3 u i 2 u i 1 2 u i u i 1 considering uniform flow h i h i 1 and u i u i 1 the only factor which could cause a null grass factor at the cell i 1 and not at cell i is the unavailability of sediment at the cell under these conditions the edge averaged interaction parameter is g i 1 2 g i 2 and hence the corrector flux vector δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u g i 2 t δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u g i 2 t b3 dambreak wave front on wet conditions the advance of an erosive dambreak wave on a wet bed is characterized by the following local flow conditions h i 0 u i 0 g i 0 h i 1 0 u i 1 0 g i 1 0 in that case the edge averaged grass parameter has the following expression b 2 g i 1 2 g i 1 h i 3 2 h i h i 1 3 depending only on the water depth values at the left and right cells in the limiting case where h i h i 1 the grass parameter takes the value g i 1 2 7 8 g i and hence the corrector flux vector δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u 1 8 g i t δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u 7 8 g i t b4 dambreak wave front on dry conditions the advance of an erosive dambreak wave on a dry bed the local flow conditions are h i 0 u i 0 g i 0 h i 1 0 u i 1 0 g i 1 0 therefore the edge averaged grass factor is nil g i 1 2 0 and the corrector flux vector and hence the corrector flux vector δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 ξ u g i t δ f i 1 2 g 0 0 0 t appendix c eigenvalues wave and source strength derivation c1 eigenvalues calculation the eigenvalues of the linearized matrix m i 1 2 are calculated as the roots of its

609,mixing and reaction between chemical species during cycles of drainage and imbibition in porous media are investigated using a coupled lattice boltzmann model lbm this coupled lbm is able to simulate advection diffusion processes with homogeneous reactions under dynamic immiscible multiphase flow conditions a feature of the model is that there is no need to track the interface specifically for the transport domain which improves the computational efficiency significantly transport simulations of non reactive tracers in a natural pore domain show that some tracers can be trapped with the resident wetting fluid with the tracers in these stagnant regions defined here as regions where pé 1 being released slowly during the imbibition phase moreover it is found that the relative amount of tracer diffusing from these stagnant regions increases as the system approaches steady state flow conditions for bimolecular reactive transport the results demonstrate that most of the reaction product generated during mixing in stagnant regions accumulates and remains within these regions with only some release of the product to infiltrating wetting fluid that bypasses adjacent to these regions keywords two phase flow non reactive reactive transport air water transport coupled lattice boltzmann model 1 introduction non reactive and reactive chemical transport in partially saturated porous media occurs widely in the vadose zone with the chemical composition of infiltrating water varying over time e g agrochemical application during irrigation moreover chemical transport in multiphase flows in porous media occurs e g during oil and gas recovery operations and in a variety of other engineering applications compared to transport in fully saturated single phase porous media domains temporal changes in the wetting phase e g water content lead to changes in the velocity distribution and the spatial distribution of flow paths resulting in the development of low velocity regions trapped clusters of wetting fluid and preferential flow paths de gennes 1983 the dependence of velocity distribution and flow path formation on wetting phase saturation significantly impacts the dynamics of chemical transport e g bromly and hinz 2004 cortis and berkowitz 2004 zoia et al 2010 in parallel resident wetting fluid trapped by the non wetting fluid phase may mix with infiltrating wetting fluid during imbibition influencing chemical transport phenomena numerous experimental and simulation works have been carried out to explore the characteristics of transport phenomena in partially saturated multiphase porous media many of these analyses have highlighted interactions between infiltrating and resident waters at both pore and field scales e g legout et al 2007 brooks et al 2010 collins et al 2000 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 li and berkowitz 2018 turton et al 1995 reported a field experiment using sodium bromide as a tracer to label resident water the soil profile experienced four periods of rainfall cycles imbibition followed by drainage with sodium bromide being added only to the first cycle in this way resident water from the first cycle had a different chemical signature from that of the infiltrating water in the following cycles the results showed that labeled resident water was initially the main component in the soil profile outflow during the second infiltration event but also that significant volumes of labeled resident water were retained even after the three subsequent rainfall periods in a related context laboratory experiments that employ disturbed or repacked soils suggest that chemical dispersion increases with decreasing saturation e g sato et al 2003 guillon et al 2013 in contrast results from experiments using natural undisturbed soil demonstrate the opposite behavior hammel and roth 1998 vanderborght and vereecken 2007 this apparent contradiction can be explained by noting that in some soil structures decreasing the saturation may correspond to decreasing the flow rate and thus less variation in the velocity field jiménez martínez et al 2015b significantly however all of these experiments were conducted at continuum scales so that specific influences of fluid distribution pore structure and other local scale factors remain elusive in recent years with the development of fast high resolution imaging techniques and microfluidics pore scale characterizations of two phase fluid flow and transport dynamics in porous media have been investigated e g jiménez martínez et al 2015b 2016 karadimitriou et al 2013 it has been demonstrated for example that mass exchange between resident and infiltrating fluid may vary in time and space karadimitriou et al 2016 even when the saturation topology is maintained under different injection rates karadimitriou et al 2017 the results also suggest i that increasing the injection rate of fluid carrying chemical tracers enhances the mass transfer between flowing and stagnant regions and ii that there is a non monotonic trend between the dispersion coefficient and total saturation as well as between the stagnant and total saturation karadimitriou et al 2017 with regard to mixing and reaction of chemical species in partially saturated systems it is clear that while advection and molecular diffusion control mixing reaction consideration of larger continuum scales does not provide information on the actual mixing processes that control chemical transport and reactions the common viewpoint is that the occurrence of a limited number of preferential flow paths induces shorter travel times and thus decrease the time available for mixing and chemical reactions however experiments measuring non reactive reactive transport with steady two phase flow in a homogeneous pore structure demonstrate that flow channeling can also increase concentration gradients and thus diffusive mass transfer and thus chemical reactions jiménez martínez et al 2015b these authors jiménez martínez et al 2015b conclude that three factors are critical in enhancing mixing processes the formation of ramified finger structures the occurrence of anomalous dispersion and the limited merging of fluid fingers by the presence of air clusters later it was found that these three factors can be attributed to the size of the dead end pore clusters the stagnant regions hasan et al 2019 there are relatively few numerical modeling studies at the pore scale of transport phenomena in porous media in partially saturated or two phase miscible immiscible systems simulations from a coupled pore network model to quantify non reactive reactive transport in partially saturated porous media indicate that the dispersion effect is strengthened by decreasing the saturation in a certain range raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 however this study did not include the effect of the size of stagnant regions as a physical factor which is a key parameter hasan et al 2019 in a different study a diffusion two relaxation time lattice boltzmann model lbm was coupled with the shan chen model to estimate effective diffusivities under different saturation values genty and pot 2014 a coupled lbm accounting for a dissolution precipitation phase change in a multicomponent multiphase system was developed and applied to simulate reactive transport in a fuel cell chen et al 2012 and co2 sequestration with low péclet number chen et al 2013 recently lbm was coupled to particle tracking methods to show that pore scale anomalous dispersion in two phase systems results primarily from the degree of molecular diffusion the initial position of chemical species and the nature of the flow network induced by trapped fluid triadis et al 2018 direct numerical simulation dns has also been used to model such systems simulations of nonreactive chemical transport in steady state two phase flow conditions using the openfoam software package aziz et al 2018 supported findings summarized above karadimitriou et al 2016 2017 and delineated the relationship between relative permeability and the dispersion coefficient aziz et al 2018 later an irregular anisotropic pore network model was also applied to simulate advective dispersive transport in steady state two phase flow through porous media hasan et al 2019 the results were upscaled to estimate directly the darcy scale transport coefficients and properties it was also noted that a non monotonic trend between dispersion and saturation exists in 3d because the velocity field may not vary with a constant pressure drop when the saturation decreases this finding indicates that the conclusion from previous experiments e g sato et al 2003 guillon et al 2013 may be incorrect if the velocity fields in the pore space vary little under different saturations comparing to the same parameters estimated from the mobile immobile model e g dispersion coefficient stagnant saturation the disagreements imply fundamental shortcomings of the mobile immobile model in describing transport in two phase flow moreover the simulation results from this research indicate that the relative permeabilities may be used to obtain accurate estimates of the stagnant saturation hasan et al 2019 which support the findings in aziz et al 2018 however chemical transport in dynamic partially saturated flow fields u t 0 u is the velocity in the pore space t is time is ubiquitous in nature and can be expected to differ from transport in steady state flow fields u t 0 as examined in laboratory experiments and numerical models to date studies on chemical transport in such dynamic systems have focused mainly on the darcy and field scales xu and pruess 2001 khaleel et al 2002 simunek and van genuchten 2008 and analysis of chemical transport at the pore scale has received little attention in conventional pore scale numerical models modelling the complex dynamic behavior of air water interfaces movement merging and splitting together with chemical transport requires updating of spatial air water distributions at each time step it is computationally inefficient and faces the difficulty of re distributing chemical species after the fluid distributions change moreover both lbm and dns face the problem of spurious velocity currents that develop around the interface between immiscible fluids although methods to minimize these problems are known and effective for very low péclet number conditions chen et al 2012 2013 they are unable to deal with complicated pore geometry and high péclet number conditions it is therefore necessary to develop means to obtain reliable velocity fields prior to updating the distribution of chemical species here we explore transport in dynamic partially saturated porous media flows u t 0 with the aim of quantifying over different imbibition events i how chemical species spread and mix ii the extent to which chemicals are trapped in stagnant regions and iii how reactions between different chemical species are affected in such conditions for this purpose a new coupled lbm based on that of riaud et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 is applied to simulate non reactive and reactive transport during cycles of drainage and imbibition in contrast to other methods chen et al 2012 2013 this model first computes the flow velocity field using a continuum surface force color gradient lbm which decreases the spurious current around the interface significantly liu et al 2014 moreover this model does not require updating of interface locations specifically at each time step and the interface effect is integrated with the lbm for transport as a consequence computational efficiency is improved and higher péclet numbers can be considered with this coupled lbm the chemical species distribution mixing and reaction are first quantified focusing on how fluid flow characteristics e g the ratio of stagnant and flowing areas influence transport and reaction behavior the details of the coupled lbm formulation are given in section 2 and its numerical implementation are presented in section 3 thorough analysis and discussion of the numerical simulations are provided in section 4 followed by a summary and conclusion in section 5 2 methodology the coupled lattice boltzmann model lbm employed here is composed of two parts first the flow field for a multicomponent multiphase system is calculated using a color gradient model riaud et al 2014 the velocity in the pore space is then used to solve the advection diffusion equation ade in the pore space occupied by the wetting fluid the interface effect generated by the color gradient model is integrated into the lbm for transport as a result chemical species are transported only by the wetting fluid red fluid in color gradient model and cannot penetrate the interface between wetting and nonwetting fluids details of the coupled lbm are explained in the following sections 2 1 color gradient lattice boltzmann model cg lbm the color gradient lattice boltzmann model cg lbm was developed by coloring immiscible fluid particles as either red or blue gunstensen et al 1991 the method has been improved to decrease the occurrence of spurious currents around the interface and the lattice pinning effect by introducing a recoloring step latva kokko and rothman 2005 leclaire et al 2012 the color gradient model developed in halliday et al 2007 is used here rather than other approaches liu et al 2012 2014 this model uses a continuum surface force csf

disadvantage that a mixing layer is generated on the surface of the solid phase and numerical instability occurs when the contact angle θ is either very low θ 30 or very high θ 150 leclaire et al 2016 akai et al 2018 to address this problem and determine more accurate contact angle values leclaire et al 2016 2017 first proposed enforcing the direction of the color gradient on the wetting boundary by rotating the normal vector to the boundary according to the contact angle using a vector transformation however this method requires many iterations to reach the prescribed contact angle and is not computationally efficient here the method developed by akai et al 2018 is applied this method for the wetting boundary condition is based on the work of xu et al 2017 and is extended to 3d conditions details of the method for the wetting boundary are explained elsewhere akai et al 2018 xu et al 2017 with this gc lbm the spurious current around the interface is very low results from the static droplet tests show that the maximum magnitude of the spurious current is always in the range of 10 6 10 5 when the viscosity ratio between two fluids is between 10 and 20 the work of xu et al 2017 also shows that the spurious current does not increase significantly even when the viscosity ratio is 50 2 2 lbm for transport in partially saturated flow the similarity between the navier stokes equations nse and the advection diffusion equation ade enables the lbm to recover the solution of the ade through the chapman enskog analysis noble 1997 thus the common d2q9 and d3q19 schemes are also suitable for calculating advection diffusion transport phenomena however compared to the nse which requires velocity moments up to second order the ade needs only zero and first moments the lower isotropy lattice can therefore be dropped and d2q5 and d3q7 schemes are sufficient to solve advection diffusion phenomena in 2d and 3d chen et al 2012 noble 1997 when asymmetric diffusion does not exist moreover the d2q5can reach the same second order accuracy with better numerical stability as compared to the d2q9 scheme li et al 2017 the distribution function for chemical species transport follows the same evolution as for fluids 6 g i k x e i δ t t δ t g i k x t 1 τ k g i k x t g i k e q x t w i δ t s where s is the source term due to reaction g i k e q is the equilibrium distribution which is linear in the form u 7 g i k e q c k w i 1 3 e i u where c is the macroscopic concentration and obtained by 8 c k g i k the diffusivity is related to the relaxation rate τik by 9 d k 1 3 τ k 0 5 the multi relaxation time collision operator can also be applied to the collision process so that the simulation can treat high péclet number yang et al 2018 under multiphase flow conditions chemical transport becomes more complicated due to the existence of the interface between immiscible fluids chen et al 2013 developed a coupled lbm for diffusion precipitation dissolution in a closed multiphase flow system while this coupled model is effective for a closed system its application is limited because advection is not included moreover the computational cost is also relatively high because the interface location must be updated at each time step to determine the region in which transport occurs and then chemical species around each interface are redistributed to maintain mass conservation to overcome these crucial issues riaud et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 proposed a method that couples the lbm for chemical transport to the color gradient lbm to include the interface effect compared to eq 6 this method adds a new color redistribution algorithm into the original evolution process of a chemical in single phase the general expression of chemical evolution in a multiphase flow system is 10 g i k x e i δ t t δ t g i k x t 1 τ k g i k x t g i k e q x t β k w χ r g i k e q 0 c o s θ w i δ t s where g i k e q 0 w i c k the function w χr acts as a driving force on the chemical and governs the interface profile topology βk is a convenient parameter to tune the interface profile while keeping the same topology for the chemical distribution by adjusting the interface thickness between two immiscible fluids in the cg lbm more specifically βk is given by 11 β k 6 β b c d k τ k b f this equation implies an equilibrium between molecular diffusion and the color redistribution at the interface during the advection diffusion process for the values of b c and b f they are calculated from the discrete velocity sets scheme of lbm for chemical transport and fluid respectively as 12 2 b α i 1 q ω i α e i α e i α e i α α c f therefore b c is equal to 1 6 for the discrete velocity scheme for chemical transport with d2q5 and b f is equal to 0 15 with the lbm scheme for fluid with d2q9 here for convenience we set b c b f so that eq 11 simplifies to the form β k 6 β d k τ k with fluid and chemicals having different lbm schemes however in principle it is better to retain the calculation in eq 11 and 12 to avoid the potential risk of having anisotropic and irregular concentrations around the interface between two immiscible fluids here the single phase driving force w χ r 1 χ r is adopted to keep the chemical species in one fluid for χ r 1 a value of w 0 means that the chemical is in the red fluid and diffuses passively for χ r 0 w 1 means that the region is occupied by blue fluid and the chemical is repelled to the red fluid so that cannot pass through the interface between the immiscible fluids incorporating the interface effect into the transport equation leads to much higher computationally efficiency than that developed by chen et al 2013 here the cg lbm was coupled to a continuum surface force for the surface tension and the wetting boundary developed by akai et al 2018 with the lbm for transport described by eq 10 with this new coupled lbm low spurious velocities around the interfaces and more accurate contact angle values can be reached while chemical species are kept in the designated phase or fluid a simple test for the coupled lbm is presented in appendix a 1 for the reaction source term s i k when homogeneous reactions between chemical species are considered the general description for the chemical reactions is 13 a l b l c l where a l and b l represent the reactive chemical species a and b for homogeneous reaction in liquid phase and c l is the reaction product the reaction kinetic of this system is 14 r 0 k 0 c a l c b l where k 0 is the reaction rate constant the chemical species source terms related to the homogeneous reactions are 15 s a l r 0 s b l r 0 s c l r 0 other reactions including precipitation and dissolution of the solid phase can be easily included here with appropriate reactive chemical species and reaction rate constants for precipitation and dissolution the phase change algorithm has been proposed and validated elsewhere chen et al 2012 2013 3 numerical experiments numerical experiments first focus on validating that the coupled lbm developed here correctly simulates pore scale advection and diffusion in a dynamic immiscible multiphase flow field the model is then applied to simulate non reactive and reactive chemical transport in a porous domain subject to cycles of drainage and imbibition the details of the setups for these numerical simulations are described in the following subsections 3 1 non reactive transport in a single pore as illustrated in fig 1 the simulations are conducted in a pore domain of size 201 201 lu 2 with throat width d 41 l u and square pore width l 81 l u initially the pore is fully saturated with wetting fluid red the nonwetting fluid blue only occupies the buffering layer on the top and is injected at a constant velocity v i n 1 0 e 4 l u t 1 from the inlet while a constant pressure pout boundary condition with ρ t o t a l 1 0 is imposed at the bottom outlet both conditions are implemented using the zou he method periodic boundary conditions are applied at the left and right sides the viscosities of red and blue fluids are assumed to be the same given by ν r ν b 1 6 l u 2 t 1 the surface tension is set to σ 0 03 so that the capillary number defined by c a ρ i n ν i n v i n σ is equal to 5 6 10 4 where ρin νin and vin are the density kinematic viscosity and velocity of the invading fluids respectively the contact angle is chosen to be θ 45 the diffusion coefficients of the non reactive chemical tracers are assumed to be of magnitude 10 3 equal to 10 9 m2 s 1 in physical units the initial relative concentration of the first tracer in the wetting fluid blue is set to be c 1 1 0 following a drainage phase imbibition with a second chemical tracer is simulated in the same structure the fluid and tracer distributions from the drainage phase are used as the initial condition the top buffering layers are filled with the wetting fluid and the second passive tracer for the second tracer a constant concentration boundary is implemented with a value is with c 2 1 0 the results of this simulation are shown in appendix a 2 3 2 non reactive and reactive chemical transport in a pore domain to investigate mixing and reaction of chemical species between resident and infiltrating wetting fluids the coupled lbm model employs a section of a porous domain imaged from a natural 2d granular medium mohammadmoradi et al 2016 the simulations are run in a computational domain of 850 550 pixels lu 2 and grid resolution of 7 µm the porosity is 32 60 the minimum maximum and mean pore space diameters are 0 0154 mm 0 198 mm and 0 114 mm respectively the computational domain is extended by 50 lu in the flow direction at the inlet and outlet boundaries to minimize the influence of the boundary condition fig 2 constant velocity and constant pressure are implemented at the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively while the other boundaries are solid walls and half bounce back boundary conditions are implemented similar to the initial condition for the single pore simulation section 3 1 the pore space is filled with wetting fluid red and a chemical tracer the buffering layer at the inlet is filled with nonwetting fluid blue and the injection rate on the boundary is 5 10 5 l u t 1 for each drainage imbibition cycle at the outlet the value of the constant pressure is p o u t 1 3 m u l u 1 t 2 and the color gradient function has a free flow boundary condition the relaxation times for the wetting and nonwetting fluids are set at τ w 1 0 and τ n w 0 533 respectively in addition the capillary number is chosen as 10 5 thus the viscosity pressure drop in the simulation is negligible when steady state conditions are reached the drainage phase is stopped and the wetting fluid and the second tracer are injected from the inlet two drainage imbibition cycles are considered at the pore scale the péclet number is defined as p e v d d k aziz et al 2018 for each lattice of the pore space where v is the effective pore velocity norm d is the mean pore diameter and dk denotes the diffusion coefficient of the chemical tracer k although the distance between each lattice can be used to calculate the local péclet number this distance is not the characteristic length for the pore space and is usually smaller when the pé of a region composed of adjacent lattices in the pore space is less than 1 the region is defined as a stagnant region following pan et al 2006 and yang 2013 steady state flow conditions are considered to be reached for 16 m u x t u x t 100 2 m u x t 100 2 10 6 or 17 s r w t s r w t 100 s r w t 100 10 6 to simulate chemical reactions during the transport process the final state of the first drainage phase with the first reactant with v i n 5 0 10 5 l u t 1 is used as the initial condition so that the reaction described by eq 13 occurs in the pore space when the infiltrating wetting fluid carrying the second reactant reaches the resident wetting fluid model parameters are presented in appendix a 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 non reactive transport during drainage imbibition cycles in a pore domain 4 1 1 interactions between resident and infiltrating wetting fluids after running the two drainage imbibition cycles in the pore structure described in section 3 2 appendix a 4 shows that the relative non reactive tracer amount change matches the saturation change the non reactive tracers are first considered as labels to track interactions between resident and infiltrating fluids fig 3 shows the spatial distributions of the first and second tracers at different time points and indicates how the infiltrating water advances through the pore space and interacts with resident water fig 4 shows the changes in the amounts of nonwetting and wetting fluids from different imbibition phases in the first imbibition second drainage and second imbibition phases fig 4 a shows that the amount of nonwetting fluid air and resident wetting fluid resident water labeled by the first tracer both decreased when as infiltrating wetting fluid water entered the domain at the end of this imbibition phase it is observed that the resident wetting fluid labeled by the first tracer was not totally flushed out fig 4a and compared to the initial state of the resident wetting fluid s r w 27 16 less than half 41 6 of it still remained in the pore space s r w 11 29 in addition the number of resident wetting fluid pockets decreased by almost 89 during the imbibition event from 112 to 14 see table 2 in appendix a 5 although the number of resident wetting fluid pockets decreased significantly the saturation of the resident wetting fluid decreased to about half of its initial state which indicates that most of the large resident water pockets were not affected during the first imbibition phase to confirm that resident water represented by the first tracer from the initial condition can remain in the pore space even after multiple drainage imbibition cycles a second drainage imbibition cycle was examined using the final state of the first imbibition phase as the initial condition fig 4b and c show that the resident wetting fluid labeled by the first tracer was retained in the pore space with 18 6 of it remaining at the end of the second imbibition phase therefore it is seen that most of the resident wetting fluid remaining in the pore space is barely affected by subsequent drainage imbibition events moreover some wetting fluid from the first imbibition remained in the pore space as well at the end of the second imbibition phase fig 4c appendix a 5 summarizes the patterns of resident wetting fluid evolution during these drainage imbibition cycles based on the above results non reactive chemical transport in dynamic multiphase flow simulated by coupled lbm developed here demonstrates that some trapped resident wetting fluids remain after an initial drainage imbibition cycle together with some wetting fluids from subsequent imbibition phases moreover it is found that the amount of resident wetting fluid from the last imbibition becomes relatively stable this supports findings from previous laboratory experiments gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 and numerical simulations li and berkowitz 2018 4 1 2 dynamics of resident wetting fluid in the pore space in drainage imbibition cycles some wetting fluid pockets are trapped in the pore space after the first drainage phase as seen in fig 5a and even after the second imbibition phase fig 5b some of the resident wetting fluid clusters were trapped during the first drainage imbibition cycle these clusters changed in size during the subsequent cycles simulations showed that they were affected by displacement of the neighboring nonwetting fluid as seen in the example in fig 5c and d as a result the infiltrating wetting fluid water from the second imbibition can reach this trapped wetting fluid cluster and bypassing occurs so that a cluster becomes a stagnant area instead of being trapped the values of pé at the pore scale show that diffusion is dominant in this area fig 6 in contrast advection is dominant in the infiltrating wetting fluid water that bypasses this cluster consequently the size of the bypassed wetting fluid water tracer cluster decreases on the other hand the size of the cluster does not shrink considerably because of diffusion between resident and infiltrating water which is indicated by the diffusion of tracer as a result it is seen that resident wetting fluid trapped in the pore space may still be bypassed by infiltrating water and then mix with infiltrating wetting fluid in a subsequent infiltration event the tracer concentration change in the wetting cluster shown in fig 5c is given in appendix a 6 4 1 3 dynamics of pé in the pore space the characteristics of the pore scale pé defined in section 3 2 for each tracer are also explored noting that the transport process is dynamic figs 7 and 8 show the frequency distributions of the pore scale pé for the first and second tracers and the corresponding cumulative frequency distributions respectively the distribution of pé for the first tracer indicates that diffusion is dominant in most areas 60 containing the first tracer at the beginning of the first imbibition phase fig 7a and b gradually the percentage of area where pé 1 increases fig 7c and d this trend can be explained by the fact that some resident water clusters are flushed out or mix with infiltrating water which can cause the local velocity to increase however this change does not continue and the areas dominated by diffusion again become the most significant fig 7e and f because the clusters are either trapped or bypassed by infiltrating water for the second tracer it is observed that the distribution of pé has only a single peak when new water invades the pore space fig 8a and c and more than half of the area is dominated by advection because p e 1 fig 8b and d however when the entire system approaches steady state a bimodal distribution appears fig 8e this means that there are more stagnant areas in the pore space which is shown in fig 8f so clearly for both tracers the proportion of stagnant regions increases as the flow behavior approaches steady state 4 1 4 evolution of concentration gradient for the tracer from infiltrating fluid to gain insights on the mixing process during the imbibition phase the concentration profile across a mixing region within a pore is investigated using the distribution of the second tracer compared to the fully saturated case concentration differences at the pore scale in partially saturated domains are mostly oriented along the direction transverse to the flow within a pore this is seen in fig 9 the infiltrating wetting fluid carries a higher concentration of the chemical tracer which diffuses into stagnant residual wetting fluid clusters fig 9d f fig 10 shows that concentration differences of the second tracer within a pore in the transverse direction to the flow exist when the infiltrating water bypasses a cluster of resident water as a consequence the mixing process is enhanced by this transverse diffusive mass transfer additionally it is found that the local concentration gradient c in the area first increases and then decreases during the imbibition phase as a result the mixing process is enhanced at the beginning and then slows down because of lower concentration gradients in addition to analyzing the local concentration gradient the change in the average concentration gradient c of the second tracer across the mixing area ω m can also be investigated the temporal evolution of c can be defined as jiménez martínez et al 2015a 18 c 1 s m ω m d x d y c where sm is the area of the mixing region ω m defined as ω m x y 0 05 c x y 0 95 the term c the vector magnitude of c is approximated by 2c max x t wm x t where c max x t is the maximum concentration of the second tracer in the mixing region and wm x t is the width of the mixing region in the transverse direction to the flow as shown by the single ended arrow in fig 9d fig 11 a shows that the average concentration gradient increases and subsequently decreases gradually displaying a trend similar to that of the local concentration gradient in fig 10c this behavior also qualitatively matches the result in jiménez martínez et al 2015a who examined chemical transport and reaction in a steady state partially saturated porous medium these results indicate that the mixing process for the second tracer around the stagnant area is enhanced and probably an increasing amount of tracer remains in the stagnant area when infiltrating wetting fluid moves toward the domain outlet as seen in fig 11b the breakthrough curve for the second tracer does not reach a plateau and increases relatively slowly during the imbibition phase note that the small fluctuations in the relative concentration at dimensionless time 50 60 units are caused by air pockets being flushed out of the domain evidently the concentration gradient of the chemical tracer between stagnant and flowing regions changes dynamically because of the flow field and persists during the imbibition phase due to its existence the mixing process may be enhanced and the concentration plateau is delayed 4 2 reactive transport during drainage imbibition cycle in a porous domain 4 2 1 evolution of mass and tracer distribution in reactive transport reactive chemical transport was simulated as described in section 3 2 fig 13a shows the temporal evolution of the mass for a l b l and c l in the system while fig 12 presents the spatial distribution of a l b l and c l at different time points the reaction product c l does not appear immediately with the infiltrating wetting fluid water which is labeled by the second chemical as infiltrating wetting fluid meets resident water the two chemical species begin to react the relative mass of reaction product continues to increase as the infiltrating wetting fluid advances through the pore space this indicates that mixing between resident and infiltrating wetting fluids is dominant fig 12g i also show that the relative concentration of c l is usually relatively higher in regions where a l and b l are mixed indeed the distribution of pé for a non reactive chemical shown in the section 4 1 4 demonstrates that mixing advection dominate over diffusion until the system approaches steady state flow the relative mass of the reaction product is then seen to decrease as it is flushed out of the domain in parallel reactions at the interface between stagnant and flowing regions continue although there is less reaction product because diffusion is dominant at the interface mass conservation in the coupled lbm for the reactive chemical species a l b l and reaction product c l is also analyzed as shown in fig 13b in general mass conservation is maintained with the total reactant loss a l b l being almost equal to the amount of reaction product relative error ϵ m l o s s m p r o m p r o and ϵ max 5 3 where mloss and mpro are reactant loss and product mass respectively the value of ϵ is usually less than 1 because eq 14 determines the reaction rate the concentration distribution of reactants in dynamic multiphase flow conditions may be the source of this deviation more specifically for complex pore space geometries the velocities around interfaces have a certain degree of numerical error e g value direction thus using this velocity field to solve the transport process advection diffusion equation may introduce numerical errors in terms of concentration thus influencing mass conservation calculations full analysis of these effects is beyond the scope of the current work in appendix a 7 we demonstrate that the reaction rate constant is not the main factor causing this relative error additionally due to reaction between the resident water chemical species a l and the infiltrating water chemical species b l neither of the species can act as indicators of the amount of resident and infiltrating wetting fluids in the pore space however their relative mass changes and the reaction product c l indicate which interaction between the resident and infiltrating wetting fluid is dominant 4 2 2 concentration gradient and relative mass of reaction products in stagnant regions the temporal evolution of the concentration profiles of chemical species a l b l and c l within the same pore cluster seen in the dashed frame of fig 9 are shown in fig 14 a c clearly the concentration gradients of reactants a l and b l from the stagnant region to the flowing region do not change significantly over time however the trend of chemical species c l is different initially the concentration gradient of c l indicates that the concentration of c l in the stagnant zone is lower than that in the flowing zone but this behavior then reverses with time and the relative concentration of product c l increases faster than in the mobile region at the last time point the relative concentration of product c l is almost double that of the beginning value in the stagnant region in contrast its value in the flowing region only increases less than 20 two factors control this behavior first it is easier for product c l to be accumulated in the stagnant region than in the flowing region where advection is dominant second reactants a l and b l diffuse from stagnant and flowing regions respectively clearly fig 14a shows that the relative concentration of reactant b l increases in the stagnant region thus although the relative concentration of reactant a l decreases generally fig 14b its concentration is comparable to that of b so that the amount of product c actually increases fig 14c in parallel the product c l is released very slowly through diffusive mass transfer between the stagnant and flowing regions therefore the relative mass of product c l in this stagnant region may continue to grow due to the increasing concentration to check whether the pore scale phenomenon observed above occurs in the entire domain the relative mass change of product c l in stagnant regions is plotted fig 14d shows that the relative mass of product c l in stagnant regions continues to increase while the relative mass of reactant a l in stagnant regions decreases accounting for the effect of the pé distribution throughout the domain see appendix a 8 the relative size of stagnant regions containing product c l also increases when the system approaches steady state flow this confirms that the reaction product c l usually remains in the stagnant region which may lead to larger scale anomalous transport behavior for product c cortis and berkowitz 2004 5 summary a coupled lbm is employed to simulate chemical transport and reaction in dynamic partially saturated flow conditions in the capillary flow dominated regime the link for the code is given in appendix a 9 the model features a color gradient formulation for the flow field to decrease spurious velocities the model also incorporates a viscosity ratio between immiscible fluids and integration of the interface effect into the transport model without the need to update the transport domain at each step simulations using this coupled lbm are conducted for a 2d irregular porous medium subject to multiple cycles of drainage and imbibition moreover non reactive chemical species were used as an indicator of the spatial and temporal distribution of wetting fluid e g water over different infiltration imbibition events the results demonstrate that wetting fluids represented by different chemical species for each infiltration event either do not mix homogeneously or are flushed out completely by the newest infiltrating wetting fluid however in addition some old wetting fluid and the chemical species it carries can remain in the pore space and be bypassed by infiltrating new wetting fluid after subsequent drainage imbibition cycles the key implication of these simulations is that chemical species in the resident wetting fluid can remain in the pore space for long times or be released very slowly this mechanism may cause long term environmental risks in the case of a contaminant source being present moreover analysis of the péclet number for different chemical species provides insights as to how stagnant domains evolve during imbibition phases it is shown here that the number of stagnant regions retaining a chemical species in the infiltrating water increases when the water reaches the outlet and the system approaches steady state flow conditions these stagnant regions may release chemical species very slowly to the flowing region in subsequent drainage or imbibition phases which may lead to anomalous non fickian transport behavior analysis of mixing across stagnant and flowing regions demonstrates that the mixing process is enhanced by the concentration gradient of the chemical species in the infiltrating wetting fluid which generally first increases and then decreases it is found that the average concentration gradient of the chemical species in the infiltrating wetting fluid over the entire domain displays similar behavior finally simulations of reactive transport with homogeneous reaction a l b l c l demonstrate that mixing occurs mainly when fluid flow bypasses stagnant regions during the imbibition phase significantly the reaction product may accumulate in stagnant regions and remain even following subsequent cycles of drainage and imbibition acknowledgment b b gratefully acknowledges the support of a research grant from the p a guggenheim ascarelli foundation b b holds the sam zuckerberg professorial chair in hydrology appendix a a1 diffusion in a droplet to verify the numerical method described in section 2 2 which can prevent chemical species from crossing the interface between immiscible fluids the diffusion of a non reactive chemical species in a static droplet test is considered as fig 15 shows the domain for the simulation is 128 128 lattices a static droplet radius of 32 lattices of wetting fluid a is immersed in an immiscible nonwetting fluid b with a periodic boundary condition around it the velocity field v in the entire domain is set to be 0 the left half of the droplet is full of a non reactive chemical tracer with normalized concentration c 1 while the right half is tracer free c 0 the surface tension σ between two fluids is 0 01 m u t 2 and the viscosity ratio m ν w ν n w is 10 in principle beginning from this non equilibrium state the tracer should diffuse to the other half along the concentration gradient gradually until the entire droplet is occupied by the tracer and distributed homogeneously without crossing the interface between two fluids fig 16 shows the diffusion of the chemical tracer in a static droplet the tracer gradually diffuses from left to right and after 40 000 time steps the system reaches equilibrium it is found that the total mass of tracer in the droplet remains almost constant during the entire process i e mass is conserved confirming also that tracer is retained within the droplet a2 non reactive chemical transport in a single pore fig 17 a d g show the temporal evolution of a nonwetting fluid invading a single pore and wetting fluid containing a chemical tracer clearly when the wetting fluid blue is displaced by the nonwetting fluid red the tracer is also washed out from the pore fig 17b e h to confirm that the spurious velocities around the interface have insignificant influence on the tracer transport in the wetting fluid fig 17c f i show the relative concentration profiles at x 101 l u at different time points clearly there is no diffusion across the interface and the spurious velocities do not cause any significant fluctuation of the relative concentration around the interface after the drainage phase an imbibition phase is simulated as described in section 3 1 fig 18 a i show the temporal evolution of fluid distribution and migration of the first and second chemical tracers it is seen that no tracer crosses the interface and that only when the infiltrating wetting fluid enters the pore body and meets the resident wetting fluid does tracer diffusion occur in addition fig 19 shows the breakthrough curves of both tracers at the outlet until all of the nonwetting fluid is displaced it is noted that the concentration of the first tracer decreases very slowly because the value of pé here is relatively small pé 2 67 these results demonstrate that the coupled lbm described in 2 effectively simulates pore scale advection diffusion processes during dynamic drainage and imbibition phases maintaining the tracers in the wetting phase and repressing spurious velocities while including interface movement and contact angle effects computational efficiency is significantly improved because the interface effect for transport is integrated into the transport lbm so that updating and copying transport domain information between main memory and graphics processing units at each time step are avoided a3 summary of the parameters used in coupled lbm for a pore domain a summary of the fluid and transport parameters in the lbm simulations for a pore domain is given in table 1 the parameter k 0 is the reaction rate constant in lbm units the conversion from lbm to physical units is k 0 p h y s i c a l k 0 c i n i l b m n where c ini lbm is the initial concentration on the lattice and n is the number of time steps in lbm for 1 s in physical units in this model c i n i l b m 1 0 and n 1 96 10 5 therefore k 0 p h y s i c a l 0 053 m3 mol 1 s 1 a4 mass conservation of transport under the multiphase flow condition it has been shown that lbm preserves mass conservation when transport occurs in single phase flow conditions chen et al 2014 yoon et al 2015 the main challenge in simulating transport under multiphase flow conditions is to distribute chemical species correctly with the movement of the interface here we define the relative mass in the pore space as m m t m i n i m is the relative mass mt is the total mass of the chemical species in the pore space at dimensionless time t mini is the initial total mass of the chemical species in the pore space when the initial condition is that the wetting fluid and chemical species are fill the space changes in the saturation and the relative mass are expected to be the same when the drainage event begins fig 20 a b shows these changes in a single pore and pore domain used in the simulations and demonstrates that the mass conservation is maintained with the interface movement using our coupled lbm a5 temporal evolution of resident and infiltrating wetting fluids in drainage imbibition cycles the evolution patterns of the resident wetting fluid labeled by the first chemical species during two drainage imbibition cycles are summarized in the table below a6 local relative concentration change in a resident wetting fluid pocket the relative concentration change in the resident wetting fluid when bypassing occurs is examined here it is seen that the diffusion process is dominant and the size of the resident wetting fluid pocket decreases slowly a7 mass conservation in reactive transport to examine mass conservation the loss of reactants in the reaction at a time point is calculated as δ m n a b m n m a b m n a b n o n r e a c t i v e m n m a b m n a b r e a c t i v e where m n ab is the total mass of chemical species a and b in the pore space at time point n using the non reactive transport of species a and b the amount of a and b lost in the reaction can be determined the amount of reaction product before it reaches the domain outlet is then δ m n p n m n l a t t i c e k 0 c a n m c b n m n n l a t t i c e k 0 c a n c b n where m n p is the total mass of reaction product in the pore space at time point n nlattice the lattice number of the pore space and c a n and c b n are the reactant concentrations on the lattice at time point n in principle δ m n a b δ m n p to consider the potential effect of reaction rate constant on mass conservation simple tests of reactive transport in a droplet having the same fluid distribution as in fig 15 a were done with two different reaction rate constants k 0 2 0 e 6 and 2 0 e 7 in lbm units reactants a and b are distributed homogeneously in the droplet with c a 1 and c b 1 as fig 22 shows the loss of reactants is equal to the increase of the reaction product which indicates that the reaction rate constant does not affect the mass conservation significantly a8 evolution of pé for the reaction product the frequency and cumulative frequency of pé for the reaction product at different times are considered the general pattern is similar to that of the second tracer in fig 8 section 4 1 a9 codes on github

609,mixing and reaction between chemical species during cycles of drainage and imbibition in porous media are investigated using a coupled lattice boltzmann model lbm this coupled lbm is able to simulate advection diffusion processes with homogeneous reactions under dynamic immiscible multiphase flow conditions a feature of the model is that there is no need to track the interface specifically for the transport domain which improves the computational efficiency significantly transport simulations of non reactive tracers in a natural pore domain show that some tracers can be trapped with the resident wetting fluid with the tracers in these stagnant regions defined here as regions where pé 1 being released slowly during the imbibition phase moreover it is found that the relative amount of tracer diffusing from these stagnant regions increases as the system approaches steady state flow conditions for bimolecular reactive transport the results demonstrate that most of the reaction product generated during mixing in stagnant regions accumulates and remains within these regions with only some release of the product to infiltrating wetting fluid that bypasses adjacent

velocity regions trapped clusters of wetting fluid and preferential flow paths de gennes 1983 the dependence of velocity distribution and flow path formation on wetting phase saturation significantly impacts the dynamics of chemical transport e g bromly and hinz 2004 cortis and berkowitz 2004 zoia et al 2010 in parallel resident wetting fluid trapped by the non wetting fluid phase may mix with infiltrating wetting fluid during imbibition influencing chemical transport phenomena numerous experimental and simulation works have been carried out to explore the characteristics of transport phenomena in partially saturated multiphase porous media many of these analyses have highlighted interactions between infiltrating and resident waters at both pore and field scales e g legout et al 2007 brooks et al 2010 collins et al 2000 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 li and berkowitz 2018 turton et al 1995 reported a field experiment using sodium bromide as a tracer to label resident water the soil profile experienced four periods of rainfall cycles imbibition followed by drainage with sodium bromide being added only to the first cycle in this way resident water from the first cycle had a different chemical signature from that of the infiltrating water in the following cycles the results showed that labeled resident water was initially the main component in the soil profile outflow during the second infiltration event but also that significant volumes of labeled resident water were retained even after the three subsequent rainfall periods in a related context laboratory experiments that employ disturbed or repacked soils suggest that chemical dispersion increases with decreasing saturation e g sato et al 2003 guillon et al 2013 in contrast results from experiments using natural undisturbed soil demonstrate the opposite behavior hammel and roth 1998 vanderborght and vereecken 2007 this apparent contradiction can be explained by noting that in some soil structures decreasing the saturation may correspond to decreasing the flow rate and thus less variation in the velocity field jiménez martínez et al 2015b significantly however all of these experiments were conducted at continuum scales so that specific influences of fluid distribution pore structure and other local scale factors remain elusive in recent years with the development of fast high resolution imaging techniques and microfluidics pore scale characterizations of two phase fluid flow and transport dynamics in porous media have been investigated e g jiménez martínez et al 2015b 2016 karadimitriou et al 2013 it has been demonstrated for example that mass exchange between resident and infiltrating fluid may vary in time and space karadimitriou et al 2016 even when the saturation topology is maintained under different injection rates karadimitriou et al 2017 the results also suggest i that increasing the injection rate of fluid carrying chemical tracers enhances the mass transfer between flowing and stagnant regions and ii that there is a non monotonic trend between the dispersion coefficient and total saturation as well as between the stagnant and total saturation karadimitriou et al 2017 with regard to mixing and reaction of chemical species in partially saturated systems it is clear that while advection and molecular diffusion control mixing reaction consideration of larger continuum scales does not provide information on the actual mixing processes that control chemical transport and reactions the common viewpoint is that the occurrence of a limited number of preferential flow paths induces shorter travel times and thus decrease the time available for mixing and chemical reactions however experiments measuring non reactive reactive transport with steady two phase flow in a homogeneous pore structure demonstrate that flow channeling can also increase concentration gradients and thus diffusive mass transfer and thus chemical reactions jiménez martínez et al 2015b these authors jiménez martínez et al 2015b conclude that three factors are critical in enhancing mixing processes the formation of ramified finger structures the occurrence of anomalous dispersion and the limited merging of fluid fingers by the presence of air clusters later it was found that these three factors can be attributed to the size of the dead end pore clusters the stagnant regions hasan et al 2019 there are relatively few numerical modeling studies at the pore scale of transport phenomena in porous media in partially saturated or two phase miscible immiscible systems simulations from a coupled pore network model to quantify non reactive reactive transport in partially saturated porous media indicate that the dispersion effect is strengthened by decreasing the saturation in a certain range raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 however this study did not include the effect of the size of stagnant regions as a physical factor which is a key parameter hasan et al 2019 in a different study a diffusion two relaxation time lattice boltzmann model lbm was coupled with the shan chen model to estimate effective diffusivities under different saturation values genty and pot 2014 a coupled lbm accounting for a dissolution precipitation phase change in a multicomponent multiphase system was developed and applied to simulate reactive transport in a fuel cell chen et al 2012 and co2 sequestration with low péclet number chen et al 2013 recently lbm was coupled to particle tracking methods to show that pore scale anomalous dispersion in two phase systems results primarily from the degree of molecular diffusion the initial position of chemical species and the nature of the flow network induced by trapped fluid triadis et al 2018 direct numerical simulation dns has also been used to model such systems simulations of nonreactive chemical transport in steady state two phase flow conditions using the openfoam software package aziz et al 2018 supported findings summarized above karadimitriou et al 2016 2017 and delineated the relationship between relative permeability and the dispersion coefficient aziz et al 2018 later an irregular anisotropic pore network model was also applied to simulate advective dispersive transport in steady state two phase flow through porous media hasan et al 2019 the results were upscaled to estimate directly the darcy scale transport coefficients and properties it was also noted that a non monotonic trend between dispersion and saturation exists in 3d because the velocity field may not vary with a constant pressure drop when the saturation decreases this finding indicates that the conclusion from previous experiments e g sato et al 2003 guillon et al 2013 may be incorrect if the velocity fields in the pore space vary little under different saturations comparing to the same parameters estimated from the mobile immobile model e g dispersion coefficient stagnant saturation the disagreements imply fundamental shortcomings of the mobile immobile model in describing transport in two phase flow moreover the simulation results from this research indicate that the relative permeabilities may be used to obtain accurate estimates of the stagnant saturation hasan et al 2019 which support the findings in aziz et al 2018 however chemical transport in dynamic partially saturated flow fields u t 0 u is the velocity in the pore space t is time is ubiquitous in nature and can be expected to differ from transport in steady state flow fields u t 0 as examined in laboratory experiments and numerical models to date studies on chemical transport in such dynamic systems have focused mainly on the darcy and field scales xu and pruess 2001 khaleel et al 2002 simunek and van genuchten 2008 and analysis of chemical transport at the pore scale has received little attention in conventional pore scale numerical models modelling the complex dynamic behavior of air water interfaces movement merging and splitting together with chemical transport requires updating of spatial air water distributions at each time step it is computationally inefficient and faces the difficulty of re distributing chemical species after the fluid distributions change moreover both lbm and dns face the problem of spurious velocity currents that develop around the interface between immiscible fluids although methods to minimize these problems are known and effective for very low péclet number conditions chen et al 2012 2013 they are unable to deal with complicated pore geometry and high péclet number conditions it is therefore necessary to develop means to obtain reliable velocity fields prior to updating the distribution of chemical species here we explore transport in dynamic partially saturated porous media flows u t 0 with the aim of quantifying over different imbibition events i how chemical species spread and mix ii the extent to which chemicals are trapped in stagnant regions and iii how reactions between different chemical species are affected in such conditions for this purpose a new coupled lbm based on that of riaud et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 is applied to simulate non reactive and reactive transport during cycles of drainage and imbibition in contrast to other methods chen et al 2012 2013 this model first computes the flow velocity field using a continuum surface force color gradient lbm which decreases the spurious current around the interface significantly liu et al 2014 moreover this model does not require updating of interface locations specifically at each time step and the interface effect is integrated with the lbm for transport as a consequence computational efficiency is improved and higher péclet numbers can be considered with this coupled lbm the chemical species distribution mixing and reaction are first quantified focusing on how fluid flow characteristics e g the ratio of stagnant and flowing areas influence transport and reaction behavior the details of the coupled lbm formulation are given in section 2 and its numerical implementation are presented in section 3 thorough analysis and discussion of the numerical simulations are provided in section 4 followed by a summary and conclusion in section 5 2 methodology the coupled lattice boltzmann model lbm employed here is composed of two parts first the flow field for a multicomponent multiphase system is calculated using a color gradient model riaud et al 2014 the velocity in the pore space is then used to solve the advection diffusion equation ade in the pore space occupied by the wetting fluid the interface effect generated by the color gradient model is integrated into the lbm for transport as a result chemical species are transported only by the wetting fluid red fluid in color gradient model and cannot penetrate the interface between wetting and nonwetting fluids details of the coupled lbm are explained in the following sections 2 1 color gradient lattice boltzmann model cg lbm the color gradient lattice boltzmann model cg lbm was developed by coloring immiscible fluid particles as either red or blue gunstensen et al 1991 the method has been improved to decrease the occurrence of spurious currents around the interface and the lattice pinning effect by introducing a recoloring step latva kokko and rothman 2005 leclaire et al 2012 the color gradient model developed in halliday et al 2007 is used here rather than other approaches liu et al 2012 2014 this model uses a continuum surface force csf to implement surface tension in the collision step 1 f i x t f i x t ω i x t f i here fi is the total distribution function in the ith velocity set direction at the position x and time t defined by f i f i r f i b with f i r and f i b the distribution functions of red and blue fluids individually f i is the post collision total distribution function ω i is the collision operator and f i is the distribution function forcing term to enhance the numerical stability a multi relaxation time scheme is used in the collision operator ω i 2 ω i m 1 s m i j f j x t f j e q x t where f i e q is the equilibrium function at ith direction m is a transformation matrix and s is a diagonal relaxation matrix the equilibrium function used here is 3 f i e q ρ ω i 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where e i is the discrete velocity set cs is the speed of sound ωi is the weight coefficient u is the physical velocity in the lattice and ρ ρ r ρ b is the total density with ρr and ρb the densities of red and blue fluids respectively the forcing term f i is introduced to integrate the surface tension at the interface and other force effects based on guo and zheng 2008 the multi relaxation time framework for the forcing term is 4 f m 1 i 1 2 s m f where i is the unit matrix and f is the forcing term vector from guo and zheng 2008 5 f i ω i e i f c s 2 u f e i e i c s 2 i c s 4 δ t where f is the body force including the surface tension across the interface in the presence of the solid phase to generate the contact angle effect a fictitious density value ρn x s is usually given to the nodes of the solid phase neighboring the fluid this method has been used widely in 2d and 3d color gradient models liu et al 2014 huang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 however it suffers from the disadvantage that a mixing layer is generated on the surface of the solid phase and numerical instability occurs when the contact angle θ is either very low θ 30 or very high θ 150 leclaire et al 2016 akai et al 2018 to address this problem and determine more accurate contact angle values leclaire et al 2016 2017 first proposed enforcing the direction of the color gradient on the wetting boundary by rotating the normal vector to the boundary according to the contact angle using a vector transformation however this method requires many iterations to reach the prescribed contact angle and is not computationally efficient here the method developed by akai et al 2018 is applied this method for the wetting boundary condition is based on the work of xu et al 2017 and is extended to 3d conditions details of the method for the wetting boundary are explained elsewhere akai et al 2018 xu et al 2017 with this gc lbm the spurious current around the interface is very low results from the static droplet tests show that the maximum magnitude of the spurious current is always in the range of 10 6 10 5 when the viscosity ratio between two fluids is between 10 and 20 the work of xu et al 2017 also shows that the spurious current does not increase significantly even when the viscosity ratio is 50 2 2 lbm for transport in partially saturated flow the similarity between the navier stokes equations nse and the advection diffusion equation ade enables the lbm to recover the solution of the ade through the chapman enskog analysis noble 1997 thus the common d2q9 and d3q19 schemes are also suitable for calculating advection diffusion transport phenomena however compared to the nse which requires velocity moments up to second order the ade needs only zero and first moments the lower isotropy lattice can therefore be dropped and d2q5 and d3q7 schemes are sufficient to solve advection diffusion phenomena in 2d and 3d chen et al 2012 noble 1997 when asymmetric diffusion does not exist moreover the d2q5can reach the same second order accuracy with better numerical stability as compared to the d2q9 scheme li et al 2017 the distribution function for chemical species transport follows the same evolution as for fluids 6 g i k x e i δ t t δ t g i k x t 1 τ k g i k x t g i k e q x t w i δ t s where s is the source term due to reaction g i k e q is the equilibrium distribution which is linear in the form u 7 g i k e q c k w i 1 3 e i u where c is the macroscopic concentration and obtained by 8 c k g i k the diffusivity is related to the relaxation rate τik by 9 d k 1 3 τ k 0 5 the multi relaxation time collision operator can also be applied to the collision process so that the simulation can treat high péclet number yang et al 2018 under multiphase flow conditions chemical transport becomes more complicated due to the existence of the interface between immiscible fluids chen et al 2013 developed a coupled lbm for diffusion precipitation dissolution in a closed multiphase flow system while this coupled model is effective for a closed system its application is limited because advection is not included moreover the computational cost is also relatively high because the interface location must be updated at each time step to determine the region in which transport occurs and then chemical species around each interface are redistributed to maintain mass conservation to overcome these crucial issues riaud et al 2014 and zhao et al 2015 proposed a method that couples the lbm for chemical transport to the color gradient lbm to include the interface effect compared to eq 6 this method adds a new color redistribution algorithm into the original evolution process of a chemical in single phase the general expression of chemical evolution in a multiphase flow system is 10 g i k x e i δ t t δ t g i k x t 1 τ k g i k x t g i k e q x t β k w χ r g i k e q 0 c o s θ w i δ t s where g i k e q 0 w i c k the function w χr acts as a driving force on the chemical and governs the interface profile topology βk is a convenient parameter to tune the interface profile while keeping the same topology for the chemical distribution by adjusting the interface thickness between two immiscible fluids in the cg lbm more specifically βk is given by 11 β k 6 β b c d k τ k b f this equation implies an equilibrium between molecular diffusion and the color redistribution at the interface during the advection diffusion process for the values of b c and b f they are calculated from the discrete velocity sets scheme of lbm for chemical transport and fluid respectively as 12 2 b α i 1 q ω i α e i α e i α e i α α c f therefore b c is equal to 1 6 for the discrete velocity scheme for chemical transport with d2q5 and b f is equal to 0 15 with the lbm scheme for fluid with d2q9 here for convenience we set b c b f so that eq 11 simplifies to the form β k 6 β d k τ k with fluid and chemicals having different lbm schemes however in principle it is better to retain the calculation in eq 11 and 12 to avoid the potential risk of having anisotropic and irregular concentrations around the interface between two immiscible fluids here the single phase driving force w χ r 1 χ r is adopted to keep the chemical species in one fluid for χ r 1 a value of w 0 means that the chemical is in the red fluid and diffuses passively for χ r 0 w 1 means that the region is occupied by blue fluid and the chemical is repelled to the red fluid so that cannot pass through the interface between the immiscible fluids incorporating the interface effect into the transport equation leads to much higher computationally efficiency than that developed by chen et al 2013 here the cg lbm was coupled to a continuum surface force for the surface tension and the wetting boundary developed by akai et al 2018 with the lbm for transport described by eq 10 with this new coupled lbm low spurious velocities around the interfaces and more accurate contact angle values can be reached while chemical species are kept in the designated phase or fluid a simple test for the coupled lbm is presented in appendix a 1 for the reaction source term s i k when homogeneous reactions between chemical species are considered the general description for the chemical reactions is 13 a l b l c l where a l and b l represent the reactive chemical species a and b for homogeneous reaction in liquid phase and c l is the reaction product the reaction kinetic of this system is 14 r 0 k 0 c a l c b l where k 0 is the reaction rate constant the chemical species source terms related to the homogeneous reactions are 15 s a l r 0 s b l r 0 s c l r 0 other reactions including precipitation and dissolution of the solid phase can be easily included here with appropriate reactive chemical species and reaction rate constants for precipitation and dissolution the phase change algorithm has been proposed and validated elsewhere chen et al 2012 2013 3 numerical experiments numerical experiments first focus on validating that the coupled lbm developed here correctly simulates pore scale advection and diffusion in a dynamic immiscible multiphase flow field the model is then applied to simulate non reactive and reactive chemical transport in a porous domain subject to cycles of drainage and imbibition the details of the setups for these numerical simulations are described in the following subsections 3 1 non reactive transport in a single pore as illustrated in fig 1 the simulations are conducted in a pore domain of size 201 201 lu 2 with throat width d 41 l u and square pore width l 81 l u initially the pore is fully saturated with wetting fluid red the nonwetting fluid blue only occupies the buffering layer on the top and is injected at a constant velocity v i n 1 0 e 4 l u t 1 from the inlet while a constant pressure pout boundary condition with ρ t o t a l 1 0 is imposed at the bottom outlet both conditions are implemented using the zou he method periodic boundary conditions are applied at the left and right sides the viscosities of red and blue fluids are assumed to be the same given by ν r ν b 1 6 l u 2 t 1 the surface tension is set to σ 0 03 so that the capillary number defined by c a ρ i n ν i n v i n σ is equal to 5 6 10 4 where ρin νin and vin are the density kinematic viscosity and velocity of the invading fluids respectively the contact angle is chosen to be θ 45 the diffusion coefficients of the non reactive chemical tracers are assumed to be of magnitude 10 3 equal to 10 9 m2 s 1 in physical units the initial relative concentration of the first tracer in the wetting fluid blue is set to be c 1 1 0 following a drainage phase imbibition with a second chemical tracer is simulated in the same structure the fluid and tracer distributions from the drainage phase are used as the initial condition the top buffering layers are filled with the wetting fluid and the second passive tracer for the second tracer a constant concentration boundary is implemented with a value is with c 2 1 0 the results of this simulation are shown in appendix a 2 3 2 non reactive and reactive chemical transport in a pore domain to investigate mixing and reaction of chemical species between resident and infiltrating wetting fluids the coupled lbm model employs a section of a porous domain imaged from a natural 2d granular medium mohammadmoradi et al 2016 the simulations are run in a computational domain of 850 550 pixels lu 2 and grid resolution of 7 µm the porosity is 32 60 the minimum maximum and mean pore space diameters are 0 0154 mm 0 198 mm and 0 114 mm respectively the computational domain is extended by 50 lu in the flow direction at the inlet and outlet boundaries to minimize the influence of the boundary condition fig 2 constant velocity and constant pressure are implemented at the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively while the other boundaries are solid walls and half bounce back boundary conditions are implemented similar to the initial condition for the single pore simulation section 3 1 the pore space is filled with wetting fluid red and a chemical tracer the buffering layer at the inlet is filled with nonwetting fluid blue and the injection rate on the boundary is 5 10 5 l u t 1 for each drainage imbibition cycle at the outlet the value of the constant pressure is p o u t 1 3 m u l u 1 t 2 and the color gradient function has a free flow boundary condition the relaxation times for the wetting and nonwetting fluids are set at τ w 1 0 and τ n w 0 533 respectively in addition the capillary number is chosen as 10 5 thus the viscosity pressure drop in the simulation is negligible when steady state conditions are reached the drainage phase is stopped and the wetting fluid and the second tracer are injected from the inlet two drainage imbibition cycles are considered at the pore scale the péclet number is defined as p e v d d k aziz et al 2018 for each lattice of the pore space where v is the effective pore velocity norm d is the mean pore diameter and dk denotes the diffusion coefficient of the chemical tracer k although the distance between each lattice can be used to calculate the local péclet number this distance is not the characteristic length for the pore space and is usually smaller when the pé of a region composed of adjacent lattices in the pore space is less than 1 the region is defined as a stagnant region following pan et al 2006 and yang 2013 steady state flow conditions are considered to be reached for 16 m u x t u x t 100 2 m u x t 100 2 10 6 or 17 s r w t s r w t 100 s r w t 100 10 6 to simulate chemical reactions during the transport process the final state of the first drainage phase with the first reactant with v i n 5 0 10 5 l u t 1 is used as the initial condition so that the reaction described by eq 13 occurs in the pore space when the infiltrating wetting fluid carrying the second reactant reaches the resident wetting fluid model parameters are presented in appendix a 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 non reactive transport during drainage imbibition cycles in a pore domain 4 1 1 interactions between resident and infiltrating wetting fluids after running the two drainage imbibition cycles in the pore structure described in section 3 2 appendix a 4 shows that the relative non reactive tracer amount change matches the saturation change the non reactive tracers are first considered as labels to track interactions between resident and infiltrating fluids fig 3 shows the spatial distributions of the first and second tracers at different time points and indicates how the infiltrating water advances through the pore space and interacts with resident water fig 4 shows the changes in the amounts of nonwetting and wetting fluids from different imbibition phases in the first imbibition second drainage and second imbibition phases fig 4 a shows that the amount of nonwetting fluid air and resident wetting fluid resident water labeled by the first tracer both decreased when as infiltrating wetting fluid water entered the domain at the end of this imbibition phase it is observed that the resident wetting fluid labeled by the first tracer was not totally flushed out fig 4a and compared to the initial state of the resident wetting fluid s r w 27 16 less than half 41 6 of it still remained in the pore space s r w 11 29 in addition the number of resident wetting fluid pockets decreased by almost 89 during the imbibition event from 112 to 14 see table 2 in appendix a 5 although the number of resident wetting fluid pockets decreased significantly the saturation of the resident wetting fluid decreased to about half of its initial state which indicates that most of the large resident water pockets were not affected during the first imbibition phase to confirm that resident water represented by the first tracer from the initial condition can remain in the pore space even after multiple drainage imbibition cycles a second drainage imbibition cycle was examined using the final state of the first imbibition phase as the initial condition fig 4b and c show that the resident wetting fluid labeled by the first tracer was retained in the pore space with 18 6 of it remaining at the end of the second imbibition phase therefore it is seen that most of the resident wetting fluid remaining in the pore space is barely affected by subsequent drainage imbibition events moreover some wetting fluid from the first imbibition remained in the pore space as well at the end of the second imbibition phase fig 4c appendix a 5 summarizes the patterns of resident wetting fluid evolution during these drainage imbibition cycles based on the above results non reactive chemical transport in dynamic multiphase flow simulated by coupled lbm developed here demonstrates that some trapped resident wetting fluids remain after an initial drainage imbibition cycle together with some wetting fluids from subsequent imbibition phases moreover it is found that the amount of resident wetting fluid from the last imbibition becomes relatively stable this supports findings from previous laboratory experiments gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 and numerical simulations li and berkowitz 2018 4 1 2 dynamics of resident wetting fluid in the pore space in drainage imbibition cycles some wetting fluid pockets are trapped in the pore space after the first drainage phase as seen in fig 5a and even after the second imbibition phase fig 5b some of the resident wetting fluid clusters were trapped during the first drainage imbibition cycle these clusters changed in size during the subsequent cycles simulations showed that they were affected by displacement of the neighboring nonwetting fluid as seen in the example in fig 5c and d as a result the infiltrating wetting fluid water from the second imbibition can reach this trapped wetting fluid cluster and bypassing occurs so that a cluster becomes a stagnant area instead of being trapped the values of pé at the pore scale show that diffusion is dominant in this area fig 6 in contrast advection is dominant in the infiltrating wetting fluid water that bypasses this cluster consequently the size of the bypassed wetting fluid water tracer cluster decreases on the other hand the size of the cluster does not shrink considerably because of diffusion between resident and infiltrating water which is indicated by the diffusion of tracer as a result it is seen that resident wetting fluid trapped in the pore space may still be bypassed by infiltrating water and then mix with infiltrating wetting fluid in a subsequent infiltration event the tracer concentration change in the wetting cluster shown in fig 5c is given in appendix a 6 4 1 3 dynamics of pé in the pore space the characteristics of the pore scale pé defined in section 3 2 for each tracer are also explored noting that the transport process is dynamic figs 7 and 8 show the frequency distributions of the pore scale pé for the first and second tracers and the corresponding cumulative frequency distributions respectively the distribution of pé for the first tracer indicates that diffusion is dominant in most areas 60 containing the first tracer at the beginning of the first imbibition phase fig 7a and b gradually the percentage of area where pé 1 increases fig 7c and d this trend can be explained by the fact that some resident water clusters are flushed out or mix with infiltrating water which can cause the local velocity to increase however this change does not continue and the areas dominated by diffusion again become the most significant fig 7e and f because the clusters are either trapped or bypassed by infiltrating water for the second tracer it is observed that the distribution of pé has only a single peak when new water invades the pore space fig 8a and c and more than half of the area is dominated by advection because p e 1 fig 8b and d however when the entire system approaches steady state a bimodal distribution appears fig 8e this means that there are more stagnant areas in the pore space which is shown in fig 8f so clearly for both tracers the proportion of stagnant regions increases as the flow behavior approaches steady state 4 1 4 evolution of concentration gradient for the tracer from infiltrating fluid to gain insights on the mixing process during the imbibition phase the concentration profile across a mixing region within a pore is investigated using the distribution of the second tracer compared to the fully saturated case concentration differences at the pore scale in partially saturated domains are mostly oriented along the direction transverse to the flow within a pore this is seen in fig 9 the infiltrating wetting fluid carries a higher concentration of the chemical tracer which diffuses into stagnant residual wetting fluid clusters fig 9d f fig 10 shows that concentration differences of the second tracer within a pore in the transverse direction to the flow exist when the infiltrating water bypasses a cluster of resident water as a consequence the mixing process is enhanced by this transverse diffusive mass transfer additionally it is found that the local concentration gradient c in the area first increases and then decreases during the imbibition phase as a result the mixing process is enhanced at the beginning and then slows down because of lower concentration gradients in addition to analyzing the local concentration gradient the change in the average concentration gradient c of the second tracer across the mixing area ω m can also be investigated the temporal evolution of c can be defined as jiménez martínez et al 2015a 18 c 1 s m ω m d x d y c where sm is the area of the mixing region ω m defined as ω m x y 0 05 c x y 0 95 the term c the vector magnitude of c is approximated by 2c max x t wm x t where c max x t is the maximum concentration of the second tracer in the mixing region and wm x t is the width of the mixing region in the transverse direction to the flow as shown by the single ended arrow in fig 9d fig 11 a shows that the average concentration gradient increases and subsequently decreases gradually displaying a trend similar to that of the local concentration gradient in fig 10c this behavior also qualitatively matches the result in jiménez martínez et al 2015a who examined chemical transport and reaction in a steady state partially saturated porous medium these results indicate that the mixing process for the second tracer around the stagnant area is enhanced and probably an increasing amount of tracer remains in the stagnant area when infiltrating wetting fluid moves toward the domain outlet as seen in fig 11b the breakthrough curve for the second tracer does not reach a plateau and increases relatively slowly during the imbibition phase note that the small fluctuations in the relative concentration at dimensionless time 50 60 units are caused by air pockets being flushed out of the domain evidently the concentration gradient of the chemical tracer between stagnant and flowing regions changes dynamically because of the flow field and persists during the imbibition phase due to its existence the mixing process may be enhanced and the concentration plateau is delayed 4 2 reactive transport during drainage imbibition cycle in a porous domain 4 2 1 evolution of mass and tracer distribution in reactive transport reactive chemical transport was simulated as described in section 3 2 fig 13a shows the temporal evolution of the mass for a l b l and c l in the system while fig 12 presents the spatial distribution of a l b l and c l at different time points the reaction product c l does not appear immediately with the infiltrating wetting fluid water which is labeled by the second chemical as infiltrating wetting fluid meets resident water the two chemical species begin to react the relative mass of reaction product continues to increase as the infiltrating wetting fluid advances through the pore space this indicates that mixing between resident and infiltrating wetting fluids is dominant fig 12g i also show that the relative concentration of c l is usually relatively higher in regions where a l and b l are mixed indeed the distribution of pé for a non reactive chemical shown in the section 4 1 4 demonstrates that mixing advection dominate over diffusion until the system approaches steady state flow the relative mass of the reaction product is then seen to decrease as it is flushed out of the domain in parallel reactions at the interface between stagnant and flowing regions continue although there is less reaction product because diffusion is dominant at the interface mass conservation in the coupled lbm for the reactive chemical species a l b l and reaction product c l is also analyzed as shown in fig 13b in general mass conservation is maintained with the total reactant loss a l b l being almost equal to the amount of reaction product relative error ϵ m l o s s m p r o m p r o and ϵ max 5 3 where mloss and mpro are reactant loss and product mass respectively the value of ϵ is usually less than 1 because eq 14 determines the reaction rate the concentration distribution of reactants in dynamic multiphase flow conditions may be the source of this deviation more specifically for complex pore space geometries the velocities around interfaces have a certain degree of numerical error e g value direction thus using this velocity field to solve the transport process advection diffusion equation may introduce numerical errors in terms of concentration thus influencing mass conservation calculations full analysis of these effects is beyond the scope of the current work in appendix a 7 we demonstrate that the reaction rate constant is not the main factor causing this relative error additionally due to reaction between the resident water chemical species a l and the infiltrating water chemical species b l neither of the species can act as indicators of the amount of resident and infiltrating wetting fluids in the pore space however their relative mass changes and the reaction product c l indicate which interaction between the resident and infiltrating wetting fluid is dominant 4 2 2 concentration gradient and relative mass of reaction products in stagnant regions the temporal evolution of the concentration profiles of chemical species a l b l and c l within the same pore cluster seen in the dashed frame of fig 9 are shown in fig 14 a c clearly the concentration gradients of reactants a l and b l from the stagnant region to the flowing region do not change significantly over time however the trend of chemical species c l is different initially the concentration gradient of c l indicates that the concentration of c l in the stagnant zone is lower than that in the flowing zone but this behavior then reverses with time and the relative concentration of product c l increases faster than in the mobile region at the last time point the relative concentration of product c l is almost double that of the beginning value in the stagnant region in contrast its value in the flowing region only increases less than 20 two factors control this behavior first it is easier for product c l to be accumulated in the stagnant region than in the flowing region where advection is dominant second reactants a l and b l diffuse from stagnant and flowing regions respectively clearly fig 14a shows that the relative concentration of reactant b l increases in the stagnant region thus although the relative concentration of reactant a l decreases generally fig 14b its concentration is comparable to that of b so that the amount of product c actually increases fig 14c in parallel the product c l is released very slowly through diffusive mass transfer between the stagnant and flowing regions therefore the relative mass of product c l in this stagnant region may continue to grow due to the increasing concentration to check whether the pore scale phenomenon observed above occurs in the entire domain the relative mass change of product c l in stagnant regions is plotted fig 14d shows that the relative mass of product c l in stagnant regions continues to increase while the relative mass of reactant a l in stagnant regions decreases accounting for the effect of the pé distribution throughout the domain see appendix a 8 the relative size of stagnant regions containing product c l also increases when the system approaches steady state flow this confirms that the reaction product c l usually remains in the stagnant region which may lead to larger scale anomalous transport behavior for product c cortis and berkowitz 2004 5 summary a coupled lbm is employed to simulate chemical transport and reaction in dynamic partially saturated flow conditions in the capillary flow dominated regime the link for the code is given in appendix a 9 the model features a color gradient formulation for the flow field to decrease spurious velocities the model also incorporates a viscosity ratio between immiscible fluids and integration of the interface effect into the transport model without the need to update the transport domain at each step simulations using this coupled lbm are conducted for a 2d irregular porous medium subject to multiple cycles of drainage and imbibition moreover non reactive chemical species were used as an indicator of the spatial and temporal distribution of wetting fluid e g water over different infiltration imbibition events the results demonstrate that wetting fluids represented by different chemical species for each infiltration event either do not mix homogeneously or are flushed out completely by the newest infiltrating wetting fluid however in addition some old wetting fluid and the chemical species it carries can remain in the pore space and be bypassed by infiltrating new wetting fluid after subsequent drainage imbibition cycles the key implication of these simulations is that chemical species in the resident wetting fluid can remain in the pore space for long times or be released very slowly this mechanism may cause long term environmental risks in the case of a contaminant source being present moreover analysis of the péclet number for different chemical species provides insights as to how stagnant domains evolve during imbibition phases it is shown here that the number of stagnant regions retaining a chemical species in the infiltrating water increases when the water reaches the outlet and the system approaches steady state flow conditions these stagnant regions may release chemical species very slowly to the flowing region in subsequent drainage or imbibition phases which may lead to anomalous non fickian transport behavior analysis of mixing across stagnant and flowing regions demonstrates that the mixing process is enhanced by the concentration gradient of the chemical species in the infiltrating wetting fluid which generally first increases and then decreases it is found that the average concentration gradient of the chemical species in the infiltrating wetting fluid over the entire domain displays similar behavior finally simulations of reactive transport with homogeneous reaction a l b l c l demonstrate that mixing occurs mainly when fluid flow bypasses stagnant regions during the imbibition phase significantly the reaction product may accumulate in stagnant regions and remain even following subsequent cycles of drainage and imbibition acknowledgment b b gratefully acknowledges the support of a research grant from the p a guggenheim ascarelli foundation b b holds the sam zuckerberg professorial chair in hydrology appendix a a1 diffusion in a droplet to verify the numerical method described in section 2 2 which can prevent chemical species from crossing the interface between immiscible fluids the diffusion of a non reactive chemical species in a static droplet test is considered as fig 15 shows the domain for the simulation is 128 128 lattices a static droplet radius of 32 lattices of wetting fluid a is immersed in an immiscible nonwetting fluid b with a periodic boundary condition around it the velocity field v in the entire domain is set to be 0 the left half of the droplet is full of a non reactive chemical tracer with normalized concentration c 1 while the right half is tracer free c 0 the surface tension σ between two fluids is 0 01 m u t 2 and the viscosity ratio m ν w ν n w is 10 in principle beginning from this non equilibrium state the tracer should diffuse to the other half along the concentration gradient gradually until the entire droplet is occupied by the tracer and distributed homogeneously without crossing the interface between two fluids fig 16 shows the diffusion of the chemical tracer in a static droplet the tracer gradually diffuses from left to right and after 40 000 time steps the system reaches equilibrium it is found that the total mass of tracer in the droplet remains almost constant during the entire process i e mass is conserved confirming also that tracer is retained within the droplet a2 non reactive chemical transport in a single pore fig 17 a d g show the temporal evolution of a nonwetting fluid invading a single pore and wetting fluid containing a chemical tracer clearly when the wetting fluid blue is displaced by the nonwetting fluid red the tracer is also washed out from the pore fig 17b e h to confirm that the spurious velocities around the interface have insignificant influence on the tracer transport in the wetting fluid fig 17c f i show the relative concentration profiles at x 101 l u at different time points clearly there is no diffusion across the interface and the spurious velocities do not cause any significant fluctuation of the relative concentration around the interface after the drainage phase an imbibition phase is simulated as described in section 3 1 fig 18 a i show the temporal evolution of fluid distribution and migration of the first and second chemical tracers it is seen that no tracer crosses the interface and that only when the infiltrating wetting fluid enters the pore body and meets the resident wetting fluid does tracer diffusion occur in addition fig 19 shows the breakthrough curves of both tracers at the outlet until all of the nonwetting fluid is displaced it is noted that the concentration of the first tracer decreases very slowly because the value of pé here is relatively small pé 2 67 these results demonstrate that the coupled lbm described in 2 effectively simulates pore scale advection diffusion processes during dynamic drainage and imbibition phases maintaining the tracers in the wetting phase and repressing spurious velocities while including interface movement and contact angle effects computational efficiency is significantly improved because the interface effect for transport is integrated into the transport lbm so that updating and copying transport domain information between main memory and graphics processing units at each time step are avoided a3 summary of the parameters used in coupled lbm for a pore domain a summary of the fluid and transport parameters in the lbm simulations for a pore domain is given in table 1 the parameter k 0 is the reaction rate constant in lbm units the conversion from lbm to physical units is k 0 p h y s i c a l k 0 c i n i l b m n where c ini lbm is the initial concentration on the lattice and n is the number of time steps in lbm for 1 s in physical units in this model c i n i l b m 1 0 and n 1 96 10 5 therefore k 0 p h y s i c a l 0 053 m3 mol 1 s 1 a4 mass conservation of transport under the multiphase flow condition it has been shown that lbm preserves mass conservation when transport occurs in single phase flow conditions chen et al 2014 yoon et al 2015 the main challenge in simulating transport under multiphase flow conditions is to distribute chemical species correctly with the movement of the interface here we define the relative mass in the pore space as m m t m i n i m is the relative mass mt is the total mass of the chemical species in the pore space at dimensionless time t mini is the initial total mass of the chemical species in the pore space when the initial condition is that the wetting fluid and chemical species are fill the space changes in the saturation and the relative mass are expected to be the same when the drainage event begins fig 20 a b shows these changes in a single pore and pore domain used in the simulations and demonstrates that the mass conservation is maintained with the interface movement using our coupled lbm a5 temporal evolution of resident and infiltrating wetting fluids in drainage imbibition cycles the evolution patterns of the resident wetting fluid labeled by the first chemical species during two drainage imbibition cycles are summarized in the table below a6 local relative concentration change in a resident wetting fluid pocket the relative concentration change in the resident wetting fluid when bypassing occurs is examined here it is seen that the diffusion process is dominant and the size of the resident wetting fluid pocket decreases slowly a7 mass conservation in reactive transport to examine mass conservation the loss of reactants in the reaction at a time point is calculated as δ m n a b m n m a b m n a b n o n r e a c t i v e m n m a b m n a b r e a c t i v e where m n ab is the total mass of chemical species a and b in the pore space at time point n using the non reactive transport of species a and b the amount of a and b lost in the reaction can be determined the amount of reaction product before it reaches the domain outlet is then δ m n p n m n l a t t i c e k 0 c a n m c b n m n n l a t t i c e k 0 c a n c b n where m n p is the total mass of reaction product in the pore space at time point n nlattice the lattice number of the pore space and c a n and c b n are the reactant concentrations on the lattice at time point n in principle δ m n a b δ m n p to consider the potential effect of reaction rate constant on mass conservation simple tests of reactive transport in a droplet having the same fluid distribution as in fig 15 a were done with two different reaction rate constants k 0 2 0 e 6 and 2 0 e 7 in lbm units reactants a and b are distributed homogeneously in the droplet with c a 1 and c b 1 as fig 22 shows the loss of reactants is equal to the increase of the reaction product which indicates that the reaction rate constant does not affect the mass conservation significantly a8 evolution of pé for the reaction product the frequency and cumulative frequency of pé for the reaction product at different times are considered the general pattern is similar to that of the second tracer in fig 8 section 4 1 a9 codes on github
