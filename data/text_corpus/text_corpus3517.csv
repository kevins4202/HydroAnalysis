17585,mitigation of nitrous oxide n2o emissions is of primary importance to meet the targets of reducing carbon footprints of wastewater treatment plants wwtps despite of a large amount of n2o mitigation studies conducted in laboratories full scale implementation of n2o mitigation is scarce mainly due to uncertainties of mitigation effectiveness validation of n2o mathematical model risks to nutrient removal performance and additional costs this study aims to address the uncertainties by investigating the quantification development and implementation of n2o mitigation strategies at a full scale sequencing batch reactor sbr to achieve this n2o emission dynamics nutrient removal performance and operation of the sbr were monitored to quantify n2o emissions and identify the n2o generation mechanisms n2o mitigation strategies centered on reducing dissolved oxygen do levels were consequently proposed and evaluated using a multi pathway n2o production mathematical model before implementation the implemented mitigation strategy resulted in a 35 reduction in n2o emissions from the emission factor of 0 89 0 05 to 0 58 0 06 which was equivalent to annual reduction of 2 35 tonne of n2o from the studied wwtp this could be mainly attributed to reductions in n2o generated via the nh2oh oxidation pathway due to the lowering of do level as the first reported mitigation strategy permanently implemented at a full scale wwtp it showcased that the mitigation of n2o emissions at full scale is feasible and that widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory studies are also likely effective in full scale plants furthermore the close agreement between the validated and predicted n2o emission factors 0 58 vs 0 55 respectively showed that the n2o mathematical model is a useful tool to evaluate n2o mitigation strategies at full scale importantly this work demonstrated that n2o mitigation does not necessarily require additional operational cost to meet reduction targets in contrast the n2o mitigation applied here reduced energy requirements for aeration by 20 equally important long term monitoring identified that n2o mitigation did not affect the nutrient removal performance of the plant finally with the knowledge acquired in this study a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions from full scale treatment plants was proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide wastewater treatment full scale mitigation nitrogen removal 1 introduction raising awareness on climate change in past years has been driving many water utilities around the world to set targets of reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps nitrous oxide n2o is the third most abundant ghg in atmosphere that can be produced during the biological nitrogen removal process edenhofer et al 2014 in wwtps n2o emissions can account for the majority up to 83 of the overall plant carbon footprint daelman et al 2013 desloover et al 2011 the mitigation of n2o emissions is therefore of primary importance to meet the targets mitigation of n2o emissions in wwtps requires in depth understanding of n2o production mechanisms in wwtps early studies made efforts to establish links between n2o generations and operational parameters such as no2 dissolved oxygen do levels ph temperature and cod n chemical oxygen demand ratio kampschreur et al 2009b pijuan et al 2014 rodriguez caballero et al 2014 su et al 2019 vasilaki et al 2019 while these parameters were found to strongly influence the overall n2o emissions it was not realistic to propose mitigations strategies without considering the contributions from n2o production pathways there are three main microbial pathways and two groups of bacteria identified in n2o productions in wwtps the nh2oh oxidation pathway and the nitrifier denitrification pathway employed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the heterotrophic denitrification pathway employed by heterotrophic denitrifiers duan et al 2017 it has been realised that the n2o production pathways are regulated differently by environmental factors domingo félez and smets 2019 various operational strategies have been demonstrated in laboratories to effectively reduce n2o emissions from the nitrogen removal process chen et al 2016 massara et al 2017 zhu and chen 2011 it has been shown that substituting continuous aeration with intermittent aeration could reduce n2o emissions intermittent aeration allowed heterotrophic denitrification between aeration periods to consume n2o and or n2o precursors no no2 béline and martinez 2002 blum et al 2018 liang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 do control during nitrification and denitrification has also been shown to restrain the generation of n2o santín et al 2017 sun et al 2015 n2o emissions can also be abated by adjusting the cycle designs in sbr systems chen et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 changing feeding regimes to intermittent or multi step feeding can reduce n2o emissions duan et al 2018 su et al 2017 at laboratory scale a combined strategy consisting of intermittent aeration anoxic feeding and anoxic carbon dosage was shown to decrease n2o emission by over 99 peng et al 2017 despite a large number of n2o mitigation studies conducted in laboratories the full scale implementation of n2o mitigation is still scarce to our best knowledge there has been no comprehensive study conducted at full scale that has successfully implemented n2o mitigation strategy full scale treatment plants are inherently more complex than laboratory reactors and hence are difficult to compare with laboratory reactors varying influent compositions and loading the inclusions of nitrifying bacteria and other microorganisms in real wastewater duan et al 2019 the non optimal control of operational conditions and insufficient mixing conditions create complications to extrapolate lab scale n2o studies results to full scale plants it is believed that the following uncertainties are preventing the implementation of n2o mitigation at full scale a the effectiveness of n2o mitigation strategies proposed and developed in lab scale investigations b the applicability of n2o mathematical models developed and validated in lab scale studies c the consequences on plant nutrient removal performance d the potentially extra operational costs this study aims to address the abovementioned uncertainties through a systematic n2o mitigation study at a full scale wwtp mitigation strategies were proposed based on the investigation of long term monitoring data the effectiveness of n2o mitigation and the applicability of a mathematical model were verified following the implementation of developed n2o mitigation strategy at full scale the first permanently implemented full scale n2o mitigation in this study also enabled the long term assessment of the plant nutrient removal performance and operational costs with the knowledge acquired a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions at full scale wwtps is proposed which covers monitoring quantification analyses evaluation and implementation this study was carried out according to this approach firstly a monitoring campaign was conducted to assess baseline n2o emissions nutrient removal performance and operational conditions of the studied plant the obtained data was used to interpret the n2o generation mechanisms and potential mitigation strategies were proposed potential strategies were then evaluated by the mechanistic mathematical model prior to being implemented following the implementation a second monitoring campaign was conducted to validate and assess the long term consequences of the mitigation on n2o emissions nutrient removal performance and operational costs of the studied plant 2 material method 2 1 description of the full scale plant the studied wwtp is located in adelaide australia receiving wastewater originated from various sources including domestic sewage industrial effluent and occasional surface water run off and infiltrated ground water wastewater enters the plant and proceeds through successive stages of treatment from preliminary to tertiary treatment the plant includes a sequencing batch reactor sbr system designed to achieve biological nitrogen removal through nitrification and denitrification as well as cod removal the system comprises 6 identical tanks with five tanks operated online and one offline for routine maintenance at the time of the study fig 1 a the average daily flow to the overall sbr systems during this long term study year 2014 2017 is 23 600 2600 m3 day mean sd n 1270 with population equivalent of 60 000 each tank receives approximately 20 of the wastewater flow and operates as an independent sbr under the same conditions in this study one of the five sbr was chosen for the monitoring shown as stars in fig 1a the influent firstly passes through an anoxic selector before being fed into the sbr tank each sbr cycle consists of the following phases in sequence 108 min continuous feeding intermittent aeration 54 min reaction intermittent aeration 54 min settling and 54 min decanting the implemented intermittent aeration consists of recurring 30 to 45 min aeration followed by a 15 to 60 min anoxic period mixed but not aerated throughout the continuous feeding phase and the reaction phase this intermittent aeration pattern enabled ammonia oxidation to nitrite and nitrate through nitrification when aeration is on and nitrite and nitrate removal through denitrification when aeration is off the aeration flow rate is controlled based on online do measurement with the do set points varied between 0 5 and 2 8 mgo2 l each sbr has one online do probe and ph probe installed specifically amperometric sensors were deployed for the online measurement and control of do digital oxygen sensor oxymax cos51d endress hauser maintenance including cleaning and calibration was carried out fortnightly according to the manufacturer s operating instructions available at https www endress com the ph was monitored but not controlled the designed sludge retention time srt is 12 to 18 days and the hydraulic retention time hrt is 15 h 2 2 n2o measurement and monitoring multiple online sampling locations with floating hoods were chosen to capture the possible variations in n2o emissions due to non ideal mixing aeration conditions the design of floating hoods used in this study is described in supplementary information si section 1 the hoods locations are indicated in fig 1a b gas phase sampling locations were specifically chosen to cover the influent inlet area hood 1 the middle of the aeration tank hood 2 and the effluent outlet area hood 3 the emitted gas was firstly collected by the hoods which was then passed to the central analysing unit via a poly pipe with a gentle slope for condensate collection and removal three gas lines each with a gas flow meter a temperature sensor and a pressure sensor were set up to regulate the gas collected from the three hoods respectively the collected gas was then measured by the n2o analyser horiba va 3000 vs 3002 the gas lines were controlled by 3 direct acting solenoid valves respectively which allowed the measurement of the off gas composition sequentially from three hoods at 6 minute intervals fig 1c e the data logger controller multicon cmc 99 was used as the central controlling unit for the cyclic opening and closing of the valves this unit logs signals from the temperature and pressure sensors the horiba gas analyser and flow meters and controls the valves via digital output signals through solid state relays as the working temperature of the n2o analyser is between 5 and 40 c an automatic shutdown function was applied when the temperature exceeds 40 c fig 1c the n2o analyser horiba va 3000 achieves repeatability of 0 5 of f s r full scale range linearity of 1 0 f s r the n2o analyser measurements were checked independently by analysing gas samples using a gas chromatograph gc details of the n2o analyser calibration and results comparison with gc can be found in supplementary information section s2 2 3 long term and intensive monitoring campaigns the measurement campaign consisted of two long term monitoring campaigns for 4 weeks from 15th feb to 30th mar 2014 75 sbr cycles with n2o data collection interrupted between 24th feb 11th mar and 7th 13th april 2017 35 sbr cycles after applying the mitigation strategy and a three day intensive monitoring period on 17th mar to 19th mar 2014 in addition the influent and effluent quality were monitored on a daily basis for one year and half before and after the implementation of mitigation strategy n2o emitted at different locations were collected through sampling hoods floating over the mixed liquor and connected to a 24 hour online analyser through tubing sampling lines 24 h composite samples of both influent and effluent were collected to measure tcod tkn ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n concentrations in influent and effluent online data recorded by the plant such as influent flow rate aeration flow rate do concentration were also collected the intensive monitoring was conducted to collect liquid phase n2o concentration data at different locations along with other chemical parameters relevant to n2o production during the intensive sampling period hourly samples were taken from several selected sampling locations for wastewater and mixed liquor composition analysis the designed sampling points covered influent anoxic selector and one point within the sbr near hood 2 samples were analysed for dissolved n2o nh4 n no3 n no2 n the ph temperature do at these locations were also measured hourly with a portable do ph t meter ysi professional plus united states 2 4 calculation of n2o emissions the n2o emissions of the sbr systems were calculated based on the long term online monitoring results the on line n2o concentration captured by each hood was recorded by the employed analyser the on line flow rate data from each hood was recorded by the gas flow meter with such information the amount of n2o emissions at each hood over a certain period of time can be calculated eq 1 1 n 2 o emitted c n 2 o n gas q air δ t where cn2on gas the n2on concentration in the off gas mg n2on l qair the flow rate of the aeration l hr during an aerated phase or gas flow rate through the analyzer during a non aerated phase l hr δt time interval by which the off gas n2o concentration was measured by the n2o analyser the unit of n2o concentration in the off gas was converted from ppmv based on the volume occupied by 1 mole of ideal gas at the standard temperature and pressure 0 c and 101 3 kpa 22 4 m3 kg mole and corrected for temperature at the time of sampling since the ghg emissions could have significant spatial variations the surface of the sbr was divided into three zones represented by the location of the three hoods each hood represents 1 3 of the sbr surface the variations in ghg emissions were considered by weighing the area of each zone when calculating the average daily ghg emissions finally the n2o emission factor ef was determined based on the absolute n2o emissions and the influent nitrogen loadings the n2o ef is defined as the percentage ratio of emitted n2o to the total tkn loading to the plant and calculated as 2 n 2 o ef amount of n 2 o emitted amount of influent nitrogen load 100 2 5 mathematical models a previously developed multi pathway n2o model was used to simulate n2o production and emission in this work peng et al 2016 this model was developed based on activated sludge models henze et al 2000 the model incorporates all relevant reactions involved in the consumption and production of nh3 nh2oh no n2o o2 no2 and no3 by both aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers the model contains all three known pathways for n2o production the nitrifier denitrification the nh2oh oxidation and the heterotrophic denitrification pathways the model components stoichiometry and kinetics of this multiple pathway n2o model by aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers are summarized in table s1 s2 si section 3 kinetic control of all the enzymatic reaction rates is described by the michaelis menten equation roskoski 2015 the rate of each reaction is modelled by an explicit function of the concentrations of all substrates involved in the reaction as described in detail in table s3 s4 si section 3 the model consists of 24 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters among them 17 model parameter values are well investigated and thus adopted from the literature directly table s2 the remaining key parameters that regulate ammonium oxidation processes and n2o generation processes were estimated using an established two step calibration procedure as per peng et al 2016 briefly the ammonium oxidation kinetics were firstly estimated with the ammonium nitrite nitrate and do data obtained from the intensive and online sampling then key parameters overseeing the n2o production processes were calibrated with the n2o emission dynamics captured it should be noted that diffusion by aggregates is assumed negligible within the investigated suspended flocs system and not considered in the model 2 6 analytical methods the collected liquid samples were filtered with 0 45 mm disposable sterile filters millipore millex gp and were subsequently injected into freshly vacuumed labco exetainers to allow equilibration of gas and liquid phases the n2o concentrations in the gas phase of the tube were measured using a shimadzu gc 9a gas chromatograph gc equipped with a micro electron capture detector ecd and a flame ionization detector fid respectively each labco exetainer tube was weighed before and after sampling to determine the sample volume collected this volume along with the known volume of the exetainers enables to calculate dissolved n2o contained in the original wastewater sample ye et al 2014 a detailed description of the method using exetainer and gc for measuring nitrous oxide can be found in sturm et al 2015 the filtered samples were sent to the national association of testing authorities nata accredited australian water quality centre for analyses of nh4 no3 and no2 concentrations using a flow injection analyser fia the detection limit of the nh4 no3 and no2 concentrations are 0 002 0 003 and 0 003 mgn l respectively mixed liquor suspend solid mlss and volatile solids mlvss taken in intensive sampling round were measured in triplicates according to the standard methods apha 1995 tcod and tkn in samples collected in long term sampling round were analysed according to standard methods apha 1995 as well morphological analysis of the biomass was conducted using a light microscope nikon smz1000 with images captured using a mounted nikon digital sight ds u2 camera and nis elements d 3 0 laboratory imaging s r o imaging software 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of results in this study was evaluated by an analysis of variance p 0 05 was regarded statistically insignificant whereas p 0 05 was considered statistically significant pearson and spearman correlation analysis was performed in python 3 7 using python data analysis library pandas 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification and dynamics of n2o emissions during the one month long term sampling period the studied sbr demonstrated good pollutant removal performance as indicated by monitored influent and effluent water quality table 1 the average tcod and tkn removal efficiencies over the month were around 65 and 85 respectively due to the low bod levels measured in the effluent 2 9 1 8 mg l non biodegradable cod accounts for most of the cod in the effluent 173 36 mg l nitrate was found to be the main form of nitrogen in the effluent with an average concentration of 3 3 1 7 mg n l the nitrous oxide concentration in the effluent was 0 0045 mg n l slightly higher than its concentration in the influent 0 0012 mg n l influent and effluent water quality monitoring indicated a relatively stable and satisfactory nutrient removal performance which suggested the measurements of n2o emissions are representative of typical plant performance significant spatial variations of n2o emissions from the sbr were observed during the long term monitoring program n2o emissions from hood 1 ef 1 18 0 08 were consistently higher p 0 005 than that from hood 2 0 69 0 05 and hood 3 0 81 0 09 fig 2 a n2o emissions from hood 2 and 3 were not statistically different p 0 25 during this period the total nitrogen and cod loading remained comparable fig 2a no significant correlations were found between n cod loading rates and n2o emission factors 0 3 pearson coefficient 0 3 at the same time the airflow rated recorded in the three hoods are significantly different figure s4 p 0 01 with hood 3 44 9 2 21 l min mean s e n 88 hood 1 30 3 1 8 l min n 107 hood 2 20 9 1 2 l min n 80 the difference of recorded airflow rates suggested unevenly distributed aeration nevertheless the uneven distribution of aeration was not in line with the n2o flux variations and thus not the determining factor for the n2o emissions it is likely that the nutrient levels in the different hood locations affected the n2o off gas concentration leading to distinct n2o fluxes note that hood 1 covered the influent inlet area while hood 2 was placed at the middle of the aeration tank and hood 3 nearest to the effluent decant area fig 1 moreover the n2o emission dynamics fig 2b suggest that hood 1 produced more n2o mainly during the first two third of the aeration period which coincided with sbr feeding post feeding the n2o flux from three hoods were comparable fig 2b it is likely that the higher n2o emissions observed from hood 1 was due to pronounced substrate gradient in the reactor the introduction of feed into the reactor could result in higher localised ammonium concentrations in the area hood 1 closest to the point of feeding previous study has also shown that a high substrate concentration area tends to be formed close to the feed inlet due to limits in mixing and mass transfer larsson et al 1996 higher ammonium concentrations could lead to a higher ammonium oxidation rate aor which was found to stimulate n2o emissions law et al 2012 it was previously shown that n2o fluxes had strong spatial variations in full scale step feed plug flow reactor pan et al 2016 it was previously believed that n2o emissions from an sbr reactor would not display significant spatial variability and hence the use of a multiple hoods setup was not deemed necessary rodriguez caballero et al 2015 however this study has shown that significant spatial variations in n2o emissions exist within full scale sbrs which must be considered when monitoring such variation is likely due to substrate gradients in the reactor the substrate gradients resulted by feeding and non ideal mixing cannot be ignored in sbr the use of a one hood setup is likely to result in inaccurate measurement in our case the ef ranged between 0 69 to 1 18 depending on location coefficient of variation 0 23 floating hoods flux measurement is the most favoured way of measuring n2o emissions from wwtps due to low cost and simplicity yoshida et al 2014 however it has been well recognized that the most important disadvantage of the hood measurement approach is the small surface area that is covered which may not be representative of a whole plant bai et al 2019 from this study it is apparent that a multiple hood setup should be adopted for the quantification of n2o emissions from full scale sbr that are thought to be well mixed with the consideration of spatial variation the average n2o ef was calculated to be 0 89 0 05 s e n 75 for the studied sbr during the first monitoring campaign which is 44 lower than the ipcc default n2o ef 1 6 for domestic wwtps in the latest refinement of ipcc guidelines the default ef from full scale domestic wwtps was determined by averaging current available measurements 30 data ipcc 2019 nevertheless the n2o emissions from the studied sbr are still higher than most 80 of the 12 plants reported in the united states ahn et al 2010 the n2o emission 2 08 kg tonnes of co2 e year accounts for 42 of the wwtp overall carbon footprint 4 92 kg tonnes of co2 e year and 98 of the direct fugitive ghg emissions 2 12 kg tonnes of co2 e year from the plant table s5 therefore the mitigation of n2o emissions is still critical to reduce the carbon footprint of wwtps 3 2 factors influencing n2o emissions and proposed mitigation strategy understanding the key parameters that influence n2o emissions is critical as it enables the development of corresponding mitigation strategies online monitoring showed that majority of n2o was emitted during the filling and the reaction periods when aeration was on the n2o flux dropped to zero immediately after aeration was turned off fig 2 3 the n2o emission showed a clear recurring cycle pattern which mirrored the pattern of the do profile fig 3 a the strong monotonic relationship between the do concentrations and n2o flux was confirmed by spearman correlation analysis with r s determined to be 0 74 in addition dissolved nitrogenous compounds were intensively monitored profiles taken from two typical cycles are shown in fig 3b as substrates for n2o productions nh4 and no2 are also positively related to n2o emissions pearson correlation analysis was performed for nitrogenous compound concentrations and n2o flux and results are shown in table s6 a particularly strong linear correlation between no2 concentration and n2o flux was observed with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 93 the observed strong correlations of n2o flux to do and no2 concentrations are consistent with previous laboratory studies kampschreur et al 2009a under aerobic condition n2o emissions can mostly be attributed to aob which transforms nh4 or no2 to n2o by two pathways aerobically nh2oh oxidation pathway nn and nitrifiers denitrification pathway nd respectively previous isotope study found that high do levels promote n2o emissions mainly from nn pathway increase of do levels above 1 0 mgo2 l does not further increase n2o emissions from nd pathway peng et al 2014 the accumulation of nitrite is believed to stimulate n2o emissions from the nd pathway as substrate duan et al 2018 in the studied sbr the actual do concentrations varied greatly during the aerobic phase from 0 1 up to 8 0mgo2 l the do was not controlled when operated using the intermittent aeration strategy fixed on off aeration time based on this it is proposed that a reduced and better controlled delivery of do during the aerobic phase could reduce the n2o emissions by regulating n2o generations from both nn and nd pathways based on the observed strong correlation of n2o emissions and the do levels it is likely that a large part of the n2o emissions are originated from nn pathway the reduction of do concentration could reduce the n2o emissions from nn pathway peng et al 2014 in addition the studied sbrs were fed aerobically decreased do levels could promote denitrification in the aerobic phase which could reduce nitrite accumulation as a result of lowered substrate nitrite concentrations less n2o would be produced from nd pathway overall reduction of do levels in the sbr could mitigate n2o emissions two n2o mitigation strategies were developed accordingly fig 4 a strategy 1 was proposed to continue the current intermittent aeration scheme fixed on off aeration time while implementing a tighter do set point control while the aeration is on at 2 0 mgo2 l strategy 2 was proposed to implement a continuous aeration scheme with the do level constantly maintained at a low level of around 0 5 mgo2 l which will likely enable simultaneous nitrification and denitrification throughout the aerobic phase mathematical modeling was then applied to evaluate how the proposed strategies could impact the n2o emissions and nutrient removal performances a previously developed multi pathway model was calibrated with long term and intensive monitoring data from one sbr cycle fig 4b as described in section 2 5 the calibrated model was then validated by simulating the long term monitoring data as shown in fig 4c the model could predict the n2o emissions and capture the dynamics from the sbr the do concentrations under current conditions varied between 0 and 3 5 mg o2 l while the do concentrations of strategy 1 and strategy 2 are maintained at 2 0 mg o2 l when aeration is on and 0 5 mg o2 l respectively fig 5 a with reduced do levels in these two strategies the model predicted a substantial decrease in n2o emissions fig 5d for both strategies the model showed that the overall n2o emission factor can be reduced from 0 9 to 0 7 strategy 1 and further down to 0 55 strategy 2 importantly nutrient removal performances were predicted as well comparison showed that tkn and total cod removal efficiencies were not negatively affected by the proposed mitigation strategies figure s5 3 3 implementation of mitigation strategy and the results proposed strategy 2 was implemented at the full scale sbr compared with previous operational condition the do levels were more tightly controlled fig 5a c during the aerobic phase the do concentrations were maintained at 0 49 0 28 mgo2 l mean s d to promote simultaneous nitrification and denitrification similar to the model prediction significantly less n2o was emitted from the sbr fig 5b d the n2o emission factor is determined to be 0 58 0 06 mean s e n 17 cycles the implemented mitigation strategy significantly reduced n2o emissions by 35 ef from 0 89 to 0 58 p 0 001 fig 6 which is equivalent to a reduction of 1 21 tonne of n2o nitrogen per year emitted from the studied sbr plant it should be noted that the mitigation strategy was implemented two years after the first monitoring campaign both monitoring campaigns were carried out at the same time of year to avoid potentially seasonal variations the influent characteristics and loadings during two monitoring periods were not significantly different table s5 in addition apart from the do profile all operational conditions and were kept the same to enable direct comparison of n2o emissions before and after the mitigation nevertheless some obscure changes cannot be simply excluded a reconfirmation test was therefore designed and carried out to further verify the validity of the comparison during the reconfirmation test the low do control was suspended to allow the do in the reactor revert back to the same intermittent and high concentration profile that was seen in the initial stage fig 5a vs 5e the relatively high do resulted in the return of higher n2o emissions from the reactor compared to when the mitigation strategy was applied p 0 001 the ef had increased from 0 58 0 06 to 1 43 0 59 mean s e n 12 cycles fig 6 the substantially higher n2o emissions observed had reconfirmed the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy suggesting the low n2o emissions was due to the implemented mitigation strategy therefore the mitigation was successfully validated at full scale the observed n2o reduction could be attributed to a reduction in n2o generation from both the nn pathway due to lower do level maintained and nd pathway due to a reduction in nitrite accumulation in the sbr which is discussed in the following section long term monitoring of the plant performance before and after implementing the mitigation strategy confirmed that the nutrient removal performance of the sbr were not affected fig 6a during the two study periods 1 5 year before and 1 5 year after the implementation in the second half of 2015 the nutrient loading rates to the sbr remained comparable table s7 while strong seasonal variations of no3 and no2 concentrations in the effluent can be observed fig 6a no2 and no3 concentrations remained comparable after adopting the mitigation strategy p 0 05 fig 6a c at the same time the excellent ammonium removal in the second period suggests that complete ammonium removal can be achieved at relatively low do levels i e 0 43 0 07 mgn l mean s e n 57 consistent with literature reports liu and wang 2013 overall the influent and effluent quality monitoring suggested the mitigation of n2o did not influence the removal efficiency of tn cod or bod figure s6 however it should be noted that the low do control strategy slightly reduced the sludge settleability a clear trend of seasonal change of sludge settleability can be consistently observed during the monitoring period better in summer and worse in winter the seasonal variation is consistent with previous report likely caused by variable biomass density jones and schuler 2010 the implementation of low do control slightly deteriorated the sludge settleability increasing svi from 230 1 3 0 to 241 3 2 9 ml g mean s e n 341 4 9 increase p 0 05 no significant change in filaments was observed in sludge as reflected by similar sludge morphology before and after the implementation of low do figure s7 low do has long been known to strongly affect sludge settleability yuan and blackall 2002 the observed decrement of sludge settleability consequently led to reduced suspended solids concentration in the reactor 3 48 0 04 vs 3 08 0 02 g l mean s e n 341 p 0 001 nevertheless the slightly reduced settleability did not affect the plant nutrient removal performance an additional benefit of the mitigation strategy is the significant saving on aeration energy and energy cost aeration mass flows were monitored continuously for one year before and after the implementation of mitigation strategy the comparison shows that in average 33 less air flow was required for aeration leading to 21 reduction in aeration energy consumption after the implementation figure s8 in most medium to large wwtps with the common conventional activated sludge configuration aeration takes up approximately 50 60 of all electricity consumption being the largest energy consumer gu et al 2017 the approximately 20 reduction in aeration energy requirement would result in significant savings in the total energy consumption of the wwtp this will also further reduce the carbon footprint of the wwtp due to the electricity savings in addition to the demonstrated n2o emission reduction 3 4 implications for n2o mitigations in wwtps this study demonstrated a systematic approach for mitigating n2o emissions from a full scale wwtp in the last decade a large number of studies were carried out to investigate n2o emissions from wwtps the ultimate goal for most of those studies is the mitigation of n2o emissions from full scale wwtps standing on the shoulders of giants it is for the first time that a scientifically concluded n2o mitigation strategy was permanently implemented in a full scale wwtp through this long term full scale study a few uncertainties that prevented the implementation of n2o mitigations in full scale plants were addressed firstly it showcased that widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory studies are likely also effective at full scale laboratory studies have demonstrated that low do control strategy can mitigate n2o emissions chen et al 2016 this is the first time that low do control strategy was shown to be effective at full scale to mitigate n2o emissions rodriguez caballero et al 2015 also demonstrated that the intermittent aeration strategy initially demonstrated effective in lab was also efficient in full scale the evidence collectively suggested that widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory are also likely to be effective in full scale wwtps secondly the multi pathway n2o mathematical model prediction was verified by the full scale implementation n2o mathematical model is a powerful tool to guide n2o mitigations the model can evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies on n2o reductions it also assessed the consequences of proposed mitigations strategies on the plant nutrient removal performance however prior to this it was uncertain whether the multi pathway n2o mathematical model developed mainly from lab experiments while calibrated with full scale data can be reliably applied to full scale wwtps in this study the measured ef 0 58 0 06 after the implementation of proposed mitigation strategy was close to the predicted n2o emission factor by the mathematical model 0 55 this work confirms that once properly calibrated the n2o model is a useful and powerful tool to guide n2o mitigations at full scale plants equally important this work demonstrated that n2o mitigation does not necessarily require additional operational cost as previously argued in rodriguez caballero et al 2015 in fact the n2o mitigation in this study was achieved with reduced operational cost due to savings in energy consumption by aeration the study highlights how operational improvements can play a major role in delivering cost effective and long term ghg abatement outcomes it should also be noted the n2o mitigation did not affect plant nutrient removal performance this finding is significant as it shows n2o mitigation could result in additional benefits for wwtp operations which could give greater incentives for the water sector to mitigate n2o emissions with the knowledge acquired in this study we proposed a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions from full scale treatment plants as shown in fig 7 while this study was carried out in an sbr the results are independent from sbr settings and applicable to other configurations firstly a comprehensive understanding of operational conditions and baseline n2o emission status of the studied plants is required operational parameters e g do inflow rates airflow rates and nutrients levels nitrogen compounds and cod which are associated with n2o emissions should be monitored in addition n2o gas and or liquid phase concentrations need to be measured to quantify emissions and to characterize the dynamics of the emission profiles note that spatial and temporal variations of n2o emissions cannot be ignored in either sbr this study or plug flow reactor gruber et al 2019 pan et al 2016 therefore multiple sampling spots and long term monitoring are necessary main influencing factor s that stimulates n2o emissions can be identified by analysing the monitoring results by linking with the operational environmental factors important factors include do aeration strategy no2 rapidly changing process conditions cod n and ph should be considered if applicable the n2o production pathway contributions can be determined by isotope techniques duan et al 2017 the production pathways are differently regulated by environmental factors with identified influencing factor s and or pathway contributions corresponding mitigation strategies can be developed thereafter strategies are firstly evaluated by mathematical models as demonstrated in this work the evaluation should consider the impacts on both n2o emissions and pollutant removal performances effective mitigation strategies are then assessed again for each wwtp on a case by case basis with specific conditions of the plant considered before the final implementation risk assessment needs to be conducted to minimize the risk on plant performance following the implementation monitoring is still required to fully verify the effects of the mitigation strategy on n2o emissions and pollutants removal performances finally some limitations of this work should be noted in this study n2o was monitored only for a relatively short period of time strong seasonal variations of n2o emissions from wwtps have been repeatedly observed and reported chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 therefore the quantification of the n2o emissions ef 0 89 0 05 and 0 58 0 06 before and after mitigation from the studied plant could be biased previous long term n2o monitoring studies have suggested n2o emissions in autumn are likely in the lower end of a year daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 it is likely that the n2o emissions quantified in this work during autumn is underestimated to represent the plant n2o emissions nevertheless the limitation does not affect the results of this mitigation work two monitoring periods in this study were purposely conducted at the same time of a year to minimize the effects of seasonal variations allowing fair comparisons the successful mitigation of n2o emissions is still valid which was further confirmed with the reconfirmation monitoring campaign in addition the n2o mitigation strategies investigated and implemented in this study may not be the only or best option and other strategies could also be effective for example implementing intermittent feeding may also effectively reduce n2o emissions su et al 2017 4 conclusions this study demonstrated a systematic approach for mitigating n2o emissions from a full scale wwtp the n2o emissions from the full scale sbr were quantified with multiple floating hoods and significant spatial variations of n2o emissions were observed it suggested multiple hood setup is essential to capture spatial variations in full scale sbr quantification the proposed mitigation was permanently implemented in the full scale sbr resulting in 35 reduction in n2o emissions ef 0 89 0 05 vs 0 58 0 06 equivalent to annual reduction of 2 35 tonne of n2o in the studied wwtp i e 729 6 tonne of co2 in a 100 year horizon observed n2o reduction could be attributed to less generations from the nh2oh oxidation pathway due to the lower do level through this study a few uncertainties that prevented the implementation of n2o mitigations in full scale plants were addressed it showcased the mitigation of n2o emissions at full scale is feasible and the knowledge obtained from laboratory investigations in many aspects is applicable widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory studies are likely also effective at full scale plants in addition a multi pathway n2o model prediction was implemented and validated at a full scale wwtp ef 0 58 vs 0 55 measured vs predicted it showed that the n2o mathematical model developed in laboratories is also a useful tool to evaluate n2o mitigation strategies and consequences to nutrient removal performances at full scale it is also important the study demonstrated that n2o mitigation does not necessarily incur additional operational cost or affect nutrient removal performances in fact the n2o mitigation was achieved with reduced operational costs in this study due to 20 savings in aeration energy consumption finally with the knowledge acquired in this study a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions covering monitoring

17585,mitigation of nitrous oxide n2o emissions is of primary importance to meet the targets of reducing carbon footprints of wastewater treatment plants wwtps despite of a large amount of n2o mitigation studies conducted in laboratories full scale implementation of n2o mitigation is scarce mainly due to uncertainties of mitigation effectiveness validation of n2o mathematical model risks to nutrient removal performance and additional costs this study aims to address the uncertainties by investigating the quantification development and implementation of n2o mitigation strategies at a full scale sequencing batch reactor sbr to achieve this n2o emission dynamics nutrient removal performance and operation of the sbr were monitored to quantify n2o emissions and identify the n2o generation mechanisms n2o mitigation strategies centered on reducing dissolved oxygen do levels were consequently proposed and evaluated using a multi pathway n2o production mathematical model before implementation the implemented mitigation strategy resulted in a 35 reduction in n2o emissions from the emission factor of 0 89 0 05 to 0 58 0 06 which was equivalent to annual reduction of 2 35 tonne of n2o from the studied wwtp this could be mainly attributed to reductions in n2o generated via the nh2oh oxidation pathway due to the lowering of do level as the first reported mitigation strategy permanently implemented at a full scale wwtp it showcased that the mitigation of n2o emissions at full scale is feasible and that widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory studies are also likely effective in full scale plants furthermore the close agreement between the validated and predicted n2o emission factors 0 58 vs 0 55 respectively showed that the n2o mathematical model is a useful tool to evaluate n2o mitigation strategies at full scale importantly this work demonstrated that n2o mitigation does not necessarily require additional operational cost to meet reduction targets in contrast the n2o mitigation applied here reduced energy requirements for aeration by 20 equally important long term monitoring identified that n2o mitigation did not affect the nutrient removal performance of the plant finally with the knowledge acquired in this study a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions from full scale treatment plants was proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide wastewater treatment full scale mitigation nitrogen removal 1 introduction raising awareness on climate change in past years has been driving many water utilities around the world to set targets of reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps nitrous oxide n2o is the third most abundant ghg in atmosphere that can be produced during the biological nitrogen removal process edenhofer et al 2014 in wwtps n2o emissions can account for the majority up to 83 of the overall plant carbon footprint daelman et al 2013 desloover et al 2011 the mitigation of n2o emissions is therefore of primary importance to meet the targets mitigation of n2o emissions in wwtps requires in depth understanding of n2o production mechanisms in wwtps early studies made efforts to establish links between n2o generations and operational parameters such as no2 dissolved oxygen do levels ph temperature and cod n chemical oxygen demand ratio kampschreur et al 2009b pijuan et al 2014 rodriguez caballero et al 2014 su et al 2019 vasilaki et al 2019 while these parameters were found to strongly influence the overall n2o emissions it was not realistic to propose mitigations strategies without considering the contributions from n2o production pathways there are three main microbial pathways and two groups of bacteria identified in n2o productions in wwtps the nh2oh oxidation pathway and the nitrifier denitrification pathway employed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the heterotrophic denitrification pathway employed by heterotrophic denitrifiers duan et al 2017 it has been realised that the n2o production pathways are regulated differently by environmental factors domingo félez and smets 2019 various operational strategies have been demonstrated in laboratories to effectively reduce n2o emissions from the nitrogen removal process chen et al 2016 massara et al 2017 zhu and chen 2011 it has been shown that substituting continuous aeration with intermittent aeration could reduce n2o emissions intermittent aeration allowed heterotrophic denitrification between aeration periods to consume n2o and or n2o precursors no no2 béline and martinez 2002 blum et al 2018 liang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 do control during nitrification and denitrification has also been shown to restrain the generation of n2o santín et al 2017 sun et al 2015 n2o emissions can also be abated by adjusting the cycle designs in sbr systems chen et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 changing feeding regimes to intermittent or multi step feeding can reduce n2o emissions duan et al 2018 su et al 2017 at laboratory scale a combined strategy consisting of intermittent aeration anoxic feeding and anoxic carbon dosage was shown to decrease n2o emission by over 99 peng et al 2017 despite a large number of n2o mitigation studies conducted in laboratories the full scale implementation of n2o mitigation is still scarce to our best knowledge there has been no comprehensive study conducted at full scale that has successfully implemented n2o mitigation strategy full scale treatment plants are inherently more complex than laboratory reactors and hence are difficult to compare with laboratory reactors varying influent compositions and loading the inclusions of nitrifying bacteria and other microorganisms in real wastewater duan et al 2019 the non optimal control of operational conditions and insufficient mixing conditions create complications to extrapolate lab scale n2o studies results to full scale plants it is believed that the following uncertainties are preventing the implementation of n2o mitigation at full scale a the effectiveness of n2o mitigation strategies proposed and developed in lab scale investigations b the applicability of n2o mathematical models developed and validated in lab scale studies c the consequences on plant nutrient removal performance d the potentially extra operational costs this study aims to address the abovementioned uncertainties through a systematic n2o mitigation study at a full scale wwtp mitigation strategies were proposed based on the investigation of long term monitoring data the effectiveness of n2o mitigation and the applicability of a mathematical model were verified following the implementation of developed n2o mitigation strategy at full scale the first permanently implemented full scale n2o mitigation in this study also enabled the long term assessment of the plant nutrient removal performance and operational costs with the knowledge acquired a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions at full scale wwtps is proposed which covers monitoring quantification analyses evaluation and implementation this study was carried out according to this approach firstly a monitoring campaign was conducted to assess baseline n2o emissions nutrient removal performance and operational conditions of the studied plant the obtained data was used to interpret the n2o generation mechanisms and potential mitigation strategies were proposed potential strategies were then evaluated by the mechanistic mathematical model prior to being implemented following the implementation a second monitoring campaign was conducted to validate and assess the long term consequences of the mitigation on n2o emissions nutrient removal performance and operational costs of the studied plant 2 material method 2 1 description of the full scale plant the studied wwtp is located in adelaide australia receiving wastewater originated from various sources including domestic sewage industrial effluent and occasional surface water run off and infiltrated ground water wastewater enters the plant and proceeds through successive stages of treatment from preliminary to tertiary treatment the plant includes a sequencing batch reactor sbr system designed to achieve biological nitrogen removal through nitrification and denitrification as well as cod removal the system comprises 6 identical tanks with five tanks operated online and one offline for routine maintenance at the time of the study fig 1 a the average daily flow to the overall sbr systems during this long term study year 2014 2017 is 23 600 2600 m3 day mean sd n 1270 with population equivalent of 60 000 each tank receives approximately 20 of the wastewater flow and operates as an independent sbr under the same conditions in this study one of the five sbr was chosen for the monitoring shown as stars in fig 1a the influent firstly passes through an anoxic selector before being fed into the sbr tank each sbr cycle consists of the following phases in sequence 108 min continuous feeding intermittent aeration 54 min reaction intermittent aeration 54 min settling and 54 min decanting the implemented intermittent aeration consists of recurring 30 to 45 min aeration followed by a 15 to 60 min anoxic period mixed but not aerated throughout the continuous feeding phase and the reaction phase this intermittent aeration pattern enabled ammonia oxidation to nitrite and nitrate through nitrification when aeration is on and nitrite and nitrate removal through denitrification when aeration is off the aeration flow rate is controlled based on online do measurement with the do set points varied between 0 5 and 2 8 mgo2 l each sbr has one online do probe and ph probe installed specifically amperometric sensors were deployed for the online measurement and control of do digital oxygen sensor oxymax cos51d endress hauser maintenance including cleaning and calibration was carried out fortnightly according to the manufacturer s operating instructions available at https www endress com the ph was monitored but not controlled the designed sludge retention time srt is 12 to 18 days and the hydraulic retention time hrt is 15 h 2 2 n2o measurement and monitoring multiple online sampling locations with floating hoods were chosen to capture the possible variations in n2o emissions due to non ideal mixing aeration conditions the design of floating hoods used in this study is described in supplementary information si section 1 the hoods locations are indicated in fig 1a b gas phase sampling locations were specifically chosen to cover the influent inlet area hood 1 the middle of the aeration tank hood 2 and the effluent outlet area hood 3 the emitted gas was firstly collected by the hoods which was then passed to the central analysing unit via a poly pipe with a gentle slope for condensate collection and removal three gas lines each with a gas flow meter a temperature sensor and a pressure sensor were set up to regulate the gas collected from the three hoods respectively the collected gas was then measured by the n2o analyser horiba va 3000 vs 3002 the gas lines were controlled by 3 direct acting solenoid valves respectively which allowed the measurement of the off gas composition sequentially from three hoods at 6 minute intervals fig 1c e the data logger controller multicon cmc 99 was used as the central controlling unit for the cyclic opening and closing of the valves this unit logs signals from the temperature and pressure sensors the horiba gas analyser and flow meters and controls the valves via digital output signals through solid state relays as the working temperature of the n2o analyser is between 5 and 40 c an automatic shutdown function was applied when the temperature exceeds 40 c fig 1c the n2o analyser horiba va 3000 achieves repeatability of 0 5 of f s r full scale range linearity of 1 0 f s r the n2o analyser measurements were checked independently by analysing gas samples using a gas chromatograph gc details of the n2o analyser calibration and results comparison with gc can be found in supplementary information section s2 2 3 long term and intensive monitoring campaigns the measurement campaign consisted of two long term monitoring campaigns for 4 weeks from 15th feb to 30th mar 2014 75 sbr cycles with n2o data collection interrupted between 24th feb 11th mar and 7th 13th april 2017 35 sbr cycles after applying the mitigation strategy and a three day intensive monitoring period on 17th mar to 19th mar 2014 in addition the influent and effluent quality were monitored on a daily basis for one year and half before and after the implementation of mitigation strategy n2o emitted at different locations were collected through sampling hoods floating over the mixed liquor and connected to a 24 hour online analyser through tubing sampling lines 24 h composite samples of both influent and effluent were collected to measure tcod tkn ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n concentrations in influent and effluent online data recorded by the plant such as influent flow rate aeration flow rate do concentration were also collected the intensive monitoring was conducted to collect liquid phase n2o concentration data at different locations along with other chemical parameters relevant to n2o production during the intensive sampling period hourly samples were taken from several selected sampling locations for wastewater and mixed liquor composition analysis the designed sampling points covered influent anoxic selector and one point within the sbr near hood 2 samples were analysed for dissolved n2o nh4 n no3 n no2 n the ph temperature do at these locations were also measured hourly with a portable do ph t meter ysi professional plus united states 2 4 calculation of n2o emissions the n2o emissions of the sbr systems were calculated based on the long term online monitoring results the on line n2o concentration captured by each hood was recorded by the employed analyser the on line flow rate data from each hood was recorded by the gas flow meter with such information the amount of n2o emissions at each hood over a certain period of time can be calculated eq 1 1 n 2 o emitted c n 2 o n gas q air δ t where cn2on gas the n2on concentration in the off gas mg n2on l qair the flow rate of the aeration l hr during an aerated phase or gas flow rate through the analyzer during a non aerated phase l hr δt time interval by which the off gas n2o concentration was measured by the n2o analyser the unit of n2o concentration in the off gas was converted from ppmv based on the volume occupied by 1 mole of ideal gas at the standard temperature and pressure 0 c and 101 3 kpa 22 4 m3 kg mole and corrected for temperature at the time of sampling since the ghg emissions could have significant spatial variations the surface of the sbr was divided into three zones represented by the location of the three hoods each hood represents 1 3 of the sbr surface the variations in ghg emissions were considered by weighing the area of each zone when calculating the average daily ghg emissions finally the n2o emission factor ef was determined based on the absolute n2o emissions and the influent nitrogen loadings the n2o ef is defined as the percentage ratio of emitted n2o to the total tkn loading to the plant and calculated as 2 n 2 o ef amount of n 2 o emitted amount of influent nitrogen load 100 2 5 mathematical models a previously developed multi pathway n2o model was used to simulate n2o production and emission in this work peng et al 2016 this model was developed based on activated sludge models henze et al 2000 the model incorporates all relevant reactions involved in the consumption and production of nh3 nh2oh no n2o o2 no2 and no3 by both aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers the model contains all three known pathways for n2o production the nitrifier denitrification the nh2oh oxidation and the heterotrophic denitrification pathways the model components stoichiometry and kinetics of this multiple pathway n2o model by aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers are summarized in table s1 s2 si section 3 kinetic control of all the enzymatic reaction rates is described by the michaelis menten equation roskoski 2015 the rate of each reaction is modelled by an explicit function of the concentrations of all substrates involved in the reaction as described in detail in table s3 s4 si section 3 the model consists of 24 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters among them 17 model parameter values are well investigated and thus adopted from the literature directly table s2 the remaining key parameters that regulate ammonium oxidation processes and n2o generation processes were estimated using an established two step calibration procedure as per peng et al 2016 briefly the ammonium oxidation kinetics were firstly estimated with the ammonium nitrite nitrate and do data obtained from the intensive and online sampling then key parameters overseeing the n2o production processes were calibrated with the n2o emission dynamics captured it should be noted that diffusion by aggregates is assumed negligible within the investigated suspended flocs system and not considered in the model 2 6 analytical methods the collected liquid samples were filtered with 0 45 mm disposable sterile filters millipore millex gp and were subsequently injected into freshly vacuumed labco exetainers to allow equilibration of gas and liquid phases the n2o concentrations in the gas phase of the tube were measured using a shimadzu gc 9a gas chromatograph gc equipped with a micro electron capture detector ecd and a flame ionization detector fid respectively each labco exetainer tube was weighed before and after sampling to determine the sample volume collected this volume along with the known volume of the exetainers enables to calculate dissolved n2o contained in the original wastewater sample ye et al 2014 a detailed description of the method using exetainer and gc for measuring nitrous oxide can be found in sturm et al 2015 the filtered samples were sent to the national association of testing authorities nata accredited australian water quality centre for analyses of nh4 no3 and no2 concentrations using a flow injection analyser fia the detection limit of the nh4 no3 and no2 concentrations are 0 002 0 003 and 0 003 mgn l respectively mixed liquor suspend solid mlss and volatile solids mlvss taken in intensive sampling round were measured in triplicates according to the standard methods apha 1995 tcod and tkn in samples collected in long term sampling round were analysed according to standard methods apha 1995 as well morphological analysis of the biomass was conducted using a light microscope nikon smz1000 with images captured using a mounted nikon digital sight ds u2 camera and nis elements d 3 0 laboratory imaging s r o imaging software 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of results in this study was evaluated by an analysis of variance p 0 05 was regarded statistically insignificant whereas p 0 05 was considered statistically significant pearson and spearman correlation analysis was performed in python 3 7 using python data analysis library pandas 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification and dynamics of n2o emissions during the one month long term sampling period the studied sbr demonstrated good pollutant removal performance as indicated by monitored influent and effluent water quality table 1 the average tcod and tkn removal efficiencies over the month were around 65 and 85 respectively due to the low bod levels measured in the effluent 2 9 1 8 mg l non biodegradable cod accounts for most of the cod in the effluent 173 36 mg l nitrate was found to be the main form of nitrogen in the effluent with an average concentration of 3 3 1 7 mg n l the nitrous oxide concentration in the effluent was 0 0045 mg n l slightly higher than its concentration in the influent 0 0012 mg n l influent and effluent water quality monitoring indicated a relatively stable and satisfactory nutrient removal performance which suggested the measurements of n2o emissions are representative of typical plant performance significant spatial variations of n2o emissions from the sbr were observed during the long term monitoring program n2o emissions from hood 1 ef 1 18 0 08 were consistently higher p 0 005 than that from hood 2 0 69 0 05 and hood 3 0 81 0 09 fig 2 a n2o emissions from hood 2 and 3 were not statistically different p 0 25 during this period the total nitrogen and cod loading remained comparable fig 2a no significant correlations were found between n cod loading rates and n2o emission factors 0 3 pearson coefficient 0 3 at the same time the airflow rated recorded in the three hoods are significantly different figure s4 p 0 01 with hood 3 44 9 2 21 l min mean s e n 88 hood 1 30 3 1 8 l min n 107 hood 2 20 9 1 2 l min n 80 the difference of recorded airflow rates suggested unevenly distributed aeration nevertheless the uneven distribution of aeration was not in line with the n2o flux variations and thus not the determining factor for the n2o emissions it is likely that the nutrient levels in the different hood locations affected the n2o off gas concentration leading to distinct n2o fluxes note that hood 1 covered the influent inlet area while hood 2 was placed at the middle of the aeration tank and hood 3 nearest to the effluent decant area fig 1 moreover the n2o emission dynamics fig 2b suggest that hood 1 produced more n2o mainly during the first two third of the aeration period which coincided with sbr feeding post feeding the n2o flux from three hoods were comparable fig 2b it is likely that the higher n2o emissions observed from hood 1 was due to pronounced substrate gradient in the reactor the introduction of feed into the reactor could result in higher localised ammonium concentrations in the area hood 1 closest to the point of feeding previous study has also shown that a high substrate concentration area tends to be formed close to the feed inlet due to limits in mixing and mass transfer larsson et al 1996 higher ammonium concentrations could lead to a higher ammonium oxidation rate aor which was found to stimulate n2o emissions law et al 2012 it was previously shown that n2o fluxes had strong spatial variations in full scale step feed plug flow reactor pan et al 2016 it was previously believed that n2o emissions from an sbr reactor would not display significant spatial variability and hence the use of a multiple hoods setup was not deemed necessary rodriguez caballero et al 2015 however this study has shown that significant spatial variations in n2o emissions exist within full scale sbrs which must be considered when monitoring such variation is likely due to substrate gradients in the reactor the substrate gradients resulted by feeding and non ideal mixing cannot be ignored in sbr the use of a one hood setup is likely to result in inaccurate measurement in our case the ef ranged between 0 69 to 1 18 depending on location coefficient of variation 0 23 floating hoods flux measurement is the most favoured way of measuring n2o emissions from wwtps due to low cost and simplicity yoshida et al 2014 however it has been well recognized that the most important disadvantage of the hood measurement approach is the small surface area that is covered which may not be representative of a whole plant bai et al 2019 from this study it is apparent that a multiple hood setup should be adopted for the quantification of n2o emissions from full scale sbr that are thought to be well mixed with the consideration of spatial variation the average n2o ef was calculated to be 0 89 0 05 s e n 75 for the studied sbr during the first monitoring campaign which is 44 lower than the ipcc default n2o ef 1 6 for domestic wwtps in the latest refinement of ipcc guidelines the default ef from full scale domestic wwtps was determined by averaging current available measurements 30 data ipcc 2019 nevertheless the n2o emissions from the studied sbr are still higher than most 80 of the 12 plants reported in the united states ahn et al 2010 the n2o emission 2 08 kg tonnes of co2 e year accounts for 42 of the wwtp overall carbon footprint 4 92 kg tonnes of co2 e year and 98 of the direct fugitive ghg emissions 2 12 kg tonnes of co2 e year from the plant table s5 therefore the mitigation of n2o emissions is still critical to reduce the carbon footprint of wwtps 3 2 factors influencing n2o emissions and proposed mitigation strategy understanding the key parameters that influence n2o emissions is critical as it enables the development of corresponding mitigation strategies online monitoring showed that majority of n2o was emitted during the filling and the reaction periods when aeration was on the n2o flux dropped to zero immediately after aeration was turned off fig 2 3 the n2o emission showed a clear recurring cycle pattern which mirrored the pattern of the do profile fig 3 a the strong monotonic relationship between the do concentrations and n2o flux was confirmed by spearman correlation analysis with r s determined to be 0 74 in addition dissolved nitrogenous compounds were intensively monitored profiles taken from two typical cycles are shown in fig 3b as substrates for n2o productions nh4 and no2 are also positively related to n2o emissions pearson correlation analysis was performed for nitrogenous compound concentrations and n2o flux and results are shown in table s6 a particularly strong linear correlation between no2 concentration and n2o flux was observed with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 93 the observed strong correlations of n2o flux to do and no2 concentrations are consistent with previous laboratory studies kampschreur et al 2009a under aerobic condition n2o emissions can mostly be attributed to aob which transforms nh4 or no2 to n2o by two pathways aerobically nh2oh oxidation pathway nn and nitrifiers denitrification pathway nd respectively previous isotope study found that high do levels promote n2o emissions mainly from nn pathway increase of do levels above 1 0 mgo2 l does not further increase n2o emissions from nd pathway peng et al 2014 the accumulation of nitrite is believed to stimulate n2o emissions from the nd pathway as substrate duan et al 2018 in the studied sbr the actual do concentrations varied greatly during the aerobic phase from 0 1 up to 8 0mgo2 l the do was not controlled when operated using the intermittent aeration strategy fixed on off aeration time based on this it is proposed that a reduced and better controlled delivery of do during the aerobic phase could reduce the n2o emissions by regulating n2o generations from both nn and nd pathways based on the observed strong correlation of n2o emissions and the do levels it is likely that a large part of the n2o emissions are originated from nn pathway the reduction of do concentration could reduce the n2o emissions from nn pathway peng et al 2014 in addition the studied sbrs were fed aerobically decreased do levels could promote denitrification in the aerobic phase which could reduce nitrite accumulation as a result of lowered substrate nitrite concentrations less n2o would be produced from nd pathway overall reduction of do levels in the sbr could mitigate n2o emissions two n2o mitigation strategies were developed accordingly fig 4 a strategy 1 was proposed to continue the current intermittent aeration scheme fixed on off aeration time while implementing a tighter do set point control while the aeration is on at 2 0 mgo2 l strategy 2 was proposed to implement a continuous aeration scheme with the do level constantly maintained at a low level of around 0 5 mgo2 l which will likely enable simultaneous nitrification and denitrification throughout the aerobic phase mathematical modeling was then applied to evaluate how the proposed strategies could impact the n2o emissions and nutrient removal performances a previously developed multi pathway model was calibrated with long term and intensive monitoring data from one sbr cycle fig 4b as described in section 2 5 the calibrated model was then validated by simulating the long term monitoring data as shown in fig 4c the model could predict the n2o emissions and capture the dynamics from the sbr the do concentrations under current conditions varied between 0 and 3 5 mg o2 l while the do concentrations of strategy 1 and strategy 2 are maintained at 2 0 mg o2 l when aeration is on and 0 5 mg o2 l respectively fig 5 a with reduced do levels in these two strategies the model predicted a substantial decrease in n2o emissions fig 5d for both strategies the model showed that the overall n2o emission factor can be reduced from 0 9 to 0 7 strategy 1 and further down to 0 55 strategy 2 importantly nutrient removal performances were predicted as well comparison showed that tkn and total cod removal efficiencies were not negatively affected by the proposed mitigation strategies figure s5 3 3 implementation of mitigation strategy and the results proposed strategy 2 was implemented at the full scale sbr compared with previous operational condition the do levels were more tightly controlled fig 5a c during the aerobic phase the do concentrations were maintained at 0 49 0 28 mgo2 l mean s d to promote simultaneous nitrification and denitrification similar to the model prediction significantly less n2o was emitted from the sbr fig 5b d the n2o emission factor is determined to be 0 58 0 06 mean s e n 17 cycles the implemented mitigation strategy significantly reduced n2o emissions by 35 ef from 0 89 to 0 58 p 0 001 fig 6 which is equivalent to a reduction of 1 21 tonne of n2o nitrogen per year emitted from the studied sbr plant it should be noted that the mitigation strategy was implemented two years after the first monitoring campaign both monitoring campaigns were carried out at the same time of year to avoid potentially seasonal variations the influent characteristics and loadings during two monitoring periods were not significantly different table s5 in addition apart from the do profile all operational conditions and were kept the same to enable direct comparison of n2o emissions before and after the mitigation nevertheless some obscure changes cannot be simply excluded a reconfirmation test was therefore designed and carried out to further verify the validity of the comparison during the reconfirmation test the low do control was suspended to allow the do in the reactor revert back to the same intermittent and high concentration profile that was seen in the initial stage fig 5a vs 5e the relatively high do resulted in the return of higher n2o emissions from the reactor compared to when the mitigation strategy was applied p 0 001 the ef had increased from 0 58 0 06 to 1 43 0 59 mean s e n 12 cycles fig 6 the substantially higher n2o emissions observed had reconfirmed the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy suggesting the low n2o emissions was due to the implemented mitigation strategy therefore the mitigation was successfully validated at full scale the observed n2o reduction could be attributed to a reduction in n2o generation from both the nn pathway due to lower do level maintained and nd pathway due to a reduction in nitrite accumulation in the sbr which is discussed in the following section long term monitoring of the plant performance before and after implementing the mitigation strategy confirmed that the nutrient removal performance of the sbr were not affected fig 6a during the two study periods 1 5 year before and 1 5 year after the implementation in the second half of 2015 the nutrient loading rates to the sbr remained comparable table s7 while strong seasonal variations of no3 and no2 concentrations in the effluent can be observed fig 6a no2 and no3 concentrations remained comparable after adopting the mitigation strategy p 0 05 fig 6a c at the same time the excellent ammonium removal in the second period suggests that complete ammonium removal can be achieved at relatively low do levels i e 0 43 0 07 mgn l mean s e n 57 consistent with literature reports liu and wang 2013 overall the influent and effluent quality monitoring suggested the mitigation of n2o did not influence the removal efficiency of tn cod or bod figure s6 however it should be noted that the low do control strategy slightly reduced the sludge settleability a clear trend of seasonal change of sludge settleability can be consistently observed during the monitoring period better in summer and worse in winter the seasonal variation is consistent with previous report likely caused by variable biomass density jones and schuler 2010 the implementation of low do control slightly deteriorated the sludge settleability increasing svi from 230 1 3 0 to 241 3 2 9 ml g mean s e n 341 4 9 increase p 0 05 no significant change in filaments was observed in sludge as reflected by similar sludge morphology before and after the implementation of low do figure s7 low do has long been known to strongly affect sludge settleability yuan and blackall 2002 the observed decrement of sludge settleability consequently led to reduced suspended solids concentration in the reactor 3 48 0 04 vs 3 08 0 02 g l mean s e n 341 p 0 001 nevertheless the slightly reduced settleability did not affect the plant nutrient removal performance an additional benefit of the mitigation strategy is the significant saving on aeration energy and energy cost aeration mass flows were monitored continuously for one year before and after the implementation of mitigation strategy the comparison shows that in average 33 less air flow was required for aeration leading to 21 reduction in aeration energy consumption after the implementation figure s8 in most medium to large wwtps with the common conventional activated sludge configuration aeration takes up approximately 50 60 of all electricity consumption being the largest energy consumer gu et al 2017 the approximately 20 reduction in aeration energy requirement would result in significant savings in the total energy consumption of the wwtp this will also further reduce the carbon footprint of the wwtp due to the electricity savings in addition to the demonstrated n2o emission reduction 3 4 implications for n2o mitigations in wwtps this study demonstrated a systematic approach for mitigating n2o emissions from a full scale wwtp in the last decade a large number of studies were carried out to investigate n2o emissions from wwtps the ultimate goal for most of those studies is the mitigation of n2o emissions from full scale wwtps standing on the shoulders of giants it is for the first time that a scientifically concluded n2o mitigation strategy was permanently implemented in a full scale wwtp through this long term full scale study a few uncertainties that prevented the implementation of n2o mitigations in full scale plants were addressed firstly it showcased that widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory studies are likely also effective at full scale laboratory studies have demonstrated that low do control strategy can mitigate n2o emissions chen et al 2016 this is the first time that low do control strategy was shown to be effective at full scale to mitigate n2o emissions rodriguez caballero et al 2015 also demonstrated that the intermittent aeration strategy initially demonstrated effective in lab was also efficient in full scale the evidence collectively suggested that widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory are also likely to be effective in full scale wwtps secondly the multi pathway n2o mathematical model prediction was verified by the full scale implementation n2o mathematical model is a powerful tool to guide n2o mitigations the model can evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies on n2o reductions it also assessed the consequences of proposed mitigations strategies on the plant nutrient removal performance however prior to this it was uncertain whether the multi pathway n2o mathematical model developed mainly from lab experiments while calibrated with full scale data can be reliably applied to full scale wwtps in this study the measured ef 0 58 0 06 after the implementation of proposed mitigation strategy was close to the predicted n2o emission factor by the mathematical model 0 55 this work confirms that once properly calibrated the n2o model is a useful and powerful tool to guide n2o mitigations at full scale plants equally important this work demonstrated that n2o mitigation does not necessarily require additional operational cost as previously argued in rodriguez caballero et al 2015 in fact the n2o mitigation in this study was achieved with reduced operational cost due to savings in energy consumption by aeration the study highlights how operational improvements can play a major role in delivering cost effective and long term ghg abatement outcomes it should also be noted the n2o mitigation did not affect plant nutrient removal performance this finding is significant as it shows n2o mitigation could result in additional benefits for wwtp operations which could give greater incentives for the water sector to mitigate n2o emissions with the knowledge acquired in this study we proposed a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions from full scale treatment plants as shown in fig 7 while this study was carried out in an sbr the results are independent from sbr settings and applicable to other configurations firstly a comprehensive understanding of operational conditions and baseline n2o emission status of the studied plants is required operational parameters e g do inflow rates airflow rates and nutrients levels nitrogen compounds and cod which are associated with n2o emissions should be monitored in addition n2o gas and or liquid phase concentrations need to be measured to quantify emissions and to characterize the dynamics of the emission profiles note that spatial and temporal variations of n2o emissions cannot be ignored in either sbr this study or plug flow reactor gruber et al 2019 pan et al 2016 therefore multiple sampling spots and long term monitoring are necessary main influencing factor s that stimulates n2o emissions can be identified by analysing the monitoring results by linking with the operational environmental factors important factors include do aeration strategy no2 rapidly changing process conditions cod n and ph should be considered if applicable the n2o production pathway contributions can be determined by isotope techniques duan et al 2017 the production pathways are differently regulated by environmental factors with identified influencing factor s and or pathway contributions corresponding mitigation strategies can be developed thereafter strategies are firstly evaluated by mathematical models as demonstrated in this work the evaluation should consider the impacts on both n2o emissions and pollutant removal performances effective mitigation strategies are then assessed again for each wwtp on a case by case basis with specific conditions of the plant considered before the final implementation risk assessment needs to be conducted to minimize the risk on plant performance following the implementation monitoring is still required to fully verify the effects of the mitigation strategy on n2o emissions and pollutants removal performances finally some limitations of this work should be noted in this study n2o was monitored only for a relatively short period of time strong seasonal variations of n2o emissions from wwtps have been repeatedly observed and reported chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 therefore the quantification of the n2o emissions ef 0 89 0 05 and 0 58 0 06 before and after mitigation from the studied plant could be biased previous long term n2o monitoring studies have suggested n2o emissions in autumn are likely in the lower end of a year daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 it is likely that the n2o emissions quantified in this work during autumn is underestimated to represent the plant n2o emissions nevertheless the limitation does not affect the results of this mitigation work two monitoring periods in this study were purposely conducted at the same time of a year to minimize the effects of seasonal variations allowing fair comparisons the successful mitigation of n2o emissions is still valid which was further confirmed with the reconfirmation monitoring campaign in addition the n2o mitigation strategies investigated and implemented in this study may not be the only or best option and other strategies could also be effective for example implementing intermittent feeding may also effectively reduce n2o emissions su et al 2017 4 conclusions this study demonstrated a systematic approach for mitigating n2o emissions from a full scale wwtp the n2o emissions from the full scale sbr were quantified with multiple floating hoods and significant spatial variations of n2o emissions were observed it suggested multiple hood setup is essential to capture spatial variations in full scale sbr quantification the proposed mitigation was permanently implemented in the full scale sbr resulting in 35 reduction in n2o emissions ef 0 89 0 05 vs 0 58 0 06 equivalent to annual reduction of 2 35 tonne of n2o in the studied wwtp i e 729 6 tonne of co2 in a 100 year horizon observed n2o reduction could be attributed to less generations from the nh2oh oxidation pathway due to the lower do level through this study a few uncertainties that prevented the implementation of n2o mitigations in full scale plants were addressed it showcased the mitigation of n2o emissions at full scale is feasible and the knowledge obtained from laboratory investigations in many aspects is applicable widely accepted n2o mitigation strategies developed in laboratory studies are likely also effective at full scale plants in addition a multi pathway n2o model prediction was implemented and validated at a full scale wwtp ef 0 58 vs 0 55 measured vs predicted it showed that the n2o mathematical model developed in laboratories is also a useful tool to evaluate n2o mitigation strategies and consequences to nutrient removal performances at full scale it is also important the study demonstrated that n2o mitigation does not necessarily incur additional operational cost or affect nutrient removal performances in fact the n2o mitigation was achieved with reduced operational costs in this study due to 20 savings in aeration energy consumption finally with the knowledge acquired in this study a standard approach for mitigating n2o emissions covering monitoring quantification analyses evaluation and implementation was proposed to guide the mitigation of n2o emissions in full scale wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17586,numerous experimental studies have identified a multi step reaction mechanism to control arsenite as iii oxidation by manganese mn oxides the studies highlighted the importance of edge sites and intermediate processes e g surface passivation by reaction products however the identified reaction mechanism and controlling factors have rarely been evaluated in a quantitative context in this study a process based modeling framework was developed to delineate and quantify the relative contributions and rates of the different processes affecting as iii oxidation by mn oxides the model development and parameterization were constrained by experimental observations from literature studies involving environmentally relevant mn oxides at circumneutral ph using both batch and stirred flow reactors our modeling results highlight the importance of a transitional phase solely evident in the stirred flow experiments where as iii oxidation gradually shifts from fast reacting mn iv to slowly reacting mn iii edge sites the relative abundance of these edge sites was the most important factor controlling the oxidation rate whereas surface passivation restricted oxidation only in the stirred flow experiment the mn iii edge sites were demonstrated to play a crucial role in the oxidation and therefore in controlling the long term fate of as this study provided an improved understanding of mn oxide reactivity and the significance in the cycling of redox sensitive metal loid s in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese oxide arsenic process based modeling surface complexation model edge sites surface passivation 1 introduction manganese mn oxides play a key role in the cycling of redox sensitive metal loid s in the environment due to their high redox potential and ubiquitous presence in soils and sediments jenne 1968 post 1999 yao and millero 1996 mn oxides are also preferred for their strong adsorption and oxidizing properties in treatment of wastewater effluent containing heavy metal ions dyes pesticides leachates oil spills and pharmaceuticals de rudder et al 2004 du et al 2020 husnain et al 2020 song et al 2019 their effect on arsenic as cycling has been studied extensively in both natural environments takamatsu et al 1985 and water treatment driehaus et al 1995 gude et al 2017 because of the health threat that as contaminated groundwater poses globally fendorf et al 2010 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 perhaps the most relevant impact on as cycling occurs when mn oxides oxidize the more toxic and arguably more mobile arsenite as iii to arsenate as v bai et al 2016 huling et al 2017 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 tamaki and frankenberger 1992 the oxidation is known to follow a multi step mechanism which involves complex interactions of as iii with the surface of mn oxides via adsorption desorption and surface bound oxidation manning et al 2002 nesbitt et al 1998 scott and morgan 1995 tournassat et al 2002 mn oxides of different structure and or particle size have variable reactivity towards as iii oxidation schacht and ginder vogel 2018 both layered and tunneled structures are common mn oxides in the environment however the layered structures are much more abundant than the tunneled ones in most environments probably due to enhanced stability of the former by adsorption of divalent metal cations yang et al 2019 furthermore structural defects are common in layered mn oxides and contribute to distinct mineral properties specifically mn iii substitutions in the mineral lattice affect the average mn oxidation number amon while mn vacancies in the layer serve as vacancy sorption sites which have strong affinity for adsorption of metal ions variations in particle sizes control the specific surface area ssa and affect the number of edge sites that are also important adsorption sites although the point of zero charge pzc of mn oxides is generally low the pzc of edge sites is expected to be higher than that of vacancy sites peacock and sherman 2007 tonkin et al 2004 villalobos 2015 thus under most environmentally relevant ph conditions vacancy sites carry a highly negative charge while the edge sites have a variable charge depending on the ph and the oxidation state of mn mn iii versus mn iv as a result while m n 2 can adsorb on both edge and vacancy sites wang et al 2019 as iii and as v oxyanions adsorb only on the edge sites tournassat et al 2002 furthermore mn iv is considered to adsorb and oxidize as iii more strongly than mn iii and therefore an increasing extent of mn iii substitutions can reduce mn oxide oxidative reactivity this behavior is also observed for uranium wang et al 2013 but is in contrast to the importance of mn iii availability in oxidation of chromium and phenolic compounds hu et al 2019 qian et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2000 accordingly layered mn iv oxides with a high edge site density and a low fraction of mn iii substitutions are most reactive towards as iii oxidation one of the suggested oxidation pathways lafferty et al 2010a b involves as iii being adsorbed on the edge sites via a double corner sharing also known as bidentate binuclear surface complex zhu et al 2009 and then oxidized to as v thereby producing intermediate mn iii edge sites subsequent adsorption and oxidation of as iii on the mn iii edge sites produces as v and mn ii lafferty et al 2010a manning et al 2002 nesbitt et al 1998 scott and morgan 1995 zhu et al 2009 while simultaneously exposing new mn iv edge sites thereby allowing the oxidation to proceed further scott and morgan 1995 meanwhile the reaction products as v and mn ii may suppress the accessibility of the edge sites to as iii a process known as surface passivation this may occur through competitive sorption and or by formation of mn ii as v precipitates or ternary surface complexes tournassat et al 2002 zhu et al 2009 an alternate oxidation pathway has also been suggested lafferty et al 2010a 2010b which involves an additional process known as comproportionation to produce surface mn iii from oxidation of adsorbed mn ii by mn iv on either edge or vacancy sites lafferty et al 2010b wang et al 2019 2018 zhao et al 2016 although many aspects of the multi step reaction mechanism have been discussed in the literature we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the as iii oxidation kinetics and how they are influenced by the inter relationships between the various reaction steps for instance changes to the abundance of initially present mn iv and intermediately formed mn iii sites and their effect on as iii oxidation rate are vastly unknown the extent and contributing species of surface passivation is also ill defined at certain ph values edge sites may become unavailable for as iii adsorption or favor adsorption of competing solutes thus enhancing surface passivation effects until now the effects of ph on as iii oxidation rates have never been quantified many previous studies rathi et al 2017a stollenwerk et al 2007 wallis et al 2010 ying et al 2011 that quantified oxidation rates lumped all steps into a single stoichiometric reaction oscarson et al 1980 that follows a first order rate law with respect to as iii concentration in solution 1 mn o 2 s h 3 as o 3 h m n 2 h 2 aso 4 h 2 o 2 r a s i i i a s i i i t k o b s h 3 as o 3 however given the complexity of the mechanism the often strong temporal variations of the rates and the varying factors that can be rate controlling under changing geochemical conditions it is not surprising that the values of the reported empirical rate constant kobs range over several orders of magnitude among different studies even when they were all conducted with batch reactors schacht and ginder vogel 2018 empirical models while sometimes useful are generally unable to provide mechanistic insights to the reaction mechanism and apart from a few exceptions amirbahman et al 2006 feng et al 2018 no attempts have been made to develop more comprehensive models in contrast to empirical models process based models are substantially better equipped to support the identification and delineation of the various interdependent factors that may affect the fate of as iii during its oxidation by mn oxides schacht and ginder vogel 2018 such as as iii adsorption desorption and oxidation on mn oxide surface sites reactivity of different types of mn oxides ph and the role of competitive solutes to adequately quantify adsorption desorption reactions surface complexation models scms have proven to be a powerful tool to integrate information on mineral surface areas sorption site densities and surface charge effects with respect to ph while also considering the impacts from different competing species davis and kent 1990 liu et al 2019 however at present the challenge of developing scms that describe the adsorption desorption of as iii as v and mn ii on edge and vacancy sites of mn oxides is that most of the parameters including the required surface complexation constants are not readily available in the literature selecting appropriate experimental data from the literature and calibrating the numerical model against those data using suitable optimization methods can help derive these valuable parameters the end result will be a quantitative framework which elucidates the reaction mechanism and can be used to analyze future experiments and to further evaluate the proposed reaction mechanism prommer et al 2019 the main objective of this study therefore was i to develop a process based data constrained framework to assess the adequacy of a conceptual model describing as iii oxidation by layered mn oxides and ii to quantitatively evaluate the role of edge sites and surface passivation on the oxidation rate under circumneutral ph conditions in this study we focus on the analysis of laboratory experiments from the literature that were conducted over an extended duration and with synthetic layered mn oxides which are considered a suitable analog to natural mn oxides and at ph values most relevant to natural groundwater systems lafferty et al 2011 2010a villalobos et al 2014 2 materials and method 2 1 modeling approach and procedure the modeling procedure started with the development of a conceptual model that based on our survey of the current literature incorporates the potentially relevant details of the reaction mechanism fig 1 subsequently the assembled conceptual model was evaluated against the most suitable literature datasets this was achieved by translating the conceptual model of the reaction processes into a numerical model and by comparing the simulated concentrations with the corresponding experimental observations the numerical implementation required i the spatial and temporal discretization of the considered lab experiments ii the definition of an adequate reaction network consisting of a mixture of equilibrium and kinetically controlled geochemical reactions and iii a calibration of adjustable model parameters in conjunction with a successive refinement of the proposed conceptual model 2 2 conceptual model and numerical implementation to isolate the specific role of mn oxide edge surfaces for as iii oxidation we separated the total concentration of mn oxide into edge cedge and bulk cbulk components accordingly the edge both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i and the vacancy m n v a c a n c y i v sites are stoichiometrically linked with the temporally varying concentrations of cedge and cbulk respectively in this study we focus on one of the suggested oxidation pathways in which as iii is adsorbed on the edge sites via bidentate binuclear surface complexation tables 1 and 2 once adsorbed as iii is oxidized to as v on m n e d g e i v sites at the rate defined as 3 r 1 a s i i i t k 1 m n e d g e i v o 2 a s i i i o h simultaneously the m n e d g e i v sites are transformed into m n e d g e i i i sites where as iii also adsorbs and is oxidized at the rate 4 r 2 a s i i i t k 2 m n e d g e i i i o 2 a s i i i o h where k 1 and k 2 are the first order rate constant s 1 and m n e d g e i v o 2 a s i i i o h and m n e d g e i i i o 2 a s i i i o h are adsorbed concentrations of as iii on mn iv and mn iii edge sites mol l 1 respectively adsorbed as iii concentrations are quantified through a scm which incorporates the effects of mn oxide mineral reactivity solution ph aqueous as iii speciation and competitive sorption by other solutes coupled to the oxidation the reductive dissolution of mn oxides occurs on the mineral edge where m n e d g e i i i sites are reduced to aqueous mn ii and cause cedge to decrease this step also triggers the exposure of a new edge surface on cbulk that hosts new m n e d g e i v sites fig 1 this was numerically implemented by transferring the corresponding amounts of mn oxide from cbulk to cedge at a rate proportional to the rate of as iii oxidation that occurs on the m n e d g e i i i sites eq 4 5 c b u l k t k 3 r 2 where the dimensionless proportionality term k 3 can range between 0 and 1 a value of 1 corresponds to ideal stoichiometric mineral dissolution where a pair of m n e d g e i v sites is exposed to allow as iii adsorption via bidentate binuclear surface complexation and subsequent oxidation zhu et al 2009 accordingly a value of less than 1 for k 3 represents an irregular unordered arrangement of newly exposed m n e d g e i v sites which would impede as iii adsorption and oxidation to consider potential surface passivation from reaction products surface complexation reactions of as v on m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites were included in the reaction network tables 1 and 2 at circumneutral ph adsorption of mn ii is favored on negatively charged m n v a c a n c y i v sites over m n e d g e i v sites simanova et al 2015 mn ii adsorption on positively charged m n e d g e i i i sites was assumed negligible at circumneutral ph and therefore not considered in the reaction network ramstedt et al 2004 based on potential surface passivation pathways identified in previous studies jiang et al 2013 moore et al 1990 tournassat et al 2002 formation of mn ii as v precipitates such as a krautite like mineral mnhaso 4 h 2 o and mn ii as v ternary complexes on either m n e d g e i v or m n v a c a n c y i v sites were also investigated in the modeling framework tables 1 and 3 2 3 experimental datasets for conceptual model evaluation numerous experimental studies varying in terms of their experimental setups and conditions have investigated many details of the as iii oxidation via mn oxides among those we selected a subset of studies lafferty et al 2011 2010a villalobos et al 2014 that provided suitable data to elucidate and quantify the role of edge sites and surface passivation on oxidation rates under circumneutral ph conditions these studies were carried out i with different layered mn oxide types δ mno2 and acid birnessite and ssas 39 114 and 273 m2 g 1 ii at different ph values 6 0 and 7 2 iii with fixed batch and temporally varying inputs stirred flow of either aqueous as iii as v or mn ii iv as oxidation or adsorption desorption experiments and v at extended experiment durations 24 and 48 h the available data showed pronounced temporal variations in the measured aqueous concentrations of as iii as v and mn ii and in the calculated concentrations of aqueous and adsorbed total as the measured aqueous concentrations derived from the adsorption oxidation experiments using both stirred flow and batch setups were used for calibration of the numerical model table 4 whereas the remainder of the dataset was used for verification of the calibrated model table 5 2 4 numerical modeling tools and calibration a total of four stirred flow and five batch experiments were simulated in this study using a common set of model parameters among the employed model parameters we distinguished between the ones that must be fundamentally similar for all experiments and those that may differ between experiments depending on experimental setups and conditions the former included surface complexation constants and site densities the equilibrium constants were derived from the calibration of the stirred flow model and where appropriate modified based on their ssa and site density according to the approach described by sverjensky 2003 and further elaborated for scms that include bidentate adsorption by wang and giammar 2013 the two reaction rate constants k 1 and k 2 were consistent across all batch experiments but differed from those calibrated for the stirred flow experiments this difference was introduced to account for potential differences in the solution saturation state that could arise between the two types of reactors due to the accumulation of reaction products within batch systems which can affect dissolution kinetics kraemer and hering 1997 the other two calibrated parameters the proportionality term k 3 and the edge concentration cedge varied across the experiments as mineral properties of different mn oxides varied between the studies all batch simulations were performed with phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 while the stirred flow experiments were simulated with modflow harbaugh 2005 and pht3d prommer et al 2003 to account for flow and reactive processes respectively the standard wateq4f database ball and nordstrom 1991 was used as a starting point for the reaction network definition to which our newly defined reactions were added for example the edge m n e d g e i v and vacancy m n v a c a n c y i v sites were defined in the database and their protonation deprotonation constants pka were adopted from the literature for birnessite peacock and sherman 2007 tonkin et al 2004 whereas the values for m n e d g e i i i sites were adopted from the constants provided for manganite ramstedt et al 2004 and not varied any further table 3 edge and vacancy site densities reported in a birnessite study villalobos 2015 were used as starting values and subsequently varied during model calibration table 1 as iii and as v were decoupled from the global redox equilibrium and their redox transformations were kinetically controlled the scm was restricted to considering only the chemical contribution towards the overall adsorption and the electrostatic effects on the complexation were ignored this was because the ssa of end basal planes and edge surface of a mn oxide particle cannot be determined separately villalobos et al 2014 which is required for the calculation of surface charge on vacancy and edge sites in a scm similar to many published modeling studies rathi et al 2017b a stolze et al 2019 sun et al 2018 given that reactants were sufficiently mixed stirred in the investigated experimental systems all surface complexation reactions were assumed to be sufficiently fast such that the local equilibrium assumption bahr and rubin 1987 was valid initial estimates of the reaction constants for as iii as v and mn ii surface complexation on respective sites were estimated via manual calibration and further optimized during an automated calibration step the solubility product of the mn ii as v precipitate krautite and the constants for mn ii as v solution complexes were set to literature values tournassat et al 2002 and not varied any further table 3 each model calibration run included multiple model simulations where each simulation corresponded to one of the oxidation experiments table 4 we employed initially a manual trial and error step followed by an automatic calibration step using the heuristic particle swarm optimization pso coello et al 2004 eberhart and kennedy 1995 kennedy et al 2001 algorithm pso was chosen because it has previously been shown to be a suitable method for dealing with the non linearity of complex geochemical models jamieson et al 2018 prommer et al 2018 rathi et al 2017a b sun et al 2018 the pso code was written within the pest platform using the panther run manager and linked with phreeqc pht3d siade et al 2019 the 12 parameters to be estimated included surface complexation constants for as iii as v mn ii and mn ii as v ternary complexes oxidation rate constants k 1 and k 2 proportionality term k 3 surface site densities sedge and svacancy and cedge tables 1 and 2 calibration was achieved by minimizing the objective function defined as the sum of squared residuals between all observations from the considered experiments table 4 and their model simulated equivalents the calibrated model was further verified against the observations from various stirred flow and batch experiments table 5 lafferty et al 2011 2010a villalobos et al 2014 finally the parameter estimates from pso calibration were used as initial values for a linearized parameter uncertainty analysis using pest doherty 2015 rathi et al 2017b rawson et al 2017 further details are provided in table 1 3 results 3 1 quantification of as iii oxidation rates the final calibrated models closely replicated the observations from as iii oxidation experiments conducted using both stirred flow table 4 and fig 2 a and batch setups table 4 and fig 3 a moreover they also reproduced all observations available from the oxidation and adsorption experiments table 5 for the purpose of model verification figs 2a and 4 the model based analysis demonstrated that the as iii oxidation rates show two distinct phases in the batch experiments but three distinct phases in the stirred flow experiments phase i was identified in all of the analyzed experiments and characterized by fast as iii oxidation during phase i high solution as iii saturated the sorption sites and was completely oxidized and released into the solution as as v the length of phase i ranged between only a few minutes to a few hours figs 2a and 3a the amount of cedge regulated the duration of phase i and the experimental data within this phase were critical for the estimation of cedge the variations in the model estimated values for cedge among the different experiments reflect the differences in the initial concentrations and types of mn oxides used figs 2b and 3 when the same initial concentration but different mn oxides were used table 2 cedge was higher for δ mno2 compared to acid birnessite due to the higher edge surface area villalobos et al 2014 of δ mno2 on the other hand when different amounts of the same mn oxide were used e g table 2 b1 vs b2 higher cedge values reflected higher initial concentrations of the mineral added in the experiments however for a given type of mn oxide the proportion of cedge on the mineral was comparable irrespective of the experimental setup tables 1 and 2 in the stirred flow oxidation experiment as determined by oxalate titration villalobos et al 2003 the amon of δ mno2 was 3 95 lafferty et al 2010a therefore cedge in the numerical model was assigned to host 95 of m n e d g e i v and 5 of m n e d g e i i i sites at the start of the experiment during phase i m n e d g e i v sites were reduced to m n e d g e i i i sites and no mn ii was produced fig 2a in conjunction with the reductive transformation the amon decreased to 3 80 fig s1 common to all experiments the end of phase i was marked by a distinct decrease in the overall oxidation rate figs 2c and s1b in the stirred flow experiment phase i was followed by a transition phase phase ii where as iii oxidation gradually shifted from fast reacting m n e d g e i v to slow reacting m n e d g e i i i sites this caused the overall oxidation rate to decrease significantly figs 2c during this transition small amounts of as iii remained adsorbed on m n e d g e i i i sites fig 2f due to the significantly slower oxidation rates this can explain the observed temporary decrease in total dissolved as concentrations fig 2a phase ii lasted for a relatively short period from t 4 h to 10 h in the stirred flow experiment the duration of phase ii depended upon the availability of both the initially present m n e d g e i v sites and the newly formed m n e d g e i i i sites on cedge fig 2e and f during phase ii the m n e d g e i i i sites were slowly reduced to mn ii causing mineral dissolution on the edge surface while a new edge surface on cbulk was exposed which hosted new m n e d g e i v sites however the amount of newly exposed edge sites was only 67 of the parent edge sites k 3 0 67 with relative uncertainty variance reduction of 85 1 table 1 i e a net decrease of cedge occurred slower oxidation of as iii produced lower amounts of as v in solution while mn ii was gradually produced and a fraction of it was adsorbed first on m n v a c a n c y i v sites and then on m n e d g e i v sites fig 2e and g the amon of δ mno2 dropped to 3 72 during phase ii since the slow reactivity of the m n e d g e i i i sites promoted an accumulation of mn iii on the mineral edge surface fig s1 finally phase iii in the stirred flow experiment was identifiable by a relatively constant oxidation rate that occurred when the continuous as iii bearing influent to the reactor started to reach a steady state with the overall as iii oxidation on both m n e d g e i i i and new m n e d g e i v sites hence effluent as iii as v and mn ii concentrations remained constant during phase iii dissolution of δ mno2 continued on the edge surface as indicated by the steady decrease in cedge value corresponding to the achieved steady state amon of δ mno2 did not change any further during phase iii fig s1 in contrast no transition phase ii was identified during any of the as iii oxidation batch experiments instead there was a direct transition from phase i to a steady rate phase that resembled phase iii of the stirred flow experiment fig 3 based on the model simulations the absence of phase ii can be attributed either to low initial as iii concentrations table 4 b2 or as in b1 and b3 to the low initial amount of mn oxide during phase i all m n e d g e i v sites on cedge collectively oxidized as iii and were themselves reduced to m n e d g e i i i sites subsequently in phase iii oxidation was dominated on m n e d g e i i i sites with only minor contributions from the new m n e d g e i v sites 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling the rate of as iii oxidation 4 1 1 type and abundance of edge sites the type of edge sites m n e d g e i v or m n e d g e i i i and their abundances on mn oxides were found to be the two most important factors that determine as iii oxidation rate this is best seen in the simulation of the stirred flow experiment where the abundance of fast reacting m n e d g e i v sites decreased considerably after phase i while that of slow reacting m n e d g e i i i sites started to increase during phase ii during phase iii m n e d g e i i i sites were more abundant than m n e d g e i v sites but both edge sites gradually depleted at a steady rate fig 2e and f accordingly as iii oxidation rates were highest when a large number of m n e d g e i v sites was available phase i modest for a combination of both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites phase ii and lowest when m n e d g e i i i sites were predominant phase iii fig 2c in contrast the simulations of the batch experiments showed that as iii oxidation over most of the experimental duration was controlled by the abundance of only m n e d g e i i i sites while the influence of m n e d g e i v sites was only visible during the short phase i the simulations of the batch experiments showed that either most of the added as iii was oxidized within phase i by an excess amount of initially available m n e d g e i v sites or conversely excess as iii completely reduced m n e d g e i v to m n e d g e i i i sites during phase i before oxidation continued on the remaining m n e d g e i i i sites fig 3 during phases ii and iii of the stirred flow oxidation experiment our model simulation showed a disparity in the rates of exposing new cedge versus dissolution of the parent cedge as indicated by an estimated value of 0 67 for k 3 table 1 this could be interpreted as having only two out of every three newly exposed m n e d g e i v sites present adjacent to each other to allow for as iii adsorption to occur via a bidentate binuclear surface complex this reduced efficiency could be a result of the difference in the as iii oxidation rates between m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites which causes accumulation of m n e d g e i i i sites compared to m n e d g e i v as a result a new m n e d g e i v site can become isolated on the new edge surface jeopardizing their as iii oxidation ability fig 1 the value of k 3 also appears to be a function of the mineral ssa in the batch experiments k 3 ranged between 0 20 and 0 27 for acid birnessite with an ssa of 39 m2 g 1 while it was 0 78 for δ mno2 with an ssa of 114 m2 g 1 table 2 furthermore the lower oxidation rate on m n e d g e i i i sites might have led to a longer retention time of adsorbed as iii on these sites before undergoing oxidation this hypothesis was supported by the temporary decrease in the total dissolved as concentrations that is apparent during phase ii of the stirred flow oxidation experiment fig 2 to test this hypothesis we used the calibrated model to simulate a stirred flow adsorption oxidation desorption experiment table 5 sf2 lafferty et al 2011 in this experiment the as iii bearing influent was switched over to an as iii free background electrolyte after 24 h to initiate a desorption phase the dilution curve suggested a lag time of 3 h for the influent to fully saturate the reactor arsenic speciation analysis on the collected samples showed that as associated with δ mno2 was present as as v and no as iii was observed in the effluent during the desorption phase lafferty et al 2011 however our model simulation suggested that as associated with δ mno2 would temporarily remain as as iii the adsorbed as iii was then oxidized to as v over the lag time of dilution during the desorption phase fig 4a and before the ex situ solid phase as speciation analysis with exafs was performed 4 1 2 surface passivation the model simulations of the stirred flow experiment showed that passivation of m n e d g e i v sites by as v was minor and occurred only during phase i fig 2e during phase ii mn ii saturated the m n v a c a n c y i v sites which contributed to its delayed release into the solution subsequently mn ii competed with both as iii and as v for adsorption on m n e d g e i v sites fig 2e and g since m n e d g e i v sites are mostly negatively charged m n e d g e i v o at ph 7 20 peacock and sherman 2007 tonkin et al 2004 adsorption of mn ii is favored over neutral as iii h 3 aso 3 and negatively charged as v h a s o 4 2 species after 9 h into the experiment coverage by total adsorbed mn ii with respect to the total amount of sorption sites 36 exceeded that of as iii and as v combined 30 surface passivation by mn ii was exclusively responsible for restricting as iii oxidation on new m n e d g e i v sites limiting further production of m n e d g e i i i sites and thereby regulating the overall duration of phase ii interestingly based on the model simulations passivation of positively charged m n e d g e i i i sites by as v oxyanions was minor fig 2f this was in contrast to the expected higher affinity of negatively charged as v compared to the neutral as iii species at ph 7 20 ramstedt et al 2004 zhu et al 2009 the continuous influx of high as iii concentrations into the reactor might have prevented competitive adsorption of as v during phases ii and iii in contrast to the stirred flow experiments surface passivation by either as v or mn ii was not apparent in the batch experiments this is because early in these experiments as iii oxidation transitioned directly into phase iii during phase iii mn oxides predominantly hosted m n e d g e i i i sites which were saturated by as iii fig 3c and d potential surface passivation by krautite and mn ii as v ternary surface complexes was also evaluated using the literature value for the solubility product of krautite tournassat et al 2002 our simulations showed that krautite never reached saturation in any of the experiments analyzed therefore surface passivation by krautite most likely only occurs at extremely high concentrations of mn ii and as v which are rarely seen in environmental settings as there are no surface complexation constants available for the mn ii as v ternary surface complexes they were treated as adjustable during model calibration but found to be insensitive with respect to the employed observation data table 1 therefore surface passivation by mn ii as v ternary surface complexes could not be quantified in this study 4 2 parameter sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 manual sensitivity analysis for selected parameters additional model runs were conducted with one of the parameters being adjusted by a small amount 20 from its calibrated value while keeping the remaining parameters consistent with the calibrated model the results of the model simulations for four key parameters show that they affect as iii oxidation during different phases fig 5 for example the effect of rate constant k 1 was visible only during oxidation phase ii when the amount of adsorbed as on m n e d g e i v sites is comparable to k 1 eq 3 and fig 2e similarly the effects of the rate constant k 2 were visible only during phase iii interestingly the influence of the proportionality term k 3 is visible only during the tail end of phase iii after the rate of oxidation on m n e d g e i i i sites surpasses that on m n e d g e i v sites fig 2c this suggests that k 3 has a direct effect on the long term oxidation rate of as iii finally the influence of the edge component cedge on oxidation is visible only after as iii is predominantly adsorbed on m n e d g e i i i sites i e during phase ii and iii fig 2e and f 4 2 2 parameter uncertainty variance reduction beside the manual sensitivity analysis an automatic linearized uncertainty analysis based on local parameter sensitivities was also conducted for the simulation of the stirred flow experiments although due to the highly nonlinear nature of the simulated processes the results of this linearized statistical analysis should be interpreted with caution the analysis was able to recognize the parameters that were well constrained by the selected datasets and those that were less constrained or insensitive during model calibration table 1 the insensitive parameters included surface complexation constant of as v on m n e d g e i i i log k5 and ternary surface complexes on m n e d g e i v log k9 and m n v a c a n c y i v log k10 sites although these insensitive parameters did not influence the model outcomes under the tested experimental conditions the possibility of these processes playing a role under other conditions cannot be ruled out in addition the parameter describing surface complexation of mn ii on m n v a c a n c y i v sites log k6 was sensitive but its low reduction in relative uncertainty i e 14 2 suggests that the reported parameter value was not uniquely identifiable table 1 this implies that this parameter can potentially take on a range of values while still achieving a good model calibration however this parameter s sensitivity is relatively low compared to the other parameters indicating that its low reduction in posterior variance is not likely due to the correlation that results from overparameterization these results demonstrate that inverse problem for this study was relatively well determined furthermore sensitivity analysis of the stirred flow model indicated a strong negative correlation between several parameters that represent competing processes for example negative correlation between the surface complexation constants for as iii log k1 and mn ii log k3 on m n e d g e i v sites table s1 is understandable because both species compete for sorption on these sites 5 conclusions using a process based modeling approach this study evaluated a conceptual model that reflects the widely accepted mechanisms for as iii oxidation by mn oxides based on the modeling results the rate of as iii oxidation by mn oxides is controlled by the accessibility to both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites and by surface passivation from mn ii a transitional phase ii which was clearly identified in the stirred flow experiment but not in the batch system represents a period when as iii oxidation gradually shifts from fast reacting m n e d g e i v to slowly reacting m n e d g e i i i sites under conditions typical of natural groundwater systems with flow oxidation of aqueous as iii by mn oxides may also follow a three phase reaction mechanism our modeling results suggest that several previous studies that used a batch reactor setup possibly overestimated the importance of m n e d g e i v sites for as iii oxidation these sites were only responsible for as iii oxidation during a brief initial phase subsequently oxidation occurs predominantly on m n e d g e i i i sites at slow rates allowing for retention of adsorbed as iii in contrast a stirred flow reactor setup in which reactant concentrations are additionally affected by flow rates is generally more relevant for studying natural groundwater systems or a water treatment plant and allows for a more detailed inspection of the complex reaction network based on the dataset from the stirred flow experiment a three phase as iii oxidation mechanism has been identified which is driven by the accessibility to both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites and regulated by solution ph and surface passivation from mn ii the abundance of m n e d g e i v sites corresponds to rapid oxidation while that of m n e d g e i i i sites would correspond to adsorption and steady but slower oxidation despite the good agreement of our model simulations with the tested literature datasets a universal applicability of the derived parameters such as oxidation rate constants is not prudent because several model parameters were insensitive and one model parameter was not well constrained in this study to reduce uncertainty in the model conceptualization and parameter values and to improve robustness and wider applicability continued research effort from both experimentalists and modelers is clearly required nonetheless the numerical model presented here derived several hypotheses which can assist in the design of future experiments for example model simulations of experiments with δ mno2 and acid birnessite showed that varying particle sizes regulated the value of cedge which in turn means a higher abundance of edge sites this finding could be extended to and verified on other layered and even tunnel structured mn oxides similarly model simulations show that all adsorbed as persisted as as iii for longer on slow reacting m n e d g e i i i sites however the delays in sample collection and measurements might have allowed oxidation of adsorbed as iii to as v before samples were analyzed this hypothesis could be tested with in situ measurements of adsorbed as such as the quick scanning xas technique ginder vogel et al 2009 furthermore the current model framework can be extended to study the reactivity of other mn oxides e g tunnel structured or mn oxides with impurity power et al 2005 effects of competing solutes e g fe ii wu et al 2015 other redox sensitive pollutants e g cr eary and rai 1987 and micro organic pollutants furgal et al 2014 as well as effects of a wider range of solution ph wu et al 2015 and comproportionation lafferty et al 2010b wang et al 2019 2018 zhao et al 2016 the extended model s can be subsequently used to design new experiments where the experimental conditions can be optimized and the most informative data sampling campaign can be determined ahead of time growing application of mn oxides in wastewater treatment husnain et al 2020 demands that future work should be expanded towards analysis of experiments where raw influent is treated with mn oxides however due to a more complex matrix numerous constituents in the raw water would compete for reactions with mn oxides and therefore a detailed knowledge of each reaction mechanism will be required for the development of a numerical model our present study represents an important milestone towards this goal and the numerical model developed here could assist with the design of new experiments for the purpose of gaining the required insight into the mechanism of mn oxide reaction with various raw water constituents declaration of

17586,numerous experimental studies have identified a multi step reaction mechanism to control arsenite as iii oxidation by manganese mn oxides the studies highlighted the importance of edge sites and intermediate processes e g surface passivation by reaction products however the identified reaction mechanism and controlling factors have rarely been evaluated in a quantitative context in this study a process based modeling framework was developed to delineate and quantify the relative contributions and rates of the different processes affecting as iii oxidation by mn oxides the model development and parameterization were constrained by experimental observations from literature studies involving environmentally relevant mn oxides at circumneutral ph using both batch and stirred flow reactors our modeling results highlight the importance of a transitional phase solely evident in the stirred flow experiments where as iii oxidation gradually shifts from fast reacting mn iv to slowly reacting mn iii edge sites the relative abundance of these edge sites was the most important factor controlling the oxidation rate whereas surface passivation restricted oxidation only in the stirred flow experiment the mn iii edge sites were demonstrated to play a crucial role in the oxidation and therefore in controlling the long term fate of as this study provided an improved understanding of mn oxide reactivity and the significance in the cycling of redox sensitive metal loid s in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese oxide arsenic process based modeling surface complexation model edge sites surface passivation 1 introduction manganese mn oxides play a key role in the cycling of redox sensitive metal loid s in the environment due to their high redox potential and ubiquitous presence in soils and sediments jenne 1968 post 1999 yao and millero 1996 mn oxides are also preferred for their strong adsorption and oxidizing properties in treatment of wastewater effluent containing heavy metal ions dyes pesticides leachates oil spills and pharmaceuticals de rudder et al 2004 du et al 2020 husnain et al 2020 song et al 2019 their effect on arsenic as cycling has been studied extensively in both natural environments takamatsu et al 1985 and water treatment driehaus et al 1995 gude et al 2017 because of the health threat that as contaminated groundwater poses globally fendorf et al 2010 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 perhaps the most relevant impact on as cycling occurs when mn oxides oxidize the more toxic and arguably more mobile arsenite as iii to arsenate as v bai et al 2016 huling et al 2017 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 tamaki and frankenberger 1992 the oxidation is known to follow a multi step mechanism which involves complex interactions of as iii with the surface of mn oxides via adsorption desorption and surface bound oxidation manning et al 2002 nesbitt et al 1998 scott and morgan 1995 tournassat et al 2002 mn oxides of different structure and or particle size have variable reactivity towards as iii oxidation schacht and ginder vogel 2018 both layered and tunneled structures are common mn oxides in the environment however the layered structures are much more abundant than the tunneled ones in most environments probably due to enhanced stability of the former by adsorption of divalent metal cations yang et al 2019 furthermore structural defects are common in layered mn oxides and contribute to distinct mineral properties specifically mn iii substitutions in the mineral lattice affect the average mn oxidation number amon while mn vacancies in the layer serve as vacancy sorption sites which have strong affinity for adsorption of metal ions variations in particle sizes control the specific surface area ssa and affect the number of edge sites that are also important adsorption sites although the point of zero charge pzc of mn oxides is generally low the pzc of edge sites is expected to be higher than that of vacancy sites peacock and sherman 2007 tonkin et al 2004 villalobos 2015 thus under most environmentally relevant ph conditions vacancy sites carry a highly negative charge while the edge sites have a variable charge depending on the ph and the oxidation state of mn mn iii versus mn iv as a result while m n 2 can adsorb on both edge and vacancy sites wang et al 2019 as iii and as v oxyanions adsorb only on the edge sites tournassat et al 2002 furthermore mn iv is considered to adsorb and oxidize as iii more strongly than mn iii and therefore an increasing extent of mn iii substitutions can reduce mn oxide oxidative reactivity this behavior is also observed for uranium wang et al 2013 but is in contrast to the importance of mn iii availability in oxidation of chromium and phenolic compounds hu et al 2019 qian et al 2019 nico and zasoski 2000 accordingly layered mn iv oxides with a high edge site density and a low fraction of mn iii substitutions are most reactive towards as iii oxidation one of the suggested oxidation pathways lafferty et al 2010a b involves as iii being adsorbed on the edge sites via a double corner sharing also known as bidentate binuclear surface complex zhu et al 2009 and then oxidized to as v thereby producing intermediate mn iii edge sites subsequent adsorption and oxidation of as iii on the mn iii edge sites produces as v and mn ii lafferty et al 2010a manning et al 2002 nesbitt et al 1998 scott and morgan 1995 zhu et al 2009 while simultaneously exposing new mn iv edge sites thereby allowing the oxidation to proceed further scott and morgan 1995 meanwhile the reaction products as v and mn ii may suppress the accessibility of the edge sites to as iii a process known as surface passivation this may occur through competitive sorption and or by formation of mn ii as v precipitates or ternary surface complexes tournassat et al 2002 zhu et al 2009 an alternate oxidation pathway has also been suggested lafferty et al 2010a 2010b which involves an additional process known as comproportionation to produce surface mn iii from oxidation of adsorbed mn ii by mn iv on either edge or vacancy sites lafferty et al 2010b wang et al 2019 2018 zhao et al 2016 although many aspects of the multi step reaction mechanism have been discussed in the literature we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the as iii oxidation kinetics and how they are influenced by the inter relationships between the various reaction steps for instance changes to the abundance of initially present mn iv and intermediately formed mn iii sites and their effect on as iii oxidation rate are vastly unknown the extent and contributing species of surface passivation is also ill defined at certain ph values edge sites may become unavailable for as iii adsorption or favor adsorption of competing solutes thus enhancing surface passivation effects until now the effects of ph on as iii oxidation rates have never been quantified many previous studies rathi et al 2017a stollenwerk et al 2007 wallis et al 2010 ying et al 2011 that quantified oxidation rates lumped all steps into a single stoichiometric reaction oscarson et al 1980 that follows a first order rate law with respect to as iii concentration in solution 1 mn o 2 s h 3 as o 3 h m n 2 h 2 aso 4 h 2 o 2 r a s i i i a s i i i t k o b s h 3 as o 3 however given the complexity of the mechanism the often strong temporal variations of the rates and the varying factors that can be rate controlling under changing geochemical conditions it is not surprising that the values of the reported empirical rate constant kobs range over several orders of magnitude among different studies even when they were all conducted with batch reactors schacht and ginder vogel 2018 empirical models while sometimes useful are generally unable to provide mechanistic insights to the reaction mechanism and apart from a few exceptions amirbahman et al 2006 feng et al 2018 no attempts have been made to develop more comprehensive models in contrast to empirical models process based models are substantially better equipped to support the identification and delineation of the various interdependent factors that may affect the fate of as iii during its oxidation by mn oxides schacht and ginder vogel 2018 such as as iii adsorption desorption and oxidation on mn oxide surface sites reactivity of different types of mn oxides ph and the role of competitive solutes to adequately quantify adsorption desorption reactions surface complexation models scms have proven to be a powerful tool to integrate information on mineral surface areas sorption site densities and surface charge effects with respect to ph while also considering the impacts from different competing species davis and kent 1990 liu et al 2019 however at present the challenge of developing scms that describe the adsorption desorption of as iii as v and mn ii on edge and vacancy sites of mn oxides is that most of the parameters including the required surface complexation constants are not readily available in the literature selecting appropriate experimental data from the literature and calibrating the numerical model against those data using suitable optimization methods can help derive these valuable parameters the end result will be a quantitative framework which elucidates the reaction mechanism and can be used to analyze future experiments and to further evaluate the proposed reaction mechanism prommer et al 2019 the main objective of this study therefore was i to develop a process based data constrained framework to assess the adequacy of a conceptual model describing as iii oxidation by layered mn oxides and ii to quantitatively evaluate the role of edge sites and surface passivation on the oxidation rate under circumneutral ph conditions in this study we focus on the analysis of laboratory experiments from the literature that were conducted over an extended duration and with synthetic layered mn oxides which are considered a suitable analog to natural mn oxides and at ph values most relevant to natural groundwater systems lafferty et al 2011 2010a villalobos et al 2014 2 materials and method 2 1 modeling approach and procedure the modeling procedure started with the development of a conceptual model that based on our survey of the current literature incorporates the potentially relevant details of the reaction mechanism fig 1 subsequently the assembled conceptual model was evaluated against the most suitable literature datasets this was achieved by translating the conceptual model of the reaction processes into a numerical model and by comparing the simulated concentrations with the corresponding experimental observations the numerical implementation required i the spatial and temporal discretization of the considered lab experiments ii the definition of an adequate reaction network consisting of a mixture of equilibrium and kinetically controlled geochemical reactions and iii a calibration of adjustable model parameters in conjunction with a successive refinement of the proposed conceptual model 2 2 conceptual model and numerical implementation to isolate the specific role of mn oxide edge surfaces for as iii oxidation we separated the total concentration of mn oxide into edge cedge and bulk cbulk components accordingly the edge both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i and the vacancy m n v a c a n c y i v sites are stoichiometrically linked with the temporally varying concentrations of cedge and cbulk respectively in this study we focus on one of the suggested oxidation pathways in which as iii is adsorbed on the edge sites via bidentate binuclear surface complexation tables 1 and 2 once adsorbed as iii is oxidized to as v on m n e d g e i v sites at the rate defined as 3 r 1 a s i i i t k 1 m n e d g e i v o 2 a s i i i o h simultaneously the m n e d g e i v sites are transformed into m n e d g e i i i sites where as iii also adsorbs and is oxidized at the rate 4 r 2 a s i i i t k 2 m n e d g e i i i o 2 a s i i i o h where k 1 and k 2 are the first order rate constant s 1 and m n e d g e i v o 2 a s i i i o h and m n e d g e i i i o 2 a s i i i o h are adsorbed concentrations of as iii on mn iv and mn iii edge sites mol l 1 respectively adsorbed as iii concentrations are quantified through a scm which incorporates the effects of mn oxide mineral reactivity solution ph aqueous as iii speciation and competitive sorption by other solutes coupled to the oxidation the reductive dissolution of mn oxides occurs on the mineral edge where m n e d g e i i i sites are reduced to aqueous mn ii and cause cedge to decrease this step also triggers the exposure of a new edge surface on cbulk that hosts new m n e d g e i v sites fig 1 this was numerically implemented by transferring the corresponding amounts of mn oxide from cbulk to cedge at a rate proportional to the rate of as iii oxidation that occurs on the m n e d g e i i i sites eq 4 5 c b u l k t k 3 r 2 where the dimensionless proportionality term k 3 can range between 0 and 1 a value of 1 corresponds to ideal stoichiometric mineral dissolution where a pair of m n e d g e i v sites is exposed to allow as iii adsorption via bidentate binuclear surface complexation and subsequent oxidation zhu et al 2009 accordingly a value of less than 1 for k 3 represents an irregular unordered arrangement of newly exposed m n e d g e i v sites which would impede as iii adsorption and oxidation to consider potential surface passivation from reaction products surface complexation reactions of as v on m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites were included in the reaction network tables 1 and 2 at circumneutral ph adsorption of mn ii is favored on negatively charged m n v a c a n c y i v sites over m n e d g e i v sites simanova et al 2015 mn ii adsorption on positively charged m n e d g e i i i sites was assumed negligible at circumneutral ph and therefore not considered in the reaction network ramstedt et al 2004 based on potential surface passivation pathways identified in previous studies jiang et al 2013 moore et al 1990 tournassat et al 2002 formation of mn ii as v precipitates such as a krautite like mineral mnhaso 4 h 2 o and mn ii as v ternary complexes on either m n e d g e i v or m n v a c a n c y i v sites were also investigated in the modeling framework tables 1 and 3 2 3 experimental datasets for conceptual model evaluation numerous experimental studies varying in terms of their experimental setups and conditions have investigated many details of the as iii oxidation via mn oxides among those we selected a subset of studies lafferty et al 2011 2010a villalobos et al 2014 that provided suitable data to elucidate and quantify the role of edge sites and surface passivation on oxidation rates under circumneutral ph conditions these studies were carried out i with different layered mn oxide types δ mno2 and acid birnessite and ssas 39 114 and 273 m2 g 1 ii at different ph values 6 0 and 7 2 iii with fixed batch and temporally varying inputs stirred flow of either aqueous as iii as v or mn ii iv as oxidation or adsorption desorption experiments and v at extended experiment durations 24 and 48 h the available data showed pronounced temporal variations in the measured aqueous concentrations of as iii as v and mn ii and in the calculated concentrations of aqueous and adsorbed total as the measured aqueous concentrations derived from the adsorption oxidation experiments using both stirred flow and batch setups were used for calibration of the numerical model table 4 whereas the remainder of the dataset was used for verification of the calibrated model table 5 2 4 numerical modeling tools and calibration a total of four stirred flow and five batch experiments were simulated in this study using a common set of model parameters among the employed model parameters we distinguished between the ones that must be fundamentally similar for all experiments and those that may differ between experiments depending on experimental setups and conditions the former included surface complexation constants and site densities the equilibrium constants were derived from the calibration of the stirred flow model and where appropriate modified based on their ssa and site density according to the approach described by sverjensky 2003 and further elaborated for scms that include bidentate adsorption by wang and giammar 2013 the two reaction rate constants k 1 and k 2 were consistent across all batch experiments but differed from those calibrated for the stirred flow experiments this difference was introduced to account for potential differences in the solution saturation state that could arise between the two types of reactors due to the accumulation of reaction products within batch systems which can affect dissolution kinetics kraemer and hering 1997 the other two calibrated parameters the proportionality term k 3 and the edge concentration cedge varied across the experiments as mineral properties of different mn oxides varied between the studies all batch simulations were performed with phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 while the stirred flow experiments were simulated with modflow harbaugh 2005 and pht3d prommer et al 2003 to account for flow and reactive processes respectively the standard wateq4f database ball and nordstrom 1991 was used as a starting point for the reaction network definition to which our newly defined reactions were added for example the edge m n e d g e i v and vacancy m n v a c a n c y i v sites were defined in the database and their protonation deprotonation constants pka were adopted from the literature for birnessite peacock and sherman 2007 tonkin et al 2004 whereas the values for m n e d g e i i i sites were adopted from the constants provided for manganite ramstedt et al 2004 and not varied any further table 3 edge and vacancy site densities reported in a birnessite study villalobos 2015 were used as starting values and subsequently varied during model calibration table 1 as iii and as v were decoupled from the global redox equilibrium and their redox transformations were kinetically controlled the scm was restricted to considering only the chemical contribution towards the overall adsorption and the electrostatic effects on the complexation were ignored this was because the ssa of end basal planes and edge surface of a mn oxide particle cannot be determined separately villalobos et al 2014 which is required for the calculation of surface charge on vacancy and edge sites in a scm similar to many published modeling studies rathi et al 2017b a stolze et al 2019 sun et al 2018 given that reactants were sufficiently mixed stirred in the investigated experimental systems all surface complexation reactions were assumed to be sufficiently fast such that the local equilibrium assumption bahr and rubin 1987 was valid initial estimates of the reaction constants for as iii as v and mn ii surface complexation on respective sites were estimated via manual calibration and further optimized during an automated calibration step the solubility product of the mn ii as v precipitate krautite and the constants for mn ii as v solution complexes were set to literature values tournassat et al 2002 and not varied any further table 3 each model calibration run included multiple model simulations where each simulation corresponded to one of the oxidation experiments table 4 we employed initially a manual trial and error step followed by an automatic calibration step using the heuristic particle swarm optimization pso coello et al 2004 eberhart and kennedy 1995 kennedy et al 2001 algorithm pso was chosen because it has previously been shown to be a suitable method for dealing with the non linearity of complex geochemical models jamieson et al 2018 prommer et al 2018 rathi et al 2017a b sun et al 2018 the pso code was written within the pest platform using the panther run manager and linked with phreeqc pht3d siade et al 2019 the 12 parameters to be estimated included surface complexation constants for as iii as v mn ii and mn ii as v ternary complexes oxidation rate constants k 1 and k 2 proportionality term k 3 surface site densities sedge and svacancy and cedge tables 1 and 2 calibration was achieved by minimizing the objective function defined as the sum of squared residuals between all observations from the considered experiments table 4 and their model simulated equivalents the calibrated model was further verified against the observations from various stirred flow and batch experiments table 5 lafferty et al 2011 2010a villalobos et al 2014 finally the parameter estimates from pso calibration were used as initial values for a linearized parameter uncertainty analysis using pest doherty 2015 rathi et al 2017b rawson et al 2017 further details are provided in table 1 3 results 3 1 quantification of as iii oxidation rates the final calibrated models closely replicated the observations from as iii oxidation experiments conducted using both stirred flow table 4 and fig 2 a and batch setups table 4 and fig 3 a moreover they also reproduced all observations available from the oxidation and adsorption experiments table 5 for the purpose of model verification figs 2a and 4 the model based analysis demonstrated that the as iii oxidation rates show two distinct phases in the batch experiments but three distinct phases in the stirred flow experiments phase i was identified in all of the analyzed experiments and characterized by fast as iii oxidation during phase i high solution as iii saturated the sorption sites and was completely oxidized and released into the solution as as v the length of phase i ranged between only a few minutes to a few hours figs 2a and 3a the amount of cedge regulated the duration of phase i and the experimental data within this phase were critical for the estimation of cedge the variations in the model estimated values for cedge among the different experiments reflect the differences in the initial concentrations and types of mn oxides used figs 2b and 3 when the same initial concentration but different mn oxides were used table 2 cedge was higher for δ mno2 compared to acid birnessite due to the higher edge surface area villalobos et al 2014 of δ mno2 on the other hand when different amounts of the same mn oxide were used e g table 2 b1 vs b2 higher cedge values reflected higher initial concentrations of the mineral added in the experiments however for a given type of mn oxide the proportion of cedge on the mineral was comparable irrespective of the experimental setup tables 1 and 2 in the stirred flow oxidation experiment as determined by oxalate titration villalobos et al 2003 the amon of δ mno2 was 3 95 lafferty et al 2010a therefore cedge in the numerical model was assigned to host 95 of m n e d g e i v and 5 of m n e d g e i i i sites at the start of the experiment during phase i m n e d g e i v sites were reduced to m n e d g e i i i sites and no mn ii was produced fig 2a in conjunction with the reductive transformation the amon decreased to 3 80 fig s1 common to all experiments the end of phase i was marked by a distinct decrease in the overall oxidation rate figs 2c and s1b in the stirred flow experiment phase i was followed by a transition phase phase ii where as iii oxidation gradually shifted from fast reacting m n e d g e i v to slow reacting m n e d g e i i i sites this caused the overall oxidation rate to decrease significantly figs 2c during this transition small amounts of as iii remained adsorbed on m n e d g e i i i sites fig 2f due to the significantly slower oxidation rates this can explain the observed temporary decrease in total dissolved as concentrations fig 2a phase ii lasted for a relatively short period from t 4 h to 10 h in the stirred flow experiment the duration of phase ii depended upon the availability of both the initially present m n e d g e i v sites and the newly formed m n e d g e i i i sites on cedge fig 2e and f during phase ii the m n e d g e i i i sites were slowly reduced to mn ii causing mineral dissolution on the edge surface while a new edge surface on cbulk was exposed which hosted new m n e d g e i v sites however the amount of newly exposed edge sites was only 67 of the parent edge sites k 3 0 67 with relative uncertainty variance reduction of 85 1 table 1 i e a net decrease of cedge occurred slower oxidation of as iii produced lower amounts of as v in solution while mn ii was gradually produced and a fraction of it was adsorbed first on m n v a c a n c y i v sites and then on m n e d g e i v sites fig 2e and g the amon of δ mno2 dropped to 3 72 during phase ii since the slow reactivity of the m n e d g e i i i sites promoted an accumulation of mn iii on the mineral edge surface fig s1 finally phase iii in the stirred flow experiment was identifiable by a relatively constant oxidation rate that occurred when the continuous as iii bearing influent to the reactor started to reach a steady state with the overall as iii oxidation on both m n e d g e i i i and new m n e d g e i v sites hence effluent as iii as v and mn ii concentrations remained constant during phase iii dissolution of δ mno2 continued on the edge surface as indicated by the steady decrease in cedge value corresponding to the achieved steady state amon of δ mno2 did not change any further during phase iii fig s1 in contrast no transition phase ii was identified during any of the as iii oxidation batch experiments instead there was a direct transition from phase i to a steady rate phase that resembled phase iii of the stirred flow experiment fig 3 based on the model simulations the absence of phase ii can be attributed either to low initial as iii concentrations table 4 b2 or as in b1 and b3 to the low initial amount of mn oxide during phase i all m n e d g e i v sites on cedge collectively oxidized as iii and were themselves reduced to m n e d g e i i i sites subsequently in phase iii oxidation was dominated on m n e d g e i i i sites with only minor contributions from the new m n e d g e i v sites 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling the rate of as iii oxidation 4 1 1 type and abundance of edge sites the type of edge sites m n e d g e i v or m n e d g e i i i and their abundances on mn oxides were found to be the two most important factors that determine as iii oxidation rate this is best seen in the simulation of the stirred flow experiment where the abundance of fast reacting m n e d g e i v sites decreased considerably after phase i while that of slow reacting m n e d g e i i i sites started to increase during phase ii during phase iii m n e d g e i i i sites were more abundant than m n e d g e i v sites but both edge sites gradually depleted at a steady rate fig 2e and f accordingly as iii oxidation rates were highest when a large number of m n e d g e i v sites was available phase i modest for a combination of both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites phase ii and lowest when m n e d g e i i i sites were predominant phase iii fig 2c in contrast the simulations of the batch experiments showed that as iii oxidation over most of the experimental duration was controlled by the abundance of only m n e d g e i i i sites while the influence of m n e d g e i v sites was only visible during the short phase i the simulations of the batch experiments showed that either most of the added as iii was oxidized within phase i by an excess amount of initially available m n e d g e i v sites or conversely excess as iii completely reduced m n e d g e i v to m n e d g e i i i sites during phase i before oxidation continued on the remaining m n e d g e i i i sites fig 3 during phases ii and iii of the stirred flow oxidation experiment our model simulation showed a disparity in the rates of exposing new cedge versus dissolution of the parent cedge as indicated by an estimated value of 0 67 for k 3 table 1 this could be interpreted as having only two out of every three newly exposed m n e d g e i v sites present adjacent to each other to allow for as iii adsorption to occur via a bidentate binuclear surface complex this reduced efficiency could be a result of the difference in the as iii oxidation rates between m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites which causes accumulation of m n e d g e i i i sites compared to m n e d g e i v as a result a new m n e d g e i v site can become isolated on the new edge surface jeopardizing their as iii oxidation ability fig 1 the value of k 3 also appears to be a function of the mineral ssa in the batch experiments k 3 ranged between 0 20 and 0 27 for acid birnessite with an ssa of 39 m2 g 1 while it was 0 78 for δ mno2 with an ssa of 114 m2 g 1 table 2 furthermore the lower oxidation rate on m n e d g e i i i sites might have led to a longer retention time of adsorbed as iii on these sites before undergoing oxidation this hypothesis was supported by the temporary decrease in the total dissolved as concentrations that is apparent during phase ii of the stirred flow oxidation experiment fig 2 to test this hypothesis we used the calibrated model to simulate a stirred flow adsorption oxidation desorption experiment table 5 sf2 lafferty et al 2011 in this experiment the as iii bearing influent was switched over to an as iii free background electrolyte after 24 h to initiate a desorption phase the dilution curve suggested a lag time of 3 h for the influent to fully saturate the reactor arsenic speciation analysis on the collected samples showed that as associated with δ mno2 was present as as v and no as iii was observed in the effluent during the desorption phase lafferty et al 2011 however our model simulation suggested that as associated with δ mno2 would temporarily remain as as iii the adsorbed as iii was then oxidized to as v over the lag time of dilution during the desorption phase fig 4a and before the ex situ solid phase as speciation analysis with exafs was performed 4 1 2 surface passivation the model simulations of the stirred flow experiment showed that passivation of m n e d g e i v sites by as v was minor and occurred only during phase i fig 2e during phase ii mn ii saturated the m n v a c a n c y i v sites which contributed to its delayed release into the solution subsequently mn ii competed with both as iii and as v for adsorption on m n e d g e i v sites fig 2e and g since m n e d g e i v sites are mostly negatively charged m n e d g e i v o at ph 7 20 peacock and sherman 2007 tonkin et al 2004 adsorption of mn ii is favored over neutral as iii h 3 aso 3 and negatively charged as v h a s o 4 2 species after 9 h into the experiment coverage by total adsorbed mn ii with respect to the total amount of sorption sites 36 exceeded that of as iii and as v combined 30 surface passivation by mn ii was exclusively responsible for restricting as iii oxidation on new m n e d g e i v sites limiting further production of m n e d g e i i i sites and thereby regulating the overall duration of phase ii interestingly based on the model simulations passivation of positively charged m n e d g e i i i sites by as v oxyanions was minor fig 2f this was in contrast to the expected higher affinity of negatively charged as v compared to the neutral as iii species at ph 7 20 ramstedt et al 2004 zhu et al 2009 the continuous influx of high as iii concentrations into the reactor might have prevented competitive adsorption of as v during phases ii and iii in contrast to the stirred flow experiments surface passivation by either as v or mn ii was not apparent in the batch experiments this is because early in these experiments as iii oxidation transitioned directly into phase iii during phase iii mn oxides predominantly hosted m n e d g e i i i sites which were saturated by as iii fig 3c and d potential surface passivation by krautite and mn ii as v ternary surface complexes was also evaluated using the literature value for the solubility product of krautite tournassat et al 2002 our simulations showed that krautite never reached saturation in any of the experiments analyzed therefore surface passivation by krautite most likely only occurs at extremely high concentrations of mn ii and as v which are rarely seen in environmental settings as there are no surface complexation constants available for the mn ii as v ternary surface complexes they were treated as adjustable during model calibration but found to be insensitive with respect to the employed observation data table 1 therefore surface passivation by mn ii as v ternary surface complexes could not be quantified in this study 4 2 parameter sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 manual sensitivity analysis for selected parameters additional model runs were conducted with one of the parameters being adjusted by a small amount 20 from its calibrated value while keeping the remaining parameters consistent with the calibrated model the results of the model simulations for four key parameters show that they affect as iii oxidation during different phases fig 5 for example the effect of rate constant k 1 was visible only during oxidation phase ii when the amount of adsorbed as on m n e d g e i v sites is comparable to k 1 eq 3 and fig 2e similarly the effects of the rate constant k 2 were visible only during phase iii interestingly the influence of the proportionality term k 3 is visible only during the tail end of phase iii after the rate of oxidation on m n e d g e i i i sites surpasses that on m n e d g e i v sites fig 2c this suggests that k 3 has a direct effect on the long term oxidation rate of as iii finally the influence of the edge component cedge on oxidation is visible only after as iii is predominantly adsorbed on m n e d g e i i i sites i e during phase ii and iii fig 2e and f 4 2 2 parameter uncertainty variance reduction beside the manual sensitivity analysis an automatic linearized uncertainty analysis based on local parameter sensitivities was also conducted for the simulation of the stirred flow experiments although due to the highly nonlinear nature of the simulated processes the results of this linearized statistical analysis should be interpreted with caution the analysis was able to recognize the parameters that were well constrained by the selected datasets and those that were less constrained or insensitive during model calibration table 1 the insensitive parameters included surface complexation constant of as v on m n e d g e i i i log k5 and ternary surface complexes on m n e d g e i v log k9 and m n v a c a n c y i v log k10 sites although these insensitive parameters did not influence the model outcomes under the tested experimental conditions the possibility of these processes playing a role under other conditions cannot be ruled out in addition the parameter describing surface complexation of mn ii on m n v a c a n c y i v sites log k6 was sensitive but its low reduction in relative uncertainty i e 14 2 suggests that the reported parameter value was not uniquely identifiable table 1 this implies that this parameter can potentially take on a range of values while still achieving a good model calibration however this parameter s sensitivity is relatively low compared to the other parameters indicating that its low reduction in posterior variance is not likely due to the correlation that results from overparameterization these results demonstrate that inverse problem for this study was relatively well determined furthermore sensitivity analysis of the stirred flow model indicated a strong negative correlation between several parameters that represent competing processes for example negative correlation between the surface complexation constants for as iii log k1 and mn ii log k3 on m n e d g e i v sites table s1 is understandable because both species compete for sorption on these sites 5 conclusions using a process based modeling approach this study evaluated a conceptual model that reflects the widely accepted mechanisms for as iii oxidation by mn oxides based on the modeling results the rate of as iii oxidation by mn oxides is controlled by the accessibility to both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites and by surface passivation from mn ii a transitional phase ii which was clearly identified in the stirred flow experiment but not in the batch system represents a period when as iii oxidation gradually shifts from fast reacting m n e d g e i v to slowly reacting m n e d g e i i i sites under conditions typical of natural groundwater systems with flow oxidation of aqueous as iii by mn oxides may also follow a three phase reaction mechanism our modeling results suggest that several previous studies that used a batch reactor setup possibly overestimated the importance of m n e d g e i v sites for as iii oxidation these sites were only responsible for as iii oxidation during a brief initial phase subsequently oxidation occurs predominantly on m n e d g e i i i sites at slow rates allowing for retention of adsorbed as iii in contrast a stirred flow reactor setup in which reactant concentrations are additionally affected by flow rates is generally more relevant for studying natural groundwater systems or a water treatment plant and allows for a more detailed inspection of the complex reaction network based on the dataset from the stirred flow experiment a three phase as iii oxidation mechanism has been identified which is driven by the accessibility to both m n e d g e i v and m n e d g e i i i sites and regulated by solution ph and surface passivation from mn ii the abundance of m n e d g e i v sites corresponds to rapid oxidation while that of m n e d g e i i i sites would correspond to adsorption and steady but slower oxidation despite the good agreement of our model simulations with the tested literature datasets a universal applicability of the derived parameters such as oxidation rate constants is not prudent because several model parameters were insensitive and one model parameter was not well constrained in this study to reduce uncertainty in the model conceptualization and parameter values and to improve robustness and wider applicability continued research effort from both experimentalists and modelers is clearly required nonetheless the numerical model presented here derived several hypotheses which can assist in the design of future experiments for example model simulations of experiments with δ mno2 and acid birnessite showed that varying particle sizes regulated the value of cedge which in turn means a higher abundance of edge sites this finding could be extended to and verified on other layered and even tunnel structured mn oxides similarly model simulations show that all adsorbed as persisted as as iii for longer on slow reacting m n e d g e i i i sites however the delays in sample collection and measurements might have allowed oxidation of adsorbed as iii to as v before samples were analyzed this hypothesis could be tested with in situ measurements of adsorbed as such as the quick scanning xas technique ginder vogel et al 2009 furthermore the current model framework can be extended to study the reactivity of other mn oxides e g tunnel structured or mn oxides with impurity power et al 2005 effects of competing solutes e g fe ii wu et al 2015 other redox sensitive pollutants e g cr eary and rai 1987 and micro organic pollutants furgal et al 2014 as well as effects of a wider range of solution ph wu et al 2015 and comproportionation lafferty et al 2010b wang et al 2019 2018 zhao et al 2016 the extended model s can be subsequently used to design new experiments where the experimental conditions can be optimized and the most informative data sampling campaign can be determined ahead of time growing application of mn oxides in wastewater treatment husnain et al 2020 demands that future work should be expanded towards analysis of experiments where raw influent is treated with mn oxides however due to a more complex matrix numerous constituents in the raw water would compete for reactions with mn oxides and therefore a detailed knowledge of each reaction mechanism will be required for the development of a numerical model our present study represents an important milestone towards this goal and the numerical model developed here could assist with the design of new experiments for the purpose of gaining the required insight into the mechanism of mn oxide reaction with various raw water constituents declaration of

17587,in addition to surface water and groundwater rainwater is used as an important drinking water source in many parts of the world especially in areas with serious water pollution or insufficient water resources conventional drinking water treatment technologies can remove dissolved organic matter and therefore reduce the formation of disinfection by products dbps during subsequent disinfection using surface water or groundwater as drinking water sources however little information has been known about the effect of conventional water treatment processes on dbp formation when rainwater is used as drinking water source this study evaluated cx3r type dbp precursors removal from rainwater by conventional drinking water treatments and the corresponding decrease of cx3r type dbp trihalomethanes thms haloaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams formation and toxicity during the subsequent chlor am ination the result showed that both sand filtration sf and activated carbon filtration gac were able to remove dbp precursors and gac outperformed sf but no dbp precursors removal was observed during coagulation sedimentation treatment among all treatments sf gac was the most effective for dbp precursors removal with removal efficiencies of 64 2 doc 98 don and 76 6 uv254 correspondingly both sf and gac decreased the formation of thms hals hans and hams and gac performed better than sf the combination of sf and gac especially sf gac greatly decreased dbp formation with average reduction of 79 2 and 85 during chlorination and chloramination respectively after different treatments the comprehensive toxicity risk of cx3r type dbps was all reduced among which gac sf exhibited superior performance generally the main contribution of integrated toxicity was hans during chlor am ination the formation potential of thms hals hans and hams and the corresponding integrated toxicity were greater during chlorination than

have caused increasing water demand mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 rodell et al 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 reported that nearly two thirds of the global population faces to severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year and half a billion people in the world suffer from severe water shortages all year round thus an alternative water source is needed to address water scarcity especially in developing countries rainwater as an important of unconventional water source has relatively better water quality than surface water sources which appears to be the most promising alternative for supplying fresh water when the amount of local conventional water is insufficient or the water quality is seriously polluted zhu et al 2004 santos and de farias 2017 chubaka et al 2018 harvested rainwater as an alternative water source has a long application history in many countries and is of great significance to ensure people s water use zhang et al 2014 da costa pacheco et al 2017 lee et al 2017 santos and de farias 2017 rainwater harvesting systems are prevalent in brazil australia and malaysia lee et al 2017 santos and de farias 2017 chubaka et al 2018 additionally catchment and cellar have been often used to collect rainwater for potable water in the arid regions of northwest and southwest china zhu et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2016 however harvested rainwater has poor quality due to the accumulation of anthropogenic pollutants and microorganisms from atmosphere which depends on atmospheric characteristics of the region mwenge kahinda and taigbenu 2011 haque et al 2016 wang et al 2019 moreover rainwater quality will further deteriorate during storage zhu et al 2004 ahmed et al 2017 therefore microbial pathogens are one of the major reasons for poor rainwater quality ahmed et al 2017 naser et al 2017 omar k f m et al 2017 shaheed et al 2017 and some treatment processes e g chlorine disinfection are needed to ensure the microbiological safety of rainwater however this leads to an unintended consequence the formation of disinfection by products dbps hou et al 2018 since dbps were discovered in 1974 extensive studies have been undertaken to disinfect drinking water chu et al 2012a niu et al 2015 nihemaiti et al 2017 huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 toxicological studies showed that dbps might be potentially mutagenic or carcinogenic to human being muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008a deng et al 2014 pan et al 2014 han and zhang 2018 some typical carbonaceous dbps c dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloaldehydes hals have relative high concentrations comparing with other dbps in finished drinking water and are regulated in many countries richardson et al 2007 koudjonou et al 2008 huang et al 2017 however some emerging nitrogenous dbps n dbps haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides hams and halonitromethanes hnms with low concentrations were not regulated but they were reported to have much higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity than thms and hals plewa et al 2008a 2008b therefore it is very important to control these dbps for drinking water safety these dbps thms hals hans hams and hnms were identified as cx3r type dbps x h cl br or i due to their similar molecular structure ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a he et al 2020 the molecular structures of cx3r type dbps are listed in table s1 generally the removal of these dbp precursors before disinfection is regarded as an effective way to mitigate the formation of dbps chu et al 2012b jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 kosaka et al 2018 in drinking water treatment plants dwtps conventional water treatment processes coagulation sedimentation cs and filtration can partially remove dbp precursors and mitigate the formation of dbps during the subsequent disinfection han et al 2015 metcalfe et al 2015 watson et al 2015 xue et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 for instance wang et al 2017 found that powdered activated carbon and coagulation could remove thm and han precursors from surface water and the combined process exhibited synergic effect in previous studies cost effective technologies such as sand filtration sf and granular activated carbon filtration gac have been used successfully to improve the quality of rainwater in water lacking areas zhang et al 2012 kwaadsteniet et al 2013 although conventional processes had a good removal effect on dbp precursors in surface water till now little information has been known about the effect of the conventional drinking water treatment processes on dbp formation when rainwater is used as the drinking water source this work could provide valuable information for the control of dbps in the case of rainwater as drinking water source the purposes of this study were therefore to 1 evaluate the removal of organic matter especially precursors of cx3r type dbps from rainwater by cs and sf gac or their combination 2 investigate the formation of cx3r type dbps including c dbps thms and hals and n dbps hans hams

virgin granular activated carbon were filled in sf and gac column respectively both the two columns had the height of 20 cm and the inner diameter of 2 cm the filtration rate was controlled by a

water velocity was set at 25 ml min after the rainwater flowed through the entire circuit for 10 min to ensure steady operation the treated rainwater samples were collected from the sampling port for subsequent experiments all experiments were performed at 20 2 c in order to prevent the growth of microorganisms new filtration media was replaced for each batch of experiments 2 4 dbp fp tests dbp fp

brominated dbps were not detected in rainwater after disinfection as bromide was below detection limit in the rainwater 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of precursors using cs and sf gac

the following discussion was conducted based on the results from the highest coagulant dosage to compare the performance of conventional treatment processes doc uv254 and don in the feed rainwater and the treated rainwater were shown in fig 2a it can be observed that cs showed almost no efficiency in removing doc uv254 and don in rainwater this result is different from surface water in which coagulation had a certain removal rate of organic matter zhao et al 2009 chu et al 2011 wan et al 2019 this probably due to a lower turbidity 1 0 ntu as well as different organic matter characteristics of rainwater wang et al 2013 han et al 2015 hou et al 2018 amw distribution of rainwater and two typical surface waters in this study can be seen clearly in fig 2b as shown in fig 2b dom in the collected surface source water had uniform distributions in the 10 kda 1 10 kda and 1 kda regions while more than half of dom in rainwater belonged to 1 kda which indicates that rainwater had a more low mw organic matters composition compared with typical surface waters a previous study has also found that the cs process has no significant effect on removing low mw organic matters chu et al 2011 which is consistent with the results of this study compared with cs both gac and sf alone could reduce doc of rainwater and gac outperformed sf in doc removal with the average removal rate of 51 and 42 1 respectively which is in agreement with the results of surface water badawy et al 2012 this might be explained by that gac has more specific surface area and micropores than sf hanigan et al 2012 it is noteworthy that the sum of doc removal by sf and gac alone was greater than the doc removal by the combination of sf and gac which indicates that a same fraction of organic matter in rainwater can be removed by both sf and gac among the combined processes sf gac showed the highest efficiency in reducing doc uv254 and don usually macro molecules are likely to block gac pores and decrease the adsorption ability of gac jiang et al 2017 jiang and zhang 2018 therefore the reason why the highest efficiency occurred in sf gac group could be that sf firstly removed macromolecular organics from rainwater afterwards gac removed more organics than the gac without sf pretreatment while the doc removal by gac sf was comparable with that by gac alone which indicates that gac is able to remove a wide range of organic materials including the most fraction that can be readily removed by sf fig 2a also shows the uv254 results of the treated rainwater the uv254 results are similar to doc results sf and gac alone decreased uv254 by 10 9 and 29 7 respectively while the combined processes sf gac and gac sf greatly improved the removal of uv254 to 76 6 and 84 4 respectively suggesting that the combined processes largely reduced uv absorbance substances containing unsaturated bonds or aromatic chromophores and performed better than the superposition of single treatment as for don the n dbp precursors sf had a poor removal rate while other treatment processes involving gac especially sf gac effectively removed don which is consistent with surface water chu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 in summary among all treatments the most effective process for removing organics from rainwater was sf gac suggesting that the combination of sf and gac may be a promising process for dbp precursors removal in rainwater eem spectra was often used to differentiate origin and composition of dbp precursors in water sources birdwell and valsaraj 2010 xiao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 eem spectra results of rainwater treated by different treatment processes are presented in fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3a fluorescent compounds in rainwater were mainly constituted of soluble microbial products like smps λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and aromatic proteins aps λex 250 nm λem 380 nm followed by fulvic acid like λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and humic acid like λex 250 nm λem 380 nm as is shown in fig 3b fluorescent compounds were hardly removed by cs in agreement with the results of doc uv254 and don fig 2 as is shown in fig 3c and d sf removed most of fulvic acid like as well as a part of smps and humic acid like gac performed even better than sf for removing fluorescent compounds which removed most of fluorescent compounds except for aps this is consistent with reservoir water wang et al 2017 the combination of gac and sf for the removal of fluorescent compounds was similar with the results of gac alone the results from fig 3d f indicate that gac could easily remove fulvic acid like humic acid like and smps compounds which was reported to be able to produce a large number of dbps in previous studies bellar et al 1974 rook 1977 chu et al 2010 han et al 2015 niu et al 2015 3 2 control of c dbps the c dbps thms and hals formation in rainwater after different treatment processes are illustrated in fig 4 since cs had almost no effect on dbp precursors and the formation of dbps during disinfection it will not be discussed subsequently as is shown in fig 4a gac was efficient for the decrease of thms and hals formation during chlorination with the average reduction rate of 83 3 and 80 5 greater than that of sf with the average reduction rate of 20 4 and 15 5 which is in agreement with surface water badawy et al 2012 the combination of sf and gac could inhibit the formation of thms and hals but it performed worse than the superposition of two single treatments and its order seemly had no effect on controlling the formation of thms and hals a similar result on c dbp formation was also observed during chloramination after different treatments sf gac gac sf gac sf however sf was more effective in reducing the formation of trichloromethane tcm and trichloroacetaldehyde tcal during chloramination than chlorination which may be related to the mechanism by which nom reacts with different disinfectants to form dbps hua and reckhow 2007 goslan et al 2009 fig 4c and d shows the results of c dbp fp c dbps doc to assess reactivity of residual dissolved organic matter dom in treated rainwater with cl2 and nh2cl all processes with gac reduced c dbp fp to different degrees during both chlorination and chloramination process indicating that gac removed relatively high active dbp precursors while sf process increased c dbp fp indicating sf reduced relatively low active precursors which may be related to the removal of fulvic acid like in rainwater fig 3c similarly sf slightly increased tcm fp and dichloroacetaldehyde dcal fp but decreased tcal fp compared to untreated rainwater during chloramination which may be due to the reaction mechanism of different disinfectants with organic matter in rainwater in addition it clearly observed that c dbp fp was much higher during chlorination than chloramination which is in line with previous studies hua and reckhow 2007 goslan et al 2009 bougeard et al 2010 yan et al 2018 3 3 control of n dbps since hnms were not detected in chlorinated and chloraminated rainwater it will not be discussed subsequently the decrease of the formation of n dbps hans and hams in rainwater after different treatment processes are shown in fig 5 as is shown in fig 5a trichloroacetamide tcam and trichloroacetonitrile tcan were not detectable below detection limit 0 5 μg l during chlorination gac outperformed sf in decreasing the formation of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dichloroacetamide dcam the combination of gac and sf only improved the decrease of dcan compared to gac alone while their comprehensive effect was less than the sum of sf and gac alone as is shown in fig 5b other n dbps were not detectable below detection limit 0 5 μg l except for dcan during chloramination the decrease of dcan formation caused by gac gac sf and sf gac were comparable all over 70 which are significantly higher than sf 12 5 similarly n dbp fp n dbps doc was compared to assess reactivity of residual dom in treated rainwater with cl2 and nh2cl as is shown in fig 5c and d sf increased the dcan fp but gac decreased the dcan fp regardless of chlorination or choramination which may be because the precursor of dcan was mainly from smps removed by gac instead of sf however there was no significant difference in decreasing dcam fp in different treatments during chlorination which might be related with unremoved aps both han fp and ham fp were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination 3 4 integrated toxic risk in the past plewa et al systematically investigated the cytotoxicity and the genotoxicity of a range of halogenated dbps plewa et al 2004 2008b muellner et al 2007 the integrated toxic risk values itrv were calculated to evaluate the comprehensive risk of dbps zhang et al 2017 he et al 2020 the itrv are the reciprocal of the averaged c½ cytotoxicity and the genotoxic potency genotoxicity values which were calculated using equation 1 where c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx are cyto and geno toxicity of each dbp compound respectively m is the relative molecular mass of each dbp compound cx is the formation potential of each dbp compound nm x is the specific dbp compound the effect of different treatment processes on the itrv of dbp formation in rainwater is shown in fig 6 as is presented in fig 6a without the pretreatment the rank order of itrv caused by dbp formation in rainwater were thms hans hals hams during chlorination and hals hans thms hams during chloramination respectively however with the different pretreatments except for sf the toxicity rank order changed into hans hals thms hams during chlor am ination which is in agreement with surface water and the main contribution of comprehensive toxicity was hans zhang et al 2017 the sum of the itrv of the four classes of dbps in rainwater was all reduced to different degrees after different treatments during chlor am ination the rank order of reduction efficiency of itrv during chlorination and chloramination were gac sf sf gac gac sf and gac sf sf gac gac sf respectively which suggests that the combined filtration exhibited better performance in controlling dbps comprehensive toxicity risk in rainwater than sf or gac alone and dependent of the order of sf and gac during chlorination in addition the processes with gac especially gac sf was more effective to control the overall toxicity risk of dbps in rainwater than other treatments in comparison with chlorination the itrv of dbps formed in rainwater after different treatments during chloramination was remarkably dropped especially these treatments including gac due to its stronger adsorption capacity in summary gac plus chloramine disinfection was the most cost effective in mitigating the comprehensive toxicity risk of dbps for rainwater 4 conclusions the main conclusions were as follows 1 sf gac and their combination were able to remove cx3r type dbp precursors e g doc don and fluorescent compounds in rainwater while cs was almost ineffective in removing dbp precursors compared with sf the pretreatment gac had better performance in removing dbp precursors among all treatments sf gac was the most effective process for removing dbp precursors from rainwater 2 sf gac and their combination decreased the formation of thms hals hans and hams while cs did not the effect of all treatment processes on decreasing the formation of thms hals hans and hams was ranked as follows sf gac gac sf gac sf cs during chlorination and sf gac gac sf gac sf cs during chloramination gac might remove more active dbp precursors while sf might remove more low active precursors however there was no significant difference in decreasing dcam fp in different treatments during chlorination all dbp fp were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination 3 for rainwater chlorination resulted into higher comprehensive toxicity risk than chloramination the pretreatments reduced the overall toxicity in the following order gac sf sf gac gac sf during chlorination and gac sf sf gac gac sf during chloramination and the main contribution of integrated toxicity was hans during chloramination after pretreatments except for sf overall gac and chloramination treatment were promising in mitigating the comprehensive toxicity risk of dbps for rainwater

17587,in addition to surface water and groundwater rainwater is used as an important drinking water source in many parts of the world especially in areas with serious water pollution or insufficient water resources conventional drinking water treatment technologies can remove dissolved organic matter and therefore reduce the formation of disinfection by products dbps during subsequent disinfection using surface water or groundwater as drinking water sources however little information has been known about the effect of conventional water treatment processes on dbp formation when rainwater is used as drinking water source this study evaluated cx3r type dbp precursors removal from rainwater by conventional drinking water treatments and the corresponding decrease of cx3r type dbp trihalomethanes thms haloaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams formation and toxicity during the subsequent chlor am ination the result showed that both sand filtration sf and activated carbon filtration gac were able to remove dbp precursors and gac outperformed sf but no dbp precursors removal was observed during coagulation sedimentation treatment among all treatments sf gac was the most effective for dbp precursors removal with removal efficiencies of 64 2 doc 98 don and 76 6 uv254 correspondingly both sf and gac decreased the formation of thms hals hans and hams and gac performed better than sf the combination of sf and gac especially sf gac greatly decreased dbp formation with average reduction of 79 2 and 85 during chlorination and chloramination respectively after different treatments the comprehensive toxicity risk of cx3r type dbps was all reduced among which gac sf exhibited superior performance generally the main contribution of integrated toxicity was hans during chlor am ination the formation potential of thms hals hans and hams and the corresponding integrated toxicity were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination therefore the combination of gac and chloramination was promising in mitigating the comprehensive toxicity risk of thms hals hans and hams for rainwater graphical abstract

have caused increasing water demand mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 rodell et al 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 reported that nearly two thirds of the global population faces to severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year and half a billion people in the world suffer from severe water shortages all year round thus an alternative water source is needed to address water scarcity especially in developing countries rainwater as an important of unconventional water source has relatively better water quality than surface water sources which appears to be the most promising alternative for supplying fresh water when the amount of local conventional water is insufficient or the water quality is seriously polluted zhu et al 2004 santos and de farias 2017 chubaka et al 2018 harvested rainwater as an alternative water source has a long application history in many countries and is of great significance to ensure people s water use zhang et al 2014 da costa pacheco et al 2017 lee et al 2017 santos and de farias 2017 rainwater harvesting systems are prevalent in brazil australia and malaysia lee et al 2017 santos and de farias 2017 chubaka et al 2018 additionally catchment and cellar have been often used to collect rainwater for potable water in the arid regions of northwest and southwest china zhu et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2016 however harvested rainwater has poor quality due to the accumulation of anthropogenic pollutants and microorganisms from atmosphere which depends on atmospheric characteristics of the region mwenge kahinda and taigbenu 2011 haque et al 2016 wang et al 2019 moreover rainwater quality will further deteriorate during storage zhu et al 2004 ahmed et al 2017 therefore microbial pathogens are one of the major reasons for poor rainwater quality ahmed et al 2017 naser et al 2017 omar k f m et al 2017 shaheed et al 2017 and some treatment processes e g chlorine disinfection are needed to ensure the microbiological safety of rainwater however this leads to an unintended consequence the formation of disinfection by products dbps hou et al 2018 since dbps were discovered in 1974 extensive studies have been undertaken to disinfect drinking water chu et al 2012a niu et al 2015 nihemaiti et al 2017 huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 toxicological studies showed that dbps might be potentially mutagenic or carcinogenic to human being muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008a deng et al 2014 pan et al 2014 han and zhang 2018 some typical carbonaceous dbps c dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloaldehydes hals have relative high concentrations comparing with other dbps in finished drinking water and are regulated in many countries richardson et al 2007 koudjonou et al 2008 huang et al 2017 however some emerging nitrogenous dbps n dbps haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides hams and halonitromethanes hnms with low concentrations were not regulated but they were reported to have much higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity than thms and hals plewa et al 2008a 2008b therefore it is very important to control these dbps for drinking water safety these dbps thms hals hans hams and hnms were identified as cx3r type dbps x h cl br or i due to their similar molecular structure ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a he et al 2020 the molecular structures of cx3r type dbps are listed in table s1 generally the removal of these dbp precursors before disinfection is regarded as an effective way to mitigate the formation of dbps chu et al 2012b jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 kosaka et al 2018 in drinking water treatment plants dwtps conventional water treatment processes coagulation sedimentation cs and filtration can partially remove dbp precursors and mitigate the formation of dbps during the subsequent disinfection han et al 2015 metcalfe et al 2015 watson et al 2015 xue et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 for instance wang et al 2017 found that powdered activated carbon and coagulation could remove thm and han precursors from surface water and the combined process exhibited synergic effect in previous studies cost effective technologies such as sand filtration sf and granular activated carbon filtration gac have been used successfully to improve the quality of rainwater in water lacking areas zhang et al 2012 kwaadsteniet et al 2013 although conventional processes had a good removal effect on dbp precursors in surface water till now little information has been known about the effect of the conventional drinking water treatment processes on dbp formation when rainwater is used as the drinking water source this work could provide valuable information for the control of dbps in the case of rainwater as drinking water source the purposes of this study were therefore to 1 evaluate the removal of organic matter especially precursors of cx3r type dbps from rainwater by cs and sf gac or their combination 2 investigate the formation of cx3r type dbps including c dbps thms and hals and n dbps hans hams and hnms and 3 assess the integrated toxic of cx3r type dbps formed during chlor am ination after different treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all chemicals were at least

rainwater collection and characterization rainwater was harvested on the roof of the mingjing building on the campus of tongji university shanghai china a part of collected rainwater was filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters and stored in the dark at 4 c until usage the characteristics of rainwater were listed in table s2 in order to reflect the difference of molecular weight mw characteristics between rainwater and surface water two typical surface water samples were collected from the intake of two dwtps whose source was the qingcaosha reservoir typical source water 1 in

virgin granular activated carbon were filled in sf and gac column respectively both the two columns had the height of 20 cm and the inner diameter of 2 cm the filtration rate was controlled by a peristaltic pump the sampling points can be seen in fig 1 the rainwater as the same as the influent water of cs experiment was also used and was filled in 4 l tank the experiments were carried in sf gac sf gac gac sf filtration systems fig 1 before the experiment the whole circuit was backwashed using distilled water till the water quality of the inlet and outlet water was basically same the water velocity was set at 25 ml min after the rainwater flowed through the entire circuit for 10 min to ensure steady operation the treated rainwater samples were collected from the sampling port for subsequent experiments all experiments were performed at 20 2 c in order to prevent the growth of microorganisms new filtration media was replaced for each batch of experiments 2 4 dbp fp tests dbp fp

brominated dbps were not detected in rainwater after disinfection as bromide was below detection limit in the rainwater 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of precursors using cs and sf gac

outperformed sf in decreasing the formation of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dichloroacetamide dcam the combination of gac and sf only improved the decrease of dcan compared to gac alone while their comprehensive effect was less than the sum of sf and gac alone as is shown in fig 5b other n dbps were not detectable below detection limit 0 5 μg l except for dcan during chloramination the decrease of dcan formation caused by gac gac sf and sf gac were comparable all over 70 which are significantly higher than sf 12 5 similarly n dbp fp n dbps doc was compared to assess reactivity of residual dom in treated rainwater with cl2 and nh2cl as is shown in fig 5c and d sf increased the dcan fp but gac decreased the dcan fp regardless of chlorination or choramination which may be because the precursor of dcan was mainly from smps removed by gac instead of sf however there was no significant difference in decreasing dcam fp in different treatments during chlorination which might be related with unremoved aps both han fp and ham fp were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination 3 4 integrated toxic risk in the past plewa et al systematically investigated the cytotoxicity and the genotoxicity of a range of halogenated dbps plewa et al 2004 2008b muellner et al 2007 the integrated toxic risk values itrv were calculated to evaluate the comprehensive risk of dbps zhang et al 2017 he et al 2020 the itrv are the reciprocal of the averaged c½ cytotoxicity and the genotoxic potency genotoxicity values which were calculated using equation 1 where c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx are cyto and geno toxicity of each dbp compound respectively m is the relative molecular mass of each dbp compound cx is the formation potential of each dbp compound nm x is the specific dbp compound the effect of different treatment processes on the itrv of dbp formation in rainwater is shown in fig 6 as is presented in fig 6a without the pretreatment the rank order of itrv caused by dbp formation in rainwater were thms hans hals hams during chlorination and hals hans thms hams during chloramination respectively however with the different pretreatments except for sf the toxicity rank order changed into hans hals thms hams during chlor am ination which is in agreement with surface water and the main contribution of comprehensive toxicity was hans zhang et al 2017 the sum of the itrv of the four classes of dbps in rainwater was all reduced to different degrees after different treatments during chlor am ination the rank order of reduction efficiency of itrv during chlorination and chloramination were gac sf sf gac gac sf and gac sf sf gac gac sf respectively which suggests that the combined filtration exhibited better performance in controlling dbps comprehensive toxicity risk in rainwater than sf or gac alone and dependent of the order of sf and gac during chlorination in addition the processes with gac especially gac sf was more effective to control the overall toxicity risk of dbps in rainwater than other treatments in comparison with chlorination the itrv of dbps formed in rainwater after different treatments during chloramination was remarkably dropped especially these treatments including gac due to its stronger adsorption capacity in summary gac plus chloramine disinfection was the most cost effective in mitigating the comprehensive toxicity risk of dbps for rainwater 4 conclusions the main conclusions were as follows 1 sf gac and their combination were able to remove cx3r type dbp precursors e g doc don and fluorescent compounds in rainwater while cs was almost ineffective in removing dbp precursors compared with sf the pretreatment gac had better performance in removing dbp precursors among all treatments sf gac was the most effective process for removing dbp precursors from rainwater 2 sf gac and their combination decreased the formation of thms hals hans and hams while cs did not the effect of all treatment processes on decreasing the formation of thms hals hans and hams was ranked as follows sf gac gac sf gac sf cs during chlorination and sf gac gac sf gac sf cs during chloramination gac might remove more active dbp precursors while sf might remove more low active precursors however there was no significant difference in decreasing dcam fp in different treatments during chlorination all dbp fp were greater during chlorination than that during chloramination 3 for rainwater chlorination resulted into higher comprehensive toxicity risk than chloramination the pretreatments reduced the overall toxicity in the following order gac sf sf gac gac sf during chlorination and gac sf sf gac gac sf during chloramination and the main contribution of integrated toxicity was hans during chloramination after pretreatments except for sf overall gac and chloramination treatment were promising in mitigating the comprehensive toxicity risk of dbps for rainwater

17588,antibiotics contaminants for example tetracycline tc in the environment have attracted extensive attention around the world and appropriate treatments for such contaminants are urgently required in this study five groups of anaerobic reactors supplemented with different amounts of fe3o4 were operated periodically to investigate their performance on tc removal the results showed that fe3o4 effectively promoted tc removal compared with the control reactor the tc removal efficiency was increased by 7 3 when co digested with glucose and increased by 40 4 when mono tc was digested in reactors with 5 0 g l fe3o4 further analysis indicated that the probable mechanism of fe3o4 promoting tc removal was through tc being adsorbed from the liquid onto fe3o4 making tc more available for microbes to be biodegraded microbial community analysis indicated that the bacteria klebsiella pseudomonas and escherichia related to tc removal were enriched which meant more pathways for tc removal were available following the addition of fe3o4 in addition in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors syntrophic metabolism between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium azonexus and methanobacterium were possibly established which played an important role in improving tc removal and ch4 production the electron transport system data further confirmed these results the functional gene classification for kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg analysis demonstrated that the dominant functions enhanced by fe3o4 supplementation was microbial metabolic activities graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline adsorption fe3o4 syntrophic metabolism 1 introduction antibiotics are produced from natural such as nucleoside antibiotics or synthetic such as sulfamethoxazole norfloxacin processes and widely used as medical agents for humans and animals to kill or inhibit some bacteria including gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as animal feed additives song et al 2020 cao et al 2018 chen et al 2016 the overuse and misuse of antibiotics mean that they are detected frequently in the environment which results in huge potential threats for human health crane et al 2006 tetracycline tc has a high antimicrobial activity and a low cost and is thus a widely used antibiotic daghrir and drogui 2013 however the metabolic efficiency of tc varied with the condition of anaerobic digestion liu et al 2018 used the industrial scale anaerobic digester dispose the tc contained swine feces and the results showed that the tc removal efficiency was only 17 8 in summer the low metabolic efficiency of tc led to its accumulation in waste systems which was why its treatment process has been a subject of concern reyes et al 2006 various treatment processes including photocatalysis tc removal efficiency 74 ultrasound tc removal efficiency 99 adsorption tc removal efficiency 71 and electrochemistry tc removal efficiency 98 have been investigated to remove tc feng et al 2012 wang et al 2011 gao et al 2012 oturan et al 2013 however high coexisting organic matters in tc producing wastewater interfered with tc removal and greatly increased the operation costs which limited their application in tc wastewater treatment anaerobic digestion has been considered as a promising and economical process for high concentration recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater due to the lower costs and the higher energy efficiency pan et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 it has been reported that the anaerobic digestion process can effectively deal with some antibiotic wastewater with organic matter removal efficiency from 14 to 89 spielmeyer et al 2015 however in terms of tc wastewater the high concentration and biodegradation intermediates have strong bacteriostatic action that could deteriorate anaerobic biological treatment decreasing the treatment efficiency and inhibiting the ch4 production deng et al 2011 therefore a new anaerobic biological treatment technology is required effective approaches for improving tc anaerobic treatment efficiency include enhancing the microorganism activity and decreasing the antibacterial activity zhang et al 2018b previous studies indicated that adding fe3o4 into an anaerobic digester could promote the syntrophic metabolism between bacteria and methanogens and then enhanced the organics removal efficiency and biogas production about 10 45 and 18 50 respectively zhang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 zhao et al 2018a the mechanism was believed to be the ability of fe3o4 to enrich fe iii reducing microorganisms which were capable of participating in the decomposition of complex organics via dissimilatory iron reduction zhao et al 2017a in addition magnetite as the conductive material could function as an electron conduit to improve direct interspecies electron transfer diet during anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2017b diet is an alternative to interspecies h2 transfer iht for interspecies electron exchange during syntrophic metabolism which is more efficient for organics removal compared with iht zhao et al 2017b during anaerobic digestion process most researchers ascribed the promotion effects to the stimulation of microorganisms nevertheless abiotic experiments indicated that fe3o4 played an important role in segregating some specific pollutants for example magnetite or fe3o4 was used as the adsorbent to remove arsenic shahid et al 2019 so2 and no2 pham et al 2019 and glyphosate yang et al 2018a and the adsorption capacity was 12 69 mg arsenate 40 5 mg so2 108 5 mg no2 6 7 mg glyphosate on 1 g of adsorbent respectively to the best of our knowledge when adding magnetite into an anaerobic reactor few researchers focused on investigating the interaction between the effects on adsorption and biodegradation of magnetite in this study fe3o4 was added to an anaerobic reactor to enhance the removal efficiency of tc the overall objective of this study was as following 1 the effects of fe3o4 on tc removal efficiency during anaerobic digestion 2 synergistic role of adsorption and microbial metabolism of fe3o4 during tc anaerobic removal process 3 high throughput sequencing technology and functional gene classification for kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg were conducted to reveal the change of microbial community structure and functional gene 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and inoculum fe3o4 powder 0 1 mm purity approximately 97 was purchased from damao chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china tc glucose and other chemicals used in this experiment were obtained from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china inoculant sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester of wulongkou waste sludge treatment plant of zhengzhou china before the experiment the inoculum was cultured in a batch anaerobic reactor φ200 320 mm 10 l working volume the operating conditions and the substrates used for culturing the inocula were implemented according to a previous study zhao et al 2016b 2 2 operation batch experiments were conducted in five groups and 0 g l 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 were added to the groups all groups ran for four cycles with a 100 ml working volume 15 ml inoculum 85 ml substrates and each cycle lasted for five days in the first two cycles phase i 100 mg l tc and 1000 mg l glucose were used as the co substrates and in the last two cycles phase ii only 100 mg l tc was used as the substrate in addition nh4cl and kh2po4 were used as the nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively to give a chemical oxygen demand cod n p ratio of 200 5 1 the trace element stock solution was added to the substrates in the concentration of 1 ml l and the stock solution was prepared with the following composition znso4 7h2o 0 37 mm mnso4 2h2o 2 5 mm cuso4 5h2o 0 14 mm coso4 7h2o 8 4 mm nicl2 6h2o 0 25 mm h3bo3 0 8 mm and edta 3 4 mm before the start of every cycle the residual liquid in the reactors was removed and another 85 ml of fresh substrate was added as described above after the inoculum and substrates were added the bottles were sealed with silica gel stoppers subsequently 99 9 nitrogen was flushed into the serum bottles to maintain an anaerobic condition then all bottles were placed in an incubator 37 the tc concentration cod and vfas were analyzed every day and the collected biogas was analyzed at the end of every cycle the experiment to explore the adsorption of fe3o4 was conducted in another 15 serum bottles which was only conducted one cycle with the same condition as phase ii but no inoculum all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods the cod the component in the biogas ch4 and co2 and the concentration of fe2 were measured according to the previous studies li et al 2019 zhao et al 2018b 2016a the concentration of tc was analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan with a c18 column agilent 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm and the detailed process was the same as that described in a previous study chen et al 2011 the equivalent relationships between cod and substrates were as follows 1 42 g cod g tc 1 06 g cod g glucose the intermediate products of tc in the abiotic reactors were analyzed by a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms agilent 6410b palo alto usa with an electrospray ionization esi source the method for analyzing the electron transport system ets activity was according to the reduction of 2 piodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int to formazan intf and the detailed process was the same as a previous study zhang et al 2018a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker vertex 70 germany was performed with the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 using a nicolet 5700 spectrometer after dried sludge samples were prepared using the potassium kbr pellets method and the detailed process was according to zhao et al 2018c the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was conducted with the pass energy high resolution scan at 30 ev and a survey scan at 100 ev spectra were analyzed with xpspeak41 software raymond kwok and the detailed process was according to yu et al 2018 the zeta potential was measured by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instrument ltd uk high throughput gene pyrosequencing was performed for the microbial community analyses genomic dna was extracted from the suspended sludge collected from each reactor using a dna extraction kit bioteke corporation beijing china according to the manufacturer s instructions the detailed methods were according to the references li et al 2016a 2016b the program picrust pipelines were applied to predict the metagenomics information of the microbial metabolic function using the kegg databases zhang et al 2016 2 4 calculation the cod or tc removal efficiency was evaluated by the following formula 1 1 re c initial c final c initial 100 where re is the organics removal efficiency i e cod or tc removal efficiency cinitial is the concentration of cod or tc at the initial of every cycle and cfinal is the concentration of cod or tc at the end of every cycle methane conversion efficiency mce ml

in the liquid at the initial of every cycle mg and organicssample is the organics content in the samples collected from the reactors that were used for measurement mg 3 the results and discussion 3 1 performance of the anaerobic reactor this experiment was divided into two phases phase i co digestion of glucose and tc phase ii mono digestion of tc and each phase proceeded for two cycles cod removal and biogas production are important parameters to evaluate the performance of anaerobic digestion the cod removal efficiency is exhibited in fig 1 a the results showed that the cod removal efficiency was enhanced in all reactors with fe3o4 addition after five days of digestion the cod removal efficiency in cycle 2 was 71 6 72 6 80 2 82 2 and 82 7 in the five reactors 0 g l 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 respectively the cod removal efficiency in the 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was approximately 15 higher compared with the control reactor 0 g l in phase ii with the removal of glucose from the inflow the cod removal efficiency in the control reactor deteriorated extremely after five days of digestion in cycle 4 the cod removal efficiency in the control reactor declined to 50 5 while the cod removal efficiency remained over 70 in the reactors with fe3o4 except for the 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor which was 67 9 this finding meant that fe3o4 could help either co digestion of glucose and tc or mono digestion of tc and the cod removal efficiency was positively related to the dosage of fe3o4 the better performance of the reactors supplemented with fe3o4 might be that fe3o4 could help the microbial communities to adapt to organics variation and thus enhance the removal efficiency wang et al 2019a accumulated ch4 production is shown in fig 1 b and ch4 production was also increased with the addition of fe3o4 which was in agreement with the cod removal comparatively the ch4 production in 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactors was 15 7 18 6 28 9 and 27 0 higher than the control reactor respectively in cycle 2 in phase ii with the removal of glucose from the inflow the ch4 production in all reactors declined because of the decrement of organic substrates from glucose and tc to tc only 3 2 tc removal efficiency similar to the cod removal efficiency the tc removal efficiency was also steadily improved with the addition of fe3o4 as shown in fig 2 a specifically in cycle 1 after five days of digestion the tc removal efficiency in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 60 0 66 3 72 2 80 3 and 80 7 respectively in cycle 2 the tc removal efficiency in all reactors increased compared with cycle 1 especially in the control reactor which might be because that in cycle 2 the microbial community adapted to the tc loading of 100 mg l in phase ii glucose was removed from the inflow and tc was used as the only carbon source in general the tc removal efficiency in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors in cycle 3 and cycle 4 exhibited no obvious difference with cycle 2 nevertheless the tc removal efficiency declined immediately in the control reactor after five days of digestion in cycle 3 the tc removal efficiency in 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactors was 94 7 97 7 97 4 and 99 0 respectively while it was only 58 6 in the control reactor it might be because that the deficiency of the preferred carbon source i e glucose for the microbial community directly resulted in the sharp reduction of tc removal efficiency in the control reactor which meant that the co digestion of tc and glucose could increase the tc removal efficiency the potential mechanism might be that the easier degraded glucose was more available for microbial growth and metabolism compared with the refractory tc which was in agreement with previous study donoso bravo et al 2009 however in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors although glucose was removed from the inflow the tc removal efficiency was not influenced the tc removal efficiencies in fe3o4 reactors were even 36 1 higher than that in the control reactor which indicated that in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors the microbial community could metabolize tc efficiently as the only carbon source one possible reason was that the microorganism activity was enhanced by the dissimilatory iron reduction process of fe3o4 zhang et al 2020 which was in agreement with changes of fe2 fig s1 in addition in cycle 2 over 60 of tc was removed on the first day in the control reactor and approximately 70 of tc was removed in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors therefore it was necessary to further point out the exact removal efficiency of tc within the first day as shown in fig 2 b the removal of tc from the liquid on the first day mainly happened at the initial 10 h during which over 50 of tc was removed in addition the removal efficiency in 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was approximately 30 higher than that in the control reactor at the tenth hour previous experiments indicated that fe3o4 could be used as the adsorbent for pollutant removal tomašovičová et al 2019 yang et al 2018a because of the opposite zeta potentials of organics and fe3o4 in this experiment the zeta potential of fe3o4 was 6 57 mv and the zeta potential of tc was 12 6 mv therefore further investigation to explore the physical and chemical effects of fe3o4 on the tc removal from the liquid was necessary another batch experiment proceeded with the same conditions as phase ii but without the addition of inoculum the results showed that the tc removal efficiency in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 3 9 12 7 17 7 21 3 and 38 1 respectively after 24 h reaction fig 2 c this finding meant that the tc removal efficiency increased approximately by 34 2 with the addition of 5 0 g l fe3o4 under abiotic condition compared with that of the control reactor to further confirm the pathways of fe3o4 enhancing tc removal efficiency under abiotic conditions physical absorption or chemocatalysis degradation the liquid was analyzed by lc ms the results indicated that no intermediate products were detected which implied that tc could not be degraded without the participation of microorganisms fig s2a in addition after the reaction the added fe3o4 was vacuum dried and then analyzed by fitr the results showed that the bands at approximate 1521 cm 1 1641 cm 1 and 3438 cm 1 assigned to no2 c n and nh were significantly higher than that observed with the initial fe3o4 fig s2b this finding meant that the extra tc removal in abiotic reactors was attributed to adsorption by fe3o4 considering that adsorption occurred during tc biodegraded process it was necessary to ascertain the further transformation of tc on the fe3o4 surface therefore at the end of cycle 4 the tc in solid phase was extracted by the solid phase extraction columns prepacked c18 cartridge then the extracting solution was analyzed by hplc the results showed that the residual tc in solid phase in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 0 046 mg 0 036 mg 0 029 mg 0 022 mg and 0 0069 mg respectively fig 2 d it can be found that the residual tc reached the maximum in the control reactor which meant that the inoculum sludge could also adsorb tc it might be the reason that the relatively rapid removal of tc in the initial ten hours in the control reactor combined with the abiotic experiments the amounts of tc adsorption in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors inoculum sludge adsorption and fe3o4 adsorption were higher than that of the control reactor inoculum sludge adsorption only however the residual tc in the solid phase decreased with the increment of fe3o4 these results indicated that at the solid phase tc removal efficiency is more efficient in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors compared with the control reactor therefore it could be concluded that during the tc biodegradation process tc was first adsorbed by fe3o4 and or inoculum sludge and then degraded by microorganisms and fe3o4 enhanced both the adsorption and biodegradation processes 3 3 ets activity xps and lc ms analysis ets activity as a method to embody microorganisms respiratory activity and sludge bioactivity could be quantified by measuring microbial respiration chain electron transfer efficiency the effects of fe3o4 on the ets are shown in fig 3 the results showed that ets activity had a positive correlation with the antibiotic removal efficiency which was in agreement with the previous study zhang et al 2018a the relative ets activity in 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 21 3 41 6 52 1 and 49 6 higher compared with the control reactor respectively the ets activity increased with the increment of fe3o4 within a certain concentration when the fe3o4 dosage reached 1 0 g l further increasing the fe3o4 dosage could not improve the ets activity significantly which was in agreement with the tc removal to further investigate the mechanism of fe3o4 promoting tc degradation after the experiment the initial fe3o4 fe3o4 in abiotic reactors and fe3o4 in 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor were analyzed by xps the results of the xps spectra analysis for fe and c elements on the surface of biotic fe3o4 are displayed in fig 4 the atomic abundance of fe c of the initial fe3o4 the abiotic fe3o4 in 5 0 g l reactor and the biotic fe3o4 in 5 0 g l reactor is shown in table s1 the regions of fe2p fig 4 a and c 1 s fig 4 b indicated the main fe containing and c containing species the peak at 711 4 ev was ascribed to aromatics attached to fe blomquist et al 1983 as shown in table s1 this binding area was increased only in the abiotic fe3o4 compared with the initial fe3o4 the increment of this peak in the abiotic fe3o4 should be ascribed to the adsorption of fe3o4 which was in agreement with the ftir results however compared with the abiotic fe3o4 the decrement of this peak in bio fe3o4 resulted from the biodegradation of adsorbed organics the peaks at 284 5 286 0 and 288 1 ev were related to the intermediates during the tc bio degradation which all reached the maximum in bio fe3o4 barber et al 1973 hammond et al 1981 sexton and avery 1983 these results indicated that tc was degraded with biocompatibility while in the abiotic conditions tc could not be degraded by fe3o4 the liquid collected from the cycle 4 of phase ii on the second day was analyzed by lc ms according to lc ms results the potential degradation pathway of tc is shown in fig 5 and the ms spectra are shown in fig s3 it was reported that tc reactive sites mainly included aromatic ring ketone group amino group and double bond he et al 2014 mboula et al 2012 in this experiment tc was first degraded into two main intermediates and their m z were 362 and 375 attacked by oh tc lost the acylamino group at c2 lost two n methyl at c6 and showed dehydration at c11 generating product 1 m z 362 in addition then product 1 transferred to product 2 m z 318 through cleavage of the carbon atomic ring next via decarboxylation at c5 in product 2 product 3 m z 274 was generated due to the oxidation of oh and hoo product 3 could produce product 4 m z 228 in dehydroxylation at c7 and lose a methyl at c5 then the carbon atomic ring in product 4 was further split to generate product 5 m z 202 and product 8 m z 114 the generation of product 6 mainly resulted from the loss of two n methyl at c6 and the deamidation reaction at c2 of tc yang et al 2018b subsequently product 7 and product 8 were generated by the ring opening reactions and dislodging hydroxyl or methyl groups dong et al 2018 finally the ring opening intermediates were further oxidized into co2 ch4 and h2o under the effects of anaerobic microorganisms 3 4 microbial community analysis after four cycles of operation the genus level identification of bacterial community structure in the five reactors is illustrated in fig 6 a the most prominent genus in the control reactor was pandoraea which accounted for over 70 of the bacteria 16s rrna gene sequences interestingly the abundance of pandoraea in the control reactor was approximately 2 8 times higher than the abundance in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors and their abundance decreased with the increment of fe3o4 content the pandoraea genus is non fermenting gram negative bacteria that is being considered as emerging multi antibiotic resistant bacteria calza et al 2003 in addition the pandoraea genus possesses the capability to degrade benzene compounds and or their derivatives jiang et al 2009 therefore it could be reasonably speculated that the degradation of tc was predominantly dependent on the pandoraea genus in the control reactor however the dominant genus of bacteria in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors were various and mainly contained six genera pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas escherichia shigella azonexus and desulfovibrio pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas and escherichia are known to be pathogens that can survive under antibiotic conditions owing to the multiple antibiotic resistance genes carried by their chromosomes liang et al 2014 tabatabaei et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a in addition they are important bacteria with a complex metabolism capable of degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and transferring their biologically active secondary metabolites including quinolones rhamnolipids lectins hydrogen cyanide and phenazines into simple organics fu et al 2018 it was reported that azonexus an acetate oxidizing electrogen is electroactive bacteria that could transfer an extracellular electron to insoluble conductive materials and or methanogens for ch4 production liu et al 2019 desulfovibrio has also been ascribed to pharmaceutical compound degradation participants which are mainly responsible for the transformation of nitro aromatics into corresponding aromatic amines wang et al 2019b in addition the enrichment of desulfovibrio species could promote h2 dependent methanogenesis wang et al 2019b moreover the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors was approximately 10 50 times higher than that in the control reactor clostridium sensu stricto could degrade natural organic matter and produce low molecular weight organic acids with the reduction of fe iii under strictly anaerobic environments fan et al 2018 therefore it could be concluded that in the control reactor the most dominant genus was only pandorarea over 70 and tc degradation only relied on the participation of pandoraea however in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors there were six bacterial genera whose 16s rrna abundance was found to exceed 10 by gene sequences and they were all related to the degradation of tc which guaranteed the high efficiency in the fe3o4 reactors fig 6 b shows the genus level identification of the archaea community structure in the five reactors the most abundant genus methanobacterium was significantly enriched in the fe3o4 reactor methanobacterium as the hydrogenotrophic methanogens could reduce co2 to ch4 with organic oxidation bacteria serving as the electron donor through syntrophic metabolism in addition a direct electron transfer pathway was postulated for methanobacterium by cheng et al 2009 in this report it was suggested that ch4 production by the mixed culture biofilm was sustained primarily from electrons released at the cathode but not by hydrogen gas combined with the abundance of bacteria azonexus desulfovibrio and clostridium sensu stricto enriched in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors it could be speculated that the addition of fe3o4 promoted the syntrophic metabolism for ch4 production and the organic removal through direct or indirect interspecies electron transfer processes the biological activity intensity of microbial communities could be reflected by the expression degree of related functional genes mitra et al 2011 kegg is a database that integrates information on genome chemistry and system function one of kegg s features is the association of gene catalogs from already sequenced genomes with system functions at higher levels of cell species and ecosystems kanehisa et al 2016 from fig 6 c it can be found that the total frequency in 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor were 15 2 28 4 70 6 and 27 0 higher compared with the control reactor which indicated that the total biological activity of microbial communities in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors was significantly enhanced especially in1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor through functional analysis of genome lots of functional pathways kegg classification were identified in the metagenomes of microbial communities in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor which agreed with the results of campanaro et al 2016 the dominant functional pathways were linked to membrane transport carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism replication and repair energy metabolism cellular processes and signaling with the supplementation of fe3o4 into the anaerobic reactor the metabolic activities of microbial communities were enhanced which made the anaerobic digestion system function better and hence gave a higher digester performance in the fe3o4 supplemented reactor compared with the control reactor 3 5 potential pathway of tc degradation in this study compared with the control reactor the tc removal efficiency increased by approximately 40 in 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor in the previous studies researchers used to ascribe the improvement of anaerobic digestion by fe3o4 to the establishment of diet lei et al 2018 however the bacteria widely known as diet participators i e geobacter were not detected in this experiment further analysis indicated that when fe3o4 was added into the reactors tc was firstly removed from the liquid phase through adsorption by fe3o4 and then the adsorbed tc in the solid phase was removed in the anaerobic biological process enhanced by fe3o4 because of adsorption and enrichment both tc and microbe adhered to fe3o4 surface which made the organics more available for microorganisms and improved the tc utilization efficiency vu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a the microbial community analysis found that more optional pathways of tc degradation were provided in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors first in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors multiple bacteria such as pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas escherichia shigella azonexus and desulfovibrio etc related to the tc decomposition were enriched which guaranteed the high tc remove efficiency second potential syntrophic metabolism was established in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors 1 potential syntrophic metabolism via h2 served as the electron carrier desulfovibrio species as the syntrophic bacteria not only participated in organics degradation but also promoted the h2 depended methanogenesis through producing h2 considering the enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium it could be reasonably speculated that adding fe3o4 into tc reactors could promote syntrophic metabolism between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium 2 potential syntrophic metabolism via diet azonexus the acetate oxidizing bacteria is capable of extracellular electron transfer to insoluble current harvesting anodes jangir et al 2016 and is therefore likely to be capable of serving as the electron donating partner during diet process liu et al 2019 subsequently liu et al 2019 conducted genomic characteristics of azonexus results indicated that these genomes have genes coding for numerous c type cytochrome proteins many of which have transmembrane helices the azonexus genomes also have 14 different genes that code for putative c type cytochromes with 2 or more heme groups and 2 or 3 genes that code for c type cytochrome proteins the expression of the genes associated with direct electron transfer in azonexus could be the evidence that azonexus participated in the diet process besides previous reports believed that methanobacterium could obtain electrons directly from the electrode to reduce co2 to ch4 cheng et al 2009 which was also enriched in the fe3o4 supplemented reactor therefore it was speculated that a new model of diet process for ch4 production possibly occurred between azonexus and methanobacterium 4 conclusions the addition of fe3o4 is an effective technology to improve tc degradation and methane production in anaerobic process mechanisms investigation indicated that in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors tc was firstly removed from the liquid phase through adsorption because of the different zeta potentials of fe3o4 and tc subsequently adsorbed tc was removed with the participation of anaerobic microorganisms microbial community analysis indicated that multiple bacteria such as pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas escherichia shigella azonexus and desulfovibrio etc related to the tc decomposition were enriched and the potential syntrophic metabolism between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium azonexus and methanobacterium were established in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors which meant that more optional pathways for tc degradation were available in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors kegg analysis indicated that with the supplementation of fe3o4 into the anaerobic reactors the metabolic activities of microbial communities were enhanced which made the anaerobic digestion system function better and hence gave a higher digester performance in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors compared with the control reactor declaration of competing interest the

17588,antibiotics contaminants for example tetracycline tc in the environment have attracted extensive attention around the world and appropriate treatments for such contaminants are urgently required in this study five groups of anaerobic reactors supplemented with different amounts of fe3o4 were operated periodically to investigate their performance on tc removal the results showed that fe3o4 effectively promoted tc removal compared with the control reactor the tc removal efficiency was increased by 7 3 when co digested with glucose and increased by 40 4 when mono tc was digested in reactors with 5 0 g l fe3o4 further analysis indicated that the probable mechanism of fe3o4 promoting tc removal was through tc being adsorbed from the liquid onto fe3o4 making tc more available for microbes to be biodegraded microbial community analysis indicated that the bacteria klebsiella pseudomonas and escherichia related to tc removal were enriched which meant more pathways for tc removal were available following the addition of fe3o4 in addition in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors syntrophic metabolism between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium azonexus and methanobacterium were possibly established which played an important role in improving tc removal and ch4 production the electron transport system data further confirmed these results the functional gene classification for kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg analysis demonstrated that the dominant functions enhanced by fe3o4 supplementation was microbial metabolic activities graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline adsorption fe3o4 syntrophic metabolism 1 introduction antibiotics are produced from natural such as nucleoside antibiotics or synthetic such as sulfamethoxazole norfloxacin processes and widely used as medical agents for humans and animals to kill or inhibit some bacteria including gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as animal feed additives song et al 2020 cao et al 2018 chen et al 2016 the overuse and misuse of antibiotics mean that they are detected frequently in the environment which results in huge potential threats for human health crane et al 2006 tetracycline tc has a high antimicrobial activity and a low cost and is thus a widely used antibiotic daghrir and drogui 2013 however the metabolic efficiency of tc varied with the condition of anaerobic digestion liu et al 2018 used the industrial scale anaerobic digester dispose the tc contained swine feces and the results showed that the tc removal efficiency was only 17 8 in summer the low metabolic efficiency of tc led to its accumulation in waste systems which was why its treatment process has been a subject of concern reyes et al 2006 various treatment processes including photocatalysis tc removal efficiency 74 ultrasound tc removal efficiency 99 adsorption tc removal efficiency 71 and electrochemistry tc removal efficiency 98 have been investigated to remove tc feng et al 2012 wang et al 2011 gao et al 2012 oturan et al 2013 however high coexisting organic matters in tc producing wastewater interfered with tc removal and greatly increased the operation costs which limited their application in tc wastewater treatment anaerobic digestion has been considered as a promising and economical process for high concentration recalcitrant pollutants in wastewater due to the lower costs and the higher energy efficiency pan et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 it has been reported that the anaerobic digestion process can effectively deal with some antibiotic wastewater with organic matter removal efficiency from 14 to 89 spielmeyer et al 2015 however in terms of tc wastewater the high concentration and biodegradation intermediates have strong bacteriostatic action that could deteriorate anaerobic biological treatment decreasing the treatment efficiency and inhibiting the ch4 production deng et al 2011 therefore a new anaerobic biological treatment technology is required effective approaches for improving tc anaerobic treatment efficiency include enhancing the microorganism activity and decreasing the antibacterial activity zhang et al 2018b previous studies indicated that adding fe3o4 into an anaerobic digester could promote the syntrophic metabolism between bacteria and methanogens and then enhanced the organics removal efficiency and biogas production about 10 45 and 18 50 respectively zhang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 zhao et al 2018a the mechanism was believed to be the ability of fe3o4 to enrich fe iii reducing microorganisms which were capable of participating in the decomposition of complex organics via dissimilatory iron reduction zhao et al 2017a in addition magnetite as the conductive material could function as an electron conduit to improve direct interspecies electron transfer diet during anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2017b diet is an alternative to interspecies h2 transfer iht for interspecies electron exchange during syntrophic metabolism which is more efficient for organics removal compared with iht zhao et al 2017b during anaerobic digestion process most researchers ascribed the promotion effects to the stimulation of microorganisms nevertheless abiotic experiments indicated that fe3o4 played an important role in segregating some specific pollutants for example magnetite or fe3o4 was used as the adsorbent to remove arsenic shahid et al 2019 so2 and no2 pham et al 2019 and glyphosate yang et al 2018a and the adsorption capacity was 12 69 mg arsenate 40 5 mg so2 108 5 mg no2 6 7 mg glyphosate on 1 g of adsorbent respectively to the best of our knowledge when adding magnetite into an anaerobic reactor few researchers focused on investigating the interaction between the effects on adsorption and biodegradation of magnetite in this study fe3o4 was added to an anaerobic reactor to enhance the removal efficiency of tc the overall objective of this study was as following 1 the effects of fe3o4 on tc removal efficiency during anaerobic digestion 2 synergistic role of adsorption and microbial metabolism of fe3o4 during tc anaerobic removal process 3 high throughput sequencing technology and functional gene classification for kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg were conducted to reveal the change of microbial community structure and functional gene 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and inoculum fe3o4 powder 0 1 mm purity approximately 97 was purchased from damao chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china tc glucose and other chemicals used in this experiment were obtained from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china inoculant sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester of wulongkou waste sludge treatment plant of zhengzhou china before the experiment the inoculum was cultured in a batch anaerobic reactor φ200 320 mm 10 l working volume the operating conditions and the substrates used for culturing the inocula were implemented according to a previous study zhao et al 2016b 2 2 operation batch experiments were conducted in five groups and 0 g l 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 were added to the groups all groups ran for four cycles with a 100 ml working volume 15 ml inoculum 85 ml substrates and each cycle lasted for five days in the first two cycles phase i 100 mg l tc and 1000 mg l glucose were used as the co substrates and in the last two cycles phase ii only 100 mg l tc was used as the substrate in addition nh4cl and kh2po4 were used as the nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively to give a chemical oxygen demand cod n p ratio of 200 5 1 the trace element stock solution was added to the substrates in the concentration of 1 ml l and the stock solution was prepared with the following composition znso4 7h2o 0 37 mm mnso4 2h2o 2 5 mm cuso4 5h2o 0 14 mm coso4 7h2o 8 4 mm nicl2 6h2o 0 25 mm h3bo3 0 8 mm and edta 3 4 mm before the start of every cycle the residual liquid in the reactors was removed and another 85 ml of fresh substrate was added as described above after the inoculum and substrates were added the bottles were sealed with silica gel stoppers subsequently 99 9 nitrogen was flushed into the serum bottles to maintain an anaerobic condition then all bottles were placed in an incubator 37 the tc concentration cod and vfas were analyzed every day and the collected biogas was analyzed at the end of every cycle the experiment to explore the adsorption of fe3o4 was conducted in another 15 serum bottles which was only conducted one cycle with the same condition as phase ii but no inoculum all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods the cod the component in the biogas ch4 and co2 and the concentration of fe2 were measured according to the previous studies li et al 2019 zhao et al 2018b 2016a the concentration of tc was analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan with a c18 column agilent 5 μm 4 6 mm 250 mm and the detailed process was the same as that described in a previous study chen et al 2011 the equivalent relationships between cod and substrates were as follows 1 42 g cod g tc 1 06 g cod g glucose the intermediate products of tc in the abiotic reactors were analyzed by a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms agilent 6410b palo alto usa with an electrospray ionization esi source the method for analyzing the electron transport system ets activity was according to the reduction of 2 piodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int to formazan intf and the detailed process was the same as a previous study zhang et al 2018a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker vertex 70 germany was performed with the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 using a nicolet 5700 spectrometer after dried sludge samples were prepared using the potassium kbr pellets method and the detailed process was according to zhao et al 2018c the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was conducted with the pass energy high resolution scan at 30 ev and a survey scan at 100 ev spectra were analyzed with xpspeak41 software raymond kwok and the detailed process was according to yu et al 2018 the zeta potential was measured by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instrument ltd uk high throughput gene pyrosequencing was performed for the microbial community analyses genomic dna was extracted from the suspended sludge collected from each reactor using a dna extraction kit bioteke corporation beijing china according to the manufacturer s instructions the detailed methods were according to the references li et al 2016a 2016b the program picrust pipelines were applied to predict the metagenomics information of the microbial metabolic function using the kegg databases zhang et al 2016 2 4 calculation the cod or tc removal efficiency was evaluated by the following formula 1 1 re c initial c final c initial 100 where re is the organics removal efficiency i e cod or tc removal efficiency cinitial is the concentration of cod or tc at the initial of every cycle and cfinal is the concentration of cod or tc at the end of every cycle methane conversion efficiency mce ml

in the liquid at the initial of every cycle mg and organicssample is the organics content in the samples collected from the reactors that were used for measurement mg 3 the results and discussion 3 1 performance of the anaerobic reactor this experiment was divided into two phases phase i co digestion of glucose and tc phase ii mono digestion of tc and each phase proceeded for two cycles cod removal and biogas production are important parameters to evaluate the performance of anaerobic digestion the cod removal efficiency is exhibited in fig 1 a the results showed that the cod removal efficiency was enhanced in all reactors with fe3o4 addition after five days of digestion the cod removal efficiency in cycle 2 was 71 6 72 6 80 2 82 2 and 82 7 in the five reactors 0 g l 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 respectively the cod removal efficiency in the 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was approximately 15 higher compared with the control reactor 0 g l in phase ii with the removal of glucose from the inflow the cod removal efficiency in the control reactor deteriorated extremely after five days of digestion in cycle 4 the cod removal efficiency in the control reactor declined to 50 5 while the cod removal efficiency remained over 70 in the reactors with fe3o4 except for the 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor which was 67 9 this finding meant that fe3o4 could help either co digestion of glucose and tc or mono digestion of tc and the cod removal efficiency was positively related to the dosage of fe3o4 the better performance of the reactors supplemented with fe3o4 might be that fe3o4 could help the microbial communities to adapt to organics variation and thus enhance the removal efficiency wang et al 2019a accumulated ch4 production is shown in fig 1 b and ch4 production was also increased with the addition of fe3o4 which was in agreement with the cod removal comparatively the ch4 production in 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactors was 15 7 18 6 28 9 and 27 0 higher than the control reactor respectively in cycle 2 in phase ii with the removal of glucose from the inflow the ch4 production in all reactors declined because of the decrement of organic substrates from glucose and tc to tc only 3 2 tc removal efficiency similar to the cod removal efficiency the tc removal efficiency was also steadily improved with the addition of fe3o4 as shown in fig 2 a specifically in cycle 1 after five days of digestion the tc removal efficiency in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 60 0 66 3 72 2 80 3 and 80 7 respectively in cycle 2 the tc removal efficiency in all reactors increased compared with cycle 1 especially in the control reactor which might be because that in cycle 2 the microbial community adapted to the tc loading of 100 mg l in phase ii glucose was removed from the inflow and tc was used as the only carbon source in general the tc removal efficiency in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors in cycle 3 and cycle 4 exhibited no obvious difference with cycle 2 nevertheless the tc removal efficiency declined immediately in the control reactor after five days of digestion in cycle 3 the tc removal efficiency in 0 1 g l 0 5 g l 1 0 g l and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactors was 94 7 97 7 97 4 and 99 0 respectively while it was only 58 6 in the control reactor it might be because that the deficiency of the preferred carbon source i e glucose for the microbial community directly resulted in the sharp reduction of tc removal efficiency in the control reactor which meant that the co digestion of tc and glucose could increase the tc removal efficiency the potential mechanism might be that the easier degraded glucose was more available for microbial growth and metabolism compared with the refractory tc which was in agreement with previous study donoso bravo et al 2009 however in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors although glucose was removed from the inflow the tc removal efficiency was not influenced the tc removal efficiencies in fe3o4 reactors were even 36 1 higher than that in the control reactor which indicated that in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors the microbial community could metabolize tc efficiently as the only carbon source one possible reason was that the microorganism activity was enhanced by the dissimilatory iron reduction process of fe3o4 zhang et al 2020 which was in agreement with changes of fe2 fig s1 in addition in cycle 2 over 60 of tc was removed on the first day in the control reactor and approximately 70 of tc was removed in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors therefore it was necessary to further point out the exact removal efficiency of tc within the first day as shown in fig 2 b the removal of tc from the liquid on the first day mainly happened at the initial 10 h during which over 50 of tc was removed in addition the removal efficiency in 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was approximately 30 higher than that in the control reactor at the tenth hour previous experiments indicated that fe3o4 could be used as the adsorbent for pollutant removal tomašovičová et al 2019 yang et al 2018a because of the opposite zeta potentials of organics and fe3o4 in this experiment the zeta potential of fe3o4 was 6 57 mv and the zeta potential of tc was 12 6 mv therefore further investigation to explore the physical and chemical effects of fe3o4 on the tc removal from the liquid was necessary another batch experiment proceeded with the same conditions as phase ii but without the addition of inoculum the results showed that the tc removal efficiency in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 3 9 12 7 17 7 21 3 and 38 1 respectively after 24 h reaction fig 2 c this finding meant that the tc removal efficiency increased approximately by 34 2 with the addition of 5 0 g l fe3o4 under abiotic condition compared with that of the control reactor to further confirm the pathways of fe3o4 enhancing tc removal efficiency under abiotic conditions physical absorption or chemocatalysis degradation the liquid was analyzed by lc ms the results indicated that no intermediate products were detected which implied that tc could not be degraded without the participation of microorganisms fig s2a in addition after the reaction the added fe3o4 was vacuum dried and then analyzed by fitr the results showed that the bands at approximate 1521 cm 1 1641 cm 1 and 3438 cm 1 assigned to no2 c n and nh were significantly higher than that observed with the initial fe3o4 fig s2b this finding meant that the extra tc removal in abiotic reactors was attributed to adsorption by fe3o4 considering that adsorption occurred during tc biodegraded process it was necessary to ascertain the further transformation of tc on the fe3o4 surface therefore at the end of cycle 4 the tc in solid phase was extracted by the solid phase extraction columns prepacked c18 cartridge then the extracting solution was analyzed by hplc the results showed that the residual tc in solid phase in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 0 046 mg 0 036 mg 0 029 mg 0 022 mg and 0 0069 mg respectively fig 2 d it can be found that the residual tc reached the maximum in the control reactor which meant that the inoculum sludge could also adsorb tc it might be the reason that the relatively rapid removal of tc in the initial ten hours in the control reactor combined with the abiotic experiments the amounts of tc adsorption in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors inoculum sludge adsorption and fe3o4 adsorption were higher than that of the control reactor inoculum sludge adsorption only however the residual tc in the solid phase decreased with the increment of fe3o4 these results indicated that at the solid phase tc removal efficiency is more efficient in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors compared with the control reactor therefore it could be concluded that during the tc biodegradation process tc was first adsorbed by fe3o4 and or inoculum sludge and then degraded by microorganisms and fe3o4 enhanced both the adsorption and biodegradation processes 3 3 ets activity xps and lc ms analysis ets activity as a method to embody microorganisms respiratory activity and sludge bioactivity could be quantified by measuring microbial respiration chain electron transfer efficiency the effects of fe3o4 on the ets are shown in fig 3 the results showed that ets activity had a positive correlation with the antibiotic removal efficiency which was in agreement with the previous study zhang et al 2018a the relative ets activity in 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor was 21 3 41 6 52 1 and 49 6 higher compared with the control reactor respectively the ets activity increased with the increment of fe3o4 within a certain concentration when the fe3o4 dosage reached 1 0 g l further increasing the fe3o4 dosage could not improve the ets activity significantly which was in agreement with the tc removal to further investigate the mechanism of fe3o4 promoting tc degradation after the experiment the initial fe3o4 fe3o4 in abiotic reactors and fe3o4 in 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor were analyzed by xps the results of the xps spectra analysis for fe and c elements on the surface of biotic fe3o4 are displayed in fig 4 the atomic abundance of fe c of the initial fe3o4 the abiotic fe3o4 in 5 0 g l reactor and the biotic fe3o4 in 5 0 g l reactor is shown in table s1 the regions of fe2p fig 4 a and c 1 s fig 4 b indicated the main fe containing and c containing species the peak at 711 4 ev was ascribed to aromatics attached to fe blomquist et al 1983 as shown in table s1 this binding area was increased only in the abiotic fe3o4 compared with the initial fe3o4 the increment of this peak in the abiotic fe3o4 should be ascribed to the adsorption of fe3o4 which was in agreement with the ftir results however compared with the abiotic fe3o4 the decrement of this peak in bio fe3o4 resulted from the biodegradation of adsorbed organics the peaks at 284 5 286 0 and 288 1 ev were related to the intermediates during the tc bio degradation which all reached the maximum in bio fe3o4 barber et al 1973 hammond et al 1981 sexton and avery 1983 these results indicated that tc was degraded with biocompatibility while in the abiotic conditions tc could not be degraded by fe3o4 the liquid collected from the cycle 4 of phase ii on the second day was analyzed by lc ms according to lc ms results the potential degradation pathway of tc is shown in fig 5 and the ms spectra are shown in fig s3 it was reported that tc reactive sites mainly included aromatic ring ketone group amino group and double bond he et al 2014 mboula et al 2012 in this experiment tc was first degraded into two main intermediates and their m z were 362 and 375 attacked by oh tc lost the acylamino group at c2 lost two n methyl at c6 and showed dehydration at c11 generating product 1 m z 362 in addition then product 1 transferred to product 2 m z 318 through cleavage of the carbon atomic ring next via decarboxylation at c5 in product 2 product 3 m z 274 was generated due to the oxidation of oh and hoo product 3 could produce product 4 m z 228 in dehydroxylation at c7 and lose a methyl at c5 then the carbon atomic ring in product 4 was further split to generate product 5 m z 202 and product 8 m z 114 the generation of product 6 mainly resulted from the loss of two n methyl at c6 and the deamidation reaction at c2 of tc yang et al 2018b subsequently product 7 and product 8 were generated by the ring opening reactions and dislodging hydroxyl or methyl groups dong et al 2018 finally the ring opening intermediates were further oxidized into co2 ch4 and h2o under the effects of anaerobic microorganisms 3 4 microbial community analysis after four cycles of operation the genus level identification of bacterial community structure in the five reactors is illustrated in fig 6 a the most prominent genus in the control reactor was pandoraea which accounted for over 70 of the bacteria 16s rrna gene sequences interestingly the abundance of pandoraea in the control reactor was approximately 2 8 times higher than the abundance in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors and their abundance decreased with the increment of fe3o4 content the pandoraea genus is non fermenting gram negative bacteria that is being considered as emerging multi antibiotic resistant bacteria calza et al 2003 in addition the pandoraea genus possesses the capability to degrade benzene compounds and or their derivatives jiang et al 2009 therefore it could be reasonably speculated that the degradation of tc was predominantly dependent on the pandoraea genus in the control reactor however the dominant genus of bacteria in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors were various and mainly contained six genera pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas escherichia shigella azonexus and desulfovibrio pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas and escherichia are known to be pathogens that can survive under antibiotic conditions owing to the multiple antibiotic resistance genes carried by their chromosomes liang et al 2014 tabatabaei et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a in addition they are important bacteria with a complex metabolism capable of degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and transferring their biologically active secondary metabolites including quinolones rhamnolipids lectins hydrogen cyanide and phenazines into simple organics fu et al 2018 it was reported that azonexus an acetate oxidizing electrogen is electroactive bacteria that could transfer an extracellular electron to insoluble conductive materials and or methanogens for ch4 production liu et al 2019 desulfovibrio has also been ascribed to pharmaceutical compound degradation participants which are mainly responsible for the transformation of nitro aromatics into corresponding aromatic amines wang et al 2019b in addition the enrichment of desulfovibrio species could promote h2 dependent methanogenesis wang et al 2019b moreover the abundance of clostridium sensu stricto in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors was approximately 10 50 times higher than that in the control reactor clostridium sensu stricto could degrade natural organic matter and produce low molecular weight organic acids with the reduction of fe iii under strictly anaerobic environments fan et al 2018 therefore it could be concluded that in the control reactor the most dominant genus was only pandorarea over 70 and tc degradation only relied on the participation of pandoraea however in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors there were six bacterial genera whose 16s rrna abundance was found to exceed 10 by gene sequences and they were all related to the degradation of tc which guaranteed the high efficiency in the fe3o4 reactors fig 6 b shows the genus level identification of the archaea community structure in the five reactors the most abundant genus methanobacterium was significantly enriched in the fe3o4 reactor methanobacterium as the hydrogenotrophic methanogens could reduce co2 to ch4 with organic oxidation bacteria serving as the electron donor through syntrophic metabolism in addition a direct electron transfer pathway was postulated for methanobacterium by cheng et al 2009 in this report it was suggested that ch4 production by the mixed culture biofilm was sustained primarily from electrons released at the cathode but not by hydrogen gas combined with the abundance of bacteria azonexus desulfovibrio and clostridium sensu stricto enriched in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors it could be speculated that the addition of fe3o4 promoted the syntrophic metabolism for ch4 production and the organic removal through direct or indirect interspecies electron transfer processes the biological activity intensity of microbial communities could be reflected by the expression degree of related functional genes mitra et al 2011 kegg is a database that integrates information on genome chemistry and system function one of kegg s features is the association of gene catalogs from already sequenced genomes with system functions at higher levels of cell species and ecosystems kanehisa et al 2016 from fig 6 c it can be found that the total frequency in 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor were 15 2 28 4 70 6 and 27 0 higher compared with the control reactor which indicated that the total biological activity of microbial communities in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors was significantly enhanced especially in1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor through functional analysis of genome lots of functional pathways kegg classification were identified in the metagenomes of microbial communities in the control reactor 0 1 g l fe3o4 reactor 0 5 g l fe3o4 reactor 1 0 g l fe3o4 reactor and 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor which agreed with the results of campanaro et al 2016 the dominant functional pathways were linked to membrane transport carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism replication and repair energy metabolism cellular processes and signaling with the supplementation of fe3o4 into the anaerobic reactor the metabolic activities of microbial communities were enhanced which made the anaerobic digestion system function better and hence gave a higher digester performance in the fe3o4 supplemented reactor compared with the control reactor 3 5 potential pathway of tc degradation in this study compared with the control reactor the tc removal efficiency increased by approximately 40 in 5 0 g l fe3o4 reactor in the previous studies researchers used to ascribe the improvement of anaerobic digestion by fe3o4 to the establishment of diet lei et al 2018 however the bacteria widely known as diet participators i e geobacter were not detected in this experiment further analysis indicated that when fe3o4 was added into the reactors tc was firstly removed from the liquid phase through adsorption by fe3o4 and then the adsorbed tc in the solid phase was removed in the anaerobic biological process enhanced by fe3o4 because of adsorption and enrichment both tc and microbe adhered to fe3o4 surface which made the organics more available for microorganisms and improved the tc utilization efficiency vu et al 2020 wang et al 2019a the microbial community analysis found that more optional pathways of tc degradation were provided in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors first in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors multiple bacteria such as pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas escherichia shigella azonexus and desulfovibrio etc related to the tc decomposition were enriched which guaranteed the high tc remove efficiency second potential syntrophic metabolism was established in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors 1 potential syntrophic metabolism via h2 served as the electron carrier desulfovibrio species as the syntrophic bacteria not only participated in organics degradation but also promoted the h2 depended methanogenesis through producing h2 considering the enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium it could be reasonably speculated that adding fe3o4 into tc reactors could promote syntrophic metabolism between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium 2 potential syntrophic metabolism via diet azonexus the acetate oxidizing bacteria is capable of extracellular electron transfer to insoluble current harvesting anodes jangir et al 2016 and is therefore likely to be capable of serving as the electron donating partner during diet process liu et al 2019 subsequently liu et al 2019 conducted genomic characteristics of azonexus results indicated that these genomes have genes coding for numerous c type cytochrome proteins many of which have transmembrane helices the azonexus genomes also have 14 different genes that code for putative c type cytochromes with 2 or more heme groups and 2 or 3 genes that code for c type cytochrome proteins the expression of the genes associated with direct electron transfer in azonexus could be the evidence that azonexus participated in the diet process besides previous reports believed that methanobacterium could obtain electrons directly from the electrode to reduce co2 to ch4 cheng et al 2009 which was also enriched in the fe3o4 supplemented reactor therefore it was speculated that a new model of diet process for ch4 production possibly occurred between azonexus and methanobacterium 4 conclusions the addition of fe3o4 is an effective technology to improve tc degradation and methane production in anaerobic process mechanisms investigation indicated that in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors tc was firstly removed from the liquid phase through adsorption because of the different zeta potentials of fe3o4 and tc subsequently adsorbed tc was removed with the participation of anaerobic microorganisms microbial community analysis indicated that multiple bacteria such as pandoraea klebsiella pseudomonas escherichia shigella azonexus and desulfovibrio etc related to the tc decomposition were enriched and the potential syntrophic metabolism between desulfovibrio and methanobacterium azonexus and methanobacterium were established in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors which meant that more optional pathways for tc degradation were available in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors kegg analysis indicated that with the supplementation of fe3o4 into the anaerobic reactors the metabolic activities of microbial communities were enhanced which made the anaerobic digestion system function better and hence gave a higher digester performance in the fe3o4 supplemented reactors compared with the control reactor declaration of competing interest the

17589,low energy and cost solutions are needed to combat raising water needs in urbanised areas and produce high quality recycled water in this study we investigated key processes that drive a unique greywater treatment train consisting of a passive green wall biofiltration system followed by disinfection using a boron doped diamond bdd electrode with a solid polymer electrolyte spe in both systems the treatment was performed without any additional chemicals and pollutants of concern were monitored for process evaluation the green wall system removed over 90 of turbidity apparent colour chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon and biological oxygen demand and 1 log of e coli and total coliforms mostly through biological processes the green wall effluent met several proposed greywater reuse guidelines except for e coli and total coliform treatment below 10 mpn 100 ml further disinfection of treated greywater contained 28 mg l cl and electrical conductivity ec of 181 3 µs cm by electrolysis at current density 25 ma cm2 inactivated over 3 5 logs of both e coli and total coliforms in 10 15 min of electrolysis resulting in recycled water with less than 2 mpn 100 ml a synergistic effect between electrochemically generated free chlorines and reactive oxygen species contributed to the inactivation process although the treated water contained diluted chloride and had low ec estimated energy consumption was just 0 63 0 83 kwh m3 this is the first study to show the effectiveness of a low energy and a low cost greywater treatment train that combines green urban infrastructure with bdd electrochemical treatment process with spe offering a reliable and an environmentally friendly method for greywater reuse graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords passive treatment disinfection e coli electrochemical treatment boron doped diamond electrode solid polymer electrolyte 1 introduction recycling of urban wastewater has been receiving increasing attention to combat water shortages and satisfy the proliferating demand of freshwater and groundwater in both developing and developed countries paulo et al 2013 patil and munavalli 2016 a particular interest has been paid to using greywater as a potential water source because of its low pollutant levels reasonably consistent supply low seasonal variations and it requires limited transport because it can be reused locally close to where it was created li et al 2009 when treated greywater can be used in many ways such as irrigation of gardens and parks toilet flushing and industrial processes li et al 2009 recently treated greywater has also been considered for agricultural crop growing in urbanised areas eregno et al 2017 showing significant benefits in appropriate greywater treatment the removal of pollutants of concern from greywater has been reported for several processes including physical processes such as sand filtration friedler et al 2005 physio chemical as in electro coagulation lin et al 2005 vegetated filtration systems such as wetlands li et al 2004 and recently living walls narrow biofiltration systems with climbing plants fowdar et al 2017 and green walls vertical wall mounted vegetated systems with distinct soil plants and support structure prodanovic et al 2019 vegetated treatment systems are preferred systems for further research and development because they offer multiple benefits to the community including their aesthetic and amenity and they require a small footprint in our dense land limited urban environments li et al 2004 paulo et al 2013 although vegetated systems have been reported to effectively remove solid pollutants and nutrients prodanovic et al 2019 their removal of pathogens is more variable and can only achieve around 1 log removal in well designed biofiltration systems chandrasena et al 2014 ramprasad et al 2017 including green walls prodanovic et al 2020 to comply with proposed guidelines for greywater reuse li et al 2009 epa victoria 2013 and avoid the risk of contamination with disease causing microorganisms blanky et al 2017 additional disinfection steps are usually necessary disinfection by sodium hypochlorite is among the most commonly used methods in greywater treatment friedler et al 2005 lin et al 2005 and disinfection by advanced oxidation by tio2 based photocatalysis has also been reported li et al 2004 however to avoid the costs and risks associated with the transport and addition of chemicals in situ generation of disinfecting reagents is a more sustainable option in recent years effective advanced electrochemical disinfection methods have been developed and tested in removing a wide spectrum of harmful microorganisms by in situ generated oxidants radjenovic and sedlak 2015 martinez huitle et al 2015 electrochemical processes have been proven to be more effective than the use of a variety of chemicals due to its ability to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh with disinfection efficiency about 105 times higher than disinfection with chlorine cho et al 2004 the electrochemical process has the merit of no transport storage or addition of chemicals furthermore oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and chlorine can be generated from the water itself or from the constituents present in the water martinez huitle and brillas 2008 however one main limitation of the electrochemical process is that it depends on concentration of ions in the water to allow for the flow of current in the electrolytic cell hence high voltages are sometimes needed to achieve electric currents in low electric conductivity mediums martinez huitle et al 2015 fortunately this limitation can be avoided by using solid polymer electrolytes spes clematis et al 2017 in addition to facilitating the flow of current in the electrolytic cell anodic electrochemical ozone production is reported when using spe with anode materials that have a high oxygen overvoltage such as pbo2 da silva et al 2003 sno2 zakaria and christensen 2014 and boron doped diamond bdd electrodes choi et al 2015 high oxygen overpotential electrodes namely bdd exhibit good performance and stability properties in removing a variety of pollutants from water and wastewater radjenovic and sedlak 2015 bdd has shown high efficiency in the disinfection of various microorganisms in both chloride containing andres garcia 2018 ziemba et al 2019 and chloride free media li et al 2010 bakheet et al 2018a a previous study investigated the disinfection efficiency of pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa by bdd electrode with spe in synthetic water in the presence and absence of chloride rajab et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge the disinfection of greywater containing low electrical conductivity by bdd with spe has not been reported in this work we investigate the combination of a passive vegetated green wall biofiltration system which are starting to dominate urban fabric and for the first time subsequent low energy disinfection using a bdd electrode with spe providing an efficient treatment train for recycling greywater this is an important step toward practical implementation of electrochemical water treatment systems which was previously lacking in the literature garcia segura et al 2020 since this has not been done in the past we need to solve some fundamental challenges firstly it is not clear if low electric conductivity of greywater will interfere with the disinfection process and if the use of spe will generate enough ozone for effective and quick disinfection in the bulk solution rajab et al 2015 secondly we need to understand which processes will be dominant in pathogen inactivation for greywater treatment thirdly we must understand whether ozone generation can lower the unwanted levels of water colouration slight yellow hue which is caused by organic materials used in green wall media prodanovic et al 2020 finally what will be the overall energy consumption of the whole process and how will the process interact with other greywater parameters required for reuse bod ph ec etc these research questions have not been studied in the past and will have to be answered to understand the complete effectiveness of proposed greywater treatment train to answer these research questions this project will i assess bdd electrode disinfection processes when a spe is used on greywater that has been pre treated using a green wall ii understand if greywater reuse guideline recommendations are met within the combined treatment system iii examine the change in e coli as a reference pathogen for wastewater recycling cell morphology before and after electrolysis and finally iv estimate the energy consumption of the electrochemical system with spe to evaluate practical merit of using this technology to our knowledge this is the first study to explore the processes and effectiveness of a low energy and a low cost greywater treatment train that combines green urban infrastructure with bdd electrochemical treatment process with spe offering a reliable and environmentally friendly method for greywater reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a synthetic greywater mix was prepared by combining a secondary treated wastewater effluent obtained from an urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp in victoria australia and a laboratory synthesized greywater recipe following a protocol described in literature diaper et al 2008 this synthetic mix has been extensively used in the literature fowdar et al 2017 prodanovic et al 2020 and has allowed us to maintain controlled pollution concentrations throughout the tests the concentration of pollutants in this mix is closely matched to those in the light greywater from household showers and hand basins see supplementary material table s1 for details the greywater was dosed with lab cultured e coli to a final concentration of 2 104 mpn 100 ml centrifuged and double washed with di water to completely remove traces of nutrient rich e coli growing solution with total coliform levels of 4 104 mpn 100 ml which is within the reported range of greywater literature eriksson et al 2002 e coli was used as a microorganism indicator for faecal contamination nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 due to its persistence in greywater shown by scientific literature and for being the most common and often only indicator organism used in wastewater recycling guidelines worldwide ernst et al 2007 us epa 2012 epa victoria 2013 the treatment of greywater was carried out in two stages fig 1 the first stage was green wall treatment fig 1a followed by a second stage which was the electrochemical treatment fig 1b the experimental procedures along with the apparatus used in each stage are presented in the following sections 2 1 1 green wall biofiltration experiment the green wall was set in an open air greenhouse with a clear impermeable roof exposed to outside temperature conditions but not the rain commercially available planter pots atlantis australia were used for the green wall design fig 1a with three vertical pots dimensions 200 width 200 depth 150 height mm making one testing configuration with total depth 450 mm the use of the full scale pot based green wall system replicates realistic naturally occurring phenomena water flow paths root growth plant sun exposure etc onto experimental setup the irrigation water was dosed at the top of the system and water gravity dripped to lower pots fig 1a each pot held approximately 6 l of soil medium the pots were filled with a mix of perlite and coco coir with a ratio of 1 2 this media mix was selected based on our previous studies prodanovic et al 2017 prodanovic et al 2018 indicating its efficiency in removing several pollutants from greywater the media mix had 90 porosity which made pore volume of the pot approximately 5 4 l each pot was planted with one carex appressa plant and the system was well established under regular daily greywater dosing before our current experiment the system had an equivalent year of use before these tests were made carex appressa has shown to be one of the best performers in removing nutrients from greywater in our previous studies prodanovic et al 2019 five replicates of green wall test configurations were used for these experiments the synthetic greywater inflow was dripped into the first pot of each configuration see fig 1a using a six dripper irrigation system with 8 l h flow rate for a total of 30 mins delivering 4 l per configuration the total treated greywater effluent from the bottom of each configuration was collected approximately 3 l per configuration and 15 l for all five replicates with total drainage time of 1 hour see fig 1a and effluents from all five replicates were volumetrically mixed to form three replicate 2 l samples on day 1 and three replicate 4 l samples on day 2 for electrochemical treatment process across two consecutive days these testing volumes correspond to 1 previously studied daily treatment efficiency of green walls up to 30 l m2 per day prodanovic et al 2019 2 assume that the electrochemical disinfection for the selected volume 2 l or 4 l would take less than 1 h and 3 all of the effluent from a 1m2 green wall could be treated each day and within 24 hours this is a conservative estimate since the electrochemical disinfection unit as described in the next section is expected to operate with higher efficiency than 4 l h all samples were used and or processed within 5 h of collection 2 1 2 electrochemical disinfection experiment the electrochemical system consisted of a sandwich containing an anode a cation exchange membrane cem and a cathode all of which was framed in an acrylic housing and bolted together in 3 points using polycarbonate bolts and nails kraft et al 2006 the cation exchange membrane cem ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international u s a thus acts as a solid polymer electrolyte spe the sandwich was then located in between two acrylic containers each with an inner volume of 200 ml inner dimensions lx w x d 20 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm it is important to note that the cem completely separated the two compartments fig 1b the anode was niobium mesh based bdd purchased from neocoat switzerland with overall size 50 cm2 5 cm x 10 cm but the acrylic housing meant that the apparent surface area was only 40 cm2 a stainless steel mesh with similar dimensions was used as a cathode fig 1b greywater was circulated through the anodic compartment and distilled deionized water diw containing 50 mg l nacl electrolyte was circulated through the cathodic compartment fig 1b both with flowrate maintained at 500 ml min and electrolysis was performed under galvanostatic conditions in this configuration in addition to possible ozone generation kraft et al 2006 the divided electrolytic cell is commonly used in mechanism studies as possible reduction of oxidants at the cathode surface is avoided and thus oxidants are more precisely quantified than when using an undivided cell bagastyo et al 2011 bagastyo et al 2012 in order to further increase the homogeneity of the solution the solutions were also well mixed at 500 rpm using magnetic stirring plates fig 1b bagastyo et al 2011 electrochemical disinfection efficiency experiments were conducted separately for 2 litre and 4 litre samples and conducted across both days of the experiment all experiments were repeated in triplicate as a control another triplicate experiment was carried out using e coli directly dosed in diw 2 l without using the supporting electrolyte in order to explore the effectiveness of electro generated reactive oxygen species aliquots were taken at different time intervals for analysis of selected water quality parameters of concern for greywater reuse li et al 2009 and also for electro generated oxidant detection to reduce measurement uncertainty all samples were analysed or preserved for further analysis within two hours of collection 2 2 analysis 2 2 1 total coliforms and e coli concentration and morphology concentrations of e coli and total coliforms were tested using colilert methods idexx std methods 9223b random duplicates were taken for every ten samples to ensure method reliability cell morphology before and after 30 min of electrolysis in greywater and diw spiked with e coli were examined using a jeol 1400 plus transmission electron microscope at 80 kv the protocol for samples preparation for tem imaging is described elsewhere bakheet et al 2018a 2 2 2 analysis of physico chemical parameters measurement of chemical oxygen demands cod was performed using hach chemical kits hach pacific australia and a uv spectroscopy technique with a detection range of 3 1500 mg l cod total organic carbon toc was analysed using a shimadzu toc v cph cpn toc analyser biological oxygen demand bod5 was tested in a nata certified facility using standard methods national association of testing authorities australia als environmental victoria australia concentration of cl was analysed using the silver nitrate 0 0141 n titration method method no 8225 and chloride 2 indicator powder pillow hach australia 2017 colour was tested in the sample against the pt co standard using a hach dr 5000 uv spectrophotometer hach pacific australia this method was appropriate due to low effluent sample turbidity and yellow hue likely produced by organics from the green wall media prodanovic et al 2020 electrical conductivity and ph were measured using dedicated hach ec and ph meters hach pacific australia 2 2 3 oxidant detection electrochemical production of oh was investigated by using n n dimethyl p nitrosoaniline rno sigma aldrich australia as an oh probe compound choi et al 2015 initial rno concentration of 5 mg l was dissolved in diw only and also in diw containing 28 mg l cl electrolysed for 30 min and the change of its absorbance at 440 nm was monitored using uv vis spectrophotometer long life oxidants including free chlorine species cl2 hclo clo o3 h2o2 combined were detected by using n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method aph 2005 method no 10069 with dpd free chlorine reagent powder pillows and hach dr 5000 uv spectrophotometer hach pacific australia the concentration of h2o2 was measured with 2 9 dimethyl 1 10 phenanthroline dmp method and uv vis spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at 454 nm baga et al 1988 dissolved ozone concentration was determined by the indigo trisulfonate method and a uv vis spectrophotometer where indigo decolourization was monitored at 600 nm bader 1982 3 results and discussion 3 1 green wall filtration of greywater table 1 shows the characteristics of greywater in the inflow untreated influent and outflow of the green wall effluent the green wall removed about 95 of the inflow turbidity from 55 to 2 5 ntu and 98 of tss from 91 to 1 4 mg l with physical straining of these particles in the filter media reported as the main removal mechanism prodanovic et al 2020 consistent with turbidity removal and visual observation 92 of apparent colour was also removed from 449 to 35 pt co as shown previously while green walls managed to remove apparent colour through fine particle filtration it likely contributed to a new yellow hue of the effluent due to leaching of tannins from coco coir media prodanovic et al 2020 the green wall removed about 96 90 and 99 of cod toc and bod5 respectively table 1 the removal of cod by both physico chemical and biological activities has been previously reported for green walls prodanovic et al 2017 2020 the results suggest that the removal of toc and bod by the biofilter likely occurred by aerobic degradation in its upper layer fowdar et al 2017 the electrical conductivity ec which also represents the ions in the greywater increased slightly in the outflow from 173 to 183 µs cm probably due to leaching of built up salt inside the filter prodanovic et al 2020 however long term experiments on green walls reported that slow ec build up in the media and effluent were not significantly impacting the performance of the system prodanovic et al 2020 additionally the ph in the outflow increased slightly from 6 62 to 7 18 likely due to co2 accumulated within the media by the high activity of the c appressa plant mwagona et al 2019 chloride cl levels remained consistent after passing greywater through the green wall 28 mg l the green wall also removed around 1 logarithm 90 of e coli and total coliforms table 1 these results are in agreement with previous findings for green wall systems prodanovic et al 2020 and other biofiltration systems where 90 removal of e coli was obtained ramprasad et al 2017 biological processes including adsorption to biofilm predation by other microorganisms and natural die off are considered the predominant factors for e coli removal chandrasena et al 2014 in addition to plant uptake and potential plant leaching of anti microbial agents shirdashtzadeh et al 2017 with the exception of colour e coli and total coliforms all tested parameters in the effluent met the proposed greywater reuse guidelines for unrestricted public access table 1 however to fully comply with these guidelines electrochemical disinfection process was used to further treat and disinfect the effluent of the green wall system and reduce the effluent s true colour organic yellow hue 3 2 electrochemical disinfection initially experiments with control samples were conducted where all electrolysis conditions were employed but without applying an electric current which showed no significant change of e coli and total coliform concentrations after 30 mins supplementary material figure s1 this was done to rule out any factors of the electrochemical experiment that may cause cell damage such as the mechanical stress which could be caused by high mixing rates lacasa et al 2013 the concentrations of e coli and total coliform during electrolysis at current density 25 ma cm2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively fig 2a shows that the initial e coli concentration decreased rapidly and complete disinfection 99 95 removal occurred within just 10 and 15 min when 2 and 4 l were treated respectively likewise total coliforms were also completely removed albeit with slightly higher required disinfection times as compared to e coli fig 2b this result indicates that bacterial inactivation predominately occurred via oxidative stress caused by electro generated oxidants lacasa et al 2013 with total coliform population containing somewhat more resistant species compared to e coli needing longer treatment time in 4 l sample notably as a function of charge per volume less charge was required for 4 l 0 063 ah l compared to 2 l 0 083 ah l for complete inactivation fig 2a and fig 2b while most research focused on investigating the influence of current density on the removal efficiency as a function of charge per volume cano et al 2012 our results show that testing the effect of initially treated volume is also a crucial step towards further optimizing the electrochemical system for scaling up purposes for instance for e coli disinfection our result in fig 2a suggests a non linear relation between treated volumes and time required for treatment i e 10 mins for 2 l and 15 min for 4 l while a linear relation was found for total coliform elimination 10 mins for 2 l and 20 mins for 4 l fig 2b this finding may affect estimated energy consumption bakheet et al 2019 as well as the required size and location of the electrochemical system for greywater disinfection the faster increase in the disinfection rate at 2 l than 4 l of greywater is due to the increased contact time between the anode and the greywater which would improve oxidant generation and pollutant oxidation this result is consistent with a previous study of bdd treatment of 2 and 6 l of simulated greywater andres garcia 2018 fig 2 also shows that the fast inactivation phase was in the first 5 mins and the slow phase proceeded thereafter it appears that this electrochemical inactivation behaviour depends on applied current density and attributed to greater oxidant generation in the initial stage at higher current densities rajab et al 2015 some authors also suggested that as treatment proceeded and the concentration of living cells decreased dead cells and lysed cellular materials can still consume oxidants thus leading to slower inactivation of living cells rajab et al 2015 bakheet et al 2018b comparing e coli inactivation in distilled deionized water diw only i e without supporting electrolytes to that in greywater gw e coli populations fell rapidly in just 2 min and only 0 017 ah l electric charge per volume was enough for 99 95 removal fig 2c this result also suggests that reactive oxygen species such as oh and o2 o ho2 o3 and h2o2 were generated in considerable amounts enough to inactivate e coli in chloride free solution bakheet et al 2018b li et al 2010 bakheet et al 2018a and may have played a role in greywater treatment although the adopted electrochemical system in this study that combines anode spe cathode sandwich for e coli disinfection in pre treated greywater has not been previously reported our results fig 2 are consistent with bdd disinfection of e coli in secondary treated wastewater containing cl cano et al 2012 our results are also consistent with previous work that used bdd with spe to disinfect p aeruginosa in chloride containing and chloride free synthetic water matrices rajab et al 2015 several studies reported that in the presence of cl electro generated active chlorine species predominated the disinfection efficiency and that the role of oh was a minor or negligible schmalz et al 2009 cano et al 2012 however choi et al 2015 reported that ozone production in a system that employs bdd and spe favours low salinity media such as greywater in this experiment ec 180 µs cm showing potential significance of ozone disinfection in our study additionaly two closely related experimental setups resembling our current study reported that effective microbial removal was due to the synergistic effect between electro generated free chlorines and ozone rajab et al 2015 bakheet et al 2018a since our system was able to inactivate e coli in a chloride free medium diw in very short time fig 2c it might be safe to conclude that it is likely both free chlorines and ozone contributed to the disinfection of the greywater however this study was not able to ascertain which of these two processes ozone and free chlorine generation is dominant for removal of e coli the inactivation of e coli was further investigated by transmission electron microscope fig 3 a reveals that the untreated cells have mostly uniform electron density which indicates an intact internal cell structure and that the cell wall and membranes were intact on the other hand treated cells in greywater fig 3b and in diw only fig 3c show a drastic change in their internal contents with cell walls and membranes no longer being uniform after 30 minutes of electrolysis these results further unravel the effectiveness of the electrochemical disinfection of e coli and are in agreement with observations of several researchers jeong et al 2006 feng et al 2018 the significant change in the cell morphology mainly caused by electro generated oxidants that were able to disrupt the integrity of the cell wall and membranes and result in cell lysis jeong et al 2006 this further suggests that this disinfection method would likely have comparable effectiveness for other microorganisms which share similar membrane structure as e coli e g p aeruginosa culotti and packman 2014 moreover bdd electrodes through the generation of oh followed by the phenomenon of gas evolution may mitigate biofilms from being formed on its surface during bacterial disinfection rice et al 2018 3 3 electro generated oxidants to confirm whether our system generated oxidants free chlorines oh o3 and h2o2 were monitored during the electrolysis of greywater gw diw containing chloride diw cl and diw only chlorine is generated by the oxidation of 2cl at bdd anode and further hydrolysis of chlorine generates free chlorines in the bulk solution kraft 2008 however a study by jeong et al 2009 suggested that cl2 production in bdd electrode is likely also mediated by oh reaction with cl jeong et al 2009 they tested the bdd generation of cl2 in the presence of t butoh 0 05 m as oh scavenger and found that cl2 production was inhibited confirming their assumption jeong et al 2009 this finding may explain the conclusions obtained by several researchers that the role of oh is minor during bdd disinfection in the presence of cl schmalz et al 2009 cano et al 2012 mostafa et al 2018 likely due to its consumption in cl2 production indirect oh contribution especially in acidic conditions mostafa et al 2018 fig 4 a illustrates that the highest concentration of oxidants after 30 min was in diw containing chloride 0 62 mg l as cl2 and the lowest was in chloride free diw 0 2 mg l as cl2 indicating that dpd method also measured o3 and h2o2 in the water aph 2005 the second highest was recorded in the greywater matrix 0 33 mg l as cl2 30 min which contained the same initial amount of cl as in the diw indicating that the difference may represent the amount of oxidants consumed in reactions with pollutants such as organic carbons or bacteria mascia et al 2013 this level of chlorine complies with most international guidelines for reuse in toilet flushing and irrigation when treated water is used on site rather than transported or stored for a prolonged time 0 02 0 4 mg l cl supplementary material table s2 while the focus of this treatment train is on site greywater treatment and reuse if longer storage over 24 hours or treated effluent transport is expected additional chlorination should be considered either through re application of electrochemical disinfection or direct chlorine addition hydroxyl radicals oh can be generated in bdd electrode from water discharge at its surface and this reaction is in competition with o2 evolution panizza and cerisola 2009 the change of rno absorbance in diw fig 4b only decreased linearly with time following pseudo first order kinetics indicating oh were produced in the system choi et al 2015 this decay rate was accelerated in the presence of the 28 mg l cl which further demonstrates the generation of free chlorine in the system and their subsequent reaction with rno in the bulk solution muff et al 2011 electrochemical o3 production favours medium with low electrical conductivity and thus the highest o3 concentration was detected in diw only ec 1 4 µs cm fig 4b kraft et al 2006 choi et al 2015 however the production of o3 in the 28 mg l cl containing medium with ec 100 µs cm was significantly suppressed fig 4c kraft et al 2006 choi et al 2015 ozone was also detected during the electrolysis of greywater ec 180 µs cm and its concentration started to decrease monotonically after 5 mins of electrolysis which is probably indicative of either further o3 consumption in reactions with pollutants or o3 decomposition the anodic production of h2o2 in bdd electrode is widely considered an evidence of oh generation jeong et al 2006 unlike o3 generation the concentration of h2o2 in the three different water matrixes were almost the same and increased linearly through the electrolysis time fig 4d our result of h2o2 production in different water matrices seemed to contradict results obtained by other researchers who found that both h2o2 and o3 production was widely suppressed in the different electrical conductivity values in the electrochemical ozone production process choi et al 2016 these authors suggested that due to high ion concentration in the medium with high electric conductivity diffusion of oh near the electrode is limited choi et al 2016 however their experiments were conducted without any form of mixing which is a crucial factor in the electrochemical oxidation process in order to achieve high mass transfer rates to the electrode surface where most reactions occur anglada et al 2009 several researchers reported that h2o2 in a concentration of 100 mg l ph 7 2 20 c and above would have effect on e coli inactivation and almost no effect in a concentration below 40 mg l labas et al 2008 it is safe also to suggest that h2o2 generated in our system of about 0 4 mg l h2o2 did not contribute to the inactivation process of e coli 3 4 fate of other parameters during electrolysis fig 5 illustrates the change in some of the physico chemical parameters during the electrolysis of greywater the decrease in the ph in the divided electrochemical cell was observed previously reported by others bagastyo et al 2011 and was expected as more anions such as oh are generated and retained in the anodic compartment where cations such h migration to the cathode side through the cation exchange membrane bagastyo et al 2011 the 4 l experiments experienced a lower drop in ph from 7 to 6 5 yet remained within most worldwide greywater reuse guidelines 6 9 supplementary material table s2 the 2 l experiments resulted in ph of 5 65 after 30 minutes of treatment although this ph value is just below the guidelines if the treatment had been stopped at 20 minutes when complete bacterial disinfection was reached fig 2a and b ph values would not have changed significantly from their starting values e g ph was 6 6 at 20 mins of treatment the slight decrease in the electrical conductivity in the greywater approximately 20 drop fig 5 was likely caused by the transportation of cations to the cathode compartment which has been reported in electrodialysis process bagastyo et al 2013 the electrochemical system had marginal effect on decrease in turbidity fig 5 however it has shown to be effective in degrading of colour causing organic pollutants likely tannin from coco coir in green wall media causing 40 colour removal after 30 min treatment resulting in marginally higher colour values 17 22 pt co compared to very restrictive drinking water guidelines 15 pt co nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 and below some greywater reuse guideline thresholds of 30 pt co ernst et al 2007 this reduction of yellow hue in water samples were also confirmed via visual observation complying with almost colourless matrix used in us epa 2012 since qualitative colour estimates are proposed in most greywater reuse guidelines see supplementary material table s2 effectiveness in organic colour removal of such electrochemical system has also been shown in the literature bagastyo et al 2012 bakheet et al 2013 almost no or minor removal of cod and toc were observed during the electrolysis fig 5 as well as bod all values below 3 mg l while organic degradation likely occurs within electrochemical disinfection systems shown in colour removal suggesting tannin degradation it is typically a slow process that may take hours larger organics are gradually degraded into smaller compounds which are then converted to co2 thereby finally causing toc to drop shown in bakheet et al 2014 hence a 30 minute experiment was not able to capture this change nonetheless the concentrations of bod and cod in the treated greywater by electrolysis are in compliance with guidelines for greywater reuse 30 mg l cod 10 mg l bod us epa 2012 epa victoria 2013 3 5 energy consumption as reported in section 3 2 the charge per volume required for complete bacterial inactivation in the greywater for 2 and 4 l were 0 083 and 0 063 ah l respectively the cell voltage was about 10 v and stayed almost constant during the electrolysis the electrochemical energy consumption charge per volume x cell voltage bakheet et al 2018a for over 99 9 removal of both e coli and total coliform can be estimated as 0 63 0 83 kwh m3 the energy requirement in the electrochemical disinfection process depends on many factors such as the presence of chloride and organics the targeted log reduction the applied current and the selected electrochemical components e g the chosen electrodes the energy consumption reported in literature for bdd electrodes and for complete inactivation of e coli in effluents of three municipal wastewater treatment plants e coli 2800 16 000 cfu ml toc 4 4 8 3 mg l cl 53 315 mg l and ph 7 41 8 12 was around 0 2 kwh m3 cano et al 2012 another study reported energy demand was in the range 0 5 4 kwh m3 for 4 log reduction of e coli by bdd electrode in biologically treated wastewater e coli 106 cfu ml doc 8 9 mg l cl 119 mg l ec 970 µs cm and ph 7 9 schmalz et al 2009 considering that this study was carried out for greywater containing dilute chloride 28 mg l cl and an ec of around 181 µs cm the energy consumption for over 99 95 less than 2 mpn 100 ml with 3 5 log reduction inactivation of e coli and total coliform is reasonable and within the range reported above 0 2 4 kwh m3 for e coli disinfection in wastewaters 3 6 practical implications the treatment train explored in this study offers a robust solution for greywater treatment with the green wall system being able to buffer variable greywater inflow concentrations prodanovic et al 2019 likely providing consistent water quality feeding into the electrochemical disinfection system which can then reliably remove excess colour and more importantly pathogens this is a compact decentralized greywater treatment solution which can be easily applied in dense urban environments at most greywater producing buildings with green walls only taking up vertical wall space typically unused and a small disinfection unit integrated within a water storage tank additionally this study shows that only two water recirculation cycles are needed for complete removal of e coli and likely all coliforms this can be used to size the storage tank and pumping system for any residential or commercial premise that is looking to utilise such a greywater treatment technology according to the australian energy market operator aemo the average market price of electricity in australia between 2015 and 2020 is in the range of 3 11 australian cents kwh based on this estimation the cost of the electrochemical treatment will be in the range of 2 10 australian cents m3 however the total operating cost for the whole combined treatment system may include the cost of pumping of the greywater through the electrolytic cell no pumping required for green wall system since it can be gravity fed which should also be considered in future studies when designing these systems a consideration to placing the green wall needs to be made due to the potential health risk for residents users if exposed to the somewhat contaminated green wall media prodanovic et al 2020 4 conclusions this work described and discussed the processes that govern the treatment within the combined green wall biofiltration system with electrochemical disinfection with bdd electrode and spe for greywater treatment and reuse to the best of our knowledge this is the first study of the treatment of greywater containing high coloration and low ec with bdd electrode and spe in addition this work presented how our treatment processes affected cell morphology and a range of physico chemical parameters required for successful greywater reuse the green wall itself was found to effectively remove pollutants of concern mostly through biological processes producing effluent that complied with suggested greywater reuse guidelines across most parameters while the green wall was able to achieve approximately 1 log removal of both e coli and total coliforms the electrochemical disinfection process was needed to further reduce microbe levels for appropriate reuse 10 mpn 100 ml the results showed that it was possible to achieve 3 5 log reduction 2 mpn 100 ml of e coli and total coliforms with only 0 63 0 83 kwh m3 energy requirement after 10 and 15 minutes for 2 l and 4 l greywater samples respectively synergistic effects between electrochemically generated free chlorines and reactive oxygen species seemed to contribute to the inactivation process and degradation of the cell membranes of selected faecal indicator organism the electrochemical system also reduced the colour of the greywater effluent while having no significant effect on other physico chemical parameters likely through degradation of organic pollutants this suggests that passive greywater treatment through green walls and electrochemical disinfection together can provide a cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative for greywater treatment and reuse further optimization to reduce energy consumption can focus on the applied current density the electrode material and the type of spe used future research also should focus on testing this combined system for real greywater and actual pathogens rather than indicator organisms along with identification and measurement of

17589,low energy and cost solutions are needed to combat raising water needs in urbanised areas and produce high quality recycled water in this study we investigated key processes that drive a unique greywater treatment train consisting of a passive green wall biofiltration system followed by disinfection using a boron doped diamond bdd electrode with a solid polymer electrolyte spe in both systems the treatment was performed without any additional chemicals and pollutants of concern were monitored for process evaluation the green wall system removed over 90 of turbidity apparent colour chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon and biological oxygen demand and 1 log of e coli and total coliforms mostly through biological processes the green wall effluent met several proposed greywater reuse guidelines except for e coli and total coliform treatment below 10 mpn 100 ml further disinfection of treated greywater contained 28 mg l cl and electrical conductivity ec of 181 3 µs cm by electrolysis at current density 25 ma cm2 inactivated over 3 5 logs of both e coli and total coliforms in 10 15 min of electrolysis resulting in recycled water with less than 2 mpn 100 ml a synergistic effect between electrochemically generated free chlorines and reactive oxygen species contributed to the inactivation process although the treated water contained diluted chloride and had low ec estimated energy consumption was just 0 63 0 83 kwh m3 this is the first study to show the effectiveness of a low energy and a low cost greywater treatment train that combines green urban infrastructure with bdd electrochemical treatment process with spe offering a reliable and an environmentally friendly method for greywater reuse graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords passive treatment disinfection e coli electrochemical treatment boron doped diamond electrode solid polymer electrolyte 1 introduction recycling of urban wastewater has been receiving increasing attention to combat water shortages and satisfy the proliferating demand of freshwater and groundwater in both developing and developed countries paulo et al 2013 patil and munavalli 2016 a particular interest has been paid to using greywater as a potential water source because of its low pollutant levels reasonably consistent supply low seasonal variations and it requires limited transport because it can be reused locally close to where it was created li et al 2009 when treated greywater can be used in many ways such as irrigation of gardens and parks toilet flushing and industrial processes li et al 2009 recently treated greywater has also been considered for agricultural crop growing in urbanised areas eregno et al 2017 showing significant benefits in appropriate greywater treatment the removal of pollutants of concern from greywater has been reported for several processes including physical processes such as sand filtration friedler et al 2005 physio chemical as in electro coagulation lin et al 2005 vegetated filtration systems such as wetlands li et al 2004 and recently living walls narrow biofiltration systems with climbing plants fowdar et al 2017 and green walls vertical wall mounted vegetated systems with distinct soil plants and support structure prodanovic et al 2019 vegetated treatment systems are preferred systems for further research and development because they offer multiple benefits to the community including their aesthetic and amenity and they require a small footprint in our dense land limited urban environments li et al 2004 paulo et al 2013 although vegetated systems have been reported to effectively remove solid pollutants and nutrients prodanovic et al 2019 their removal of pathogens is more variable and can only achieve around 1 log removal in well designed biofiltration systems chandrasena et al 2014 ramprasad et al 2017 including green walls prodanovic et al 2020 to comply with proposed guidelines for greywater reuse li et al 2009 epa victoria 2013 and avoid the risk of contamination with disease causing microorganisms blanky et al 2017 additional disinfection steps are usually necessary disinfection by sodium hypochlorite is among the most commonly used methods in greywater treatment friedler et al 2005 lin et al 2005 and disinfection by advanced oxidation by tio2 based photocatalysis has also been reported li et al 2004 however to avoid the costs and risks associated with the transport and addition of chemicals in situ generation of disinfecting reagents is a more sustainable option in recent years effective advanced electrochemical disinfection methods have been developed and tested in removing a wide spectrum of harmful microorganisms by in situ generated oxidants radjenovic and sedlak 2015 martinez huitle et al 2015 electrochemical processes have been proven to be more effective than the use of a variety of chemicals due to its ability to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh with disinfection efficiency about 105 times higher than disinfection with chlorine cho et al 2004 the electrochemical process has the merit of no transport storage or addition of chemicals furthermore oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and chlorine can be generated from the water itself or from the constituents present in the water martinez huitle and brillas 2008 however one main limitation of the electrochemical process is that it depends on concentration of ions in the water to allow for the flow of current in the electrolytic cell hence high voltages are sometimes needed to achieve electric currents in low electric conductivity mediums martinez huitle et al 2015 fortunately this limitation can be avoided by using solid polymer electrolytes spes clematis et al 2017 in addition to facilitating the flow of current in the electrolytic cell anodic electrochemical ozone production is reported when using spe with anode materials that have a high oxygen overvoltage such as pbo2 da silva et al 2003 sno2 zakaria and christensen 2014 and boron doped diamond bdd electrodes choi et al 2015 high oxygen overpotential electrodes namely bdd exhibit good performance and stability properties in removing a variety of pollutants from water and wastewater radjenovic and sedlak 2015 bdd has shown high efficiency in the disinfection of various microorganisms in both chloride containing andres garcia 2018 ziemba et al 2019 and chloride free media li et al 2010 bakheet et al 2018a a previous study investigated the disinfection efficiency of pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa by bdd electrode with spe in synthetic water in the presence and absence of chloride rajab et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge the disinfection of greywater containing low electrical conductivity by bdd with spe has not been reported in this work we investigate the combination of a passive vegetated green wall biofiltration system which are starting to dominate urban fabric and for the first time subsequent low energy disinfection using a bdd electrode with spe providing an efficient treatment train for recycling greywater this is an important step toward practical implementation of electrochemical water treatment systems which was previously lacking in the literature garcia segura et al 2020 since this has not been done in the past we need to solve some fundamental challenges firstly it is not clear if low electric conductivity of greywater will interfere with the disinfection process and if the use of spe will generate enough ozone for effective and quick disinfection in the bulk solution rajab et al 2015 secondly we need to understand which processes will be dominant in pathogen inactivation for greywater treatment thirdly we must understand whether ozone generation can lower the unwanted levels of water colouration slight yellow hue which is caused by organic materials used in green wall media prodanovic et al 2020 finally what will be the overall energy consumption of the whole process and how will the process interact with other greywater parameters required for reuse bod ph ec etc these research questions have not been studied in the past and will have to be answered to understand the complete effectiveness of proposed greywater treatment train to answer these research questions this project will i assess bdd electrode disinfection processes when a spe is used on greywater that has been pre treated using a green wall ii understand if greywater reuse guideline recommendations are met within the combined treatment system iii examine the change in e coli as a reference pathogen for wastewater recycling cell morphology before and after electrolysis and finally iv estimate the energy consumption of the electrochemical system with spe to evaluate practical merit of using this technology to our knowledge this is the first study to explore the processes and effectiveness of a low energy and a low cost greywater treatment train that combines green urban infrastructure with bdd electrochemical treatment process with spe offering a reliable and environmentally friendly method for greywater reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a synthetic greywater mix was prepared by combining a secondary treated wastewater effluent obtained from an urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp in victoria australia and a laboratory synthesized greywater recipe following a protocol described in literature diaper et al 2008 this synthetic mix has been extensively used in the literature fowdar et al 2017 prodanovic et al 2020 and has allowed us to maintain controlled pollution concentrations throughout the tests the concentration of pollutants in this mix is closely matched to those in the light greywater from household showers and hand basins see supplementary material table s1 for details the greywater was dosed with lab cultured e coli to a final concentration of 2 104 mpn 100 ml centrifuged and double washed with di water to completely remove traces of nutrient rich e coli growing solution with total coliform levels of 4 104 mpn 100 ml which is within the reported range of greywater literature eriksson et al 2002 e coli was used as a microorganism indicator for faecal contamination nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 due to its persistence in greywater shown by scientific literature and for being the most common and often only indicator organism used in wastewater recycling guidelines worldwide ernst et al 2007 us epa 2012 epa victoria 2013 the treatment of greywater was carried out in two stages fig 1 the first stage was green wall treatment fig 1a followed by a second stage which was the electrochemical treatment fig 1b the experimental procedures along with the apparatus used in each stage are presented in the following sections 2 1 1 green wall biofiltration experiment the green wall was set in an open air greenhouse with a clear impermeable roof exposed to outside temperature conditions but not the rain commercially available planter pots atlantis australia were used for the green wall design fig 1a with three vertical pots dimensions 200 width 200 depth 150 height mm making one testing configuration with total depth 450 mm the use of the full scale pot based green wall system replicates realistic naturally occurring phenomena water flow paths root growth plant sun exposure etc onto experimental setup the irrigation water was dosed at the top of the system and water gravity dripped to lower pots fig 1a each pot held approximately 6 l of soil medium the pots were filled with a mix of perlite and coco coir with a ratio of 1 2 this media mix was selected based on our previous studies prodanovic et al 2017 prodanovic et al 2018 indicating its efficiency in removing several pollutants from greywater the media mix had 90 porosity which made pore volume of the pot approximately 5 4 l each pot was planted with one carex appressa plant and the system was well established under regular daily greywater dosing before our current experiment the system had an equivalent year of use before these tests were made carex appressa has shown to be one of the best performers in removing nutrients from greywater in our previous studies prodanovic et al 2019 five replicates of green wall test configurations were used for these experiments the synthetic greywater inflow was dripped into the first pot of each configuration see fig 1a using a six dripper irrigation system with 8 l h flow rate for a total of 30 mins delivering 4 l per configuration the total treated greywater effluent from the bottom of each configuration was collected approximately 3 l per configuration and 15 l for all five replicates with total drainage time of 1 hour see fig 1a and effluents from all five replicates were volumetrically mixed to form three replicate 2 l samples on day 1 and three replicate 4 l samples on day 2 for electrochemical treatment process across two consecutive days these testing volumes correspond to 1 previously studied daily treatment efficiency of green walls up to 30 l m2 per day prodanovic et al 2019 2 assume that the electrochemical disinfection for the selected volume 2 l or 4 l would take less than 1 h and 3 all of the effluent from a 1m2 green wall could be treated each day and within 24 hours this is a conservative estimate since the electrochemical disinfection unit as described in the next section is expected to operate with higher efficiency than 4 l h all samples were used and or processed within 5 h of collection 2 1 2 electrochemical disinfection experiment the electrochemical system consisted of a sandwich containing an anode a cation exchange membrane cem and a cathode all of which was framed in an acrylic housing and bolted together in 3 points using polycarbonate bolts and nails kraft et al 2006 the cation exchange membrane cem ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international u s a thus acts as a solid polymer electrolyte spe the sandwich was then located in between two acrylic containers each with an inner volume of 200 ml inner dimensions lx w x d 20 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm it is important to note that the cem completely separated the two compartments fig 1b the anode was niobium mesh based bdd purchased from neocoat switzerland with overall size 50 cm2 5 cm x 10 cm but the acrylic housing meant that the apparent surface area was only 40 cm2 a stainless steel mesh with similar dimensions was used as a cathode fig 1b greywater was circulated through the anodic compartment and distilled deionized water diw containing 50 mg l nacl electrolyte was circulated through the cathodic compartment fig 1b both with flowrate maintained at 500 ml min and electrolysis was performed under galvanostatic conditions in this configuration in addition to possible ozone generation kraft et al 2006 the divided electrolytic cell is commonly used in mechanism studies as possible reduction of oxidants at the cathode surface is avoided and thus oxidants are more precisely quantified than when using an undivided cell bagastyo et al 2011 bagastyo et al 2012 in order to further increase the homogeneity of the solution the solutions were also well mixed at 500 rpm using magnetic stirring plates fig 1b bagastyo et al 2011 electrochemical disinfection efficiency experiments were conducted separately for 2 litre and 4 litre samples and conducted across both days of the experiment all experiments were repeated in triplicate as a control another triplicate experiment was carried out using e coli directly dosed in diw 2 l without using the supporting electrolyte in order to explore the effectiveness of electro generated reactive oxygen species aliquots were taken at different time intervals for analysis of selected water quality parameters of concern for greywater reuse li et al 2009 and also for electro generated oxidant detection to reduce measurement uncertainty all samples were analysed or preserved for further analysis within two hours of collection 2 2 analysis 2 2 1 total coliforms and e coli concentration and morphology concentrations of e coli and total coliforms were tested using colilert methods idexx std methods 9223b random duplicates were taken for every ten samples to ensure method reliability cell morphology before and after 30 min of electrolysis in greywater and diw spiked with e coli were examined using a jeol 1400 plus transmission electron microscope at 80 kv the protocol for samples preparation for tem imaging is described elsewhere bakheet et al 2018a 2 2 2 analysis of physico chemical parameters measurement of chemical oxygen demands cod was performed using hach chemical kits hach pacific australia and a uv spectroscopy technique with a detection range of 3 1500 mg l cod total organic carbon toc was analysed using a shimadzu toc v cph cpn toc analyser biological oxygen demand bod5 was tested in a nata certified facility using standard methods national association of testing authorities australia als environmental victoria australia concentration of cl was analysed using the silver nitrate 0 0141 n titration method method no 8225 and chloride 2 indicator powder pillow hach australia 2017 colour was tested in the sample against the pt co standard using a hach dr 5000 uv spectrophotometer hach pacific australia this method was appropriate due to low effluent sample turbidity and yellow hue likely produced by organics from the green wall media prodanovic et al 2020 electrical conductivity and ph were measured using dedicated hach ec and ph meters hach pacific australia 2 2 3 oxidant detection electrochemical production of oh was investigated by using n n dimethyl p nitrosoaniline rno sigma aldrich australia as an oh probe compound choi et al 2015 initial rno concentration of 5 mg l was dissolved in diw only and also in diw containing 28 mg l cl electrolysed for 30 min and the change of its absorbance at 440 nm was monitored using uv vis spectrophotometer long life oxidants including free chlorine species cl2 hclo clo o3 h2o2 combined were detected by using n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method aph 2005 method no 10069 with dpd free chlorine reagent powder pillows and hach dr 5000 uv spectrophotometer hach pacific australia the concentration of h2o2 was measured with 2 9 dimethyl 1 10 phenanthroline dmp method and uv vis spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at 454 nm baga et al 1988 dissolved ozone concentration was determined by the indigo trisulfonate method and a uv vis spectrophotometer where indigo decolourization was monitored at 600 nm bader 1982 3 results and discussion 3 1 green wall filtration of greywater table 1 shows the characteristics of greywater in the inflow untreated influent and outflow of the green wall effluent the green wall removed about 95 of the inflow turbidity from 55 to 2 5 ntu and 98 of tss from 91 to 1 4 mg l with physical straining of these particles in the filter media reported as the main removal mechanism prodanovic et al 2020 consistent with turbidity removal and visual observation 92 of apparent colour was also removed from 449 to 35 pt co as shown previously while green walls managed to remove apparent colour through fine particle filtration it likely contributed to a new yellow hue of the effluent due to leaching of tannins from coco coir media prodanovic et al 2020 the green wall removed about 96 90 and 99 of cod toc and bod5 respectively table 1 the removal of cod by both physico chemical and biological activities has been previously reported for green walls prodanovic et al 2017 2020 the results suggest that the removal of toc and bod by the biofilter likely occurred by aerobic degradation in its upper layer fowdar et al 2017 the electrical conductivity ec which also represents the ions in the greywater increased slightly in the outflow from 173 to 183 µs cm probably due to leaching of built up salt inside the filter prodanovic et al 2020 however long term experiments on green walls reported that slow ec build up in the media and effluent were not significantly impacting the performance of the system prodanovic et al 2020 additionally the ph in the outflow increased slightly from 6 62 to 7 18 likely due to co2 accumulated within the media by the high activity of the c appressa plant mwagona et al 2019 chloride cl levels remained consistent after passing greywater through the green wall 28 mg l the green wall also removed around 1 logarithm 90 of e coli and total coliforms table 1 these results are in agreement with previous findings for green wall systems prodanovic et al 2020 and other biofiltration systems where 90 removal of e coli was obtained ramprasad et al 2017 biological processes including adsorption to biofilm predation by other microorganisms and natural die off are considered the predominant factors for e coli removal chandrasena et al 2014 in addition to plant uptake and potential plant leaching of anti microbial agents shirdashtzadeh et al 2017 with the exception of colour e coli and total coliforms all tested parameters in the effluent met the proposed greywater reuse guidelines for unrestricted public access table 1 however to fully comply with these guidelines electrochemical disinfection process was used to further treat and disinfect the effluent of the green wall system and reduce the effluent s true colour organic yellow hue 3 2 electrochemical disinfection initially experiments with control samples were conducted where all electrolysis conditions were employed but without applying an electric current which showed no significant change of e coli and total coliform concentrations after 30 mins supplementary material figure s1 this was done to rule out any factors of the electrochemical experiment that may cause cell damage such as the mechanical stress which could be caused by high mixing rates lacasa et al 2013 the concentrations of e coli and total coliform during electrolysis at current density 25 ma cm2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively fig 2a shows that the initial e coli concentration decreased rapidly and complete disinfection 99 95 removal occurred within just 10 and 15 min when 2 and 4 l were treated respectively likewise total coliforms were also completely removed albeit with slightly higher required disinfection times as compared to e coli fig 2b this result indicates that bacterial inactivation predominately occurred via oxidative stress caused by electro generated oxidants lacasa et al 2013 with total coliform population containing somewhat more resistant species compared to e coli needing longer treatment time in 4 l sample notably as a function of charge per volume less charge was required for 4 l 0 063 ah l compared to 2 l 0 083 ah l for complete inactivation fig 2a and fig 2b while most research focused on investigating the influence of current density on the removal efficiency as a function of charge per volume cano et al 2012 our results show that testing the effect of initially treated volume is also a crucial step towards further optimizing the electrochemical system for scaling up purposes for instance for e coli disinfection our result in fig 2a suggests a non linear relation between treated volumes and time required for treatment i e 10 mins for 2 l and 15 min for 4 l while a linear relation was found for total coliform elimination 10 mins for 2 l and 20 mins for 4 l fig 2b this finding may affect estimated energy consumption bakheet et al 2019 as well as the required size and location of the electrochemical system for greywater disinfection the faster increase in the disinfection rate at 2 l than 4 l of greywater is due to the increased contact time between the anode and the greywater which would improve oxidant generation and pollutant oxidation this result is consistent with a previous study of bdd treatment of 2 and 6 l of simulated greywater andres garcia 2018 fig 2 also shows that the fast inactivation phase was in the first 5 mins and the slow phase proceeded thereafter it appears that this electrochemical inactivation behaviour depends on applied current density and attributed to greater oxidant generation in the initial stage at higher current densities rajab et al 2015 some authors also suggested that as treatment proceeded and the concentration of living cells decreased dead cells and lysed cellular materials can still consume oxidants thus leading to slower inactivation of living cells rajab et al 2015 bakheet et al 2018b comparing e coli inactivation in distilled deionized water diw only i e without supporting electrolytes to that in greywater gw e coli populations fell rapidly in just 2 min and only 0 017 ah l electric charge per volume was enough for 99 95 removal fig 2c this result also suggests that reactive oxygen species such as oh and o2 o ho2 o3 and h2o2 were generated in considerable amounts enough to inactivate e coli in chloride free solution bakheet et al 2018b li et al 2010 bakheet et al 2018a and may have played a role in greywater treatment although the adopted electrochemical system in this study that combines anode spe cathode sandwich for e coli disinfection in pre treated greywater has not been previously reported our results fig 2 are consistent with bdd disinfection of e coli in secondary treated wastewater containing cl cano et al 2012 our results are also consistent with previous work that used bdd with spe to disinfect p aeruginosa in chloride containing and chloride free synthetic water matrices rajab et al 2015 several studies reported that in the presence of cl electro generated active chlorine species predominated the disinfection efficiency and that the role of oh was a minor or negligible schmalz et al 2009 cano et al 2012 however choi et al 2015 reported that ozone production in a system that employs bdd and spe favours low salinity media such as greywater in this experiment ec 180 µs cm showing potential significance of ozone disinfection in our study additionaly two closely related experimental setups resembling our current study reported that effective microbial removal was due to the synergistic effect between electro generated free chlorines and ozone rajab et al 2015 bakheet et al 2018a since our system was able to inactivate e coli in a chloride free medium diw in very short time fig 2c it might be safe to conclude that it is likely both free chlorines and ozone contributed to the disinfection of the greywater however this study was not able to ascertain which of these two processes ozone and free chlorine generation is dominant for removal of e coli the inactivation of e coli was further investigated by transmission electron microscope fig 3 a reveals that the untreated cells have mostly uniform electron density which indicates an intact internal cell structure and that the cell wall and membranes were intact on the other hand treated cells in greywater fig 3b and in diw only fig 3c show a drastic change in their internal contents with cell walls and membranes no longer being uniform after 30 minutes of electrolysis these results further unravel the effectiveness of the electrochemical disinfection of e coli and are in agreement with observations of several researchers jeong et al 2006 feng et al 2018 the significant change in the cell morphology mainly caused by electro generated oxidants that were able to disrupt the integrity of the cell wall and membranes and result in cell lysis jeong et al 2006 this further suggests that this disinfection method would likely have comparable effectiveness for other microorganisms which share similar membrane structure as e coli e g p aeruginosa culotti and packman 2014 moreover bdd electrodes through the generation of oh followed by the phenomenon of gas evolution may mitigate biofilms from being formed on its surface during bacterial disinfection rice et al 2018 3 3 electro generated oxidants to confirm whether our system generated oxidants free chlorines oh o3 and h2o2 were monitored during the electrolysis of greywater gw diw containing chloride diw cl and diw only chlorine is generated by the oxidation of 2cl at bdd anode and further hydrolysis of chlorine generates free chlorines in the bulk solution kraft 2008 however a study by jeong et al 2009 suggested that cl2 production in bdd electrode is likely also mediated by oh reaction with cl jeong et al 2009 they tested the bdd generation of cl2 in the presence of t butoh 0 05 m as oh scavenger and found that cl2 production was inhibited confirming their assumption jeong et al 2009 this finding may explain the conclusions obtained by several researchers that the role of oh is minor during bdd disinfection in the presence of cl schmalz et al 2009 cano et al 2012 mostafa et al 2018 likely due to its consumption in cl2 production indirect oh contribution especially in acidic conditions mostafa et al 2018 fig 4 a illustrates that the highest concentration of oxidants after 30 min was in diw containing chloride 0 62 mg l as cl2 and the lowest was in chloride free diw 0 2 mg l as cl2 indicating that dpd method also measured o3 and h2o2 in the water aph 2005 the second highest was recorded in the greywater matrix 0 33 mg l as cl2 30 min which contained the same initial amount of cl as in the diw indicating that the difference may represent the amount of oxidants consumed in reactions with pollutants such as organic carbons or bacteria mascia et al 2013 this level of chlorine complies with most international guidelines for reuse in toilet flushing and irrigation when treated water is used on site rather than transported or stored for a prolonged time 0 02 0 4 mg l cl supplementary material table s2 while the focus of this treatment train is on site greywater treatment and reuse if longer storage over 24 hours or treated effluent transport is expected additional chlorination should be considered either through re application of electrochemical disinfection or direct chlorine addition hydroxyl radicals oh can be generated in bdd electrode from water discharge at its surface and this reaction is in competition with o2 evolution panizza and cerisola 2009 the change of rno absorbance in diw fig 4b only decreased linearly with time following pseudo first order kinetics indicating oh were produced in the system choi et al 2015 this decay rate was accelerated in the presence of the 28 mg l cl which further demonstrates the generation of free chlorine in the system and their subsequent reaction with rno in the bulk solution muff et al 2011 electrochemical o3 production favours medium with low electrical conductivity and thus the highest o3 concentration was detected in diw only ec 1 4 µs cm fig 4b kraft et al 2006 choi et al 2015 however the production of o3 in the 28 mg l cl containing medium with ec 100 µs cm was significantly suppressed fig 4c kraft et al 2006 choi et al 2015 ozone was also detected during the electrolysis of greywater ec 180 µs cm and its concentration started to decrease monotonically after 5 mins of electrolysis which is probably indicative of either further o3 consumption in reactions with pollutants or o3 decomposition the anodic production of h2o2 in bdd electrode is widely considered an evidence of oh generation jeong et al 2006 unlike o3 generation the concentration of h2o2 in the three different water matrixes were almost the same and increased linearly through the electrolysis time fig 4d our result of h2o2 production in different water matrices seemed to contradict results obtained by other researchers who found that both h2o2 and o3 production was widely suppressed in the different electrical conductivity values in the electrochemical ozone production process choi et al 2016 these authors suggested that due to high ion concentration in the medium with high electric conductivity diffusion of oh near the electrode is limited choi et al 2016 however their experiments were conducted without any form of mixing which is a crucial factor in the electrochemical oxidation process in order to achieve high mass transfer rates to the electrode surface where most reactions occur anglada et al 2009 several researchers reported that h2o2 in a concentration of 100 mg l ph 7 2 20 c and above would have effect on e coli inactivation and almost no effect in a concentration below 40 mg l labas et al 2008 it is safe also to suggest that h2o2 generated in our system of about 0 4 mg l h2o2 did not contribute to the inactivation process of e coli 3 4 fate of other parameters during electrolysis fig 5 illustrates the change in some of the physico chemical parameters during the electrolysis of greywater the decrease in the ph in the divided electrochemical cell was observed previously reported by others bagastyo et al 2011 and was expected as more anions such as oh are generated and retained in the anodic compartment where cations such h migration to the cathode side through the cation exchange membrane bagastyo et al 2011 the 4 l experiments experienced a lower drop in ph from 7 to 6 5 yet remained within most worldwide greywater reuse guidelines 6 9 supplementary material table s2 the 2 l experiments resulted in ph of 5 65 after 30 minutes of treatment although this ph value is just below the guidelines if the treatment had been stopped at 20 minutes when complete bacterial disinfection was reached fig 2a and b ph values would not have changed significantly from their starting values e g ph was 6 6 at 20 mins of treatment the slight decrease in the electrical conductivity in the greywater approximately 20 drop fig 5 was likely caused by the transportation of cations to the cathode compartment which has been reported in electrodialysis process bagastyo et al 2013 the electrochemical system had marginal effect on decrease in turbidity fig 5 however it has shown to be effective in degrading of colour causing organic pollutants likely tannin from coco coir in green wall media causing 40 colour removal after 30 min treatment resulting in marginally higher colour values 17 22 pt co compared to very restrictive drinking water guidelines 15 pt co nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 and below some greywater reuse guideline thresholds of 30 pt co ernst et al 2007 this reduction of yellow hue in water samples were also confirmed via visual observation complying with almost colourless matrix used in us epa 2012 since qualitative colour estimates are proposed in most greywater reuse guidelines see supplementary material table s2 effectiveness in organic colour removal of such electrochemical system has also been shown in the literature bagastyo et al 2012 bakheet et al 2013 almost no or minor removal of cod and toc were observed during the electrolysis fig 5 as well as bod all values below 3 mg l while organic degradation likely occurs within electrochemical disinfection systems shown in colour removal suggesting tannin degradation it is typically a slow process that may take hours larger organics are gradually degraded into smaller compounds which are then converted to co2 thereby finally causing toc to drop shown in bakheet et al 2014 hence a 30 minute experiment was not able to capture this change nonetheless the concentrations of bod and cod in the treated greywater by electrolysis are in compliance with guidelines for greywater reuse 30 mg l cod 10 mg l bod us epa 2012 epa victoria 2013 3 5 energy consumption as reported in section 3 2 the charge per volume required for complete bacterial inactivation in the greywater for 2 and 4 l were 0 083 and 0 063 ah l respectively the cell voltage was about 10 v and stayed almost constant during the electrolysis the electrochemical energy consumption charge per volume x cell voltage bakheet et al 2018a for over 99 9 removal of both e coli and total coliform can be estimated as 0 63 0 83 kwh m3 the energy requirement in the electrochemical disinfection process depends on many factors such as the presence of chloride and organics the targeted log reduction the applied current and the selected electrochemical components e g the chosen electrodes the energy consumption reported in literature for bdd electrodes and for complete inactivation of e coli in effluents of three municipal wastewater treatment plants e coli 2800 16 000 cfu ml toc 4 4 8 3 mg l cl 53 315 mg l and ph 7 41 8 12 was around 0 2 kwh m3 cano et al 2012 another study reported energy demand was in the range 0 5 4 kwh m3 for 4 log reduction of e coli by bdd electrode in biologically treated wastewater e coli 106 cfu ml doc 8 9 mg l cl 119 mg l ec 970 µs cm and ph 7 9 schmalz et al 2009 considering that this study was carried out for greywater containing dilute chloride 28 mg l cl and an ec of around 181 µs cm the energy consumption for over 99 95 less than 2 mpn 100 ml with 3 5 log reduction inactivation of e coli and total coliform is reasonable and within the range reported above 0 2 4 kwh m3 for e coli disinfection in wastewaters 3 6 practical implications the treatment train explored in this study offers a robust solution for greywater treatment with the green wall system being able to buffer variable greywater inflow concentrations prodanovic et al 2019 likely providing consistent water quality feeding into the electrochemical disinfection system which can then reliably remove excess colour and more importantly pathogens this is a compact decentralized greywater treatment solution which can be easily applied in dense urban environments at most greywater producing buildings with green walls only taking up vertical wall space typically unused and a small disinfection unit integrated within a water storage tank additionally this study shows that only two water recirculation cycles are needed for complete removal of e coli and likely all coliforms this can be used to size the storage tank and pumping system for any residential or commercial premise that is looking to utilise such a greywater treatment technology according to the australian energy market operator aemo the average market price of electricity in australia between 2015 and 2020 is in the range of 3 11 australian cents kwh based on this estimation the cost of the electrochemical treatment will be in the range of 2 10 australian cents m3 however the total operating cost for the whole combined treatment system may include the cost of pumping of the greywater through the electrolytic cell no pumping required for green wall system since it can be gravity fed which should also be considered in future studies when designing these systems a consideration to placing the green wall needs to be made due to the potential health risk for residents users if exposed to the somewhat contaminated green wall media prodanovic et al 2020 4 conclusions this work described and discussed the processes that govern the treatment within the combined green wall biofiltration system with electrochemical disinfection with bdd electrode and spe for greywater treatment and reuse to the best of our knowledge this is the first study of the treatment of greywater containing high coloration and low ec with bdd electrode and spe in addition this work presented how our treatment processes affected cell morphology and a range of physico chemical parameters required for successful greywater reuse the green wall itself was found to effectively remove pollutants of concern mostly through biological processes producing effluent that complied with suggested greywater reuse guidelines across most parameters while the green wall was able to achieve approximately 1 log removal of both e coli and total coliforms the electrochemical disinfection process was needed to further reduce microbe levels for appropriate reuse 10 mpn 100 ml the results showed that it was possible to achieve 3 5 log reduction 2 mpn 100 ml of e coli and total coliforms with only 0 63 0 83 kwh m3 energy requirement after 10 and 15 minutes for 2 l and 4 l greywater samples respectively synergistic effects between electrochemically generated free chlorines and reactive oxygen species seemed to contribute to the inactivation process and degradation of the cell membranes of selected faecal indicator organism the electrochemical system also reduced the colour of the greywater effluent while having no significant effect on other physico chemical parameters likely through degradation of organic pollutants this suggests that passive greywater treatment through green walls and electrochemical disinfection together can provide a cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative for greywater treatment and reuse further optimization to reduce energy consumption can focus on the applied current density the electrode material and the type of spe used future research also should focus on testing this combined system for real greywater and actual pathogens rather than indicator organisms along with identification and measurement of
