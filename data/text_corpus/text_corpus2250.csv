the vast majority of people live in rural areas and whose livelihoods rely heavily on subsistence oriented rainfed agricultural production deininger and byerlee 2011 rockström et al 2002 2010 in

tropical environments de fraiture et al 2009 rockström et al 2010 the low performance of rainfed crop production in developing countries in both wet and dry seasons is most likely attributed to biophysical limitations including unreliable rainfall patterns and heavily compacted sandy loam soils with limited water capacity as well as low soil fertility fukai and ouk 2012 these constraints may

crop production where irrigation water is limited there are additional opportunities to capitalise on stored soil water post wet season rice through supplementary irrigation of dry season crops in 2012 a small body of work was conducted via household survey in central and southern laos to determine the average households access to farm ponds average pond volume and the trend of household consumption of pond water for agricultural production vongsana 2014 vongsana et al 2014 as shown by vongsana et al 2014 pond water was the preferred source of freshwater supply for subsistence oriented agricultural production which was used mainly for wet season rice seed bed preparation fish production or watering of home gardens this is contrary to the findings of a 2013 groundwater related study conducted in southern laos by vote et al 2015 whereby the use of water stored in farm ponds was not common mostly because the water in these surface storages was considered too dirty therefore unsafe for human consumption however given that many rural households in the lowland regions have access to a pond there are opportunities to improve food and nutritional security and improve household cash income in these areas through increased use of these water sources for high value irrigated agriculture as well as livestock production and aquaculture whilst vongsana 2014 and vongsana et al 2014 presented the average value of pond volumes based on empirical measurements of surface area and depth only a finite number of households with pond access in four districts were surveyed n 94 in champhone and outhoumphone districts savannakhet province central laos and n 94 in sukhuma and phonthong districts champasak province southern laos to date the total volume of water stored in farm ponds at the district level has not been quantified in this context satellite imagery can be used to detect surface area of water bodies within the landscape which can then be used to estimate aggregated pond volume for each district based on empirical measurements of surface area and depth with respect to socio economic benefits of farm ponds in the aforementioned districts vongsana 2014 also conducted a benefit cost analysis that considered two scenarios household self sufficiency and an intensified farming system for the purpose of commercial production however farm pond water and its potential gross value for typical market oriented dry season smallholder production in the rainfed rice growing lowlands of southern laos remains largely unknown therefore building on the work of vongsana 2014 vongsana et al 2014 and vote et al 2015 the objectives of this study were i to conduct a preliminary assessment of total pond water availability via remote sensing methods in two districts sukhuma and phonthong in champasak province by using relatively high spatial resolution rapideye satellite data to capture these often small water bodies and ii to broadly quantify the potential gross value of this resource for typical market oriented dry season smallholder production in these districts 2 the study area the focus areas of this study were the sukhuma and phonthong districts located in champasak province southern laos see fig 1 these two districts were selected as they were the focus of a number of co ordinated research activities conducted in the region as part of a larger australian government funded multidisciplinary project that sought to improve farming and marketing systems in the rainfed regions of southern laos see wade et al 2016 the region experiences a tropical monsoonal climate and based on long term local records 1971 2012 the average annual rainfall is 2000 mm the majority of which occurs mostly between may and october fig 2 the average monthly air temperature ranges between 24 8 c in december and 30 4 c in april fig 3 and the average monthly total reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1988 ranges between 45 5 mm in august and 67 3 mm in january fig 2 dmh 2013 as described by manivong et al 2014 and vote et al 2015 the main agricultural activity in the rainfed lowlands of champasak is subsistence oriented glutinous rice production particularly in the wet season and where full or supplementary irrigation access is available rice and other high value non rice crops e g maize vegetables eggplant watermelon and chilli are grown in the dry season non rice crops are also grown in river bank gardens in a semi commercial capacity to capitalise on residual soils moisture along rivers and streams as water levels recede during the dry season in these areas fishing provides an alternative source of protein and income in rural and remote regions additional sources of household income are derived from livestock production particularly cattle and buffalo which can be sold for relatively large sums of money e g a cow may sell for 2 3 million lak and a buffalo may sell for 4 5 million lak 1 1 lao kip lak us 1 8333 lak on 05 january 2018 smaller livestock e g pigs and poultry are also grown but are mostly consumed by the household timber and non timber forest products e g bamboo shoots and mushrooms frogs lizards and other wild animals are also foraged to provide additional food and income sources in terms of agricultural expansion within the region results of the 2010 11 lao agricultural census presented in fig 4 show that limited access to irrigation water was one of the major constraints to agricultural production as indicated by 51 and 83 of households in sukhuma and phonthong districts respectively 3 methodology 3 1 imagery acquisition pre processing and statistical analysis to estimate the total volume of water stored in farm ponds in the sukhuma and phonthong districts an inventory of farm ponds was conducted using level 3 a rapideye imagery spatial resolution 5 m captured at the end of the wet season october november 2011 when it was assumed that all storages were at full capacity all pre processing and analysis of satellite data was performed using qgis v 2 18 software which included the conversion of spectral radiance to top of atmosphere reflectance values to remove the influence of atmospheric adsorption and scattering of aerosols and water vapour amplified over dark target surfaces e g water bodies and vegetation the unusable data mask included in the rapideye data delivery was then applied to each composite image to remove cloud cover previously identified by the rapideye cloud detection algorithm see planet team 2016 statistical analysis was performed using various data analysis packages within the python environment v 3 6 3 2 delineation of farm ponds and classification accuracy assessment identification of surface water bodies was achieved by using the normalised difference water index ndwi originally developed by mcfeeters 1996 to detect surface water bodies in wetland environments and given by eq 1 1 n d w i g r e e n b a n d n i r b a n d g r e e n b a n d n i r b a n d whilst it is generally assumed that ndwi values greater than zero are representative of water bodies mcfeeters 1996 this is not always the case and the threshold needs to be modified to adequately identify surface water thus arbitrary thresholds of 0 14 and 0 13 were applied to the ndwi raster to broadly classify water and non water bodies in sukhuma and phonthong respectively to remove the influence of the streamflow network i e the mekong river its major tributaries and irrigation channels on the final estimation of pond storage volumes a sub classification of the water bodies into ponds and rivers streams was also performed final post processing included the application of sieve filter with a threshold of 15 to remove any isolated pixels and the conversion of the final classification from a raster to vector dataset from which cloud and cloud shadow undetected by the rapideye algorithm was manually removed and gap filled using the mean value of neighbouring pixels 3 3 quantification of pond water volume and history of pond construction and water use firstly to determine whether pond surface area observed by the satellite sensors could be reliably used to estimate pond water volume a field survey of randomly selected ponds to measure area and depth across at least three transects was conducted in both districts in october 2013 and linear regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between surface area and estimated volume in this case the intercept was excluded from the linear models based on the fact that the dependent variable i e volume must be zero when the independent variable i e area is equal to zero i e y 0 when x 0 as per eisenhauer 2003 these relationships were then used to quantify pond volumes within each district a simple household survey which consisted of seven questions was conducted alongside the field measurement of pond dimensions to provide information related to pond genesis construction and general household use 3 4 sensitivity analysis to determine potential gross value of pond water for irrigated smallholder production for the purpose of this study it was assumed that the traditional practice of wet season rice production which operates close to a subsistence threshold in champasak would continue given its importance as a livelihood pursuit upon which other household decisions and activities are based newby et al 2013 therefore to get a better sense of the potential gross value of pond water for irrigated smallholder production dry season agricultural activities of the typical market oriented farmers in the area were considered for this analysis in the absence of reliable non rice crop water use data in the region secondary data including values of average household cash income from the sale of dry season vegetable crops and the corresponding average weekly irrigation volumes previously published by vote et al 2015 were used to derive corresponding seasonal estimates of irrigation volumes based on an assumed irrigation season of 5 months december april economic water productivity calculated as the value derived per unit of water delivered usd m 3 table 1 was also reported these values were then used to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the potential gross value of farm pond water for dry season vegetable production assuming 25 50 and 75 of the average pond volume was used for the irrigation of non rice crops 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy assessment of raster classification the results of the accuracy assessment table 2 show that a simple colour slice threshold of ndwi performed well in the broad identification of water bodies and non water bodies in both districts with an overall accuracy of 0 98 and 0 99 and an overall kappa 0 94 and 0 99 in sukhuma and phonthong respectively however field observations and visual comparisons of the final raster classification and reference imagery showed that the spectral signature of built up areas e g house roofs and road networks were similar to surface water storages see fig 5 consistent with the literature e g xu 2006 conversely the spectral signatures of ponds with high turbidity and aquatic vegetation were often similar to those of the surrounding landscape and thus classified as non water pixels see fig 6 because of this the extent to which this particular classification approach over or underestimates surface area and thus volume of water bodies in this particular environment is unknown in order to obtain a more accurate estimation of pond water volumes alternative methods to differentiate between water bodies and built up areas and detect all water bodies including those with vegetated water surfaces should be investigated as described in detail by lu and weng 2007 the classification performance could be improved in a number of different ways and could include modifications to data transformation techniques e g vegetation indices principal component analysis etc the application of different feature extraction methods e g pixel based versus object based classifiers etc classification algorithms e g supervised versus unsupervised etc and ensuring a sufficient number of training and validation samples 4 2 district wise pond distribution and estimated storage capacity a total of 47 ponds n 22 in sukhuma district n 25 in phonthong were surveyed to measure surface area and depth so that volume could be estimated the results of the regression analyses indicated a strong positive relationship between surface area and volume in both districts r2 0 94 and 0 93 in sukhuma and phonthong respectively see fig 7 and the following linear models were used to predict pond volume for sukhuma eq 2 and phonthong eq 3 respectively with a high degree of confidence 2 y 1 29 x 0 072 r 2 0 94 3 y 1 64 x 0 090 r 2 0 93 average depth remotely sensed pond distribution between districts and estimates of area and volume are listed in table 3 as shown the number of ponds in phonthong n 1735 was greater than it was in sukhuma n 1209 most likely because the road infrastructure network is more developed as it is a major transportation link between southern laos and thailand see section 4 3 whilst the average surface area of ponds in sukhuma 1470 m2 was larger than those located in phonthong 1250 m2 the average volume of stored water of ponds in the latter 2 05 103 m3 was slightly greater than that of the former 1 90 103 m3 due to greater average pond depth however these differences were not statistically significant and the mean volume across both districts was 1987 m3 the estimated total volume of surface water stored in ponds located in sukhuma and phonthong at the end of the wet season was 2 30 106 m3 and 3 55 106 m3 respectively 4 3 history of pond construction and perceived storage efficiency the results of the household survey indicated that the majority of ponds 67 were built by road constructors in exchange for road base and road maintenance consistent with the results of previous studies see vongsana 2014 vongsana et al 2014 and further analysis of the spatial dataset revealed that 93 and 95 of ponds in sukhuma and phonthong respectively were located within 1 km from the road network as by products of road construction it was presumed that these borrow pit ponds were built with little to no design and poor construction however despite the apparent lack of engineering coupled with the predominately sandy soils found in the region 91 of respondents indicated that the storages held water all year round in the few instances where they did not the ponds had usually emptied by the end of the dry season february april these results contradict the findings of previous studies by vongsana 2014 which showed that the water holding capacity of borrow pit ponds was much less whereby 70 of surveyed respondents in central and southern laos reported empty ponds by the end of the dry season modelling efforts conducted by vongsana 2014 also suggested that water losses were largely due to evaporation from the pond surface rather than seepage or deep percolation irrespective of how water is lost reducing the fraction of non beneficial depletion of pond water through improved storage efficiency at both field and catchment scale could be vastly improved through better engineering and design of ponds including but not limited to increasing the depth to reduce overall evaporative loss and compacting the earthen floor and walls or lining the ponds with a suitable material with no low permeability e g plastic bentonite sprayed concrete to decrease percolation and seepage losses further gains could be made by improving water productivity of smallholder farming systems which was estimated to be 24 500 46 800 lak m 3 2 94 5 61 usd m 3 see table 1 through the introduction of locally appropriate low cost irrigation techniques designed specifically for small plots including drip and sprinkler irrigation vote et al 2015 4 4 household use of pond water for agricultural production and potential gross value for irrigation of non rice crops vongsana et al 2014 found that pond water was commonly used for agricultural production in central and southern laos which resulted in significant increases in total household cash income however the results of other studies e g lyall 2017 vote et al 2015 found that in sukhuma and phonthong districts the use of farm ponds was underdeveloped as a water source with next to no households reporting the use of pond water for irrigated agricultural production primarily because groundwater was the preferred supply as it was perceived to be a clean freely available unrestricted resource notwithstanding pumping costs the results of the work presented in this paper show that the trend of groundwater consumption as the preferred source continued by which less than half of private pond owners 45 indicated that they used pond water for irrigated agriculture of these 76 grew dry season vegetable crops and 52 used it for wet season rice seedling production prior to the onset of the monsoon rains a small number of households 10 also used it to irrigate perennial fruit tree crops and rubber rootstock material the relatively infrequent use of pond water for agriculture on the champasak plain is an indication of the general lack of cognizance regarding the usefulness and value of farm ponds as production water storages to put it in monetary terms of dry season vegetable cropping only the results of the sensitivity analysis illustrated in fig 8 indicated that the average potential gross value of smallholder production per average farm pond volume using 25 of available water ranged from 12 2 million 23 2 million lak 1458 2788 usd at 50 the potential gross value ranged from 24 3 million 46 5 million lak 2917 5575 usd and at 75 these values increased to 36 5 million 69 7 million lak 4375 8363 usd note that this a broad assessment of pond water potential for high value cash crop production that should be viewed with appreciable caution as it does not consider pond water loss via evaporation or percolation and seepage neither does it consider plant water use in addition input costs of production were not taken into account nor was the availability of arable land and on farm labour one must also be mindful that high value crops often require specialist skills and large input requirements furthermore cash crops such as vegetables and fruit tree products are generally more susceptible to the incidence of pest and disease and are highly perishable young 2005 and without adequate market access as is often the case in rural laos sustainable production of these agricultural commodities is futile roberts 2015 moreover these crops do not generally benefit from national agricultural policy interventions which can be subject to wide market price fluctuations as a consequence young 2005 5 summary and conclusions the first objective of this study was to conduct a preliminary assessment of total pond water availability in southern laos by using a ndwi transformation of relatively high spatial resolution rapideye satellite data to capture the typically small water bodies the results of field survey and subsequent linear regression analyses revealed that pond surface area could be used as a predictor of volume based on average pond depth using a simple classification slice the total number of ponds delineated from the surrounding landscape in sukhuma and phonthong was 1209 and 1735 and estimated total volume of pond water was 2 30 106 m3 and 3 55 106 m3 respectively the average pond volume across both districts was 1987 m3 field observations and visual comparisons with reference imagery revealed that water bodies with presumably high turbidity vegetated water surfaces and built up areas were unable to be detected using the ndwi approach and could not be included in the final estimation of pond water volumes to what extent these influences have on the final estimation of total pond volume is unknown and a comparative study of various classification methods should be conducted to determine the best estimate of total pond volumes via remote sensing techniques in southern laos or the rice growing lowlands of lower mekong basin more generally the second objective of this study was to broadly quantify the potential gross value of farm pond water for typical market oriented dry season smallholder production given that farm ponds are largely underutilised as a water resource for food production and that pond water storage efficiency could be significantly improved there are substantial financial gains to be made by the smallholder through better design construction use and management of farm ponds as an alternative to full irrigation using groundwater or as a full supplementary irrigation source for the dry season production of high value non rice crops 6 disclosure statement no potential conflict of interest was

moisture along rivers and streams as water levels recede during the dry season in these areas fishing provides an alternative source of protein and income in rural and remote regions additional sources of household income are derived from livestock production particularly cattle and buffalo which can be sold for relatively large sums of money e g a cow may sell for 2 3 million lak and a buffalo may sell for 4 5 million lak 1 1 lao kip lak us 1 8333 lak on 05 january 2018 smaller livestock e g pigs and poultry are also grown but are mostly consumed by the household timber and non timber forest products e g bamboo shoots and mushrooms frogs lizards and other wild animals are also foraged to provide additional food and income sources in terms of agricultural expansion within the region results of the 2010 11 lao agricultural census presented in fig 4 show that limited access to irrigation water was one of the major constraints to agricultural production as indicated by 51 and 83 of households in sukhuma and phonthong districts respectively 3 methodology 3 1 imagery acquisition pre processing and statistical analysis to estimate the total volume of water stored in farm ponds in the sukhuma and phonthong districts an inventory of farm ponds was conducted using level 3 a rapideye imagery spatial resolution 5 m captured at the end of the wet season october november 2011 when it was assumed that all storages were at full capacity all pre processing and analysis of satellite data was performed using qgis v 2 18 software which included the conversion of spectral radiance to top of atmosphere reflectance values to remove the influence of atmospheric adsorption and scattering of aerosols and water vapour amplified over dark target surfaces e g water bodies and vegetation the unusable data mask included in the rapideye data delivery was then applied to each composite image to remove cloud cover previously identified by the rapideye cloud detection algorithm see planet team 2016 statistical analysis was performed using various data analysis packages within the python environment v 3 6 3 2 delineation of farm ponds and classification accuracy assessment identification of surface water bodies was achieved by using the normalised difference water index ndwi originally developed by mcfeeters 1996 to detect surface water bodies in wetland environments and given by eq 1 1 n d w i g r e e n b a n d n i r b a n d g r e e n b a n d n i r b a n d whilst it is generally assumed that ndwi values greater than zero are representative of water bodies mcfeeters 1996 this is not always the case and the threshold needs to be modified to adequately identify surface water thus arbitrary thresholds of 0 14 and 0 13 were applied to the ndwi raster to broadly classify water and non water bodies in sukhuma and phonthong respectively to remove the influence of the streamflow network i e the mekong river its major tributaries and irrigation channels on the final estimation of pond storage volumes a sub classification of the water bodies into ponds and rivers streams was also performed final post processing included the application of sieve filter with a threshold of 15 to remove any isolated pixels and the conversion of the final classification from a raster to vector dataset from which cloud and cloud shadow undetected by the rapideye algorithm was manually removed and gap filled using the mean value of neighbouring pixels 3 3 quantification of pond water volume and history of pond construction and water use firstly to determine whether pond surface area observed by the satellite sensors could be reliably used to estimate pond water volume a field survey of randomly selected ponds to measure area and depth across at least three transects was conducted in both districts in october 2013 and linear regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between surface area and estimated volume in this case the intercept was excluded from the linear models based on the fact that the dependent variable i e volume must be zero when the independent variable i e area is equal to zero i e y 0 when x 0 as per eisenhauer 2003 these relationships were then used to quantify pond volumes within each district a simple household survey which consisted of seven questions was conducted alongside the field measurement of pond dimensions to provide information related to pond genesis construction and general household use 3 4 sensitivity analysis to determine potential gross value of pond water for irrigated smallholder production for the purpose of this study it was assumed that the traditional practice of wet season rice production which operates close to a subsistence threshold in champasak would continue given its importance as a livelihood pursuit upon which other household decisions and activities are based newby et al 2013 therefore to get a better sense of the potential gross value of pond water for irrigated smallholder production dry season agricultural activities of the typical market oriented farmers in the area were considered for this analysis in the absence of reliable non rice crop water use data in the region secondary data including values of average household cash income from the sale of dry season vegetable crops and the corresponding average weekly irrigation volumes previously published by vote et al 2015 were used to derive corresponding seasonal estimates of irrigation volumes based on an assumed irrigation season of 5 months december april economic water productivity calculated as the value derived per unit of water delivered usd m 3 table 1 was also reported these values were then used to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the potential gross value of farm pond water for dry season vegetable production assuming 25 50 and 75 of the average pond volume was used for the irrigation of non rice crops 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy assessment of raster classification the results of the accuracy assessment table 2 show that a simple colour slice threshold of ndwi performed well in the broad identification of water bodies and non water bodies in both districts with an overall accuracy of 0 98 and 0 99 and an overall kappa 0 94 and 0 99 in sukhuma and phonthong respectively however field observations and visual comparisons of the final raster classification and reference imagery showed that the spectral signature of built up areas e g house roofs and road networks were similar to surface water storages see fig 5 consistent with the literature e g xu 2006 conversely the spectral signatures of ponds with high turbidity and aquatic vegetation were often similar to those of the surrounding landscape and thus classified as non water pixels see fig 6 because of this the extent to which this particular classification approach over or underestimates surface area and thus volume of water bodies in this particular environment is unknown in order to obtain a more accurate estimation of pond water volumes alternative methods to differentiate between water bodies and built up areas and detect all water bodies including those with vegetated water surfaces should be investigated as described in detail by lu and weng 2007 the classification performance could be improved in a number of different ways and could include modifications to data transformation techniques e g vegetation indices principal component analysis etc the application of different feature extraction methods e g pixel based versus object based classifiers etc classification algorithms e g supervised versus unsupervised etc and ensuring a sufficient number of training and validation samples 4 2 district wise pond distribution and estimated storage capacity a total of 47 ponds n 22 in sukhuma district n 25 in phonthong were surveyed to measure surface area and depth so that volume could be estimated the results of the regression analyses indicated a strong positive relationship between surface area and volume in both districts r2 0 94 and 0 93 in sukhuma and phonthong respectively see fig 7 and the following linear models were used to predict pond volume for sukhuma eq 2 and phonthong eq 3 respectively with a high degree of confidence 2 y 1 29 x 0 072 r 2 0 94 3 y 1 64 x 0 090 r 2 0 93 average depth remotely sensed pond distribution between districts and estimates of area and volume are listed in table 3 as shown the number of ponds in phonthong n 1735 was greater than it was in sukhuma n 1209 most likely because the road infrastructure network is more developed as it is a major transportation link between southern laos and thailand see section 4 3 whilst the average surface area of ponds in sukhuma 1470 m2 was larger than those located in phonthong 1250 m2 the average volume of stored water of ponds in the latter 2 05 103 m3 was slightly greater than that of the former 1 90 103 m3 due to greater average pond depth however these differences were not statistically significant and the mean volume across both districts was 1987 m3 the estimated total volume of surface water stored in ponds located in sukhuma and phonthong at the end of the wet season was 2 30 106 m3 and 3 55 106 m3 respectively 4 3 history of pond construction and perceived storage efficiency the results of the household survey indicated that the majority of ponds 67 were built by road constructors in exchange for road base and road maintenance consistent with the results of previous studies see vongsana 2014 vongsana et al 2014 and further analysis of the spatial dataset revealed that 93 and 95 of ponds in sukhuma and phonthong respectively were located within 1 km from the road network as by products of road construction it was presumed that these borrow pit ponds were built with little to no design and poor construction however despite the apparent lack of engineering coupled with the predominately sandy soils found in the region 91 of respondents indicated that the storages held water all year round in the few instances where they did not the ponds had usually emptied by the end of the dry season february april these results contradict the findings of previous studies by vongsana 2014 which showed that the water holding capacity of borrow pit ponds was much less whereby 70 of surveyed respondents in central and southern laos reported empty ponds by the end of the dry season modelling efforts conducted by vongsana 2014 also suggested that water losses were largely due to evaporation from the pond surface rather than seepage or deep percolation irrespective of how water is lost reducing the fraction of non beneficial depletion of pond water through improved storage efficiency at both field and catchment scale could be vastly improved through better engineering and design of ponds including but not limited to increasing the depth to reduce overall evaporative loss and compacting the earthen floor and walls or lining the ponds with a suitable material with no low permeability e g plastic bentonite sprayed concrete to decrease percolation and seepage losses further gains could be made by improving water productivity of smallholder farming systems which was estimated to be 24 500 46 800 lak m 3 2 94 5 61 usd m 3 see table 1 through the introduction of locally appropriate low cost irrigation techniques designed specifically for small plots including drip and sprinkler irrigation vote et al 2015 4 4 household use of pond water for agricultural production and potential gross value for irrigation of non rice crops vongsana et al 2014 found that pond water was commonly used for agricultural production in central and southern laos which resulted in significant increases in total household cash income however the results of other studies e g lyall 2017 vote et al 2015 found that in sukhuma and phonthong districts the use of farm ponds was underdeveloped as a water source with next to no households reporting the use of pond water for irrigated agricultural production primarily because groundwater was the preferred supply as it was perceived to be a clean freely available unrestricted resource notwithstanding pumping costs the results of the work presented in this paper show that the trend of groundwater consumption as the preferred source continued by which less than half of private pond owners 45 indicated that they used pond water for irrigated agriculture of these 76 grew dry season vegetable crops and 52 used it for wet season rice seedling production prior to the onset of the monsoon rains a small number of households 10 also used it to irrigate perennial fruit tree crops and rubber rootstock material the relatively infrequent use of pond water for agriculture on the champasak plain is an indication of the general lack of cognizance regarding the usefulness and value of farm ponds as production water storages to put it in monetary terms of dry season vegetable cropping only the results of the sensitivity analysis illustrated in fig 8 indicated that the average potential gross value of smallholder production per average farm pond volume using 25 of available water ranged from 12 2 million 23 2 million lak 1458 2788 usd at 50 the potential gross value ranged from 24 3 million 46 5 million lak 2917 5575 usd and at 75 these values increased to 36 5 million 69 7 million lak 4375 8363 usd note that this a broad assessment of pond water potential for high value cash crop production that should be viewed with appreciable caution as it does not consider pond water loss via evaporation or percolation and seepage neither does it consider plant water use in addition input costs of production were not taken into account nor was the availability of arable land and on farm labour one must also be mindful that high value crops often require specialist skills and large input requirements furthermore cash crops such as vegetables and fruit tree products are generally more susceptible to the incidence of pest and disease and are highly perishable young 2005 and without adequate market access as is often the case in rural laos sustainable production of these agricultural commodities is futile roberts 2015 moreover these crops do not generally benefit from national agricultural policy interventions which can be subject to wide market price fluctuations as a consequence young 2005 5 summary and conclusions the first objective of this study was to conduct a preliminary assessment of total pond water availability in southern laos by using a ndwi transformation of relatively high spatial resolution rapideye satellite data to capture the typically small water bodies the results of field survey and subsequent linear regression analyses revealed that pond surface area could be used as a predictor of volume based on average pond depth using a simple classification slice the total number of ponds delineated from the surrounding landscape in sukhuma and phonthong was 1209 and 1735 and estimated total volume of pond water was 2 30 106 m3 and 3 55 106 m3 respectively the average pond volume across both districts was 1987 m3 field observations and visual comparisons with reference imagery revealed that water bodies with presumably high turbidity vegetated water surfaces and built up areas were unable to be detected using the ndwi approach and could not be included in the final estimation of pond water volumes to what extent these influences have on the final estimation of total pond volume is unknown and a comparative study of various classification methods should be conducted to determine the best estimate of total pond volumes via remote sensing techniques in southern laos or the rice growing lowlands of lower mekong basin more generally the second objective of this study was to broadly quantify the potential gross value of farm pond water for typical market oriented dry season smallholder production given that farm ponds are largely underutilised as a water resource for food production and that pond water storage efficiency could be significantly improved there are substantial financial gains to be made by the smallholder through better design construction use and management of farm ponds as an alternative to full irrigation using groundwater or as a full supplementary irrigation source for the dry season production of high value non rice crops 6 disclosure statement no potential conflict of interest was

11251,the principal objective of the present study has been to investigate the long term application effects of olive mill wastewaters omww on the main properties of a mediterranean soil under arid climate in addition the migration dynamic and evolution of phenolic compounds in the different soil layers over time and according to the omww amount added have been studied results have showed that the irrigation of sandy soils by different doses of omww has influenced the soil physicochemical and microbiological characteristics however a slight change in the granulometric composition of soil treated with omww has been distinguished the study of the phenolic compounds dynamic has showed the migration of these compounds further than 120 cm soil depth the comparison of the different spectra obtained by the high pressure liquid chromatography hplc technique has explained that the high molecular weight polyphenols which have been retained in the upper soil layers however the low molecular weight phenolic compounds have been detected in depth all the results obtained have proved that the dose of 50 m3 ha 1 has been the most suitable for the soil studied keywords soil olive mill waste waters fertigation phenolic compounds 1 introduction the world s olive growing heritage covers 9 5 million hectares with more than 900 million olive trees of which almost 95 are in the mediterranean basin ioc 2015 indeed olive growing plays a major role in the economy of mediterranean countries especially spain italy tunisia and greece magdich et al 2016 olive growing in tunisia is a strategic socio economic sector currently tunisia s olive growing potential is estimated at nearly 90 million trees occupying an area of 1 8 million hectares or 79 of the total arboreal area gdap 2015 indeed tunisia contributes by 6 of the world production nearly 60 of the african production and 9 of the world exports karray et al 2010 fao 2015 gdap 2015 olive mill wastewater omww is the liquid by product generated during olive oil production the annual production of omww in mediterranean countries reached 30 million cubic meters and 700 000 cubic meters in tunisia alone mekki et al 2013 ben rouina et al 2014 thus the management of omww poses serious environmental and economic problems for all olive oil producing countries including tunisia mechri et al 2011 mekki et al 2013 magdich et al 2016 omww are characterized by an intense purple brown to black color and an odor of olive oil saadi et al 2007 daâssi et al 2014 these effluents have an acidic ph with values between 3 5 and 5 5 and elevated water content with percentage from 83 to 95 nasini et al 2013 magdich et al 2016 omww generally have a high salinity due to the important addition of salt for the conservation of olives hachicha et al 2009 the mineral fraction consists mainly of potassium which has led several researchers to test their fertilizing power piotrowska et al 2011 killi and kavdir 2013 the omww organic matter comprises an insoluble fraction consisting essentially of pulp of olives suspended matter and colloidal and a soluble fraction in the aqueous phase which contains sugars lipids organic acids pectins phenolic compounds vitamins and traces of pesticides el hadrami et al 2004 komilis et al 2005 kapellakis et al 2008 omww phenolic compounds are diverse and their structure is very variable allouche et al 2004 these phenolic compounds are divided into low molecular weight caffeic acid tyrosol hydroxytyrosol p cumaric acid ferulic acid syringic acid protocatechuic acid and high molecular weight compounds tannins anthocianins allouche et al 2004 davies et al 2004 in tunisia the climatic aridity the poverty of soils in organic matter and based on several previous works ben rouina et al 2014 mekki et al 2007 2013 have led the authorities to opt for the use of omww in the agricultural sector as soil organic fertilizers decree 1306 of february 26 2013 this type of irrigation acts on the rhizosphere and more specifically on the microorganisms associated with this part mechri et al 2009 piotrowska et al 2011 mekki et al 2013 soils irrigated by omww provide a favorable environment for the development of soil microflora which means recycling organic matter and enriching mineral elements that increase soil fertility sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2009 el hassani et al 2010 thus an improvement of the respiratory potential and a reduction of the evapotranspiration have been observed following the use of omww mekki et al 2012 abichou et al 2014 however there is still a lack of knowledge on the impact of the use of omww on the evolution of phenolic compounds in the soil and this depending on the amount applied and the time of application mekki et al 2007 the objectives of this study are based on previous works the results of which led to the agronomic valorization of the omww in tunisian soils amendment under arid mediterranean climate decree 1306 of february 26 2013 more specifically we will focus on the study of the long term application effects of omww on the main properties of a soil from the region of sfax south of tunisia moreover the migration dynamic and evolution of phenolic compounds in different soil layers over time and according to the amount of omww applied to the soil have been investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 olive mill wastewaters origin and sampling the olive mill wastewaters used for this work comes from a continuous three phase extraction system olive oil extraction factory located in the region of gremda in sfax tunisia omww have been brought back and stored in a basin at the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute sfax tunisia and spread on the soil homogeneous samples of omww have been brought back to the laboratory for analyses 2 2 soils description and sampling in order to study the long term effects of irrigation of omww three plots p1 p2 and p3 with an area of 1 ha each located at the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute north latitude 34 3 east longitude 10 20 the average annual precipitation and temperature over 15 years have been 210 mm and 25 c respectively and which have been spread by raw omww at december each year since 2004 p1 has been considered as a control plot without irrigation p2 has been irrigated with 50 m3 ha 1 and p3 has been irrigated with 200 m3 ha 1 the last application has been done in december 2016 after 2 months of the last omww application february 2017 soils sampling have been done at different depths 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 and 120 150 cm the soil sampling has been carried out at the rate of 5 points per plot with three repetitions per soil depth level ie overall 15 samples per soil depth level which corresponded to 75 samples per plot samples from different layers and soils have been brought to the laboratory for analyses 2 3 olive mill wastewaters sampling and characterization for all omww applied to soils since 2004 5 homogeneous samples have been taken from different points and depths of the omww storage basin all samples have been brought to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for analyses the main physicochemical characteristics of all omww samples have been determined the ph and electrical conductivity ec have been resolute according to sierra et al 2007 omww water content and the dry matter content have been dogged by drying at 105 c for 24 h organic matter and mineral matter contents have been calculated after heating the samples at 550 c in a laboratory furnace for 4 h the organic matter has been evaluated by difference between dry matter after drying at 105 c and mineral matter after calcination at 550 c for the chemical oxygen demand cod the knechtel method 1978 has been used biochemical oxygen demand bod5 has been measured by the manometric method with a respirometer bsb controller model 620 t wtw the omww phenolic compounds contents have been quantified according the folin ciocalteau method box 1983 total nitrogen content has been determined according to the kjeldahl method knechtel 1978 omww phosphorus iron magnesium potassium sodium and chloride have been analyzed by atomic absorption using hitachi u 2000 spectrometer 2 4 soils granulometric analyses the granulometric composition of different soils samples has been determined by the international robinson pipette method based on stokes law that the larger the particle the faster it falls into the water stanislaw and wojciech 2013 the soil sample has been placed in a specific solution h2o2 which destroys the aggregates the particles have been then separated by sieving for the higher fractions and by gravity sedimentation for the finer ones a known volume of the suspension has been taken and stored in a crucible the solid residue has been weighed after evaporation fractions obtained by sieving make it possible to determine the proportions of sand the fractions obtained by pipetting give the proportions of fine silt and clay 2 5 soils physicochemical analyses the ph and electrical conductivity ec of each soil sample have been determined according to paredes et al 1987 standard method soils water contents dry matters dm organics matters om and mineral matter mm have been evaluated according to sierra et al 2007 standard method soil water retention capacity swrc has been measured according to a standard method salters and williams 1965 soils total nitrogen contents have been assessed by kjeldahl method kandeler et al 1995 available phosphorus p and potassium k have been analyzed following the method cited by magdich et al 2013 2 6 soils respirometric activities analyses for each soil sample soil control sc soil irrigated with omww at dose of 50 m3 ha 1 s50 and soil irrigated with omww at dose of 200 m3 ha 1 s200 and for all depths microbiological activities have been assessed by respirometric activities measurement according to standard method ohlinger et al 1995 2 7 soil phenolic compounds analyses for all soils samples water soluble phenolic compounds have been extracted and determined according to a standard method allouche et al 2004 in fact for each soil sample a 1 25 w v soil aqueous mixture has been shaken for 10 h in a mechanical shaker the supernatants have been extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate the collected organic fractions have been dried and evaporated under vacuum the residues have been extracted twice with dichloromethane in order to remove the non phenolic fraction lipids aliphatic and sugars the liquid phases have been discarded while the washed residues were analyzed by the size exclusion hplc technique 2 8 statistical analyses statistical analyses of all the parameters studied have been carried out using spss software statistical package for the social sciences version 20 the experiments have been performed in triplicate they have been expressed in mean standard deviation using analysis of variance anova analysis of variance differences between treatments have been determined by using the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 in accordance with the duncan test 3 results and discussion 3 1 olive mill wastewaters characterization the studied omww has showed acidic ph 4 46 their electrical conductivity has been high ec 15 94 ms cm 1 moreover the total dry matter concentration has been relatively high 44 g l 1 the omww pollutant load expressed in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod5 have been of the order of 60 g l 1 and 17 g l 1 respectively thus the bod5 cod ratio which constitutes the index of the biodegradability of a given effluent has been of the order of 3 5 in the case of these omww which confirmed that these effluents have been difficulty of biodegradation khoufi et al 2007 the average content of phenolic compounds of the studied omww has been 1 72 g l 1 which has been significantly lower than the values cited previously and which are between 3 g l 1 and 9 g l 1 magdich et al 2016 the omww total nitrogen content has been very low 0 43 g l 1 what can be explained by the very high c n ratio 35 2 table 1 in fact the results have showed the 0 05 variability of the omww characteristics that depended on multiple factors such as the type of extraction process the olive variety the production area the use of pesticides and fertilizers the climatic conditions the growing season and the ripening of olives achak et al 2009 magdich et al 2016 houshia et al 2017 3 2 effects of omww spreading on soil characteristics 3 2 1 effects of omww on soil granulometric characteristics the granulometric characterization of the control soil has showed that sand has been the most abundant element table 2 the physicochemical characterization has showed that the control soil studied has been characterized by a ph close to neutrality 7 56 at the superficial layers depending on the depth a slight increase in ph has been distinguished table 3 in fact sandy dominated soils have been generally known by their near neutral ph mechri et al 2007 abichou et al 2014 magdich et al 2013 the soil water retention capacity swrc has been initially low 22 in the top soil the values of swrc have been increased slightly with depth reaching 42 in the deepest layers 120 150 cm table 3 these results have been correlated with the granulometric nature of the deep layers of the studied soil whose silt content has been much greater compared to the superficial layers sierra et al 2001 mechri et al 2008 abichou et al 2014 the cations exchange capacity cec has varied in the control soil from 5 52 meq g 1 dm in the upper layers and has decreased slightly to 3 35 meq g 1 dm at 150 cm depth thus according to calvet and villemin 1986 the soil studied can be classified among the soils which haven a very weak cations exchange capacity regarding the organic matter om content the control soil has showed low organic matter content in its upper layers 0 59 g kg 1dm this content has decreased remarkably according to the depth to achieve a very negligible value 0 1 g kg 1dm at a depth of 150 cm table 3 indeed the soil top layers can be considered as the main site of organic matter and of its important biological activity magdich et al 2013 mekki et al 2013 the analysis of the effects of omww at doses of 50 m3 ha 1 and 200 m3 ha 1 on the soil granulometric characteristics has been recapitulated in table 2 based on the results found the application of omww did not change the particles size distribution and the treated soils have remained of sandy granulometric class however the addition of omww has influenced the percentage distribution of the different soil components sand silt and clay as well at the surface and at deep layers these results have been consistent with those demonstrated by abichou et al 2014 demonstrating that the addition of omww to a sandy soil has influenced the granulometric distribution of their different components 3 2 2 effects of omww on soil physicochemical characteristics 3 2 2 1 effects on soil ph the control soil ph has been initially near neutrality 7 56 the monitoring of the ph evolution of soils irrigated with omww s50 and s200 as a function of depth has showed that the soil ph has remained almost unchanged for the s50 table 3 however the dose of 200 m3 ha 1 has caused a significant decrease in ph and this decrease has been very remarkable in the superficial horizons from 0 to 90 cm indeed although the omww are acidic effluents ph 4 46 their spreading for a long period of 12 years at 50 m3 ha 1 did not modify the soil ph this can be explained by the fact that the carbonates present in the soil superficial horizon by turning into bicarbonates have neutralized the acidic ph of the omww mekki et al 2013 it should be noted that in the selected study area sfax south of tunisia the average annual precipitation and temperature over 15 years have been 210 mm and 25 c respectively and that can even moderately influenced omww leaching at soil deeper layers these results have been confirmed by gargougi et al 2013 reporting that although acidic omww only slightly modify soil ph indeed the high buffering capacity of the soil has neutralized the acidity of the omww and has limited their effect on the soil ph 3 2 2 2 effects on soil electrical conductivity ec electrical conductivity reflects the content of mineral salts in the soil the follow up of the evolution of the ec has showed that the high salinity of the omww has significantly influenced that of the soil compared to the control soil an increase of the ec has been observed for the two doses applied and it has been noticeable mainly in the superficial layers of the soil table 3 the electrical conductivity of the soil and consequently its salinity has gradually decreased as a function of the depth for the control soil salinity has remained almost unchanged in all the layers studied in this context di bene et al 2013 have stated that the electrical conductivity of the soil has been significantly affected by the spreading of omww moreover our results have confirmed those found by magdich et al 2016 who noted that olive mill waters have caused an increase in soil salinity 3 2 2 3 effects on soil water retention capacity swrc compared to the control soil soils spread with omww have retained more water it has been noted that the water retention capacity of the soil has been increased with the dose of omww table 3 the swrc has been also proportional to the depth thus from the superficial layers 0 30 cm to the deepest layers 120 150 cm the swrc has increased by an average of 20 in soils receiving omww compared to that of the control soil table 3 this increase in swrc can be explained by the effect of lipid compounds contained in omww which has decreased water evaporation and can also modified soil texture abichou et al 2014 other research has showed that the organic matter provided by organic by product such as omww in our case have significantly increased the soil s holding capacity and subsequently its useful water supply saadi et al 2007 3 2 2 4 effects on soil organic matter analysis of the organic matter content om has showed that the control soil has been initially very poor in om with a mean value in the upper layers of the order of 0 59 g kg 1dm the addition of omww has provided a significant supplement in organic matter due to the richness of these effluents in various organic elements table 3 this increase in om has been very noticeable in the superficial layers and has been proportional to the dose of omww applied however depending on the depth the om content has decreased progressively because of the adsorption

total om the toc contents of the different soils have been totally consistent with those of om table 3 in this context all the studies carried out on the effect of omww on the organic matter of the soil make it possible to determine a positive effect of these effluents on the fertilization of the soil benyahia and zein 2003 have demonstrated that adding omww has increased the rate of organic matter with applied doses 3 2 2 5 effects on soil cationic exchange capacity one of the most important roles of organic fertilizer is the improvement of soil structure especially in soils poor in organic matter the enrichment of the soil with organic matter also contributes to a significant increase in its cationic exchange capacity cec monitoring the evolution of the soil cec after the addition of omww has showed a small increase in the cec in the soil receiving 50 m3 ha 1 compared to the control soil this increase in cec has been much more noticeable in the case of the soil s200 as a function of the depth the cec has decreased progressively for both the control soil and the soil receiving the omww table 3 since the cec depends on the presence of mineral elements the monitoring of the evolution of the potassium k levels has showed a positive correlation between the levels of this element and the soil cec in fact the soils treated with omww have presented higher levels of k mainly in the superficial layers 0 30 and 30 60 cm in this context all the studies carried out on the effect of omww on soil characteristics have proved that the spreading of these effluents has strongly modified the soil cationic exchange capacity saadi et al 2007 mechri et al 2008 gargouri et al 2013 3 2 3 effects of omww on soil biological activity microbial biomass and respiratory

different soils studied in terms of cumulative cco2 for 28 days has been represented in fig 1 as showed in that figure the potential for mineralization has been positively correlated with the amount of omww added to the soil the difference in cumulative respirometry has been clear mainly in the soil upper layers rich in microflora from the depth 90 cm the respiratory kinetics have become almost similar for all soils studied fig 1 however the kinetics of cumulative respiration alone cannot provide a clear idea of the biological activity of the soil in relation to the organic matter added hollender et al 2003 mantzavinos and kalogerakis 2005 mancera lopeza et al 2008 this is why we must always think in terms of specific respiration ratio in relation with total organic carbon added cco2

degree of the recalcitrance of this organic matter mancera lopeza et al 2008 the analysis of the data in terms of specific respiration has been illustrated in fig 2 therefore results have showed that even the dose 200 m3 ha 1 has given more important organic supplement in terms of total organic carbon toc to the soil it has been the dose 50 m3 ha 1 which has given higher specific respiration values in terms of cco2 toc fig 2 these findings have been as valid in the superficial layers as in the soil deeper layers these results have been consistent with previous research confirming that the 50 m3 ha 1 rate of omww has been the most appropriate dose for sandy soils poor in organic matter and in arid climates saadi et al 2007 mekki et al 2013 ben rouina et al 2014 magdich et al 2016 3 2 4 evolution and dynamics of phenolic compounds results have showed that the application of omww has increased significantly the soil phenolic compounds content and this increase has been related to the dose applied fig 3 the concentration and nature of the phenolic compounds have decreased with depth but have been still detectable compared to control soil that did not show detectable phenolic compounds fig 3 the comparison of the spectra of the phenolic compounds has showed that the high molecular weight polyphenols have been essentially retained in the upper layers of the soils amended alternatively and as mentioned above the climate of the selected study area sfax southern tunisia is arid the mean annual precipitation and temperature during the last 15 years have been 210 and 25 c respectively these climatic factors and the sandy soil texture may moderately influenced omww infiltration to the soil deeper layers mekki et al 2007 indeed according to the principle of analysis of phenolic compounds by the high pressure liquid chromatography hplc technique the polymers have been eluted with a short retention time while the monomers have required a high retention time in the column allouche et al 2004 the following figure fig 3 has showed that the low retention times 22 88 24 32 min for the soil s200 and 25 13 min for the soil s50 have been concentrated in the upper layers 0 30 cm in the sub surface layer 30 60 cm we have distinguished the absence of compounds with retention times of less than 22 8 min and especially the retention time compounds between 24 and 27 min which have been detected with more abundance in the soil s200 the 60 90 cm layer has clearly showed the tendency of compounds of average to low molecular weights which have been high retention times 25 26 min to infiltrate in deeper layers alternatively in these layers the high concentration of these compounds in the soil s200 in comparison to the soil s50 has been clearly noticed fig 3 beyond this depth it has been especially the low molecular weight monomeric compounds which have been detected essentially in the soil s200 and whose retention times have been reached 30 61 min at the depth 120 cm and have been exceeded 34 min in the layer 120 150 cm indeed the absence of monomers on the superficial layers and their presence in depth can have two explanations the first is that the monomers can be mobilized and transported by rainwater the second explanation is that the monomers have been easier to degrade by aerobic microorganisms on the soil surface mechri et al 2009 piotrowska et al 2011 magdich et al 2012 then given the sandy texture and high porosity of the soil studied results have founded an increase in the organic matter content in all soil layers in proportion to the amount of omww spread this has suggested extensive leaching from the soil surface to the deeper layers and hence the infiltration of phenolic compounds nasini et al 2013 magdich et al 2016 in this context several researchers have shown that extracts of soil irrigated by omww have not shown detectable monomers which can be explained by the physicochemical and biological activities of the soil as well as by the infiltration of monomeric compounds which can be easily mobilized and transported in the deep layers of the soil sierra et al 2001 ben rouina et al 2014 4 conclusions in order to provide evidence of its safety and to make its use more efficient the present work has focused with the study of the probable effects of the different doses of raw omww 50 m3 ha 1 and 200 m3 ha 1 on the principal soil parameters particular interest has been attributed to the dynamic and migration of water soluble phenolic compounds in soil irrigated by omww for a long period 12 years based on this study we can conclude about the results found that the irrigation of sandy soils by different doses of omww has strongly influenced the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the soil a remarkable richness in organic matter and a rise in the concentrations of the different mineral elements have been distinguished the addition of omww has significantly improved soil biological activity which has been strongly correlated with the enrichment of the soil with microflora however the dose of 200 m3 ha 1 has constituted an inhibitory dose for the soil microflora the study of phenolic compounds dynamics has showed the migration of these compounds which have been detected beyond 120 cm soil depth correlating with the sandy and highly permeable grain size of the soil studied all the results have showed that the dose of 50 m3 ha 1 has been the most suitable for the soil studied this has confirmed previous researches done in this context acknowledgements this work has been carried out in the experimental station of the olive tree institute of sfax tunisia the facilities and services of the direction of the institute and the

11251,the principal objective of the present study has been to investigate the long term application effects of olive mill wastewaters omww on the main properties of a mediterranean soil under arid climate in addition the migration dynamic and evolution of phenolic compounds in the different soil layers over time and according to the omww amount added have been studied results have showed that the irrigation of sandy soils by different doses of omww has influenced the soil physicochemical and microbiological characteristics however a slight change in the granulometric composition of soil treated with omww has been distinguished the study of the phenolic compounds dynamic has showed the migration of these compounds further than 120 cm soil depth the comparison of the different spectra obtained by the high pressure liquid chromatography hplc technique has explained that the high molecular weight polyphenols which have been retained in the upper soil layers however the low molecular weight phenolic compounds have been detected in depth all the results obtained have proved that the dose of 50 m3 ha 1 has been the most suitable for the soil studied keywords soil olive mill waste waters fertigation phenolic compounds 1 introduction the world s olive growing heritage covers 9 5 million hectares with more than 900 million olive trees of which almost 95 are in the mediterranean basin ioc 2015 indeed olive growing plays a major role in the economy of mediterranean countries especially spain italy tunisia and greece magdich et al 2016 olive growing in tunisia is a strategic socio economic sector currently tunisia s olive growing potential is estimated at nearly 90 million trees occupying an area of 1 8 million hectares or 79 of the total arboreal area gdap 2015 indeed tunisia contributes by 6 of the world production nearly 60 of the african production and 9 of the world exports karray et al 2010 fao 2015 gdap 2015 olive mill wastewater omww is the liquid by product generated during olive oil production the annual production of omww in mediterranean countries reached 30 million cubic meters and 700 000 cubic meters in tunisia alone mekki et al 2013 ben rouina et al 2014 thus the management of omww poses serious environmental and economic problems for all olive oil producing countries including tunisia mechri et al 2011 mekki et al 2013 magdich et al 2016 omww are characterized by an intense purple brown to black color and an odor of olive oil saadi et al 2007 daâssi et al 2014 these effluents have an acidic ph with values between 3 5 and 5 5 and elevated water content with percentage from 83 to 95 nasini et al 2013 magdich et al 2016 omww generally have a high salinity due to the important addition of salt for the conservation of olives hachicha et al 2009 the mineral fraction consists mainly of potassium which has led several researchers to test their fertilizing power piotrowska et al 2011 killi and kavdir 2013 the omww organic matter comprises an insoluble fraction consisting essentially of pulp of olives suspended matter and colloidal and a soluble fraction in the aqueous phase which contains sugars lipids organic acids pectins phenolic compounds vitamins and traces of pesticides el hadrami et al 2004 komilis et al 2005 kapellakis et al 2008 omww phenolic compounds are diverse and their structure is very variable allouche et al 2004 these phenolic compounds are divided into low molecular weight caffeic acid tyrosol hydroxytyrosol p cumaric acid ferulic acid syringic acid protocatechuic acid and high molecular weight compounds tannins anthocianins allouche et al 2004 davies et al 2004 in tunisia the climatic aridity the poverty of soils in organic matter and based on several previous works ben rouina et al 2014 mekki et al 2007 2013 have led the authorities to opt for the use of omww in the agricultural sector as soil organic fertilizers decree 1306 of february 26 2013 this type of irrigation acts on the rhizosphere and more specifically on the microorganisms associated with this part mechri et al 2009 piotrowska et al 2011 mekki et al 2013 soils irrigated by omww provide a favorable environment for the development of soil microflora which means recycling organic matter and enriching mineral elements that increase soil fertility sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2009 el hassani et al 2010 thus an improvement of the respiratory potential and a reduction of the evapotranspiration have been observed following the use of omww mekki et al 2012 abichou et al 2014 however there is still a lack of knowledge on the impact of the use of omww on the evolution of phenolic compounds in the soil and this depending on the amount applied and the time of application mekki et al 2007 the objectives of this study are based on previous works the results of which led to the agronomic valorization of the omww in tunisian soils amendment under arid mediterranean climate decree 1306 of february 26 2013 more specifically we will focus on the study of the long term application effects of omww on the main properties of a soil from the region of sfax south of tunisia moreover the migration dynamic and evolution of phenolic compounds in different soil layers over time and according to the amount of omww applied to the soil have been investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 olive mill wastewaters origin and sampling the olive mill wastewaters used for this work comes from a continuous three phase extraction system olive oil extraction factory located in the region of gremda in sfax tunisia omww have been brought back and stored in a basin at the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute sfax tunisia and spread on the soil homogeneous samples of omww have been brought back to the laboratory for analyses 2 2 soils description and sampling in order to study the long term effects of irrigation of omww three plots p1 p2 and p3 with an area of 1 ha each located at the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute north latitude 34 3 east longitude 10 20 the average annual precipitation and temperature over 15 years have been 210 mm and 25 c respectively and which have been spread by raw omww at december each year since 2004 p1 has been considered as a control plot without irrigation p2 has been irrigated with 50 m3 ha 1 and p3 has been irrigated with 200 m3 ha 1 the last application has been done in december 2016 after 2 months of the last omww application february 2017 soils sampling have been done at different depths 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 and 120 150 cm the soil sampling has been carried out at the rate of 5 points per plot with three repetitions per soil depth level ie overall 15 samples per soil depth level which corresponded to 75 samples per plot samples from different layers and soils have been brought to the laboratory for analyses 2 3 olive mill wastewaters sampling and characterization for all omww applied to soils since 2004 5 homogeneous samples have been taken from different points and depths of the omww storage basin all samples have been brought to the laboratory and stored at 4 c for analyses the main physicochemical characteristics of all omww samples have been determined the ph and electrical conductivity ec have been resolute according to sierra et al 2007 omww water content and the dry matter content have been dogged by drying at 105 c for 24 h organic matter and mineral matter contents have been calculated after heating the samples at 550 c in a laboratory furnace for 4 h the organic matter has been evaluated by difference between dry matter after drying at 105 c and mineral matter after calcination at 550 c for the chemical oxygen demand cod the knechtel method 1978 has been used biochemical oxygen demand bod5 has been measured by the manometric method with a respirometer bsb controller model 620 t wtw the omww phenolic compounds contents have been quantified according the folin ciocalteau method box 1983 total nitrogen content has been determined according to the kjeldahl method knechtel 1978 omww phosphorus iron magnesium potassium sodium and chloride have been analyzed by atomic absorption using hitachi u 2000 spectrometer 2 4 soils granulometric analyses the granulometric composition of different soils samples has been determined by the international robinson pipette method based on stokes law that the larger the particle the faster it falls into the water stanislaw and wojciech 2013 the soil sample has been placed in a specific solution h2o2 which destroys the aggregates the particles have been then separated by sieving for the higher fractions and by gravity sedimentation for the finer ones a known volume of the suspension has been taken and stored in a crucible the solid residue has been weighed after evaporation fractions obtained by sieving make it possible to determine the proportions of sand the fractions obtained by pipetting give the proportions of fine silt and clay 2 5 soils physicochemical analyses the ph and electrical conductivity ec of each soil sample have been determined according to paredes et al 1987 standard method soils water contents dry matters dm organics matters om and mineral matter mm have been evaluated according to sierra et al 2007 standard method soil water retention capacity swrc has been measured according to a standard method salters and williams 1965 soils total nitrogen contents have been assessed by kjeldahl method kandeler et al 1995 available phosphorus p and potassium k have been analyzed following the method cited by magdich et al 2013 2 6 soils respirometric activities analyses for each soil sample soil control sc soil irrigated with omww at dose of 50 m3 ha 1 s50 and soil irrigated with omww at dose of 200 m3 ha 1 s200 and for all depths microbiological activities have been assessed by respirometric activities measurement according to standard method ohlinger et al 1995 2 7 soil phenolic compounds analyses for all soils samples water soluble phenolic compounds have been extracted and determined according to a standard method allouche et al 2004 in fact for each soil sample a 1 25 w v soil aqueous mixture has been shaken for 10 h in a mechanical shaker the supernatants have been extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate the collected organic fractions have been dried and evaporated under vacuum the residues have been extracted twice with dichloromethane in order to remove the non phenolic fraction lipids aliphatic and sugars the liquid phases have been discarded while the washed residues were analyzed by the size exclusion hplc technique 2 8 statistical analyses statistical analyses of all the parameters studied have been carried out using spss software statistical package for the social sciences version 20 the experiments have been performed in triplicate they have been expressed in mean standard deviation using analysis of variance anova analysis of variance differences between treatments have been determined by using the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 in accordance with the duncan test 3 results and discussion 3 1 olive mill wastewaters characterization the studied omww has showed acidic ph 4 46 their electrical conductivity has been high ec 15 94 ms cm 1 moreover the total dry matter concentration has been relatively high 44 g l 1 the omww pollutant load expressed in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod5 have been of the order of 60 g l 1 and 17 g l 1 respectively thus the bod5 cod ratio which constitutes the index of the biodegradability of a given effluent has been of the order of 3 5 in the case of these omww which confirmed that these effluents have been difficulty of biodegradation khoufi et al 2007 the average content of phenolic compounds of the studied omww has been 1 72 g l 1 which has been significantly lower than the values cited previously and which are between 3 g l 1 and 9 g l 1 magdich et al 2016 the omww total nitrogen content has been very low 0 43 g l 1 what can be explained by the very high c n ratio 35 2 table 1 in fact the results have showed the 0 05 variability of the omww characteristics that depended on multiple factors such as the type of extraction process the olive variety the production area the use of pesticides and fertilizers the climatic conditions the growing season and the ripening of olives achak et al 2009 magdich et al 2016 houshia et al 2017 3 2 effects of omww spreading on soil characteristics 3 2 1 effects of omww on soil granulometric characteristics the granulometric characterization of the control soil has showed that sand has been the most abundant element table 2 the physicochemical characterization has showed that the control soil studied has been characterized by a ph close to neutrality 7 56 at the superficial layers depending on the depth a slight increase in ph has been distinguished table 3 in fact sandy dominated soils have been generally known by their near neutral ph mechri et al 2007 abichou et al 2014 magdich et al 2013 the soil water retention capacity swrc has been initially low 22 in the top soil the values of swrc have been increased slightly with depth reaching 42 in the deepest layers 120 150 cm table 3 these results have been correlated with the granulometric nature of the deep layers of the studied soil whose silt content has been much greater compared to the superficial layers sierra et al 2001 mechri et al 2008 abichou et al 2014 the cations exchange capacity cec has varied in the control soil from 5 52 meq g 1 dm in the upper layers and has decreased slightly to 3 35 meq g 1 dm at 150 cm depth thus according to calvet and villemin 1986 the soil studied can be classified among the soils which haven a very weak cations exchange capacity regarding the organic matter om content the control soil has showed low organic matter content in its upper layers 0 59 g kg 1dm this content has decreased remarkably according to the depth to achieve a very negligible value 0 1 g kg 1dm at a depth of 150 cm table 3 indeed the soil top layers can be considered as the main site of organic matter and of its important biological activity magdich et al 2013 mekki et al 2013 the analysis of the effects of omww at doses of 50 m3 ha 1 and 200 m3 ha 1 on the soil granulometric characteristics has been recapitulated in table 2 based on the results found the application of omww did not change the particles size distribution and the treated soils have remained of sandy granulometric class however the addition of omww has influenced the percentage distribution of the different soil components sand silt and clay as well at the surface and at deep layers these results have been consistent with those demonstrated by abichou et al 2014 demonstrating that the addition of omww to a sandy soil has influenced the granulometric distribution of their different components 3 2 2 effects of omww on soil physicochemical characteristics 3 2 2 1 effects on soil ph the control soil ph has been initially near neutrality 7 56 the monitoring of the ph evolution of soils irrigated with omww s50 and s200 as a function of depth has showed that the soil ph has remained almost unchanged for the s50 table 3 however the dose of 200 m3 ha 1 has caused a significant decrease in ph and this decrease has been very remarkable in the superficial horizons from 0 to 90 cm indeed although the omww are acidic effluents ph 4 46 their spreading for a long period of 12 years at 50 m3 ha 1 did not modify the soil ph this can be explained by the fact that the carbonates present in the soil superficial horizon by turning into bicarbonates have neutralized the acidic ph of the omww mekki et al 2013 it should be noted that in the selected study area sfax south of tunisia the average annual precipitation and temperature over 15 years have been 210 mm and 25 c respectively and that can even moderately influenced omww leaching at soil deeper layers these results have been confirmed by gargougi et al 2013 reporting that although acidic omww only slightly modify soil ph indeed the high buffering capacity of the soil has neutralized the acidity of the omww and has limited their effect on the soil ph 3 2 2 2 effects on soil electrical conductivity ec electrical conductivity reflects the content of mineral salts in the soil the follow up of the evolution of the ec has showed that the high salinity of the omww has significantly influenced that of the soil compared to the control soil an increase of the ec has been observed for the two doses applied and it has been noticeable mainly in the superficial layers of the soil table 3 the electrical conductivity of the soil and consequently its salinity has gradually decreased as a function of the depth for the control soil salinity has remained almost unchanged in all the layers studied in this context di bene et al 2013 have stated that the electrical conductivity of the soil has been significantly affected by the spreading of omww moreover our results have confirmed those found by magdich et al 2016 who noted that olive mill waters have caused an increase in soil salinity 3 2 2 3 effects on soil water retention capacity swrc compared to the control soil soils spread with omww have retained more water it has been noted that the water retention capacity of the soil has been increased with the dose of omww table 3 the swrc has been also proportional to the depth thus from the superficial layers 0 30 cm to the deepest layers 120 150 cm the swrc has increased by an average of 20 in soils receiving omww compared to that of the control soil table 3 this increase in swrc can be explained by the effect of lipid compounds contained in omww which has decreased water evaporation and can also modified soil texture abichou et al 2014 other research has showed that the organic matter provided by organic by product such as omww in our case have significantly increased the soil s holding capacity and subsequently its useful water supply saadi et al 2007 3 2 2 4 effects on soil organic matter analysis of the organic matter content om has showed that the control soil has been initially very poor in om with a mean value in the upper layers of the order of 0 59 g kg 1dm the addition of omww has provided a significant supplement in organic matter due to the richness of these effluents in various organic elements table 3 this increase in om has been very noticeable in the superficial layers and has been proportional to the dose of omww applied however depending on the depth the om content has decreased progressively because of the adsorption of the organic elements in the surface layers in fact around 150 cm deep the om contents have been less than 0 2 g kg 1dm even in the soil s200 total organic carbon toc has accounted for 58 of the total om the toc contents of the different soils have been totally consistent with those of om table 3 in this context all the studies carried out on the effect of omww on the organic matter of the soil make it possible to determine a positive effect of these effluents on the fertilization of the soil benyahia and zein 2003 have demonstrated that adding omww has increased the rate of organic matter with applied doses 3 2 2 5 effects on soil cationic exchange capacity one of the most important roles of organic fertilizer is the improvement of soil structure especially in soils poor in organic matter the enrichment of the soil with organic matter also contributes to a significant increase in its cationic exchange capacity cec monitoring the evolution of the soil cec after the addition of omww has showed a small increase in the cec in the soil receiving 50 m3 ha 1 compared to the control soil this increase in cec has been much more noticeable in the case of the soil s200 as a function of the depth the cec has decreased progressively for both the control soil and the soil receiving the omww table 3 since the cec depends on the presence of mineral elements the monitoring of the evolution of the potassium k levels has showed a positive correlation between the levels of this element and the soil cec in fact the soils treated with omww have presented higher levels of k

microbiological characteristics of the soil a remarkable richness in organic matter and a rise in the concentrations of the different mineral elements have been distinguished the addition of omww has significantly improved soil biological activity which has been strongly correlated with the enrichment of the soil with microflora however the dose of 200 m3 ha 1 has constituted an inhibitory dose for the soil microflora the study of phenolic compounds dynamics has showed the migration of these compounds which have been detected beyond 120 cm soil depth correlating with the sandy and highly permeable grain size of the soil studied all the results have showed that the dose of 50 m3 ha 1 has been the most suitable for the soil studied this has confirmed previous researches done in this

11252,intensive irrigated agriculture in semiarid southern idaho contributes to nitrate loads in shallow groundwater to determine the temporal character and source of leached nitrate in the twin falls irrigation tract and investigate the soil n cycling process involved we measured stable isotope ratios of nitrate δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 and water δ 2h h2o δ 18o h2o in 1 tunnel drain and irrigation waters during 2003 07 and 2 leachate from incubated urea and manure amended soil endmembers the tunnel water δ 2h h2o vs δ 18o h2o plots showed clear overlap with waters of milner reservoir which stores the tract s irrigation water prior to distribution the δ 18o h2o time series and a correlation analysis with climate hydrologic parameters indicated a 20 to 23 month transit time between the surface and shallow groundwater the tunnel waters had a mean δ 15n no3 of 6 1 0 7 std dev and mean δ 18o no3 of 6 1 0 7 decreasing tunnel water δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 and nitrate concentrations in tunnel drains located closer to the snake r indicate increasing contributions of regional groundwater to shallow groundwater and dilution of the latter s no3 n content as proximity to the river increases

meteoric water line tfcc twin falls canal co keywords drainage linear mixing model nitrogen cycle nitrate leaching 1 introduction only 40 of nitrogen applied to the world s crops is incorporated into the harvested products worldwide on average and the resulting excess soil reactive n can cause adverse environmental and human health impacts zhang et al 2015 agricultural nitrogen use efficiency nue must improve if future global food needs are to be met in a sustainable manner zhang et al 2015 this is also true in the western us where near optimal light and temperature conditions combined with generous n and p fertilizer applications often produce peak yields for irrigated crops since the 1970 s increasing crop yields and the robust growth of a regional dairy industry have resulted in increased fertilizer and dairy manure applications to farm lands in south central idaho and to the twin falls canal co tfcc irrigation tract in particular lentz et al 2018 nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater exiting subsurface tunnel drains in the tfcc tract were sampled on a monthly or bimonthly basis in the late 1960s carter et al 1971 1999 and 2002 2007 lentz et al 2018 mean nitrate n concentrations in shallow groundwater of the tract have increased with time from 3 1 to 5 1 mg l 1 lentz et al 2018 these concentrations are small relative to the 119 mg l 1 median no3 n concentration reported for soil drainage water below local irrigated crops and the reason for this is not clear the source of nitrate contamination in shallow groundwater can be inferred from nitrate concentrations coupled with nitrate 15n and 18o stable isotope contents if nitrate source inputs and end members are known and transformations of n along flow paths are minimal böhlke et al 2003 nestler et al 2011 xing and liu 2016 transport rates from which transit times can be inferred of water from the soil surface to shallow groundwater can be deduced from time series measurements of stable isotopes in recharge water and groundwater sources clark and fritz 1997 hunt et al 2005 irrigated cropland is the major source of percolating soil waters in the tract and agricultural fertilizers and animal wastes are the key contributors to nitrate loading bahr and carlson 2000 holloway et al 2004 lentz et al 2018 during the current study ammonium or urea fertilizers comprised 90 of fertilizer applied idaho state dept agriculture 2005 and nitrate concentration in irrigation water is generally 1 of that in soil percolation water lentz et al 2018 another potential source of leached nitrate is derived from ammonification and nitrification of n fixed in legume root and crown biomass particularly alfalfa medicago sativa l because nh4 n from alfalfa biomass and urea fertilizer have similar δ 15n unkovich 2013 and both are converted to no3 by soil nitrification nitrate from the two sources is indistinguishable thus n fixed from atmospheric n2 inorganic fertilizers and legume biomass and n from manure provide the dominate n inputs into tract soils several groundwater studies collected a single water sample annually from many of the area s deep wells and evaluated nitrate δ 15n values in samples containing 5 mg l 1 nitrate individual well waters had nitrate δ 15n values typical of animal waste sources 10 fixed n 4 to 4 or mineralized soil organic n 4 to 9 bahr and carlson 2000 holloway et al 2004 unkovich 2013 groundwater nitrate 15n and 18o isotopes in 31 of the area s deep wells were evaluated from a single water sample collected in 2001 the author s concluded that denitrification was not a dominant process during nitrate transport tesch and carlson 2004 plummer et al 2000 reported that groundwater sampled in the area is nearly saturated with oxygen which inhibits microbial denitrifier activity a more frequent sampling of the tract s irrigation and shallow groundwaters combined with stable isotope analysis is needed to improve our understanding of water and nitrate status there for example denitrification may vary with year or season and a single annual sample may not detect its occurrence the current research 1 evaluates the 15n and 18o isotopic signature of nitrate and the deuterium 2h and the 18o isotopes in irrigation water and subsurface tunnel drain outflow sampled in 2002 2007 and 2 determines the 15n and 18o isotopic signatures of fertilizer and manure nitrate sources which are potential inputs and end members in the continuum we hypothesized that 1 the transit time for water in shallow groundwater outflow from tunnel drains is relatively short 3 y 2 stable isotope ratios of water and nitrate could be used to test our supposition that fixed n is the primary source of leached nitrate and 3 nitrification not denitrification is the dominant process in the nitrogen cycle in these agricultural soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the twin falls canal co irrigation tract is located in the upper snake river basin of southern idaho at an elevation of 884 to 1250 m fig 1 soils are dominated by portneuf silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic durinodic xeric haplocalcids and sluka silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic xerollic haplodurids which is similar to the deeper portneuf except sluka is moderately deep to a duripan shortly after the tract was developed localized high water tables formed as a result of irrigation carter et al 1971 consequently more than fifty drainage networks were constructed to alleviate saturated conditions for each a series of 9 to 21 m deep relief wells were drilled vertically through the bedrock and intercepted at 1 1 to 12 m depth either by horizontal tunnels 1 2 2 m blasted in the basalt bedrock or by tile drain piping carter et al 1971 cothern 2013 shallow groundwater is conveyed by gravity flow through individual networks and exits from outlets located in canyons or man made surface drainage channels hence the groundwater draining from the networks hereafter referred to as tunnel water is a mixture of excess irrigation water draining from the soil above and groundwater which wells up in bore holes from bedrock below the tract was described in detail by carter et al 1971 the study area includes the outlet drains monitored in 1968 70 by carter et al 1971 fig 1 agricultural crops and management practices of the study area were described by lentz et al 2018 2 2 sampling and analysis we revisited and sampled 10 of the original 15 tunnel network drains evaluated by carter et al 1971 across the tfcc tract fig 1 the 10 drains table 1 were stratified by area to ensure complete coverage of the study lands water samples were also collected at the milner dam pool 42 31 38 n 114 02 14 w which supplies water to the irrigation canals that convey the water downslope across the tract water samples for nutrient and isotope analysis were collected in 2003 through 2007 once per month during the april to november irrigation season and on alternate months in the off season nutrient concentrations in these samples were analyzed and reported in a companion paper lentz et al 2018 we sampled water 125 ml from flows issuing directly from the tunnel drain outlet and stored it on ice until transported to the lab particulates present in water samples collected from tunnel drains the milner pool and percolate from the laboratory experiment see incubation study were removed by passing the liquid through a nitrate free 0 45 μm filter of the sediment free water sample 20 ml was frozen in a scintillation vial for nitrate 15n and 18o isotope analysis and a 30 ml portion was stored at 4 c for deuterium 2h and 18o isotope analysis isotope samples were archived and selected sets were shipped for analysis beginning in 2005 water samples were shipped frozen on dry ice to the marine chemistry and geochemistry laboratory at woods hole oceanographic institution woods hole ma for nitrate isotope analysis the laboratory employed the microbial denitrifier method mcilvin and casciotti 2011 and gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry finnigan deltaplus xp waltham ma to measure δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 eqs 1 and 2 the standard isotopic ratio for n was atmospheric n2 air while that for o was the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow because the computed ratio is small the value is multiplied

measurement precision was 0 1 to 0 2 l for both δ 15n and δ 18o mcilvin and casciotti 2011 a subset of tunnel water and irrigation water samples were sent to the university of arizona environmental isotope laboratory tucson az where they were analyzed for δ2h h2o eq 3 and δ18o h2o eq 4 waters were analyzed for d h ratio using a dual inlet mass spectrometer delta s thermo finnegan bremen germany equipped with an automated chromium reduction device h device thermo finnegan for the generation of hydrogen gas using metallic chromium at 750 c water δ 18o was measured on the same mass spectrometer

stable isotope analysis 112 for no3 and 99 for h2o for nitrate isotopes δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 we selected 1 sample dates in 2003 2005 for the tunnel waters having the greatest no3 n concentrations herman and two that had the least nye college of southern idaho csi hatchery 2 february july and september sample dates in 2005 through 2007 for all tunnel water samples table 1 and 3 irrigation water collected at the research farm near kimberly id 42 31 04 n 114 22 20 w during the 2003 2004 growing seasons for water isotopes δ 2h h2o δ 18o h2o we selected 1 the sample dates in 2003 2004 for the csi hatchery herman and walters tunnels and 2 all sampling dates in 2006 2007 for cox grossman herman and nye table 1 including the milner dam pool these tunnels represented sites having a range of irrigation types table 1 and no3 n concentrations 2 3 relating tunnel water δ 18o h2o to climatic and hydrologic parameters the δ 18o h2o of precipitation is strongly influenced by temperature during rainout clark and fritz 1997 thus one can reasonably expect that the δ 18o h2o of the tract irrigation water whose main source is precipitation falling on upstream mountains is correlated with climatic parameters similarly a correlation would be expected with certain hydrologic parameters such as spring flowrate in the snake r which is largely controlled by snowmelt rates in upstream mountains it follows that temporal origin of snake r irrigation recharge water supplying tunnel drains may be traced by comparing tunnel water δ 18o h2o with current and past annual climatic or hydrologic parameters correlations between tunnel water δ 18o h2o and annual climatic hydrologic parameters from current and one two and three years previous listed in table 2 aided in estimating tunnel water transit time 2 4 incubation study the objective of the experiment was to characterize the stable isotope status of nitrate in water leaching from agricultural soil amended with different n sources these leached waters approximate a mixing end member series that contribute to the isotopic condition of the area s shallow groundwater kendall 1998 two n sources were urea fertilizer representing fixed n and dairy manure the laboratory incubation study determined the nitrate 15n and 18o fractionation characteristics of water draining from un amended and urea fertilizer or manure amended soils the experiment employed a completely randomized design with three treatments and six replicates 18 experimental units a 0 30 cm depth sample of portneuf silt loam was collected ambient nitrate was removed by extraction with reverse osmosis ro water air dried and sieved through a 2 mm screen one of the following three amendment treatments was mixed with 125 g of soil 1 0 04 g total n as freeze dried manure 6 74 g dairy manure dry wt 2 0 04 g n as urea fertilizer 0 1 g or 3 no amendment the treated soil was packed into 13 cm long by 4 cm diameter pvc cylinders with nylon cloth 50 μm mesh bottoms in three lifts to achieve a dry bulk density of about 1 15 mg m 3 extra soil columns prepared for each treatment were used to determine soil pore volumes and track soil no3 n concentrations during incubation soil in each cylinder was wetted to 55 water filled pore space wfps using ro water and incubated at 22 c soil water contents were adjusted to 55 wfps weekly all soil columns were leached after six months incubation ensuring that the accumulated no3 n included an ample proportion of input n that had cycled through the soil system for leaching ro water was applied to the column s nylon cloth shielded soil surface at a rate of 6 0 ml h 1 4 8 mm h 1 until one pore volume of soil percolate was collected from each soil column samples of the accumulated water were prepared for δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 analysis as described above 2 5 three source linear mixing model a simple linear mixing model with three sources phillips 2001 was employed to estimate fractional nitrate contributions from conventional fertilizer ffixed manure fman and regional groundwater fgw to tunnel water tun nitrate the linear equations eqs 5 7 defining the system are δjfixed ffixed δjman fman δjgw fgw δjtun 5 δkfixed ffixed δkman fman δkgw fgw δktun 6 ffixed fman fgw 1 7 where jx δ 15n no3 and kx δ18o no3 for each source component and tunnel waters fixed man gw and tun the solution was calculated as x a 1b where x is the 1 3 solution matrix ffert fman fgw a 1 is the inverse of the 3 3 source coefficient matrix and b is the 1 3 tunnel results matrix the model assumes that nitrate n in waters is conservative e g denitrification is a minor influence in the system only three sources are contributing nitrate to tunnel water and source end members isotope compositions are constant 2 6 statistical analysis descriptive statistics mean standard deviation for tunnel sample nitrate and water isotopes were obtained using proc mean sas 2012 and tests for normality using proc univariate sas 2012 the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values for tunnel water and irrigation water were plotted relative to the local meteoric water line for southeastern idaho and regression lines were fitted to irrigation water data using proc reg sas 2012 we employed pearson s correlations calculated by proc corr sas 2012 to evaluate the relationships between normalized tunnel water δ 18o h2o values vs selected climate and hydrologic parameters for current and one two and three years previous tunnel water δ 18o h2o values were normalized by dividing each by its tunnel mean the analysis included available isotope data from all tunnel drains for years 2003 to 2007 in another analysis correlations were determined between tunnel drain location distance to the snake r and each of the following tunnel water traits nitrate concentration δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 δ 18o h2o and δ 2h h2o to determine if δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 compositions differed among the tunnel water and incubation treatment leachate endmember series we conducted an analysis of variance anova using proc mixed sas 2012 with water source group as the fixed effect and year and year group as random effects then 95 confidence limits were constructed on treatment means a similar approach was used to determine if the δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 δ 2h h2o or δ 18o h2o ratios differed between the group of three tunnel waters that had the greatest nitrate concentration relative to the group of three having the least table 1 the alignment and variance associated with δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values from tunnel waters and the end member series were plotted for comparison using the following two step process the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values were plotted separately for control urea and manure soil endmembers hankins and walters tunnel waters combined and all other tunnel waters combined a line intersecting each group s spatial mean was drawn parallel to the group s long axis of symmetry i e in the direction of greatest spatial spread among data points a second shorter line representing short axis of symmetry was drawn also intersecting the spatial mean but perpendicular to the first we then quantified the amount of spread among the group s data points in the long and short symmetry axis directions this was accomplished by rotating and aligning the x y coordinate axes with the group s long and short symmetry axes transforming the group s point coordinate values relative to the new coordinate axes then computing standard deviations for the transformed x and y coordinate values see fig 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and tunnel water 2h and 18o milner irrigation and tunnel water δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values overlap indicating that irrigation water is an important source of recharge for shallow ground water fig 2 milner waters plot close to the local meteoric water line lmwl cecil et al 2005 milner and tunnel water δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values are smaller in comparison to late spring summer and fall meteoric waters which lie outside plot area in fig 2 and typically have δ 18o h2o values greater than 15 5 benjamin et al 2004 precipitation becomes depleted in 2h and 18o as cloud temperature decreases in response to seasonal or elevation related effects hence meteoric water and dominantly winter precipitation snow is the ultimate source of milner and tunnel water the slopes of regression lines fitted to data from milner dam pool for 2006 4 8 and 2007 5 4 data are typical for surface water under evaporative regimes which commonly range from 4 to 6 barnes and allison 1988 clark and fritz 1997 milner irrigation water becomes isotopically enriched during nonequilibrium evaporation from reservoirs canals and soils which results in a positive shift in plotted points and a decrease in plot slopes clark and fritz 1997 benjamin et al 2004 because 2007 was substantially warmer and dryer than 2006 with greater evaporation the milner 2007 regression line is displaced further from the lmwl clark and fritz 1997 furthermore the correspondence of irrigation and tunnel water plots in the upper right range for milner water indicates that these shallow groundwaters are primarily recharged by irrigation water applied during the growing season figs 2 and 3 regional groundwater is another potential recharge source for the shallow groundwater the former originates in mountains to the south of the tract and is less affected by evaporation plummer et al 2000 therefore the regional groundwater can be more depleted in δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o than milner water fig 2 3 2 transit time the δ 18o h2o time series from milner pond and select tunnel drains 2006 2007 displayed in fig 3 and correlations of tunnel water δ 18o h2o with current and previous year s climate hydrologic parameters in table 2 were used to estimate the time required for water applied at the soil surface to transit to the shallow aquifer ingraham et al 1991 cool season precipitation and snowmelt runoff contribute water depleted in heavy isotopes to the milner reservoir which produces a decline in δ 18o h2o values attaining a minimum in early to late spring fig 3c during the growing season reservoir inflows are more heavily influenced by seepage spring irrigation return and reservoir storage waters which are enriched in heavy isotope concentrations due to evaporation this causes a rise in δ 18o h2o values peaking in early to late fall fig 3c smaller scale variations in the pattern likely result from annual variations in climate and hydrology fig 3c for example 2006 was unusually wet and cool with a heavy snowpack that produced increased summer reservoir levels whereas antithetical weather in 2007 produced decreased summer reservoir levels fig 3a b the diminished contribution of precipitation and runoff to the reservoir in 2007 increased the proportion of shallow groundwater seepage contributions and contracted the range of δ 18o h2o values observed relative to 2006 fig 3c the lag time between the seasonal δ 18o h2o peaks in milner irrigation water and subsequent peaks in tunnel drain water varied between 8 and 11 months fig 3c the period measured for some tunnels may differ from the actual value by up to 2 months because water was sometimes sampled on alternate months particularly outside the growing season in some cases the lag varied 1 between tunnel drains presumably due differences in local hydrogeology and 2 between years for the same tunnel drain possibly due to differences in crops grown between years and hence the amount and timing of irrigation water applied the differences in lag were not considered conclusive due to the timing of sample collection because milner δ 18o h2o peaks occur annually tunnel water δ 18o h2o peaks in the current year may represent the arrival of the most recent milner peak water or the arrival of milner peak water from one two or three years previous given that tunnel water δ 18o h2o values are correlated most strongly and significantly with climate hydrologic parameters from one year previous table 2 we conclude that the milner and tunnel water signals are one year out of phase this suggests that the transit time between the surface and shallow groundwater is between 20 and 23 months others have estimated transit times for shallow groundwaters 10 m depth to water to be 1 2 y in glacial till 5 y in layered sediments 3 y in loamy sands or 4 y in alluvial fill sediments reddy et al 2006 moore et al 2006 turkeltaub et al 2016 the 20 to 23 month transit time is very short relative to that estimated for deep groundwater in the area tens or hundreds of years mann and low 1994 this implies that the chemistry of the deep groundwater source has not yet fully absorbed the impact of the post 1960s expansion in inorganic and organic fertilizer use by agriculture in the twin falls tract lentz et al 2018 the shallow groundwater responds far sooner which ostensibly is the reason why mean tunnel water nitrate n concentrations have risen 1 4 fold from 3 6 to 5 1 mg l 1 between the late 1960s and early 2000s lentz et al 2018 notably this 1 4 fold increase in tunnel water nitrate concentration appears modest compared to the concomitant 2 2 fold increase in fertilizer applications in the tract lentz et al 2018 3 3 tunnel water δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 on the whole tunnel water nitrate δ 15n no3 values ranged from 4 6 to 7 8 and δ 18o no3 ranged from 4 5 to 7 6 generally tunnel water δ 18o no3 values present a bimodal pattern with δ 15n no3 cycling from low values during the mid to late summer to higher values in winter data from the most frequently sampled tunnel csi hatchery illustrates the pattern fig 4 a similar bimodal pattern was observed in deep 1 2 m percolation water in portneuf soils lentz and lehrsch 2018 and other soils ostrom et al 1998 loo et al 2017 except the peak occurs in late summer or fall the percolating water recharges shallow groundwater and is the source of seasonal δ 15n no3 fluctuations 3 4 the relation between drain location and tunnel water stable isotopes and nitrate when tunnel water δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values from jan july and sep or two of the three are plotted for 2005 2006 and 2007 the tunnel groups sort into a linear pattern in any given year that is the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 of waters from individual tunnels tend to increase along a line with walters and hankins having the smallest values csi moderate and herman and grossman being largest fig 5 this is particularly striking in 2007 data fig 5c could the pattern be related to tunnel location pearson s analysis showed that tunnel water δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values are positively correlated with tunnel drain location given as its distance to the snake r in the direction of groundwater flow table 1 and 3 thus the fractions of heavy isotopes in the tunnel water decline as distance to the river and elevation decrease because decreasing tunnel water and nitrate heavy isotope fractions are associated with a shift toward regional groundwater fig 2 section 3 6 it would appear that the contribution of regional groundwater to tunnel water increases towards the snake r plummer et al 2000 and results in the linear pattern seen in fig 5 the positive correlation between tunnel water no3 n concentration and the tunnel snake r distance is consistent with this scenario table 3 the increased contribution of nitrate poor regional groundwater to the shallow groundwater relative to contributions of nitrate rich soil percolation water would dilute no3 n concentrations 3 5 tunnel water δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 distribution the plot of stable isotope values from all tunnel water samples showed a relatively scattered distribution but revealed a significant positive relationship between δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 p 0 0001 fig 6 a a nearly 2 1 ratio of δ 15n no3 to δ 18o no3 like that observed for the tunnel water fig 6a is often taken as an indicator of denitrification bottcher et al 1990 kaushal et al 2011 however bottcher et al s 1990 data set included groundwater samples with δ 15n no3 values ranging from 9 to 78 compared to a range of 4 5 to 7 5 in the current study when portneuf soils were incubated under saturated conditions residual nitrate δ 15n no3 values ranged from 12 to 38 unpublished data bottcher et al s 1990 data also revealed an inverse relationship between nitrate concentration and δ 15n no3 which was not seen in tract tunnel waters fig 6b this argues against denitrification as an dominating influence in the system mariotti et al 1988 kendall 1998 alternatively the linear relationship fig 6 all tunnels may be the result of mixing with regional groundwater fig 7 and section 3 6 this view is consistent with 1 a field study in portneuf soils that analyzed nitrate and δ 15n no3 in percolation water at 1 2 m depth concluding that denitrification was not a dominant process in the soils lentz and lehrsch 2018 2 reports that area groundwaters are fully oxygenated plummer et al 2000 and 3 isotope studies in free draining soils that commonly find little evidence of denitrification ostrom et al 1998 smith and kellman 2011 kelley et al 2013 note also in fig 6a that hankins and walters 15n no3 values were in the lower range of all tunnels and δ 18o no3 values showed the least variation relative to all other tunnels 3 6 comparing incubation end members and tunnel waters δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 the urea soil and manure soil endmember isotope compositions were enriched in δ 18o no3 2 2 relative to the control soil fig 7 table 4 this resulted from microbial nitrification of source derived nh4 n to no3 n kendall 1998 nestler et al 2011 the δ 18o no3 ratio for both endmembers was 4 7 from the equation δ 18o no3 nr δ 18o h2o 1 nr δ 18o o2 where δ 18o h2o 16 5 estimated from fig 2 and δ 18o o2 23 the value for atmospheric o2 presumed unfractionated when dissolved in soil h2o clark and fritz 1997 the nitrification ratio nr is calculated as 0 70 hence the fraction of o contributed from irrigation h2o o during nitrification was 0 70 and the fraction contributed from soil gaseous o2 o was 0 30 this contribution of o from water is slightly higher than that commonly cited 0 67 hollocher 1984 shalev et al 2015 but lower than that observed by snider et al 2010 who reported fractional h2o o contributions during nitrification of 0 79 to 0 96 the δ 15n no3 ratio of the urea soil endmember 4 6 fig 7 is enriched relative to the δ 15n of urea n which averages 0 2 kendall 1998 craine et al 2015 this enrichment occurs in a matter of days in these soils lentz and lehrsch 2018 reported that nitrate leached from portneuf soil 48 h after urea application had a δ 15n no3 of 4 6 and δ 18o no3 of 7 1 presumably the rapid enrichment results primarily from volatilization of urea derived nh4 n to nh3 n and subsequent nitrification of the remaining nh4 n nestler et al 2011 relative to the control and urea soil endmember the manure soil was enriched in δ 15n no3 8 8 table 4 owing to 1 discrimination and fractionation of n occurring during animal metabolic processes and 2 volatilization of ammonia from excreted feces followed by nitrification in the soil dittert et al 1998 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 ratios of hankins walters and all other tunnel waters were enriched compared to the control soil and deep groundwater endmembers table 4 fig 7 the hankins walters tunnel waters were intermediate between all other tunnels and the deep groundwater fig 7 which suggests that shallow groundwater at locations nearer the snake r were more heavily influenced by recharge from deep groundwater the greater contribution of regional groundwater to hankins walters tunnel waters relative to all others 1 is consistent with the reduced temporal variability in δ 18o no3 we observed for this group fig 6a and 2 may result from a relative paucity of soil water percolation at these sites these data indicate that tunnel water δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values result primarily from the mixing of two end member source waters fixed n urea models no3 n nitrified from fertilizer and legume residue and manure amended soil with regional groundwater the dual isotopic element three source simple linear mixing model phillips 2001 estimated the proportion of nitrate contributed from the three sources on average nitrate from hankins walters tunnel waters was derived from 71 regional groundwater 17 fixed n and 11 animal waste sources nitrate from all other tunnel waters was derived from 47 regional groundwater 32 fixed n and 21 animal waste sources for both tunnel groupings 1 5 times more nitrate is derived from fixed n than animal waste sources thus both fixed n and animal waste sources contribute to the shallow groundwater nitrate concentration in the tract though the larger share is from fixed n sources 3 7 source of increased nitrate in shallow groundwater of the ten tunnels sampled the three with the least outflow nitrate n concentrations csi grossman and nye averaged 4 05 mg l 1 while the three with the greatest nitrate concentrations cox herman and peavy averaged 6 07 mg l 1 table 1 for these groups the shift to greater outflow nitrate concentrations was accompanied by a decrease in δ15n no3 from 6 6 to 6 1 with little change in δ18o no3 table 5 the shift in the δ15n no3 towards that of the urea endmember value 4 6 table 4 as nitrate concentration increases is evidence that the source of leached nitrate in shallow groundwater is fertilizer or fixed n from legume crops the shift to greater tunnel nitrate concentrations was also associated with the enrichment of tunnel water δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o ratios table 5 and fig 2 this suggests that higher nitrate loads result in part from a decrease in the regional aquifer contribution to the shallow groundwater relative to that of infiltrating local irrigation water clark and fritz 1997 plummer et al 2000 palmer et al 2007 4 conclusions 1 results support the hypothesis that transit time to shallow groundwater tunnel outflows is relatively short in the twin falls irrigation tract based on a time series analysis of δ18o ratios in tunnel drain and irrigation water and correlation analysis climatic hydrologic parameters vs tunnel water δ18o h2o values we estimated transit times to be 20 23 months 2 stable isotope ratios of the nitrate in tunnel outflow relative to that of urea fertilizer and manure amended soil nitrate sources suggest that nitrate in shallow groundwater is a function of nitrate leaching loads from local agricultural soils and dilution resulting from regional groundwater contributions note that urea and ammonium fertilizers comprised 90 of the total n fertilizer applied in the tract at the time of sampling 3 the source of increased nitrate loads in tunnel outflows is a combination of animal waste and n derived from atmospheric n2 including urea and ammonium fertilizer and n fixed by legumes a mixing model indicated that on average 1 5x more n is sourced from fertilizer and fixed n than animal waste the 0 6 enrichment in δ15n no3 and 1 0 enrichment in δ2h h2o in water from tunnels having the least nitrate concentrations relative to those with the greatest concentrations further suggests that increased nitrate contamination results from increased contribution from fertilizer fixed n sources and reduced contribution of regional groundwater less dilution 4 the limited breadth of variation and lack of strong enrichment observed in tunnel water δ15n no3 values combined with the absence of an inverse relationship between tunnel water nitrate concentration and δ15n no3 suggest that denitrification has relatively minor influence on nitrate in the vadose zone and shallow groundwater of the tract the dominant n cycling processes in these soils is the mineralization of soil organic matter and the nitrification of nh4 n derived from applied fertilizer and manure 5 presumably the nitrate concentration in the deep groundwater of the tract will increase with time as it slowly comes into equilibrium with effects of post 1960s expanded fertilizer use since the deep water is an important contributor to shallow groundwater in the tract these increasing nitrate loads could 1 increase shallow groundwater nitrate contamination and or 2 limit the effectiveness of any improved n management practices that are applied in the near future acknowledgments we thank dr

11252,intensive irrigated agriculture in semiarid southern idaho contributes to nitrate loads in shallow groundwater to determine the temporal character and source of leached nitrate in the twin falls irrigation tract and investigate the soil n cycling process involved we measured stable isotope ratios of nitrate δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 and water δ 2h h2o δ 18o h2o in 1 tunnel drain and irrigation waters during 2003 07 and 2 leachate from incubated urea and manure amended soil endmembers the tunnel water δ 2h h2o vs δ 18o h2o plots showed clear overlap with waters of milner reservoir which stores the tract s irrigation water prior to distribution the δ 18o h2o time series and a correlation analysis with climate hydrologic parameters indicated a 20 to 23 month transit time between the surface and shallow groundwater the tunnel waters had a mean δ 15n no3 of 6 1 0 7 std dev and mean δ 18o no3 of 6 1 0 7 decreasing tunnel water δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 and nitrate concentrations in tunnel drains located closer to the snake r indicate increasing contributions of regional groundwater to shallow groundwater and dilution of the latter s no3 n content as proximity to the river increases relative to all other tunnels water from the two tunnels closest to snake river were depleted in δ 15n no3 5 4 vs 6 3 and included a greater contribution of regional groundwater 71 vs 47 nitrate δ 15n

isotopic element three source simple linear mixing model indicated that on average 1 5x more n is sourced from fertilizer and fixed n than animal waste the dominant n cycling process in the system at

meteoric water line tfcc twin falls canal co keywords drainage linear mixing model nitrogen cycle nitrate leaching 1 introduction only 40 of nitrogen applied to the world s crops is incorporated into the harvested products worldwide on average and the resulting excess soil reactive n can cause adverse environmental and human health impacts zhang et al 2015 agricultural nitrogen use efficiency nue must improve if future global food needs are to be met in a sustainable manner zhang et al 2015 this is also true in the western us where near optimal light and temperature conditions combined with generous n and p fertilizer applications often produce peak yields for irrigated crops since the 1970 s increasing crop yields and the robust growth of a regional dairy industry have resulted in increased fertilizer and dairy manure applications to farm lands in south central idaho and to the twin falls canal co tfcc irrigation tract in particular lentz et al 2018 nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater exiting subsurface tunnel drains in the tfcc tract were sampled on a monthly or bimonthly basis in the late 1960s carter et al 1971 1999 and 2002 2007 lentz et al 2018 mean nitrate n concentrations in shallow groundwater of the tract have increased with time from 3 1 to 5 1 mg l 1 lentz et al 2018 these concentrations are small relative to the 119 mg l 1 median no3 n concentration reported for soil drainage water below local irrigated crops and the reason for this is not clear the source of nitrate contamination in shallow groundwater can be inferred from nitrate concentrations coupled with nitrate 15n and 18o stable isotope contents if nitrate source inputs and end members are known and transformations of n along flow paths are minimal böhlke et al 2003 nestler et al 2011 xing and liu 2016 transport rates from which transit times can be inferred of water from the soil surface to shallow groundwater can be deduced from time series measurements of stable isotopes in recharge water and groundwater sources clark and fritz 1997 hunt et al 2005 irrigated cropland is the major source of percolating soil waters in the tract and agricultural fertilizers and animal wastes are the key contributors to nitrate loading bahr and carlson 2000 holloway et al 2004 lentz et al 2018 during the current study ammonium or urea fertilizers comprised 90 of fertilizer applied idaho state dept agriculture 2005 and nitrate concentration in irrigation water is generally 1 of that in soil percolation water lentz et al 2018 another potential source of leached nitrate is derived from ammonification and nitrification of n fixed in legume root and crown biomass particularly alfalfa medicago sativa l because nh4 n from alfalfa biomass and urea fertilizer have similar δ 15n unkovich 2013 and both are converted to no3 by soil nitrification nitrate from the two sources is indistinguishable thus n fixed from atmospheric n2 inorganic fertilizers and legume biomass and n from manure provide the dominate n inputs into tract soils several groundwater studies collected a single water sample annually from many of the area s deep wells and evaluated nitrate δ 15n values in samples containing 5 mg l 1 nitrate individual well waters had nitrate δ 15n values typical of animal waste sources 10 fixed n 4 to 4 or mineralized soil organic n 4 to 9 bahr and carlson 2000 holloway et al 2004 unkovich 2013 groundwater nitrate 15n and 18o isotopes in 31 of the area s deep wells were evaluated from a single water sample collected in 2001 the author s concluded that denitrification was not a dominant process during nitrate transport tesch and carlson 2004 plummer et al 2000 reported that groundwater sampled in the area is nearly saturated with oxygen which inhibits microbial denitrifier activity a more frequent sampling of the tract s irrigation and shallow groundwaters combined with stable isotope analysis is needed to improve our understanding of water and nitrate status there for example denitrification may vary with year or season and a single annual sample may not detect its occurrence the current research 1 evaluates the 15n and 18o isotopic signature of nitrate and the deuterium 2h and the 18o isotopes in irrigation water and subsurface tunnel drain outflow sampled in 2002 2007 and 2 determines the 15n and 18o isotopic signatures of fertilizer and manure nitrate sources which are potential inputs and end members in the continuum we hypothesized that 1 the transit time for water in shallow groundwater outflow from tunnel drains is relatively short 3 y 2 stable isotope ratios of water and nitrate could be used to test our supposition that fixed n is the primary source of leached nitrate and 3 nitrification not denitrification is the dominant process in the nitrogen cycle in these agricultural soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the twin falls canal co irrigation tract is located in the upper snake river basin of southern idaho at an elevation of 884 to 1250 m fig 1 soils are dominated by portneuf silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic durinodic xeric haplocalcids and sluka silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic xerollic haplodurids which is similar to the deeper portneuf except sluka is moderately deep to a duripan shortly after the tract was developed localized high water tables formed as a result of irrigation carter et al 1971 consequently more than fifty drainage networks were constructed to alleviate saturated conditions for each a series of 9 to 21 m deep relief wells were drilled vertically through the bedrock and intercepted at 1 1 to 12 m depth either by horizontal tunnels 1 2 2 m blasted in the basalt bedrock or by tile drain piping carter et al 1971 cothern 2013 shallow groundwater is conveyed by gravity flow through individual networks and exits from outlets located in canyons or man made surface drainage channels hence the groundwater draining from the networks hereafter referred to as tunnel water is a mixture of excess irrigation water draining from the soil above and groundwater which wells up in bore holes from bedrock below the tract was described in detail by carter et al 1971 the study area includes the outlet drains monitored in 1968 70 by carter et al 1971 fig 1 agricultural crops and management practices of the study area were described by lentz et al 2018 2 2 sampling and analysis we revisited and sampled 10 of the original 15 tunnel network drains evaluated by carter et al 1971 across the tfcc tract fig 1 the 10 drains table 1 were stratified by area to ensure complete coverage of the study lands water samples were also collected at the milner dam pool 42 31 38 n 114 02 14 w which supplies water to the irrigation canals that convey the water downslope across the tract water samples for nutrient and isotope analysis were collected in 2003 through 2007 once per month during the april to november irrigation season and on alternate months in the off season nutrient concentrations in these samples were analyzed and reported in a companion paper lentz et al 2018 we sampled water 125 ml from flows issuing directly from the tunnel drain outlet and stored it on ice until transported to the lab particulates present in water samples collected from tunnel drains the milner pool and percolate from the laboratory experiment see incubation study were removed by passing the liquid through a nitrate free 0 45 μm filter of the sediment free water sample 20 ml was frozen in a scintillation vial for nitrate 15n and 18o isotope analysis and a 30 ml portion was stored at 4 c for deuterium 2h and 18o isotope analysis isotope samples were archived and selected sets were shipped for analysis beginning in 2005 water samples were shipped frozen on dry ice to the marine chemistry and geochemistry laboratory at woods hole oceanographic institution woods hole ma for nitrate isotope analysis the laboratory employed the microbial denitrifier method mcilvin and casciotti 2011 and gas isotope ratio mass spectrometry finnigan deltaplus xp waltham ma to measure δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 eqs 1 and 2 the standard isotopic ratio for n was atmospheric n2 air while that for o was the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow because the computed ratio is small the value is multiplied

measurement precision was 0 1 to 0 2 l for both δ 15n and δ 18o mcilvin and casciotti 2011 a subset of tunnel water and irrigation water samples were sent to the university of arizona environmental isotope laboratory tucson az where they were analyzed for δ2h h2o eq 3 and δ18o h2o eq 4 waters were analyzed for d h ratio using a dual inlet mass spectrometer delta s thermo finnegan bremen germany equipped with an automated chromium reduction device h device thermo finnegan for the generation of hydrogen gas using metallic chromium at 750 c water δ 18o was measured on the same mass spectrometer

stable isotope analysis 112 for no3 and 99 for h2o for nitrate isotopes δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 we selected 1 sample dates in 2003 2005 for the tunnel waters having the greatest no3 n concentrations herman and two that had the least nye college of southern idaho csi hatchery 2 february july and september sample dates in 2005 through 2007 for all tunnel water samples table 1 and 3 irrigation water collected at the research farm near kimberly id 42 31 04 n 114 22 20 w during the 2003 2004 growing seasons for water isotopes δ 2h h2o δ 18o h2o we selected 1 the sample dates in 2003 2004 for the csi hatchery herman and walters tunnels and 2 all sampling dates in 2006 2007 for cox grossman herman and nye table 1 including the milner dam pool these tunnels represented sites having a range of irrigation types table 1 and no3 n concentrations 2 3 relating tunnel water δ 18o h2o to climatic and hydrologic parameters the δ 18o h2o of precipitation is strongly influenced by temperature during rainout clark and fritz 1997 thus one can reasonably expect that the δ 18o h2o of the tract irrigation water whose main source is precipitation falling on upstream mountains is correlated with climatic parameters similarly a correlation would be expected with certain hydrologic parameters such as spring flowrate in the snake r which is largely controlled by snowmelt rates in upstream mountains it follows that temporal origin of snake r irrigation recharge water supplying tunnel drains may be traced by comparing tunnel water δ 18o h2o with current and past annual climatic or hydrologic parameters correlations between tunnel water δ 18o h2o and annual climatic hydrologic parameters from current and one two and three years previous listed in table 2 aided in estimating tunnel water transit time 2 4 incubation study the objective of the experiment was to characterize the stable isotope status of nitrate in water leaching from agricultural soil amended with different n sources these leached waters approximate a mixing end member series that contribute to the isotopic condition of the area s shallow groundwater kendall 1998 two n sources were urea fertilizer representing fixed n and dairy manure the laboratory incubation study determined the nitrate 15n and 18o fractionation characteristics of water draining from un amended and urea fertilizer or manure amended soils the experiment employed a completely randomized design with three treatments and six replicates 18 experimental units a 0 30 cm depth sample of portneuf silt loam was collected ambient nitrate was removed by extraction with reverse osmosis ro water air dried and sieved through a 2 mm screen one of the following three amendment treatments was mixed with 125 g of soil 1 0 04 g total n as freeze dried manure 6 74 g dairy manure dry wt 2 0 04 g n as urea fertilizer 0 1 g or 3 no amendment the treated soil was packed into 13 cm long by 4 cm diameter pvc cylinders with nylon cloth 50 μm mesh bottoms in three lifts to achieve a dry bulk density of about 1 15 mg m 3 extra soil columns prepared for each treatment were used to determine soil pore volumes and track soil no3 n concentrations during incubation soil in each cylinder was wetted to 55 water filled pore space wfps using ro water and incubated at 22 c soil water contents were adjusted to 55 wfps weekly all soil columns were leached after six months incubation ensuring that the accumulated no3 n included an ample proportion of input n that had cycled through the soil system for leaching ro water was applied to the column s nylon cloth shielded soil surface at a rate of 6 0 ml h 1 4 8 mm h 1 until one pore volume of soil percolate was collected from each soil column samples of the accumulated water were prepared for δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 analysis as described above 2 5 three source linear mixing model a simple linear mixing model with three sources phillips 2001 was employed to estimate fractional nitrate contributions from conventional fertilizer ffixed manure fman and regional groundwater fgw to tunnel water tun nitrate the linear equations eqs 5 7 defining the system are δjfixed ffixed δjman fman δjgw fgw δjtun 5 δkfixed ffixed δkman fman δkgw fgw δktun 6 ffixed fman fgw 1 7 where jx δ 15n no3 and kx δ18o no3 for each source component and tunnel waters fixed man gw and tun the solution was calculated as x a 1b where x is the 1 3 solution matrix ffert fman fgw a 1 is the inverse of the 3 3 source coefficient matrix and b is the 1 3 tunnel results matrix the model assumes that nitrate n in waters is conservative e g denitrification is a minor influence in the system only three sources are contributing nitrate to tunnel water and source end members isotope compositions are constant 2 6 statistical analysis descriptive statistics mean standard deviation for tunnel sample nitrate and water isotopes were obtained using proc mean sas 2012 and tests for normality using proc univariate sas 2012 the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values for tunnel water and irrigation water were plotted relative to the local meteoric water line for southeastern idaho and regression lines were fitted to irrigation water data using proc reg sas 2012 we employed pearson s correlations calculated by proc corr sas 2012 to evaluate the relationships between normalized tunnel water δ 18o h2o values vs selected climate and hydrologic parameters for current and one two and three years previous tunnel water δ 18o h2o values were normalized by dividing each by its tunnel mean the analysis included available isotope data from all tunnel drains for years 2003 to 2007 in another analysis correlations were determined between tunnel drain location distance to the snake r and each of the following tunnel water traits nitrate concentration δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 δ 18o h2o and δ 2h h2o to determine if δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 compositions differed among the tunnel water and incubation treatment leachate endmember series we conducted an analysis of variance anova using proc mixed sas 2012 with water source group as the fixed effect and year and year group as random effects then 95 confidence limits were constructed on treatment means a similar approach was used to determine if the δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 δ 2h h2o or δ 18o h2o ratios differed between the group of three tunnel waters that had the greatest nitrate concentration relative to the group of three having the least table 1 the alignment and variance associated with δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values from tunnel waters and the end member series were plotted for comparison using the following two step process the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values were plotted separately for control urea and manure soil endmembers hankins and walters tunnel waters combined and all other tunnel waters combined a line intersecting each group s spatial mean was drawn parallel to the group s long axis of symmetry i e in the direction of greatest spatial spread among data points a second shorter line representing short axis of symmetry was drawn also intersecting the spatial mean but perpendicular to the first we then quantified the amount of spread among the group s data points in the long and short symmetry axis directions this was accomplished by rotating and aligning the x y coordinate axes with the group s long and short symmetry axes transforming the group s point coordinate values relative to the new coordinate axes then computing standard deviations for the transformed x and y coordinate values see fig 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and tunnel water 2h and 18o milner irrigation and tunnel water δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values overlap indicating that irrigation water is an important source of recharge for shallow ground water fig 2 milner waters plot close to the local meteoric water line lmwl cecil et al 2005 milner and tunnel water δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values are smaller in comparison to late spring summer and fall meteoric waters which lie outside plot area in fig 2 and typically have δ 18o h2o values greater than 15 5 benjamin et al 2004 precipitation becomes depleted in 2h and 18o as cloud temperature decreases in response to seasonal or elevation related effects hence meteoric water and dominantly winter precipitation snow is the ultimate source of milner and tunnel water the slopes of regression lines fitted to data from milner dam pool for 2006 4 8 and 2007 5 4 data are typical for surface water under evaporative regimes which commonly range from 4 to 6 barnes and allison 1988 clark and fritz 1997 milner irrigation water becomes isotopically enriched during nonequilibrium evaporation from reservoirs canals and soils which results in a positive shift in plotted points and a decrease in plot slopes clark and fritz 1997 benjamin et al 2004 because 2007 was substantially warmer and dryer than 2006 with greater evaporation the milner 2007 regression line is displaced further from the lmwl clark and fritz 1997 furthermore the correspondence of irrigation and tunnel water plots in the upper right range for milner water indicates that these shallow groundwaters are primarily recharged by irrigation water applied during the growing season figs 2 and 3 regional groundwater is another potential recharge source for the shallow groundwater the former originates in mountains to the south of the tract and is less affected by evaporation plummer et al 2000 therefore the regional groundwater can be more depleted in δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o than milner water fig 2 3 2 transit time the δ 18o h2o time series from milner pond and select tunnel drains 2006 2007 displayed in fig 3 and correlations of tunnel water δ 18o h2o with current and previous year s climate hydrologic parameters in table 2 were used to estimate the time required for water applied at the soil surface to transit to the shallow aquifer ingraham et al 1991 cool season precipitation and snowmelt runoff contribute water depleted in heavy isotopes to the milner reservoir which produces a decline in δ 18o h2o values attaining a minimum in early to late spring fig 3c during the growing season reservoir inflows are more heavily influenced by seepage spring irrigation return and reservoir storage waters which are enriched in heavy isotope concentrations due to evaporation this causes a rise in δ 18o h2o values peaking in early to late fall fig 3c smaller scale variations in the pattern likely result from annual variations in climate and hydrology fig 3c for example 2006 was unusually wet and cool with a heavy snowpack that produced increased summer reservoir levels whereas antithetical weather in 2007 produced decreased summer reservoir levels fig 3a b the diminished contribution of precipitation and runoff to the reservoir in 2007 increased the proportion of shallow groundwater seepage contributions and contracted the range of δ 18o h2o values observed relative to 2006 fig 3c the lag time between the seasonal δ 18o h2o peaks in milner irrigation water and subsequent peaks in tunnel drain water varied between 8 and 11 months fig 3c the period measured for some tunnels may differ from the actual value by up to 2 months because water was sometimes sampled on alternate months particularly outside the growing season in some cases the lag varied 1 between tunnel drains presumably due differences in local hydrogeology and 2 between years for the same tunnel drain possibly due to differences in crops grown between years and hence the amount and timing of irrigation water applied the differences in lag were not considered conclusive due to the timing of sample collection because milner δ 18o h2o peaks occur annually tunnel water δ 18o h2o peaks in the current year may represent the arrival of the most recent milner peak water or the arrival of milner peak water from one two or three years previous given that tunnel water δ 18o h2o values are correlated most strongly and significantly with climate hydrologic parameters from one year previous table 2 we conclude that the milner and tunnel water signals are one year out of phase this suggests that the transit time between the surface and shallow groundwater is between 20 and 23 months others have estimated transit times for shallow groundwaters 10 m depth to water to be 1 2 y in glacial till 5 y in layered sediments 3 y in loamy sands or 4 y in alluvial fill sediments reddy et al 2006 moore et al 2006 turkeltaub et al 2016 the 20 to 23 month transit time is very short relative to that estimated for deep groundwater in the area tens or hundreds of years mann and low 1994 this implies that the chemistry of the deep groundwater source has not yet fully absorbed the impact of the post 1960s expansion in inorganic and organic fertilizer use by agriculture in the twin falls tract lentz et al 2018 the shallow groundwater responds far sooner which ostensibly is the reason why mean tunnel water nitrate n concentrations have risen 1 4 fold from 3 6 to 5 1 mg l 1 between the late 1960s and early 2000s lentz et al 2018 notably this 1 4 fold increase in tunnel water nitrate concentration appears modest compared to the concomitant 2 2 fold increase in fertilizer applications in the tract lentz et al 2018 3 3 tunnel water δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 on the whole tunnel water nitrate δ 15n no3 values ranged from 4 6 to 7 8 and δ 18o no3 ranged from 4 5 to 7 6 generally tunnel water δ 18o no3 values present a bimodal pattern with δ 15n no3 cycling from low values during the mid to late summer to higher values in winter data from the most frequently sampled tunnel csi hatchery illustrates the pattern fig 4 a similar bimodal pattern was observed in deep 1 2 m percolation water in portneuf soils lentz and lehrsch 2018 and other soils ostrom et al 1998 loo et al 2017 except the peak occurs in late summer or fall the percolating water recharges shallow groundwater and is the source of seasonal δ 15n no3 fluctuations 3 4 the relation between drain location and tunnel water stable isotopes and nitrate when tunnel water δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values from jan july and sep or two of the three are plotted for 2005 2006 and 2007 the tunnel groups sort into a linear pattern in any given year that is the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 of waters from individual tunnels tend to increase along a line with walters and hankins having the smallest values csi moderate and herman and grossman being largest fig 5 this is particularly striking in 2007 data fig 5c could the pattern be related to tunnel location pearson s analysis showed that tunnel water δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values are positively correlated with tunnel drain location given as its distance to the snake r in the direction of groundwater flow table 1 and 3 thus the fractions of heavy isotopes in the tunnel water decline as distance to the river and elevation decrease because decreasing tunnel water and nitrate heavy isotope fractions are associated with a shift toward regional groundwater fig 2 section 3 6 it would appear that the contribution of regional groundwater to tunnel water increases towards the snake r plummer et al 2000 and results in the linear pattern seen in fig 5 the positive correlation between tunnel water no3 n concentration and the tunnel snake r distance is consistent with this scenario table 3 the increased contribution of nitrate poor regional groundwater to the shallow groundwater relative to contributions of nitrate rich soil percolation water would dilute no3 n concentrations 3 5 tunnel water δ 15n no3 vs δ 18o no3 distribution the plot of stable isotope values from all tunnel water samples showed a relatively scattered distribution but revealed a significant positive relationship between δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 p 0 0001 fig 6 a a nearly 2 1 ratio of δ 15n no3 to δ 18o no3 like that observed for the tunnel water fig 6a is often taken as an indicator of denitrification bottcher et al 1990 kaushal et al 2011 however bottcher et al s 1990 data set included groundwater samples with δ 15n no3 values ranging from 9 to 78 compared to a range of 4 5 to 7 5 in the current study when portneuf soils were incubated under saturated conditions residual nitrate δ 15n no3 values ranged from 12 to 38 unpublished data bottcher et al s 1990 data also revealed an inverse relationship between nitrate concentration and δ 15n no3 which was not seen in tract tunnel waters fig 6b this argues against denitrification as an dominating influence in the system mariotti et al 1988 kendall 1998 alternatively the linear relationship fig 6 all tunnels may be the result of mixing with regional groundwater fig 7 and section 3 6 this view is consistent with 1 a field study in portneuf soils that analyzed nitrate and δ 15n no3 in percolation water at 1 2 m depth concluding that denitrification was not a dominant process in the soils lentz and lehrsch 2018 2 reports that area groundwaters are fully oxygenated plummer et al 2000 and 3 isotope studies in free draining soils that commonly find little evidence of denitrification ostrom et al 1998 smith and kellman 2011 kelley et al 2013 note also in fig 6a that hankins and walters 15n no3 values were in the lower range of all tunnels and δ 18o no3 values showed the least variation relative to all other tunnels 3 6 comparing incubation end members and tunnel waters δ 15n no3 δ 18o no3 the urea soil and manure soil endmember isotope compositions were enriched in δ 18o no3 2 2 relative to the control soil fig 7 table 4 this resulted from microbial nitrification of source derived nh4 n to no3 n kendall 1998 nestler et al 2011 the δ 18o no3 ratio for both endmembers was 4 7 from the equation δ 18o no3 nr δ 18o h2o 1 nr δ 18o o2 where δ 18o h2o 16 5 estimated from fig 2 and δ 18o o2 23 the value for atmospheric o2 presumed unfractionated when dissolved in soil h2o clark and fritz 1997 the nitrification ratio nr is calculated as 0 70 hence the fraction of o contributed from irrigation h2o o during nitrification was 0 70 and the fraction contributed from soil gaseous o2 o was 0 30 this contribution of o from water is slightly higher than that commonly cited 0 67 hollocher 1984 shalev et al 2015 but lower than that observed by snider et al 2010 who reported fractional h2o o contributions during nitrification of 0 79 to 0 96 the δ 15n no3 ratio of the urea soil endmember 4 6 fig 7 is enriched relative to the δ 15n of urea n which averages 0 2 kendall 1998 craine et al 2015 this enrichment occurs in a matter of days in these soils lentz and lehrsch 2018 reported that nitrate leached from portneuf soil 48 h after urea application had a δ 15n no3 of 4 6 and δ 18o no3 of 7 1 presumably the rapid enrichment results primarily from volatilization of urea derived nh4 n to nh3 n and subsequent nitrification of the remaining nh4 n nestler et al 2011 relative to the control and urea soil endmember the manure soil was enriched in δ 15n no3 8 8 table 4 owing to 1 discrimination and fractionation of n occurring during animal metabolic processes and 2 volatilization of ammonia from excreted feces followed by nitrification in the soil dittert et al 1998 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 ratios of hankins walters and all other tunnel waters were enriched compared to the control soil and deep groundwater endmembers table 4 fig 7 the hankins walters tunnel waters were intermediate between all other tunnels and the deep groundwater fig 7 which suggests that shallow groundwater at locations nearer the snake r were more heavily influenced by recharge from deep groundwater the greater contribution of regional groundwater to hankins walters tunnel waters relative to all others 1 is consistent with the reduced temporal variability in δ 18o no3 we observed for this group fig 6a and 2 may result from a relative paucity of soil water percolation at these sites these data indicate that tunnel water δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values result primarily from the mixing of two end member source waters fixed n urea models no3 n nitrified from fertilizer and legume residue and manure amended soil with regional groundwater the dual isotopic element three source simple linear mixing model phillips 2001 estimated the proportion of nitrate contributed from the three sources on average nitrate from hankins walters tunnel waters was derived from 71 regional groundwater 17 fixed n and 11 animal waste sources nitrate from all other tunnel waters was derived from 47 regional groundwater 32 fixed n and 21 animal waste sources for both tunnel groupings 1 5 times more nitrate is derived from fixed n than animal waste sources thus both fixed n and animal waste sources contribute to the shallow groundwater nitrate concentration in the tract though the larger share is from fixed n sources 3 7 source of increased nitrate in shallow groundwater of the ten tunnels sampled the three with the least outflow nitrate n concentrations csi grossman and nye averaged 4 05 mg l 1 while the three with the greatest nitrate concentrations cox herman and peavy averaged 6 07 mg l 1 table 1 for these groups the shift to greater outflow nitrate concentrations was accompanied by a decrease in δ15n no3 from 6 6 to 6 1 with little change in δ18o no3 table 5 the shift in the δ15n no3 towards that of the urea endmember value 4 6 table 4 as nitrate concentration increases is evidence that the source of leached nitrate in shallow groundwater is fertilizer or fixed n from legume crops the shift to greater tunnel nitrate concentrations was also associated with the enrichment of tunnel water δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o ratios table 5 and fig 2 this suggests that higher nitrate loads result in part from a decrease in the regional aquifer contribution to the shallow groundwater relative to that of infiltrating local irrigation water clark and fritz 1997 plummer et al 2000 palmer et al 2007 4 conclusions 1 results support the hypothesis that transit time to shallow groundwater tunnel outflows is relatively short in the twin falls irrigation tract based on a time series analysis of δ18o ratios in tunnel drain and irrigation water and correlation analysis climatic hydrologic parameters vs tunnel water δ18o h2o values we estimated transit times to be 20 23 months 2 stable isotope ratios of the nitrate in tunnel outflow relative to that of urea fertilizer and manure amended soil nitrate sources suggest that nitrate in shallow groundwater is a function of nitrate leaching loads from local agricultural soils and dilution resulting from regional groundwater contributions note that urea and ammonium fertilizers comprised 90 of the total n fertilizer applied in the tract at the time of sampling 3 the source of increased nitrate loads in tunnel outflows is a combination of animal waste and n derived from atmospheric n2 including urea and ammonium fertilizer and n fixed by legumes a mixing model indicated that on average 1 5x more n is sourced from fertilizer and fixed n than animal waste the 0 6 enrichment in δ15n no3 and 1 0 enrichment in δ2h h2o in water from tunnels having the least nitrate concentrations relative to those with the greatest concentrations further suggests that increased nitrate contamination results from increased contribution from fertilizer fixed n sources and reduced contribution of regional groundwater less dilution 4 the limited breadth of variation and lack of strong enrichment observed in tunnel water δ15n no3 values combined with the absence of an inverse relationship between tunnel water nitrate concentration and δ15n no3 suggest that denitrification has relatively minor influence on nitrate in the vadose zone and shallow groundwater of the tract the dominant n cycling processes in these soils is the mineralization of soil organic matter and the nitrification of nh4 n derived from applied fertilizer and manure 5 presumably the nitrate concentration in the deep groundwater of the tract will increase with time as it slowly comes into equilibrium with effects of post 1960s expanded fertilizer use since the deep water is an important contributor to shallow groundwater in the tract these increasing nitrate loads could 1 increase shallow groundwater nitrate contamination and or 2 limit the effectiveness of any improved n management practices that are applied in the near future acknowledgments we thank dr

large quantities of suspended solid particles salt ions algae microorganisms and organic pollutants stefanie et al 2004 yan et al 2009 wang et al 2014a which can easily cause emitter clogging bucks et al 1979 nakayama and bucks 1991 ravina et al 1997 the emitter clogging problem has become a bottleneck for the application and promotion of inferior water drip irrigation technology song et al 2017 feng et al 2018 understanding emitter clogging behaviors is the precondition and basis of solving the emitter clogging issue and related scholars mainly use two testing methods to study the anti clogging properties of emitters the method most commonly used is the simulated indoor testing method the related studies have yielded large quantities of experimental data which has been of great significance in determining emitter clogging characteristics hills et al 1989 puig bargués et al 2010 niu and liu 2011 puig bargués and lamm 2013 wang et al 2014a pei et al 2014 however the water used for the indoor simulated experiments is stored in the tank and affect the water quality and the indoor environment is obviously different from the real conditions these factors lead to experiment errors which draws great attention from related researchers therefore several researchers began conducting the in situ recycling experiments to study emitter clogging behaviors zhang 2016 zhou et al 2017a which are limited by the long experiment period heavy workload and large space needed therefore an accelerated experimental method is needed that can not only represent real environmental and water quality conditions but also provide a high efficiency and accurate reflection of emitter clogging characteristics however the alternate wet dry environment inside the drip irrigation laterals under accelerated operation conditions is different from the normal mode and the results turned out that the drip irrigation emitter clogging behaviors under different operation frequencies varied to a certain degree zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 han et al 2018 whether the experimental results obtained by the in situ accelerated operation overestimate or underestimate emitter clogging degree in drip irrigation systems and how to evaluate their effects on the experimental results are in great needs for further studies two inferior drip irrigation water sources yellow river water yrw and brackish water brw in the hetao irrigation area of inner mongolia were applied in the in situ drip irrigation experiment to study the effects of two different operation modes accelerated operation isa and normal operation ni on the clogging characteristics of the single emitter the whole system and the clogging substance components the study aims to propose a high efficiency and accurate in situ accelerated experimental method and contributes to improve the related drip irrigation clogging experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental designs and system layout this experiment was conducted in an irrigation experiment station located in northern wulan buh dengkou county bayan nur city inner mongolia china n 40 24 32 e 107 02 19 which belongs to the western part of the hetao irrigation area with the altitude of 1072 m two locally representative inferior drip irrigation water sources were used as experimental water sources yrw with high sediment concentration and brw containing large quantity of salt the water quality characteristics are shown in table 1 gravel and laminated filters were applied at the head part of the experimental system and the system which was built in 4 layers the pressure at each layer was 0 1 mpa the head of the dripline adopts a two stage pressure regulating valve which is used to maintain the stable working pressure of the drip irrigation system and internal laterals were 15 m in length fig 1 six types of flat emitters recorded as fe1 fe6 were used in the experiment and the characteristic parameters of the emitters are shown in table 2 there were 8 replications of each type of drip irrigation emitters and sampling was carried out for 8 times in total the in situ accelerated operation method isa was set as irrigated every

total irrigation quota was the same under three operation modes and the irrigation periods were 3 h 12 h and 21 h respectively the experiment was performed from june 15 2016 to october 21 2016 totaling 360 h in operations the amount of drip irrigation system water used in each flow test cycle was about 1331 m3 and the total amount of system water consumption was about 2 27 104 m3 2 2 testing methods for emitter outflow and clogging evaluation a weighing method was used to test the outflow of the emitters which was described in detail by feng 2017 the discharge q of the single

bucket m wk is the total weight of empty bucket and measured outflow within time t in g in this study t was 5 min to a calibration method proposed pei et al 2014 was applied to eliminate the effects of factors such as water temperature and pressure on the emitter clogging then an ultrasonic wave method was used to peel off the clogging substances the drip irrigation emitter sample was then placed in a ziplock bag after adding 20 ml deionized water the ziplock bag was treated in an ultrasonic cleaning instrument 600 kw for 1 h until the clogging substances peeled off small amounts of clogged substances that were difficult to remove were then peeled off with hairbrush like tools the liquid samples of the clogging substanceswere dried in an incubator at 110 c and weighed with the high precision electronic scale precision 10 4 g the weight of remains was the dry weight of the particles in the clogging substances inside the emitter 2 3 evaluation indexes of the clogging behaviors 2 3 1 randomness of clogging occurrence the randomness δ f q t of the emitter clogging occurrence was calculated to characterize the strength of the flow fluctuation based on the variation in characteristics of emitter outflow demonstrated from the results of single emitter flow measurement the absolute flow difference values of all the emitters on the tested drip line within a certain measurement interval were ranked from the highest to the lowest and the first 10 of the greatest flow measurement results was calculated according to eq 2 the calculated results according to eq 2 were defined as the clogging occurrence randomness of a single emitter δ f q t which was intended to characterize the emitter flow fluctuating ability 2 δ f q t i 1 n 10 q t δ t q t q t 100 n 10 δ f q t is

evaluate the deviation of emitter flow rate which was calculated by eq 3 as follow 3 q var q max q min q max in eq 3 qmax is the maximum emitter flow rate and qmin is the minimum emitter flow rate 2 3

characteristics of the single emitter three emitters no 3 no 23 and no 43 in each of the 6 types of emitters were used as representative emitters to analyze the dynamic changes of the outflow during system operation which are shown in figs 2 and 3 the randomness of the outflow changes and their correlations are shown in figs 4 and 5 figs 2 and 3 showed that the emitter outflow represented fluctuating variation and gradually enhanced trend afterwards as the accumulated system operation time increased the emitter fluctuation strength in the accelerated operation mode was clearly weaker than in the normal operation mode figs 4 and 5 showed that the randomness of the outflow variation showed a stable increasing trend under each operation mode and the randomness of the outflow variations under the isa and ni conditions exhibited an significant correlation r2 0 91 p 0 01 meanwhile the longer operation interval results in greater randomness the randomness under the isa treatment was more moderate with a lower value of fq t than that of the ni treatment therefore the accelerated operation treatment underestimated the randomness of outflow variations under actual conditions as they were 12 31 lower than ni1 4 and 30 80 lower than ni1 7 3 2 effect of the isa on the clogging characteristics of the drip irrigation system the qvar of the drip irrigation system under ias and ni and their linear correlations are shown in figs 6 and 7 the dynamic changes in dra of the drip irrigation system under ias and ni and their linear correlations are shown in figs 8 and 9 those of cu are shown in figs 10 and 11 and those of us are shown in figs 12 and 13 figs 6 13 showed that the continuous effects of the different operation modes on drip irrigation emitter clogging were clearly different until the end of experiment the qvar of the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments reached 0 06 0 18 0 16 0 27 and 0 23 0 32 the results under three conditions exhibited a significant correlation 0 95 r2 0 75 the value of qvar under the isa was lower than those of the ni1 4 and ni1 7 conditions by 18 54 and 31 78 respectively the dra values of the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments reached 84 3 92 3 79 1 80 9 and 72 1 77 8 the cu values were 83 6 89 9 76 1 82 6 and 71 3 76 4 while the us values were 71 5 85 5 57 7 80 1 and 43 7 72 9 respectively as the system operating the dra cu and us under isa were higher than those of the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments the clogging degrees under isa and ni conditions showed an significant correlation 0 85 r2 0 97 p 0 01 the isa mode overestimated the dra cu and us values and the dra under the isa was higher than those of the ni1 4 and ni1 7 conditions by 7 15 13 22 respectively meanwhile those of cu were 5 10 and 10 21 larger and those of us were 5 23 and 14 39 larger respectively table 3 showed the significant differences of the dra cu and us between the ni1 4 and isa treatment significant differences p 0 01 were observed between the ni1 7 and isa treatments 3 3 effect of the isa on the clogging substances on the internal laterals the mean values of clogging substances on the internal laterals csl in the drip irrigation system under accelerated and normal operation as well as their correlation are shown in fig 14 obvious differences were found in the contents of clogging substances on the internal laterals as the system continued operating the clogging substances on the internal laterals under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were higher than those of the isa the clogging substances under the isa and ni treatments exhibited excellent correlation r2 0 98 at the end of the yrw drip irrigation system the clogging substances within the internal laterals under the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were 3 08 4 66 and 6 02 mg cm 2 respectively as for the brw drip irrigation system the clogging substances under the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were 3 96 5 18 and 6 93 mg cm 2 respectively the accelerated operation treatment underestimated the clogging substance growth as their contents in the internal laterals under the isa treatment were 26 44 and 76 88 lower than those under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments respectively 3 4 effect of the isa on the clogging substances inside the emitter the dynamic variations in the total quantities of clogging substances in different emitters cse under isa and ni as well as their correlation are shown in figs 15 and 16 the results showed that the total quantities of clogging substances in the emitter under different operation modes were obviously different and the 6 drip irrigation emitters represented a favorable consistency as the accumulated system operation time increased the clogging substances in the emitter under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were higher than those under the isa treatment meanwhile the clogging substances under the isa and ni treatments showed an excellent correlation r2 0 98 for the yrw system the clogging substances inside the emitter under the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were 13 5 46 3 16 86 51 9 and 19 34 57 31 mg respectively and these values for the brw irrigation system were 13 0 55 3 15 93 60 4 and 17 63 31 mg respectively the accelerated operation treatment underestimated the total clogging substances as their contents were 13 19 and 29 45 lower than those under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments respectively 4 discussions the emitter clogging issue seriously restricts the promotion and application of drip irrigation technology which directly affects the service efficiency and service life of drip irrigation systems therefore more accurate experiments on emitter clogging characteristics are essential although the existing indoor simulated experiments have convenient testing conditions it is difficult to maintain the experiment water source quality constant because of cyclically adjusting the water supply resulting in a large error in the test the in situ field experiments can restore the real working environment of the drip irrigation system and experiment water source is sufficient but long term tests cannot be performed due to harsh conditions such as the environment and weather therefore in this paper we proposes an in situ acceleration test method that establish a drip irrigation clogging test system at the water source site and allow the system to run continuously for a long time every day to accelerate the process experiments on emitter clogging behaviors in drip irrigation systems using the in situ accelerated operation method after bias correction can not only provide real environmental and water quality conditions but also improve experimental efficiency and save large amounts of time however the accelerated irrigation method results in some differences in the wet dry environment inside the internal laterals and these differences can affect the formation accumulation adhesion process of clogging substances ultimately leading to errors in clogging behaviors which could be strengthened under inferior water source drip irrigation li et al 2013 zhou et al 2017b this study was to investigate the effect of isa on the emitter clogging behaviors and to propose a highly efficient and accurate method to eliminate this effect in this study different operation modes showed the same differences in yrw and brw drip irrigation systems and all the data indicated that the experimental resultsunder isa method underestimated the emitter clogging degree under actual operation conditions under isa the emitter clogging degree was lower than the ni in the early stage and the clogging substances in the internal laterals and emitter under isa were both lower than those of ni for yrw drip irrigation a prolonged interval between two operations resulted in a relatively long drying time inside the internal laterals with stagnated water and gradually reduced the water content and accelerated the sediment deposition zhang et al 2001 in addition the yrw contained microorganisms with extracellular polymeric substances secreted wang et al 2014b which caused the continuous adsorption of microorganisms and sediment particles thereby leading to the continuous formation and growth of biological membranes as well as the continuous aggregation of clogging substances as the operation time increased clogging substances aggregated inside the internal laterals which increased the risk of clogging substances entering the emitter and enhancing the clogging degree the clogging behavior in brw drip irrigation was consistent with that in yrw under ni the emitter clogging degrees were higher than the isa mode at the initial stage the brw contained sufficient salt contents and as the interval increased the lengthened drying time inside the internal laterals changed the surface structure of the attached substances and increased the wall roughness and finally the particle deposition and accumulation process was promoted besides water remaining at the water outlet of the emitters deposited a large amount of salt with relatively longer drying time then the salt contents aggregated at the water outlet reduced the emitter outflow which was similar to the results of zhang 2016 therefore the experimental results under isa clearly underestimated the emitter clogging degree compared with those of ni but the results under the isa and ni conditions showed a favorable linear relationship enabling the calibration of the emitter dra cu and clogging substance content with a linear model based on large quantities of experiment data as the 6 types of emitters used in the experiment were all using fractal flow path a significance analysis of the emitter clogging degree under the same operation mode was conducted and no significant differences were observed f 2 84 4 02 and fcrit 4 13 also no significant differences were acquired between two water sources f 0 02 0 18 and fcrit 4 13 therefore these two factors could be neglected the calibration model for the experimental results of the clogging degree is shown in fig 17 although the experimental results under isa were more conservative than ni this effect could be used to reflect the clogging characteristics system performance and accumulation of clogging substances in a single emitter after the simple calibration with a linear model when we get the test results through the accelerated test method we can use this test result to measure the performance of a drip irrigation system at various irrigation frequencies this finding verified that the isa experimental method was reasonable in general an in situ accelerated experimental method was proposed in this paper and the experimental results were calibrated with a linear model to represent the real conditions however there are also related issues requiring further investigations 1 this study considered the clogging characteristics of the emitter with an inferior water drip irrigation system the water quality substantially changes if we apply fertilizers to the water source so the effect of isa on emitter clogging under water fertilizer conditions should be explored 2 this study only tested 3 time interval gradients more irrigation frequency treatments based on real planting conditions are needed thus the experimental results under isa can be verified and then used for the reliable evaluation and prediction of emitter clogging characteristics under different operation conditions 5 conclusion the experimental results of the emitter clogging characteristics in a drip irrigation system found by the isa method were conservative but they underestimated the emitter clogging degree under actual operation conditions however the experimental results under isa and ni showed a favorable linear correlation r2 0 91 which could be used for calibration the experimental values of fq t ec qvar csl and cse under isa were lower than those under ni by 24 57 64 110 58 121 16 38 and 14 32 respectively while those of dra cu and us were higher than those of ni by 7 13 15 23 and 17 39 respectively therefore this isa method can accurately and highly efficiently represent emitter clogging behaviors acknowledgements we are grateful for financial support from the national key research and development program of china 2017yfd0201504 the national natural science

in table 2 there were 8 replications of each type of drip irrigation emitters and sampling was carried out for 8 times in total the in situ accelerated operation method isa was set as irrigated every day while the normal intermittent operation method ni proceeded according to the drip irrigation frequency applied in actual field and greenhouse crops once every 4 days or 7 days ni1 4 ni1 7 the total irrigation quota was the same under three operation modes and the irrigation periods were 3 h 12 h and 21 h respectively the experiment was performed from june 15 2016 to october 21 2016 totaling 360 h in operations the amount of drip irrigation system water used in each flow test cycle was about 1331 m3 and the total amount of system water consumption was about 2 27 104 m3 2 2 testing methods for emitter outflow and clogging evaluation a weighing method was used to test the outflow of the emitters which was described in detail by feng 2017 the discharge q of the single

of factors such as water temperature and pressure on the emitter clogging then an ultrasonic wave method was used to peel off the clogging substances the drip irrigation emitter sample was then placed in a ziplock bag after adding 20 ml deionized water the ziplock bag was treated in an ultrasonic cleaning instrument 600 kw for 1 h until the clogging substances peeled off small amounts of clogged substances that were difficult to remove were then peeled off with hairbrush like tools the liquid samples of the clogging substanceswere dried in an incubator at 110 c and weighed with the high precision electronic scale precision 10 4 g the weight of remains was the dry weight of the particles in the clogging substances inside the emitter 2 3 evaluation indexes of the clogging behaviors 2 3

characteristics of the single emitter three emitters no 3 no 23 and no 43 in each of the 6 types of emitters were used as representative emitters to analyze the dynamic changes of the outflow during system operation which are shown in figs 2 and 3 the randomness of the outflow changes and their correlations are shown in figs 4 and 5 figs 2 and 3 showed that the emitter outflow represented fluctuating variation and gradually enhanced trend afterwards as the accumulated system operation time increased the emitter fluctuation strength in the accelerated operation mode was clearly weaker than in the normal operation mode figs 4 and 5 showed that the randomness of the outflow variation showed a stable increasing trend under each operation mode and the randomness of the outflow variations under the isa and ni conditions exhibited an significant correlation r2 0 91 p 0 01 meanwhile the longer operation interval results in greater randomness the randomness under the isa treatment was more moderate with a lower value of fq t than that of the ni treatment therefore the accelerated operation treatment underestimated the randomness of outflow variations under actual conditions as they were 12 31 lower than ni1 4 and 30 80 lower than ni1 7 3 2 effect of the isa on the clogging characteristics of the drip irrigation system the qvar of the drip irrigation system under ias and ni and their linear correlations are shown in figs 6 and 7 the dynamic changes in dra of the drip irrigation system under ias and ni and their linear correlations are shown in figs 8 and 9 those of cu are shown in figs 10 and 11 and those of us are shown in figs 12 and 13 figs 6 13 showed that the continuous effects of the different operation modes on drip irrigation emitter clogging were clearly different until the end of experiment the qvar of the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments reached 0 06 0 18 0 16 0 27 and 0 23 0 32 the results under three conditions exhibited a significant correlation 0 95 r2 0 75 the value of qvar under the isa was lower than those of the ni1 4 and ni1 7 conditions by 18 54 and 31 78 respectively the dra values of the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments reached 84 3 92 3 79 1 80 9 and 72 1 77 8 the cu values were 83 6 89 9 76 1 82 6 and 71 3 76 4 while the us values were 71 5 85 5 57 7 80 1 and 43 7 72 9 respectively as the system operating the dra cu and us under isa were higher than those of the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments the clogging degrees under isa and ni conditions showed an significant correlation 0 85 r2 0 97 p 0 01 the isa mode overestimated the dra cu and us values and the dra under the isa was higher than those of the ni1 4 and ni1 7 conditions by 7 15 13 22 respectively meanwhile those of cu were 5 10 and 10 21 larger and those of us were 5 23 and 14 39 larger respectively table 3 showed the significant differences of the dra cu and us between the ni1 4 and isa treatment significant differences p 0 01 were observed between the ni1 7 and isa treatments 3 3 effect of the isa on the clogging substances on the internal laterals the mean values of clogging substances on the internal laterals csl in the drip irrigation system under accelerated and normal operation as well as their correlation are shown in fig 14 obvious differences were found in the contents of clogging substances on the internal laterals as the system continued operating the clogging substances on the internal laterals under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were higher than those of the isa the clogging substances under the isa and ni treatments exhibited excellent correlation r2 0 98 at the end of the yrw drip irrigation system the clogging substances within the internal laterals under the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were 3 08 4 66 and 6 02 mg cm 2 respectively as for the brw drip irrigation system the clogging substances under the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were 3 96 5 18 and 6 93 mg cm 2 respectively the accelerated operation treatment underestimated the clogging substance growth as their contents in the internal laterals under the isa treatment were 26 44 and 76 88 lower than those under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments respectively 3 4 effect of the isa on the clogging substances inside the emitter the dynamic variations in the total quantities of clogging substances in different emitters cse under isa and ni as well as their correlation are shown in figs 15 and 16 the results showed that the total quantities of clogging substances in the emitter under different operation modes were obviously different and the 6 drip irrigation emitters represented a favorable consistency as the accumulated system operation time increased the clogging substances in the emitter under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were higher than those under the isa treatment meanwhile the clogging substances under the isa and ni treatments showed an excellent correlation r2 0 98 for the yrw system the clogging substances inside the emitter under the isa ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments were 13 5 46 3 16 86 51 9 and 19 34 57 31 mg respectively and these values for the brw irrigation system were 13 0 55 3 15 93 60 4 and 17 63 31 mg respectively the accelerated operation treatment underestimated the total clogging substances as their contents were 13 19 and 29 45 lower than those under the ni1 4 and ni1 7 treatments respectively 4 discussions the emitter clogging issue seriously restricts the promotion and application of drip irrigation technology which directly affects the service efficiency and service life of drip irrigation systems therefore more accurate experiments on emitter clogging characteristics are essential although the existing indoor simulated experiments have convenient testing conditions it is difficult to maintain the experiment water source quality constant because of cyclically adjusting the water supply resulting in a large error in the test the in situ field experiments can restore the real working environment of the drip irrigation system and experiment water source is sufficient but long term tests cannot be performed due to harsh conditions such as the environment and weather therefore in this paper we proposes an in situ acceleration test method that establish a drip irrigation clogging test system at the water source site and allow the system to run continuously for a long time every day to accelerate the process experiments on emitter clogging behaviors in drip irrigation systems using the in situ accelerated operation method after bias correction can not only provide real environmental and water quality conditions but also improve experimental efficiency and save large amounts of time however the accelerated irrigation method results in some differences in the wet dry environment inside the internal laterals and these differences can affect the formation accumulation adhesion process of clogging substances ultimately leading to errors in clogging behaviors which could be strengthened under inferior water source drip irrigation li et al 2013 zhou et al 2017b this study was to investigate the effect of isa on the emitter clogging behaviors and to propose a highly efficient and accurate method to eliminate this effect in this study different operation modes showed the same differences in yrw and brw drip irrigation systems and all the data indicated that the experimental resultsunder isa method underestimated the emitter clogging degree under actual operation conditions under isa the emitter clogging degree was lower than the ni in the early stage and the clogging substances in the internal laterals and emitter under isa were both lower than those of ni for yrw drip irrigation a prolonged interval between two operations resulted in a relatively long drying time inside the internal laterals with stagnated water and gradually reduced the water content and accelerated the sediment deposition zhang et al 2001 in addition the yrw contained microorganisms with extracellular polymeric substances secreted wang et al 2014b which caused the continuous adsorption of microorganisms and sediment particles thereby leading to the continuous formation and growth of biological membranes as well as the continuous aggregation of clogging substances as the operation time increased clogging substances aggregated inside the internal laterals which increased the risk of clogging substances entering the emitter and enhancing the clogging degree the clogging behavior in brw drip irrigation was consistent with that in yrw under ni the emitter clogging degrees were higher than the isa mode at the initial stage the brw contained sufficient salt contents and as the interval increased the lengthened drying time inside the internal laterals changed the surface structure of the attached substances and increased the wall roughness and finally the particle deposition and accumulation process was promoted besides water remaining at the water outlet of the emitters deposited a large amount of salt with relatively longer drying time then the salt contents aggregated at the water outlet reduced the emitter outflow which was similar to the results of zhang 2016 therefore the experimental results under isa clearly underestimated the emitter clogging degree compared with those of ni but the results under the isa and ni conditions showed a favorable linear relationship enabling the calibration of the emitter dra cu and clogging substance content with a linear model based on large quantities of experiment data as the 6 types of emitters used in the experiment were all using fractal flow path a significance analysis of the emitter clogging degree under the same operation mode was conducted and no significant differences were observed f 2 84 4 02 and fcrit 4 13 also no significant differences were acquired between two water sources f 0 02 0 18 and fcrit 4 13 therefore these two factors could be neglected the calibration model for the experimental results of the clogging degree is shown in fig 17 although the experimental results under isa were more conservative than ni this effect could be used to reflect the clogging characteristics system performance and accumulation of clogging substances in a single emitter after the simple calibration with a linear model when we get the test results through the accelerated test method we can use this test result to measure the performance of a drip irrigation system at various irrigation frequencies this finding verified that the isa experimental method was reasonable in general an in situ accelerated experimental method was proposed in this paper and the experimental results were calibrated with a linear model to represent the real conditions however there are also related issues requiring further investigations 1 this study considered the clogging characteristics of the emitter with an inferior water drip irrigation system the water quality substantially changes if we apply fertilizers to the water source so the effect of isa on emitter clogging under water fertilizer conditions should be explored 2 this study only tested 3 time interval gradients more irrigation frequency treatments based on real planting conditions are needed thus the experimental results under isa can be verified and then used for the reliable evaluation and prediction of emitter clogging characteristics under different operation conditions 5 conclusion the experimental results of the emitter clogging characteristics in a drip irrigation system found by the isa method were conservative but they underestimated the emitter clogging degree under actual operation conditions however the experimental results under isa and ni showed a favorable linear correlation r2 0 91 which could be used for calibration the experimental values of fq t ec qvar csl and cse under isa were lower than those under ni by 24 57 64 110 58 121 16 38 and 14 32 respectively while those of dra cu and us were higher than those of ni by 7 13 15 23 and 17 39 respectively therefore this isa method can accurately and highly efficiently

11254,nitrogen rich wastewater is a major problem for the aquaculture industry to investigate whether algae could be used to remove ammonium from brackish shrimp aquaculture wastewater marine cyanobacterium synechococcus sp vdw was cultured in bg11 medium supplemented with turks island salt solution and different concentrations of nh4cl 1 0 40 0 mg l 1 for 18 days the cell density of the synechococcus sp vdw cultures increased in medium containing between 1 and 10 mg l 1 of nh4cl while ammonium concentrations greater than 20 0 mg l 1 had a negative effect on growth glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase activities were also examined and were found to increase with cell density meanwhile glutamate dehydrogenase activity increased in response to high nh4cl concentrations 20 0 40 0 mg l 1 the cellular response to ammonium excess was confirmed by measuring gene expression levels using quantitative pcr expression of both glna and gltb was down regulated compared with the control while that of gdha was up regulated at an initial concentration of 1 10 mg l 1 98 100 of the ammonium was removed by day 6 of cultivation therefore these findings suggest that synechococcus sp vdw can remove ammonium from contaminated brackish water and may be helpful for improving the quality of aquaculture wastewater keywords ammonium assimilation glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase glutamate dehydrogenase gene expression synechococcus sp vdw 1 introduction thailand is one of the top 15 producers in the aquaculture industry worldwide and is the largest exporter of crustaceans in south east asia fao 2014 a significant problem associated with the growing aquaculture industry is the high quantity of nitrogenous waste that is produced during protein metabolism by the animals and from the decomposition of nutrients in the aquaculture ponds ammonium levels in aquaculture effluent can vary widely even in aquaculture source waters however levels are generally in the range of approximately 1 10 mg l 1 chiu mei et al 2016 gustavo et al 2006 ammonium contamination from untreatedwater causes both environmental and health issues including eutrophication and toxic effects on aquatic life li et al 2007 coastal shrimp farming producing brackish water effluent often contributes to the eutrophication of receiving waters dierberg and kiattisimkul 1996 paez osuna et al 1998 elevated concentrations of environmental ammonia have been reported to affect growth molting oxygen consumption and reproduction of penaeus prawn species chen et al 1988 chen and kou 1992 chen and lin 1992 wastewater treatment is essential for enhancing the sustainable aquaculture industry and reducing marine pollution various efforts such as air stripping chemical precipitation adsorption and biological treatment have been applied to remove ammonium from different types of wastewater sarioglu 2005 currently one established tool used in public sewage treatment facilities is biological treatment which is used for activated sludge however this technique requires mechanical ventilation providing a significant volume of oxygen it also costs 45 75 of the total energy requisite for a plant oilgae 2010 besides waste activated sludge matching the quantity of wastewater treated is the main derivative of this approach thus considerable energy and a sizeable area of land are needed for the treatment and removal of waste activated sludge metcalf and eddy 2003 on the whole limitation factor for the development of the aquaculture industry in numerous regions is the cost effective removal of nitrogen n from aquaculture farm waste which likewise fails to supplement any value to the process other than the elimination of polluting nutrients from the discharge therefore biological treatment using algae has gained a lot of attention algae are very efficient at removing nutrients from wastewater and the accumulated biomass can be used in the production of high value products including biofuel and natural compounds wang et al 2010 ramaraj et al 2015 many microalgae can utilize various forms of inorganic nitrogen including nh4 no3 and no2 for growth and depending on the species and other environmental conditions can survive in the presence of high nitrogen concentrations they are fairly ubiquitous and are found in both fresh and salt water as well as municipal wastewaters several previous studies have successfully used algal cultures to remove ammonium from various types of wastewater arbib et al 2014 van den hende et al 2014 lim et al 2010 found that chlorella vulgaris umacc 001 could reduce nh4 n concentrations in textile wastewater by 44 4 45 1 initial concentration 6 5 mg l 1 while feng et al 2011 reported that 97 of nh4 n was removed by c vulgaris cultivated in artificial wastewater initial concentration 20 mg l 1 marine cyanobacteria belonging to the genus synechococcus are some of the most abundant picoplanktonic photoautotrophs in the world s oceans and are capable of fulfilling their nitrogen requirements using nitrate ammonia or in some cases urea synechococcus species also have the ability to adapt to a variety of nutrient concentrations and temperatures ting et al 2002 mella flores et al 2012 recently synechococcus species have been used as a model for synthetic biology studies with numerous biotechnological applications including production of biofuels anne 2014 mcneely et al 2010 and various bioactive compounds alka and jayashree 2010 although biological wastewater treatment using algae has been studied for over 50 years most algal strains investigated have been from freshwater environments and thus there is limited information available regarding the ammonium tolerance of algae in saline brackish water theoretically marine algal strains also have the ability to use inorganic nitrogen for growth therefore this study aimed to examine the effects of different ammonium concentrations on the growth of synechococcus sp vdw under simulated shrimp aquaculture wastewater conditions we also investigated the activity of several key enzymes involved in ammonium assimilation including glutamine synthetase gs ec 6 3 1 2 and glutamate synthase gogat ec 1 4 1 13 commonly known as the gs gogat pathway the direct amination of 2 oxoglutarate catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase gdh 1 4 1 4 was also examined in addition quantitative pcr qpcr was used to measure the expression of glna gltb and gdha encoding glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase respectively following exposure to various ammonium concentrations finally the ammonium removal efficiency of synechococcus sp vdw from synthetic medium was also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1

period between x0 and xt 2 2 estimation of biologically relevant ammonium concentrations from shrimp farm effluent to estimate the concentration of ammonium in standard shrimp farm wastewater samples

prepared as described in section 2 5 2 4 enzyme assays 2 4 1 preparation of cell free extracts for enzymatic activity assays the cell pellet was washed twice with 50 mm tris hcl buffer ph 8 0 and then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the pellet was then resuspended in 3 ml of tris hcl buffer and sonicated at 4 c for 3 min 20 s on 20 s off at 60 khz the sonicated sample was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was transferred into a pre cooled microfuge tube and used for enzyme assays 2 4 2 measurement of gs activity gs activity was measured using the method described by shapiro and stadtman 1968 accordingly the inorganic phosphate produced during atp consumption in the biosynthetic reaction glutamate and ammonium to produce glutamine was monitored over 15 min and used as a readout of enzyme activity a negative control assay was performed in the absence of glutamate one unit of gs activity was defined as the amount of protein producing 1 μmol of phosphate per min 2 4 3 measurement of gogat and gdh activity gogat and gdh activities were determined by the colorimetric method of groat and vance 1981 one unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to consume 1 μmol of nadh per min 2 4 4 measurement of protein the protein concentrations of the extracts were determined according to the method of bradford 1976 using bovine serum albumin as the standard 2 5 preparation of rna and cdna synthesis for rna extraction from synechococcus sp vdw 1 ml of cell culture was sampled at 24 48 72 120 and 168 h after initiation of the light cycle cells were collected by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 5 min at 4 c and then frozen at 80 c until use total rna was extracted using a masterpure rna purification kit epicentre usa according to the manufacturer s protocol rna was dissolved in 20 μl of te buffer and then treated with deoxyribonuclease i to eliminate genomic dna contamination the total rna concentration was quantitatively determined using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa at 260 nm reverse transcription of the total rna 1 μg was performed with oligo dt primers using a precision nanoscript ii reverse transcription kit primerdesign uk according to the manufacturer s protocol 2 6 primer design and qpcr experiments the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding gs gogat gdh and rnase p housekeeping gene were retrieved from the genbank database https www ncbi nlm nih gov genbank all primers used for qpcr assays are shown in table 1 qpcr was performed using a mygo pro real time pcr cycler it is international ltd uk the 20 μl reaction volumes contained 1 μg of cdna 400 nm each primer and 10 μl of 2 qpcrbio sygreen mix pcr biosystem ltd uk primer specificity was confirmed by the presence of a single band of the expected size on an agarose gel by a single peak melting curve in the qpcr analysis and by sequencing of the pcr products all qpcr protocols started

the ct value as explained by livak and schmittgenm 2001 so that the expression was calculated using the formula 2 relative gene expression 2 δδct where δδct corresponds to the increase in the threshold cycle of the target gene with respect to the increase in the threshold cycle of the housekeeping gene rnpb according to this formula values of 1 indicate no change values 1 indicate an increase in gene expression and values 1 indicate a decrease in gene expression 2 7 measuring the efficiency of ammonium removal ammonium concentrations were determined by the indophenol blue colorimetric method according to koroleff 1976 the supernatants in section 2 3 were filtered gf f grade and the resulting filtrates were immediately analyzed after 30 min of incubation at room temperature the absorbance at 640 nm was used to calculate the ammonium concentrations using a standard curve of nh4cl the ammonium removal efficiency was defined as the percent removal of nh4 from the medium per day and was calculated using the formula 3 conc start conc end conc start t 100 where conc start is the initial ammonium concentration conc end is the final ammonium concentration and t is the cultivation time 2 8 statistical analysis three experimental replicates were carried out for each assay with at least three analytical replicates per sampling point all calculations were performed using statistical package for social sciences spss version 15 0 spss inc usa univariate analysis of variance and post hoc and duncan tests were used for analysis all capacity measures are given as means standard error over the duration of the experiment the effects of ammonium concentration on transcription levels were examined using analysis of variance anova with scheffe post hoc testing mean differences were determined to be significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of shrimp farm effluent as shown in table 1 ph levels and concentrations of tp and no2 n were not higher than standard values for effluent in contrast concentrations of bod5 nh3 n and tkn exceeded the permitted limits by 3 15 and 4 times respectively to cover the range of ammonium concentrations identified in the shrimp farm effluent samples nh4cl was used at 10 40 mg l 1 in this study 3 2 growth response to ammonium the growth curves for synechococcus sp vdw grown in the presence of different initial ammonium concentrations 1 10 20 30 or 40 mg l 1 are shown in fig 1 the cell density decreased slightly with an increase in the ammonium concentration the highest specific growth rates for each of the concentrations of ammonium were 0 112 0 087 0 080 0 065 and 0 063 d 1 respectively these results indicate that the growth of synechococcus sp vdw was promoted by supplementation of the growth medium with nh4 in the range of 1 0 10 0 mg l 1 but was obviously inhibited when the nh4 concentration increased to 20 0 mg l 1 or higher supporting this finding allen and smith 1986 suggested that high concentrations of ammonium may inhibit growth of photosynthetic organisms one explanation is that the excretion of protons produced during ammonium assimilation into organic matter may increase the acidity resulting in damage to the organisms 3 3 effect of ammonium concentration on the activity of key ammonium assimilation enzymes the activity of three key ammonium assimilation enzymes was measured and results are shown in fig 2 a c gs and gogat activities were highest in mid exponential phase cells day 12 of cultivation in the media containing 1 control or 10 mg l 1 nh4cl then decreased to very low levels by stationary phase this may indicate that all the available ammonium was used by the cells under these conditions meanwhile enzyme activity was suppressed when the ammonium concentrations were higher than 20 mg l 1 in contrast the observed gdh activity was lowest in cells grown under the two low ammonium concentration conditions 1 control or 10 mg l 1 nh4cl merida et al 1991 reported that addition of 0 25 mm nh4c1 caused a rapid decrease in gs activity in synechocystis sp pcc 6803 inactivation of gs has been reported in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc 6803 with the dramatic effect produced by l methionine dl sulphoximine a specific inhibitor of gs in addition chavez et al 1999 demonstrated that a mutant strain of synechocystis sp pcc 6803 lacking gdh had no changes in its rate of ammonium assimilation therefore the major metabolic route for ammonium assimilation in cyanobacteria is the gs gogat pathway similar to enterobacteria gdh plays an auxiliary role in synechococcus operating as the only assimilation pathway in media containing high concentrations of ammonium brenchley and magasanik 1974 moreover skopelitis et al 2006 reported that under stress conditions when the gs gogat system was not fully operating an increase in gdh activity may counteract the accumulating toxic amounts of nh4 and provide glutamate for the biosynthesis of protective compounds such as proline 3 4 effect of ammonium concentration on gene expression differences in relative gene expression levels in response to ammonium rich conditions 20 40 mg l 1 compared with the control 1 mg l 1 were determined by qpcr as shown in fig 3 a c glna gltb and gdha were similarly expressed under ammonium rich conditions after 24 h the relative expression of these genes was down regulated compared with the control the maximum relative expression of glna 2 fold increase was observed in cells incubated in bg11 containing 40 mg l 1 nh4cl at 168 h post inoculation the expression of gltb in bg11 containing 20 mg l 1 nh4cl was lower than that under control conditions while at 40 mg l 1 nh4cl cells showed slightly higher expression of gltb fig 2b interestingly under ammonium rich conditions the expression of gdha fig 2c was greatly increased compared with the control the two highest levels of gdha expression 2 1 and 1 9 fold increases were observed in cells incubated in media containing 20 and 40 mg l 1 nh4cl at 168 and 48 h post inoculation respectively these results suggest that gdha was induced by nitrogen rich conditions while glna and gltb were repressed clearly the changes in the transcriptional levels of glna gltb and gdha corresponded to the observed levels of gs gogat and gdh activity leading to the conclusion that these enzymes are similarly regulated under the same ammonium conditions as previously mentioned extensive research over several decades has examined the enzymes involved in the ammonium assimilation pathway in cyanobacteria but transcription level information involved in key genes remains a limitation some studies identified the regulatory expression of the glna gene in response to nitrogen starvation in several cyanobacteria for example glna gene of synechocystis sp strain pcc 6803 and synechococcus sp strain pcc 7942 increases when the cells are transferred to nitrogen free medium cohen kupiec et al 1993 under dinitrogen fixing conditions glna gene expression and gs activity are high as a result of alterations in the nitrogen source for anabaena sp strain pcc 7120 tumer et al 1983 an assessment of our results regarding gene association with ammonium assimilation enzymes may offer useful data to enhance knowledge concerning the ammonium assimilation pathway however a comprehensive understanding of the entire nutrient procurement system for cyanobacteria focusing on the absorption mechanisms of ammonium as well as links to other metabolisms such as carbon sulfur and phosphorus is lacking thus applications of various cyanobacteria require further investigation to identify the potential possibilities of these organisms in applied sciences for promotion of current knowledge 3 5 effect of ammonium concentration on ammonium removal efficiency to evaluate the ammonium removal efficiency of synechococcus sp vdw cells were exposed to different concentrations of ammonium for 6 days prior to ammonium concentration analysis the ammonium removal efficiencies ranged from 16 5 in 10 mg l 1 nh4cl medium to 5 15 in medium supplemented with 40 mg l 1 nh4cl table 3 total ammonium removal reached a maximum level of 98 in the treatment containing 10 mg l 1 nh4cl and there was no significant difference between this treatment and the control however the ammonium removal efficiency decreased after 6 days of cultivation data not shown these results revealed that ammonium concentrations greater than 20 mg l 1 could decrease the removal of nh4cl by this strain borowitzka 1998 also reported that ammonium concentrations greater than 20 mg l 1 were not recommended because of ammonium toxicity and moreover photosynthesis in marine diatoms is inhibited under high ammonium conditions in general average ammonium concentrations in aquaculture wastewater range from 0 5 to 20 mg l 1 pham et al 2013 lucia et al 2013 table 2 4 conclusions results from the present study indicate that synechococcus sp vdw maintains a positive growth rate and maximum ammonium removal efficiency in medium supplemented with nh4cl at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg l 1 but that growth is suppressed when the ammonium concentration is higher than 20 mg l 1 ammonium can be assimilated by two different pathways the activation of which depends on the concentration our analysis of gs and gogat found that both specific enzyme activity and glna gltb transcription were regulated in response to nitrogen availability gs and gogat activity was rapidly down regulated under excess ammonium concentrations while gdh activity and gdha transcription were up regulated conversely under optimal ammonium concentrations the gs gogat cycle becomes the major nitrogen assimilation process finally we can conclude that marine cyanobacterium synechococcus sp vdw is a suitable choice for improving the quality of saline aquaculture effluent acknowledgements the

11254,nitrogen rich wastewater is a major problem for the aquaculture industry to investigate whether algae could be used to remove ammonium from brackish shrimp aquaculture wastewater marine cyanobacterium synechococcus sp vdw was cultured in bg11 medium supplemented with turks island salt solution and different concentrations of nh4cl 1 0 40 0 mg l 1 for 18 days the cell density of the synechococcus sp vdw cultures increased in medium containing between 1 and 10 mg l 1 of nh4cl while ammonium concentrations greater than 20 0 mg l 1 had a negative effect on growth glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase activities were also examined and were found to increase with cell density meanwhile glutamate dehydrogenase activity increased in response to high nh4cl concentrations 20 0 40 0 mg l 1 the cellular response to ammonium excess was confirmed by measuring gene expression levels using quantitative pcr expression of both glna and gltb was down regulated compared with the control while that of gdha was up regulated at an initial concentration of 1 10 mg l 1 98 100 of the ammonium was removed by day 6 of cultivation therefore these findings suggest that synechococcus sp vdw can remove ammonium from contaminated brackish water and may be helpful for improving the quality of aquaculture wastewater keywords ammonium assimilation glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase glutamate dehydrogenase gene expression synechococcus sp vdw 1 introduction thailand is one of the top 15 producers in the aquaculture industry worldwide and is the largest exporter of crustaceans in south east asia fao 2014 a significant problem associated with the growing aquaculture industry is the high quantity of nitrogenous waste that is produced during protein metabolism by the animals and from the decomposition of nutrients in the aquaculture ponds ammonium levels in aquaculture effluent can vary widely even in aquaculture source waters however levels are generally in the range of approximately 1 10 mg l 1 chiu mei et al 2016 gustavo et al 2006 ammonium contamination from untreatedwater causes both environmental and health issues including eutrophication and toxic effects on aquatic life li et al 2007 coastal shrimp farming producing brackish water effluent often contributes to the eutrophication of receiving waters dierberg and kiattisimkul 1996 paez osuna et al 1998 elevated concentrations of environmental ammonia have been reported to affect growth molting oxygen consumption and reproduction of penaeus prawn species chen et al 1988 chen and kou 1992 chen and lin 1992 wastewater treatment is essential for enhancing the sustainable aquaculture industry and reducing marine pollution various efforts such as air stripping chemical precipitation adsorption and biological treatment have been applied to remove ammonium from different types of wastewater sarioglu 2005 currently one established tool used in public sewage treatment facilities is biological treatment which is used for activated sludge however this technique requires mechanical ventilation providing a significant volume of oxygen it also costs 45 75 of the total energy requisite for a plant oilgae 2010 besides waste activated sludge matching the quantity of wastewater treated is the main derivative of this approach thus considerable energy and a sizeable area of land are needed for the treatment and removal of waste activated sludge metcalf and eddy 2003 on the whole limitation factor for the development of the aquaculture industry in numerous regions is the cost effective removal of nitrogen n from aquaculture farm waste which likewise fails to supplement any value to the process other than the elimination of polluting nutrients from the discharge therefore biological treatment using algae has gained a lot of attention algae are very efficient at removing nutrients from wastewater and the accumulated biomass can be used in the production of high value products including biofuel and natural compounds wang et al 2010 ramaraj et al 2015 many microalgae can utilize various forms of inorganic nitrogen including nh4 no3 and no2 for growth and depending on the species and other environmental conditions can survive in the presence of high nitrogen concentrations they are fairly ubiquitous and are found in both fresh and salt water as well as municipal wastewaters several previous studies have successfully used algal cultures to remove ammonium from various types of wastewater arbib et al 2014 van den hende et al 2014 lim et al 2010 found that chlorella vulgaris umacc 001 could reduce nh4 n concentrations in textile wastewater by 44 4 45 1 initial concentration 6 5 mg l 1 while feng et al 2011 reported that 97 of nh4 n was removed by c vulgaris cultivated in artificial wastewater initial concentration 20 mg l 1 marine cyanobacteria belonging to the genus synechococcus are some of the most abundant picoplanktonic photoautotrophs in the world s oceans and are capable of fulfilling their nitrogen requirements using nitrate ammonia or in some cases urea synechococcus species also have the ability to adapt to a variety of nutrient concentrations and temperatures ting et al 2002 mella flores et al 2012 recently synechococcus species have been used as a model for synthetic biology studies with numerous biotechnological applications including production of biofuels anne 2014 mcneely et al 2010 and various bioactive compounds alka and jayashree 2010 although biological wastewater treatment using algae has been studied for over 50 years most algal strains investigated have been from freshwater environments and thus there is limited information available regarding the ammonium tolerance of algae in saline brackish water theoretically marine algal strains also have the ability to use inorganic nitrogen for growth therefore this study aimed to examine the effects of different ammonium concentrations on the growth of synechococcus sp vdw under simulated shrimp aquaculture wastewater conditions we also investigated the activity of several key enzymes involved in ammonium assimilation including glutamine synthetase gs ec 6 3 1 2 and glutamate synthase gogat ec 1 4 1 13 commonly known as the gs gogat pathway the direct amination of 2 oxoglutarate catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase gdh 1 4 1 4 was also examined in addition quantitative pcr qpcr was used to measure the expression of glna gltb and gdha encoding glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase respectively following exposure to various ammonium concentrations finally the ammonium removal efficiency of synechococcus sp vdw from synthetic medium was also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal strain and culture conditions synechococcus sp vdw accession number mh393765 originally isolated from natural seawater in thailand tinpranee et al 2018 was provided by bioenergy research unit king mongkut s institute of technology ladkrabang thailand this strain was cultured in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of bg11 medium supplemented with turks island salt solution ph 7 5 at

12 h dark cycle each treatment was performed in triplicate and cultures were uniformly prepared with an initial optical density at 730 nm od730 of approximately 0 1 absence of microbial contamination was verified by cultivation on agar medium allen and gorham 1981 the specific growth rate μ was determined from the increase in algal cell density during the exponential growth phase compared with the initial cell density and calculated using the following equation 1 μ ln x t x 0 t where xt is the cell density at time t x0 is the cell density in the initial logarithmic growth phase and t is the period between x0 and xt 2 2 estimation of biologically relevant ammonium concentrations from shrimp farm effluent to estimate the concentration of ammonium in standard shrimp farm wastewater samples of shrimp farm effluent were collected from five shrimp farms in chantaburi province one of the largest shrimp farming areas in thailand the samples were collected after shrimp harvesting sampling procedures and analyses were conducted in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater of the american public health association apha 2005 physicochemical parameters of the wastewater including biochemical oxygen demand bod5 ph ammonia nh3 n concentration total phosphorus tp concentration total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentration and nitrite no2 n concentration were measured in all samples 2 3 experimental set up to determine the limiting concentration of nitrogen from ammonia on algal growth and enzyme activity a shake flask growth assay was performed ammonium chloride nh4cl was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 10 20 30 or 40 mg l 1 nh4 n covering the range of concentrations identified in the shrimp farm effluent samples three replicate flasks each containing 100 ml of culture medium were prepared for each concentration along with a control containing no nh4cl these experiments were performed at the same incubation temperature and under the same illumination conditions as for standard culturing triplicate flasks for each concentration were collected at six time point during the experimental period one milliliter of culture was harvested and the od730 was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer multiskan go thermo scientific japan the remaining culture was harvested by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 15 min the cells were washed twice with sterile saline solution 0 85 nacl and used for enzyme activity assays the supernatant was used to measure ammonium concentration as described in section 2 7 samples were measured every 3 days over the 18 day experimental period including day 0 for experiments addressing the changes in gene expression induced by high ammonium concentrations algal cells were cultured under the conditions described in section 2 1 total cells at mid logarithmic phase were harvested by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 15 min resuspended in 5 ml of sterile saline solution and then transferred into 100 ml culture medium containing 20 or 40 mg l 1 nh4cl culture medium without nh4cl was used as the control samples were then collected at the indicated time points and prepared as described in section 2 5 2 4 enzyme assays 2 4 1 preparation of cell free extracts for enzymatic activity assays the cell pellet was washed twice with 50 mm tris hcl buffer ph 8 0 and then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the pellet was then resuspended in 3 ml of tris hcl buffer and sonicated at 4 c for 3 min 20 s on 20 s off at 60 khz the sonicated sample was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was transferred into a pre cooled microfuge tube and used for enzyme assays 2 4 2 measurement of gs activity gs activity was measured using the method described by shapiro and stadtman 1968 accordingly the inorganic phosphate produced during atp consumption in the biosynthetic reaction glutamate and ammonium to produce glutamine was monitored over 15 min and used as a readout of enzyme activity a negative control assay was performed in the absence of glutamate one unit of gs activity was defined as the amount of protein producing 1 μmol of phosphate per min 2 4 3 measurement of gogat and gdh activity gogat and gdh activities were determined by the colorimetric method of groat and vance 1981 one unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to consume 1 μmol of nadh per min 2 4 4 measurement of protein the protein concentrations of the extracts were determined according to the method of bradford 1976 using bovine serum albumin as the standard 2 5 preparation of rna and cdna synthesis for rna extraction from synechococcus sp vdw 1 ml of cell culture was sampled at 24 48 72 120 and 168 h after initiation of the light cycle cells were collected by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 5 min at 4 c and then frozen at 80 c until use total rna was extracted using a masterpure rna purification kit epicentre usa according to the manufacturer s protocol rna was dissolved in 20 μl of te buffer and then treated with deoxyribonuclease i to eliminate genomic dna contamination the total rna concentration was quantitatively determined using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa at 260 nm reverse transcription of the total rna 1 μg was performed with oligo dt primers using a precision nanoscript ii reverse transcription kit primerdesign uk according to the manufacturer s protocol 2 6 primer design and qpcr experiments the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding gs gogat gdh and rnase p housekeeping gene were retrieved from the genbank database https www ncbi nlm nih gov genbank all primers used for qpcr assays are shown in table 1 qpcr was performed using a mygo pro real time pcr cycler it is international ltd uk the 20 μl reaction volumes contained 1 μg of cdna 400 nm each primer and 10 μl of 2 qpcrbio sygreen mix pcr biosystem ltd uk primer specificity was confirmed by the presence of a single band of the expected size on an agarose gel by a single peak melting curve in the qpcr analysis and by sequencing of the pcr products all qpcr protocols started with a 2 min activation step at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 c 20 s at 60 c and 30 s at 72 c and a final melting curve of 55 95 c for 1 min at each step the cycle threshold ct was determined in triplicate and ct values obtained for each sample were normalized against those of housekeeping gene rnpb encoding ribonuclease p rnase p relative gene expression was calculated using the ct value as explained by livak and schmittgenm 2001 so that the expression was calculated using the formula 2 relative gene expression 2 δδct where δδct corresponds to the increase in the threshold cycle of the target gene with respect to the increase in the threshold cycle of the housekeeping gene rnpb according to this formula values of 1 indicate no change values 1 indicate an increase in gene expression and values 1 indicate a decrease in gene expression 2 7 measuring the efficiency of ammonium removal ammonium concentrations were determined by the indophenol blue colorimetric method according to koroleff 1976 the supernatants in section 2 3 were filtered gf f grade and the resulting filtrates were immediately analyzed after 30 min of incubation at room temperature the absorbance at 640 nm was used to calculate the ammonium concentrations using a standard curve of nh4cl the ammonium removal efficiency was defined as the percent removal of nh4 from the medium per day and was calculated using the formula 3 conc start conc end conc start t 100 where conc start is the initial ammonium concentration conc end is the final ammonium concentration and t is the cultivation time 2 8 statistical analysis three experimental replicates were carried out for each assay with at least three analytical replicates per sampling point all calculations were performed using statistical package for social sciences spss version 15 0 spss inc usa univariate analysis of variance and post hoc and duncan tests were used for analysis all capacity measures are given as means standard error over the duration of the experiment the effects of ammonium concentration on transcription levels were examined using analysis of variance anova with scheffe post hoc testing mean differences were determined to be significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of shrimp farm effluent as shown in table 1 ph levels and concentrations of tp and no2 n were not higher than standard values for effluent in contrast concentrations of bod5 nh3 n and tkn exceeded the permitted limits by 3 15 and 4 times respectively to cover the range of ammonium concentrations identified in the shrimp farm effluent samples nh4cl was used at 10 40 mg l 1 in this study 3 2 growth response to ammonium the growth curves for synechococcus sp vdw grown in the presence of different initial ammonium concentrations 1 10 20 30 or 40 mg l 1 are shown in fig 1 the cell density decreased slightly with an increase in the ammonium concentration the highest specific growth rates for each of the concentrations of ammonium were 0 112 0 087 0 080 0 065 and 0 063 d 1 respectively these results indicate that the growth of synechococcus sp vdw was promoted by supplementation of the growth medium with nh4 in the range of 1 0 10 0 mg l 1 but was obviously inhibited when the nh4 concentration increased to 20 0 mg l 1 or higher supporting this finding allen and smith 1986 suggested that high concentrations of ammonium may inhibit growth of photosynthetic organisms one explanation is that the excretion of protons produced during ammonium assimilation into organic matter may increase the acidity resulting in damage to the organisms 3 3 effect of ammonium concentration on the activity of key ammonium assimilation enzymes the activity of three key ammonium assimilation enzymes was measured and results are shown in fig 2 a c gs and gogat activities were highest in mid exponential phase cells day 12 of cultivation in the media containing 1 control or 10 mg l 1 nh4cl then decreased to very low levels by stationary phase this may indicate that all the available ammonium was used by the cells under these conditions meanwhile enzyme activity was suppressed when the ammonium concentrations were higher than 20 mg l 1 in contrast the observed gdh activity was lowest in cells grown under the two low ammonium concentration conditions 1 control or 10 mg l 1 nh4cl merida et al 1991 reported that addition of 0 25 mm nh4c1 caused a rapid decrease in gs activity in synechocystis sp pcc 6803 inactivation of gs has been reported in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc 6803 with the dramatic effect produced by l methionine dl sulphoximine a specific inhibitor of gs in addition chavez et al 1999 demonstrated that a mutant strain of synechocystis sp pcc 6803 lacking gdh had no changes in its rate of ammonium assimilation therefore the major metabolic route for ammonium assimilation in cyanobacteria is the gs gogat pathway similar to enterobacteria gdh plays an auxiliary role in synechococcus operating as the only assimilation pathway in media containing high concentrations of ammonium brenchley and magasanik 1974 moreover skopelitis et al 2006 reported that under stress conditions when the gs gogat system was not fully operating an increase in gdh activity may counteract the accumulating toxic amounts of nh4 and
