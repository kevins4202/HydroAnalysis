consumption of oxygen water clarity few suspended algae and low amount of chlorophyll mesotrophic lakes are distinguished by a middle amount of nutrients and organic sediments accumulating on the bottom the productivity is intermediate between oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes and the oxygen concentration may not fluctuate except near the bottom finally eutrophic lakes are characterized by

three different lakes namely czarne 53 54 8 n 17 31 0 e zmarle 53 55 4 n 17 31 7 e and laska 53 55 9 n 17 00 6 e located in the brusy municipality in the chojnice poviat northest poland fig 1 were investigated the lakes are embedded in the zaborski landscape park a protected reserve covering a surface of 34 026 ha surrounding the tuchola forest national park the morphology and trophism of the three lakes differ considerably fig 2 czarne is a very young internal basin with a water table without drainage the lake surface covers an area of 9 ha mostly surrounded by pine forests the arboreal vegetation is also characterized by the presence of willows alders and birches czarne is an oligotrophic and polymictic lake characterized by lobelia colonies which are recorded till a depth of 5 m the average depth is 3 85 m with a maximum depth at 7 3 m barañczuk and borowiak 2010 zmarle is a young lake without drainage with a surface area of 30 ha due to its water mixing dynamic it is classified as a dimictic lake while in terms of trophism it is classified as a mesotrophic lake the water body is surrounded by a dense pine forest while its shoreline is occupied by alders and birches the shallow water is mostly covered by reeds the average depth is 9 3 m with the deepest point at 19 4 m barañczuk and borowiak 2010 laska is a mature lake belonging to the zubrzyca river basin and covering an area of 70 ha in 1997 laska was proclaimed a protected reserve being made up of a rich vegetation composed by rushes and sedges numerous breeding sites of waterfowl and marsh birds the water drainage is allowed by the zbryzca river that enters in the east side and gets out in the west side the littoral zone is densely covered by reeds with a narrow strip of alders and birches pine forests mostly surround the water body even though pastures and wetland occur in the eastern side laska is a polymictic lake characterized by complete mixing of water several times per year in terms of trophism it is classified as a eutrophic lake the nutrient input flow is also raised by a large salmon farm located close to the water body the average depth of the lake is 1 5 m and the deepest point is 3 6 m barañczuk and borowiak 2010 the driving forces converging to the investigated lake ecosystems are summarized in table 1 while table 2 shows the main features of the three lakes 2 2 methods 2 2 1 the emergy accounting method emergy is an environmental accounting method useful to measure the cumulative environmental support for generating a good or service odum 1988 1996 specifically emergy is defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly required to make a given product to support a given flow or service franzese et al 2020 odum 1996 the emergy method takes into account for free environmental inputs e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flow human driven material and energy flows and the indirect environmental support embodied in human labor and services the systems diagram in fig 3 shows the main driving forces supporting the functioning of the three investigated lakes using the energy systems language odum 1996 the systems diagram highlights the main external driving forces supporting the generation of natural capital stocks in the case of laska lake the input on nutrients coming from a major nearby salmon farm was also accounted for in addition the systems diagram shows the main components producers consumers and storages of the lake ecosystems and the interactions among them according to the emergy theory inputs are accounted for through a common unit of measure the solar equivalent joule sej odum 1996 the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 the uev reflects the direct and indirect environmental support for generating one unit of product or service the higher the uev the higher the environmental cost brown and ulgiati 1997 mass energy labour and money input flows converging to the investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to compute the total emergy supporting the system in this study the emergy accounting method was used for assessing the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the three investigated forest lakes considering a formation time of 3 years the maximum value among the turnover time of the different biomass groups 3 years was chosen considering that all groups are co products of the total emergy invested therefore in this study the driving forces converging for the formation of biotic natural capital stocks were multiplied by 3 years that is the average turnover time of the higher trophic level aquatic birds while the assessment of the abiotic natural capital stocks was out of the scope of the present investigation the emergy accounting was performed through the following main steps 1 identification of the spatial and temporal boundaries of the investigated lake ecosystems 2 inventory of mass and energy flows supporting natural capital stocks formation in the lake ecosystems 3 conversion of input flows into emergy units by using appropriate uevs 4 calculation of the total emergy supporting natural capital stocks formation in the lake ecosystems the uevs used in this study table 3 were updated to the 1 20 1025 sej yr 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown et al 2016a 2016b 2 2 2 the eco exergy accounting method the eco exergy accounting method aims at quantifying the available energy of all living biotic components in an ecosystem compared to the non living state i e the detritus in particular the eco exergy method accounts for the chemical energy in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in living organisms measuring the organization and development stage of an ecosystem jørgensen and mejer 1979 broadly eco exergy allows to account the distance from thermodynamic equilibrium as a measure of the complexity of an ecosystem fath et al 2004 marchi et al 2012 the eco exergy value for living organisms is calculated according to the following equation eco exergy ß b f where ß is a weighting factor expressing the information content of the organism s genes b is the organism s biomass in grams and f is the value of work energy per unit of biomass the value of f may slightly change among different taxonomic groups the higher is the fat content the higher is the value the average value of 18 7 kj g was used in this study according to jørgensen 2015 the total eco exergy of an ecosystem is computed as the sum of the eco exergy values calculated for all the organisms living in that ecosystem in this study the eco exergy method was used to quantify natural capital value of the three investigated lakes in terms of chemical energy stored in organic matter and genetic information embodied in biomass stocks ash free dry weights afdw per unit area of the different taxonomic groups embedded into the three lakes were multiplied by the relative ß values table 4 the resulting values were then summed to calculate the total eco exergy value of each investigated lake ecosystem 2 2 3 the eco exergy emergy ratio the relation between eco exergy and emergy has been much debated over time it was stated that coupling emergy and eco exergy accounting is complementary and non competitive bastianoni et al 2007 sciubba and ulgiati 2005 the complementarity is due to the different purpose of the two accounting approaches emergy accounts for the cumulative work of nature performed over time while eco exergy focuses on the present state of a system measuring the level of organization and the information content amaral et al 2016 in the present study the eco exergy emergy ratio was calculated to assess the ability of lake ecosystems in generating biomass stocks per unit of invested emergy bastianoni 2002 lu et al 2015 3 results in this study matter and energy supporting the generation of autotrophic and heterotrophic stocks in the investigated forest lakes czarne zmarle and laska were assessed by using the emergy accounting method in particular natural flows solar radiation rain wind geothermal flows and nutrient flows n p supporting the formation of natural capital stocks were accounted for in the case of laska lake the nitrogen input coming from the nearby zubrzyca river which influxes into the lake was also taken into account table 5 shows the emergy value of natural and nutrient flows supporting the three investigated lake ecosystems the total emergy values and the emergy per unit area i e the emergy density the total emergy is an extensive measure depending on the area of the lake while the emergy density is an intensive indicator allowing the comparison among lakes despite their different extent the laska lake showed the highest emergy density 4 36 1012 sej m 2 and total emergy value 3 07 1018 sej while the zmarle lake showed the lowest emergy density value 2 90 1011 sej m 2 table 6 shows the main autotrophic and heterotrophic groups embedded into the three lake ecosystems together with the relative biomass density calculated by using local data gathered through field sampling activities and expressed as ash free dry weight afdw per unit area flowering plants and aquatic birds in the laska lake were the groups with the highest biomass value 6 59 1010 mg m 2 and 2 39 1010 mg m 2 respectively the biomass values represented the basic information for the implementation of the eco exergy accounting table 7 shows the eco exergy value of the main taxonomic groups the total eco exergy and the eco exergy density the laska lake showed the highest values of total eco exergy 9 71 1011 kj and eco exergy density 1 38 106 kj m 2 the lowest value of eco exergy density was calculated for zmarle lake while the lowest total eco exergy resulted for czarne lake finally the eco exergy emergy ratio was calculated as a measure of efficiency of the three investigated lakes table 8 the highest value of the eco exergy emergy ratio resulted for the zmarle lake 1 43 10 3 j sej and czarne 1 37 10 3 j sej while the lowest value was obtained for the laska lake 0 32 10 3 j sej 4 discussion in this study the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods were jointly used to assess the value of natural capital stocks of the investigated lake ecosystems adopting two different perspectives the cumulative work of nature invested for natural capital formation and the organization and development state of the three lake ecosystems the total emergy and the emergy density values resulted higher for the laska lake compared to the other investigated lakes table 5 fig 4 shows the contribution of the emergy inputs driving the development of the lake ecosystems the highest emergy investment for the generation of natural capital stocks resulted in the case of the eutrophic laska lake mainly due to the high convergence of nitrogen and phosphorus flows contributing for 70 and 24 to the total emergy value the high share of the nitrogen influx in the laska lake is mainly due to the large amount of wastewater deriving from a nearby large salmon farm instead the highest emergy input contributing to natural capital formation in the czarne and zmarle lakes was the chemical potential energy in the rain flow the eco exergy method allowed for the assessment of the development state the information content and the complexity of the three investigated lakes the highest value of total eco exergy and eco exergy density resulted for the laska lake table 7 these outcomes are mainly due to the high biomass value of macrophytes and aquatic birds characterizing the laska lake and their related high ß value reflecting the evolutionary history of organisms that acquired key adaptations for successful colonization macrophytes also showed the highest eco exergy value in both the czarne and zmarle lakes followed by the zooplankton fig 5 shows the contribution of the different taxonomic groups to the eco exergy value of natural capital overall the obtained results are consistent with the different trophism oligotrophic mesotrophic eutrophic of the investigated lakes highlighting how external driving forces are capable to orient the development and complexity of lake ecosystems furthermore the eco exergy emergy ratio was used to assess the lakes efficiency in transforming natural inputs flows into ecosystem components the eco exergy emergy ratio was higher for the zmarle lake compared to czarne and laska lakes fig 6 the ratio resulted similar for czarne and zmarle lakes that are only supported by natural input flows compared to the laska lake which receives human driven input flows due to nearby aquaculture activities therefore despite the highest eco exergy value of natural capital calculated for the laska lake the results highlighted the better efficiency of the zmarle lake in maintaining and developing ecosystem structures and organization in fact the large amount of nutrients coming from the nearby salmon farm outweighed the carrying capacity of the laska lake resulting in a lower efficiency of the ecosystem indeed the excess of biomass generated in the laska lake does not flow into the food chain enhancing natural capital stocks these outcomes are also in line with the eco exergy emergy ratio calculated by bastianoni 2002 highlighting that natural lakes are characterized by higher eco exergy emergy ratio compared to lakes affected by human activities finally to compare the results of the study with a conventional ecological indicator a biomass based shannon diversity index was calculated fig 6 shows that the values of the eco exergy emergy ratio are in line with the calculated biomass based shannon diversity index fig 7 the highest diversity resulted in the case of the zmarle lake showing a positive correlation between the lake ecosystems efficiency and their capability of building biodiversity therefore the results of this study highlight that undisturbed lake ecosystems show a higher efficiency in transforming natural inputs into biomass stocks and biodiversity that decreases when anthropogenic stress factors increase the eco exergy and emergy indicators integrated with the biomass based shannon diversity index can be useful to inform local managers and policy makers on the importance of monitoring and managing human activities and related environmental impacts in order to preserve natural capital stocks in lake ecosystems 5 concluding remarks in this study the integration of the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods resulted a promising approach to explore lake ecosystems adopting a holistic and ecosystem perspective the complementarity of the methodologies allowed a comprehensive assessment of natural capital value of three lake ecosystems with a different trophism capturing both the work of nature for generating biomass stocks as well as their structure functioning and complexity the emergy and eco exergy density values resulted higher for the eutrophic lake receiving human driven input flows due to nearby aquaculture activities nonetheless the eco exergy emergy ratio calculated to assess the efficiency of the lake ecosystems in transforming natural and human inputs into biomass stocks showed that the undisturbed lakes are characterized by higher values in addition the biomass based shannon diversity index calculated for the three investigated lakes highlighted the linkage between ecosystems efficiency and biodiversity a future development of this study could focus on the assessment of ecosystem services flows generated by the investigated lake ecosystems to further evaluate how their health state affects the capability of providing benefits for human well being in conclusion integrated assessments adopting an ecosystem and holistic perspective can result in a promising approach to investigate lake ecosystems worldwide providing useful scientific information to policy makers committed to ensure the sustainable management of surface water ecosystems credit authorship

vegetation is also characterized by the presence of willows alders and birches czarne is an oligotrophic and polymictic lake characterized by lobelia colonies which are recorded till a depth of 5 m the average depth is 3 85 m with a maximum depth at 7 3 m barañczuk and borowiak 2010 zmarle is a young lake without drainage with a surface area of 30 ha due to its water mixing dynamic it is classified as a dimictic lake while in terms of trophism it is classified as a mesotrophic lake the water body is surrounded by a dense pine forest while its shoreline is occupied by alders and birches the shallow water is mostly covered by reeds the average depth is 9 3 m with the deepest point at 19 4 m barañczuk and borowiak 2010 laska is a mature lake belonging to the zubrzyca river basin and covering an area of 70 ha in 1997 laska was proclaimed a protected reserve being made up of a rich vegetation composed by rushes and sedges numerous breeding sites of waterfowl and marsh birds the water drainage is allowed by the zbryzca river that enters in the east side and gets out in the west side the littoral zone is densely covered by reeds with a narrow strip of alders and birches pine forests mostly surround the water body even though pastures and wetland occur in the eastern side laska is a polymictic lake characterized by complete mixing of water several times per year in terms of trophism it is classified as a eutrophic lake the nutrient input flow is also raised by a large salmon farm located close to the water body the average depth of the lake is 1 5 m and the deepest point is 3 6 m barañczuk and borowiak 2010 the driving forces converging to the investigated lake ecosystems are summarized in table 1 while table 2 shows the main features of the three lakes 2 2 methods 2 2 1 the emergy accounting method emergy is an environmental accounting method useful to measure the cumulative environmental support for generating a good or service odum 1988 1996 specifically emergy is defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly required to make a given product to support a given flow or service franzese et al 2020 odum 1996 the emergy method takes into account for free environmental inputs e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flow human driven material and energy flows and the indirect environmental support embodied in human labor and services the systems diagram in fig 3 shows the main driving forces supporting the functioning of the three investigated lakes using the energy systems language odum 1996 the systems diagram highlights the main external driving forces supporting the generation of natural capital stocks in the case of laska lake the input on nutrients coming from a major nearby salmon farm was also accounted for in addition the systems diagram shows the main components producers consumers and storages of the lake ecosystems and the interactions among them according to the emergy theory inputs are accounted for through a common unit of measure the solar equivalent joule sej odum 1996 the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 the uev reflects the direct and indirect environmental support for generating one unit of product or service the higher the uev the higher the environmental cost brown and ulgiati 1997 mass energy labour and money input flows converging to the investigated system are converted into emergy units by using appropriate uevs and then summed to compute the total emergy supporting the system in this study the emergy accounting method was used for assessing the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the three investigated forest lakes considering a formation time of 3 years the maximum value among the turnover time of the different biomass groups 3 years was chosen considering that all groups are co products of the total emergy invested therefore in this study the driving forces converging for the formation of biotic natural capital stocks were multiplied by 3 years that is the average turnover time of the higher trophic level aquatic birds while the assessment of the abiotic natural capital stocks was out of the scope of the present investigation the emergy accounting was performed through the following main steps 1 identification of the spatial and temporal boundaries of the investigated lake ecosystems 2 inventory of mass and energy flows supporting natural capital stocks formation in the lake ecosystems 3 conversion of input flows into emergy units by using appropriate uevs 4 calculation of the total emergy supporting natural capital stocks formation in the lake ecosystems the uevs used in this study table 3 were updated to the 1 20 1025 sej yr 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown et al 2016a 2016b 2 2 2 the eco exergy accounting method the eco exergy accounting method aims at quantifying the available energy of all living biotic components in an ecosystem compared to the non living state i e the detritus in particular the eco exergy method accounts for the chemical energy in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in living organisms measuring the organization and development stage of an ecosystem jørgensen and mejer 1979 broadly eco exergy allows to account the distance from thermodynamic equilibrium as a measure of the complexity of an ecosystem fath et al 2004 marchi et al 2012 the eco exergy value for living organisms is calculated according to the following equation eco exergy ß b f where ß is a weighting factor expressing the information content of the organism s genes b is the organism s biomass in grams and f is the value of work energy per unit of biomass the value of f may slightly change among different taxonomic groups the higher is the fat content the higher is the value the average value of 18 7 kj g was used in this study according to jørgensen 2015 the total eco exergy of an ecosystem is computed as the sum of the eco exergy values calculated for all the organisms living in that ecosystem in this study the eco exergy method was used to quantify natural capital value of the three investigated lakes in terms of chemical energy stored in organic matter and genetic information embodied in biomass stocks ash free dry weights afdw per unit area of the different taxonomic groups embedded into the three lakes were multiplied by the relative ß values table 4 the resulting values were then summed to calculate the total eco exergy value of each investigated lake ecosystem 2 2 3 the eco exergy emergy ratio the relation between eco exergy and emergy has been much debated over time it was stated that coupling emergy and eco exergy accounting is complementary and non competitive bastianoni et al 2007 sciubba and ulgiati 2005 the complementarity is due to the different purpose of the two accounting approaches emergy accounts for the cumulative work of nature performed over time while eco exergy focuses on the present state of a system measuring the level of organization and the information content amaral et al 2016 in the present study the eco exergy emergy ratio was calculated to assess the ability of lake ecosystems in generating biomass stocks per unit of invested emergy bastianoni 2002 lu et al 2015 3 results in this study matter and energy supporting the generation of autotrophic and heterotrophic stocks in the investigated forest lakes czarne zmarle and laska were assessed by using the emergy accounting method in particular natural flows solar radiation rain wind geothermal flows and nutrient flows n p supporting the formation of natural capital stocks were accounted for in the case of laska lake the nitrogen input coming from the nearby zubrzyca river which influxes into the lake was also taken into account table 5 shows the emergy value of natural and nutrient flows supporting the three investigated lake ecosystems the total emergy values and the emergy per unit area i e the emergy density the total emergy is an extensive measure depending on the area of the lake while the emergy density is an intensive indicator allowing the comparison among lakes despite their different extent the laska lake showed the highest emergy density 4 36 1012 sej m 2 and total emergy value 3 07 1018 sej while the zmarle lake showed the lowest emergy density value 2 90 1011 sej m 2 table 6 shows the main autotrophic and heterotrophic groups embedded into the three lake ecosystems together with the relative biomass density calculated by using local data gathered through field sampling activities and expressed as ash free dry weight afdw per unit area flowering plants and aquatic birds in the laska lake were the groups with the highest biomass value 6 59 1010 mg m 2 and 2 39 1010 mg m 2 respectively the biomass values represented the basic information for the implementation of the eco exergy accounting table 7 shows the eco exergy value of the main taxonomic groups the total eco exergy and the eco exergy density the laska lake showed the highest values of total eco exergy 9 71 1011 kj and eco exergy density 1 38 106 kj m 2 the lowest value of eco exergy density was calculated for zmarle lake while the lowest total eco exergy resulted for czarne lake finally the eco exergy emergy ratio was calculated as a measure of efficiency of the three investigated lakes table 8 the highest value of the eco exergy emergy ratio resulted for the zmarle lake 1 43 10 3 j sej and czarne 1 37 10 3 j sej while the lowest value was obtained for the laska lake 0 32 10 3 j sej 4 discussion in this study the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods were jointly used to assess the value of natural capital stocks of the investigated lake ecosystems adopting two different perspectives the cumulative work of nature invested for natural capital formation and the organization and development state of the three lake ecosystems the total emergy and the emergy density values resulted higher for the laska lake compared to the other investigated lakes table 5 fig 4 shows the contribution of the emergy inputs driving the development of the lake ecosystems the highest emergy investment for the generation of natural capital stocks resulted in the case of the eutrophic laska lake mainly due to the high convergence of nitrogen and phosphorus flows contributing for 70 and 24 to the total emergy value the high share of the nitrogen influx in the laska lake is mainly due to the large amount of wastewater deriving from a nearby large salmon farm instead the highest emergy input contributing to natural capital formation in the czarne and zmarle lakes was the chemical potential energy in the rain flow the eco exergy method allowed for the assessment of the development state the information content and the complexity of the three investigated lakes the highest value of total eco exergy and eco exergy density resulted for the laska lake table 7 these outcomes are mainly due to the high biomass value of macrophytes and aquatic birds characterizing the laska lake and their related high ß value reflecting the evolutionary history of organisms that acquired key adaptations for successful colonization macrophytes also showed the highest eco exergy value in both the czarne and zmarle lakes followed by the zooplankton fig 5 shows the contribution of the different taxonomic groups to the eco exergy value of natural capital overall the obtained results are consistent with the different trophism oligotrophic mesotrophic eutrophic of the investigated lakes highlighting how external driving forces are capable to orient the development and complexity of lake ecosystems furthermore the eco exergy emergy ratio was used to assess the lakes efficiency in transforming natural inputs flows into ecosystem components the eco exergy emergy ratio was higher for the zmarle lake compared to czarne and laska lakes fig 6 the ratio resulted similar for czarne and zmarle lakes that are only supported by natural input flows compared to the laska lake which receives human driven input flows due to nearby aquaculture activities therefore despite the highest eco exergy value of natural capital calculated for the laska lake the results highlighted the better efficiency of the zmarle lake in maintaining and developing ecosystem structures and organization in fact the large amount of nutrients coming from the nearby salmon farm outweighed the carrying capacity of the laska lake resulting in a lower efficiency of the ecosystem indeed the excess of biomass generated in the laska lake does not flow into the food chain enhancing natural capital stocks these outcomes are also in line with the eco exergy emergy ratio calculated by bastianoni 2002 highlighting that natural lakes are characterized by higher eco exergy emergy ratio compared to lakes affected by human activities finally to compare the results of the study with a conventional ecological indicator a biomass based shannon diversity index was calculated fig 6 shows that the values of the eco exergy emergy ratio are in line with the calculated biomass based shannon diversity index fig 7 the highest diversity resulted in the case of the zmarle lake showing a positive correlation between the lake ecosystems efficiency and their capability of building biodiversity therefore the results of this study highlight that undisturbed lake ecosystems show a higher efficiency in transforming natural inputs into biomass stocks and biodiversity that decreases when anthropogenic stress factors increase the eco exergy and emergy indicators integrated with the biomass based shannon diversity index can be useful to inform local managers and policy makers on the importance of monitoring and managing human activities and related environmental impacts in order to preserve natural capital stocks in lake ecosystems 5 concluding remarks in this study the integration of the emergy and eco exergy accounting methods resulted a promising approach to explore lake ecosystems adopting a holistic and ecosystem perspective the complementarity of the methodologies allowed a comprehensive assessment of natural capital value of three lake ecosystems with a different trophism capturing both the work of nature for generating biomass stocks as well as their structure functioning and complexity the emergy and eco exergy density values resulted higher for the eutrophic lake receiving human driven input flows due to nearby aquaculture activities nonetheless the eco exergy emergy ratio calculated to assess the efficiency of the lake ecosystems in transforming natural and human inputs into biomass stocks showed that the undisturbed lakes are characterized by higher values in addition the biomass based shannon diversity index calculated for the three investigated lakes highlighted the linkage between ecosystems efficiency and biodiversity a future development of this study could focus on the assessment of ecosystem services flows generated by the investigated lake ecosystems to further evaluate how their health state affects the capability of providing benefits for human well being in conclusion integrated assessments adopting an ecosystem and holistic perspective can result in a promising approach to investigate lake ecosystems worldwide providing useful scientific information to policy makers committed to ensure the sustainable management of surface water ecosystems credit authorship

24181,dealing with high temperatures during the anthesis stage is an important factor that can affect summer maize here the possibility of heat stress injury hsi in the summer maize grown fields of golestan province was investigated a multi criteria weighted overlay procedure was used to determine the suitability of arable land for maize cultivation using the ceres maize model and long term meteorological data the map of the days with tmax 35 c from three days before to seven days after anthesis was provided the results showed that the irrigated corn fields in the study area have suitable degrees for corn cultivation and different conditions in the field of hsi experience around pollination although most of the fields were located in highly suitable areas probable hsi as described by pdt35 affected the final suitability also more reliable sowing dates were introduced the results revealed that on 18th of june maize could be sown at all suitable areas except in some arable lands of kalaleh where the pdt35 was more than 40 the results showed that hsi should also be considered around the pollination stage to obtain reliable results from land suitability keywords abiotic stress maize disorders planting date geostatistical interpolation extreme temperature data availability data will be made available on request once the manuscript is accepted the data will be archived in the repository of the ferdowsi university of mashhad and a link will be made available 1 introduction the emergence of potential stresses in agro ecosystems makes it difficult for farmers to maintain and develop some crops as a result the area under cultivation of these crops is gradually reduced however this crop may have economic justification as well as a good place in regional cultivation patterns grain maize is one of the plants in which seed formation is not done properly due to possible exposure to high temperatures in the anthesis stage and its area under cultivation has been severely reduced in golestan province northern iran pourhadian et al 2019 farmers knowledge of the potential for critical temperatures in the seed stage can help them decide whether to incorporate the plant into the cultivation pattern or not exposure to extreme temperatures in a particular stage of a plant s development especially cereals could adversely affect its growth development or productivity watkins et al 2021 asfaw et al 2019 the stress response depends on the sensitivity of the growth stage during which it occurs chakraborty et al 2017 for instance of all the phenological stages of maize anthesis shows the highest sensitivity to heat stress wang et al 2020 and 2021 as stated by zhang et al 2019 maize is more sensitive to hsi compared to other main cereals e g wheat and rice in another study zhang et al 2020 stated that maize is extremely vulnerable to critical high temperatures during different phenological phases including tasseling flowering pollination and kernel filling the high temperature thresholds for maize have been reported as 39 2 c 0 6 c from emergence to the end of tassel initiation 37 3 c 1 3 c in anthesis and 36 0 c 1 4 c in the grain filling period sanchez et al 2014 wei et al 2020 and shiferaw et al 2011 noticed that when maize is exposed to temperatures above 35 c its growth and development are affected and the pollen viability decreases dupuis and dumas 1990 also the results of simulation models show that by increasing the earth s temperature by one degrees celsius corn yield decreases by 10 dong et al 2021 the occurrence of high temperatures in conditions where the plant is in the reproductive growth stage can lead to reduced yield by reducing the number of grains wu et al 2019 and kernel weight niu et al 2021 jung et al 2020 for instance zhang et al 2021 mentioned that for each increase of one degrees celsius above 30 celsius the yield of maize decreased by 1 1 7 in another study lobell et al 2011 also showed that for every degree of the day above 30 c the yield of african corn grain was reduced by 1 7 zhou et al 2017 stated that at early sowing dates when the average temperature at the grain filling stage reached more than 32 2 c the grain growth rate and ultimately the grain weight reduced the effects of high temperatures on corn yield have also been considered in recent studies e g rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 luo et al 2014 wei et al 2020 showed that an increase of one degrees celsius above 35 c can lead to a 1 34 4 29 reduction in yield when the temperature reaches 35 c pollen survival is reduced and cell division is impaired commuri and jones 2001 dupuis and dumas 1990 li et al 2017 showed that the process based modeling models could simulate soil temperature moisture and respiration for corn and winter wheat under both monoculture and rotation in humid southwestern ontario canada but crop parameter adjustments are required to simulate soybean therefore it can help to interpret experimental results and gain more insights into agroecosystems heat stress damage is very severe in the crucial stages of plant development especially the reproductive growth stage it leads to the production of sterile pollen grains or pollen viability dordel et al 2011 de storme and geelen 2014 lizaso et al 2018 an asynchronous flowering period with high temperatures can help reduce the adverse effects of heat stress especially during climate change rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 under high temperatures insufficient pollination and fertilization occur wu et al 2019 young et al 2004 leading to kernel abortion following a reduction in production per unit area watkins et al 2021 reported that moderate heat stress over a short time during a very sensitive phase tetrad stage can severely affect the related metabolic pathways and ultimately can lead to the production of defective pollen followed by a sharp decline in corn yield they also reported that infertility due to reduced starch content reduced enzymatic activity and reduced pollen germination they reported that sterility reduced enzymatic activity and pollen germination due to reduced starch content heat stress is a detrimental event that has influenced the extension of grain maize fields in golestan province during the last decade the summer temperature has become warmer and yields for summer planting dates have declined 4700 kg ha 1 decreasing grain number per ear is a common consequence of heat stress that reduces the yield and some essential yield components such as the ears and number of grains per ear noor et al 2019 improper planting date could affect the time of occurrence of plant phenological stages and as a result the availability of nutrients and water as well as the possibility of the plant being exposed to high temperature stress mokhtarpour et al 2010 accelerating development rate and shortened vegetative and reproductive phases could restrict terminate or harm plant growth and development sindelar et al 2010 lizasoa et al 2018 by affecting the grain filling period and rate wilhelm et al 1999 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2006 noted that selecting planting dates must ensure that the thermal environment is favorable for crop establishment and completion of its life cycle without reducing the yield monjardino et al 2005 exposed maize clusters to heat stress conditions for at 35 c for five days after pollination respectively they observed a 20 and a 48 reduction in kernel weight for two and four days of heat stress respectively higher temperatures also shortened the grain filling period zhou et al 2017 norwood and currie 1996 concluded that there was no difference in incremental yield production between late and mid may planting and that the lowest yield was related to mid may planting sun et al 2016 reported that summer corn yield increased in the north china plain by keeping planting dates in a specific range after june in a study on maize in northern nigeria adnan et al 2017 reported that delay in planting date reduced yields by 39 2 and 74 4 in very early and early maturing cultivars respectively previous studies on the effects of high critical temperature on corn grain regulation have focused mainly on plot based field experiments which have yet to be extensively and regionally studied therefore this study was conducted to combine modeling approaches of crop simulation and remote sensing to determine the suitability of arable lands for summer corn cultivation and the sensitivity of those areas with the possibility of corn cultivation to high temperatures in golestan province iran awareness of the possibility of temperature stress at the time of anthesis of maize as one of the most susceptible phenological phases to temperature stress can be effective in deciding whether to include this crop in cropping patterns or to optimize crop management e g by choosing the correct planting date therefore many suitable lands without considering critical temperatures may be shifted to lower suitability levels by considering the possibility of high temperatures occurring shortly before or after anthesis in these circumstances it is advisable to optimally select the recommended planting date to prevent the crop from being exposed to high temperature stress at phonologically sensitive stages or to remove a specific crop from the cultivation patterns this study aimed to investigate the possibility of hsi in arable lands and real maize grown fields of golestan province using a modeling approach and a geospatial information system gis hsi happens due to high temperatures from a few days before to a few days after the maize anthesis stage 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area was golestan province located in the north of iran near the caspian sea 36 44 n to 38 05 n 51 53 e to 56 14 e fig 1 regarding the de martonne classification method this province has a variable climate including the semi arid humid and semi humid regions kamkar et al 2021 overall golestan has a moderate and humid climate with moderately cool springs and warm and humid summers mokhtarpour 2011 golestan province is in fourth place among 33 of iran s provinces in terms of production of various agricultural products with more than four million tons of farm products maize rice and soybean are the major summer crops in this province kamkar et al 2021 which are usually included after wheat canola and barely as autumn crops in rotations one of the reasons that the area under grain maize cultivation has sharply decreased in recent years is that the maize is exposed to high temperatures during the anthesis stages in many places and as a result grain size is too small for production to be profitable for this reason most farmers have tended to grow forage maize the golestan province s weather allows maize to be planted for extended periods from early april until mid july maize in golestan province is usually cultivated in mid april as the main crop but it is also common in early july and after the wheat harvest as a summer crop in this study all irrigated arable lands of golestan province 323 000 ha 1 are identified fig 1 to prepare a general map of land suitability for corn cultivation and all lands under current cultivation including cereals and forage corn to determine their sensitivity to high temperatures 2 2 map of maize fields in this study for the extraction of lu lc landsat 8 datasets of 2014 early april to mid november were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs portal http earthexplorer usgs gov the details of the landsat imagery used are shown in table 1 the images were acquired with less than 10 cloud cover in the growing stage of the maize as a summer crop in the rotations of golestan province a supervised classification method using 48 ground control points recorded using 550 garmin gps device taken from both grain and forage maize fields was used to detect the maize grown areas given that the climatic and ecological requirements for grain and forage maize growth are almost the same all the maize grown fields irrespective of grain or forage maize were detected and used in the suitability analysis the map on utm coordinates is based on wgs84 data using erdas imagine v 11 the accuracy of extracted maize fields was assessed using two standard performance metrics i e kappa index and overall accuracy k taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2020 k shows the probability that a class is classified by chance kappa values of 0 and 1 mean a poor and almost perfect agreement between the two maps respectively mokarram et al 2010 the overall accuracy is calculated as the ratio of all appropriately classified land classes to all data used to create maps higher overall accuracy means better performance of the models involved taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2020 kappa and overall accuracy coefficients for the finalized layer were 0 94 and 0 81 respectively the extracted maize fields layer was used to clip vectors or mask raster layers 2 3 land suitability 2 3 1 providing the base layers for generating maize land suitability map in the study area using 3 d topographic maps 1 25 000 scale a 90 m digital elevation model dem was created then elevation slope and aspect raster layers were extracted by dem using spatial analyst tools and were reclassified in arcgis 10 4 the layers were reclassified based on the least reported general requirements e g some climatic topographic and soil related variables of maize growth table 2 temperature relative humidity and precipitation data were provided from 30 meteorological stations located in the study extent and the neighboring provinces including semnan mazandaran and northern khorasan provinces with five to over 30 years of historical data fig 2 the universal kriging geostatistical interpolation procedure involved preparing maps related to climatic variables for the study area table 2 the universal kriging interpolation method is a type of geostatistical interpolation method xiao et al 2016 that divides the random function into two different components including the residual random function with an integrated linear combination of definite functions and a smooth non uniform process gundogdu and guney 2007 ganesh prasad and sushma 2016 the soil electrical conductivity layer ec was created by the inverse distance weighted method using 330 sampled points data obtained from golestan agricultural and natural research center and samples obtained from other projects by the author data not shown for this purpose 200 samples were used to make the layer and the remaining 130 points were used to evaluate the accuracy of the produced layer 2 3 2 weighting and overlaying layers for weighting of each layer analytical hierarchy process ahp was involved saaty and alexander 1989 this procedure estimates the relative weight of factors through pair wise comparisons each of the experts i e 30 experts in the field of maize production compared the relative importance of each pair of components using a predesigned questionnaire the weighted overlay function was used to apply ahp coefficients on the reclassified layers in arcgis v 10 4 esri 2014 the reliability of the filled questionnaires was checked by calculating the inconsistency coefficient for ahp analysis then the rasters of involved climatic factors soil ec and topographic related layers i e elevation slope and aspect were reclassified afterward to generate a land suitability map lsm the weighted overlay procedure overlaid reclassified layers to assess the suitability of arable land for corn production in five categories indicated by s1 to s5 from very suitable s1 to unsuitable s5 2 4 the ceres maize models calibration and evaluation the ceres maize model was used to determine anthesis time in involved meteorological stations for calibration and evaluation of the model additional data from other works in 2007 2008 2012 and 2013 were employed the first experiment investigated the effects of two planting dates 3rd of april and 18th of april and two planting densities during 2007 and 2008 a factorial experiment in a completely randomized block design with four replications by two sowing dates 3rd of april and 18th of april and two sowing densities 4 5 and 6 5 plants m 2 were considered these experiments were conducted for two years at the agricultural research station of gorgan the experimental plots were planted in four lines with a length of twelve meters and a row spacing of seventy five centimeters during 2012 and 2013 three different sowing dates i e 22nd of june 6th of july and 21st of july and four irrigation treatments of the total available soil water taw the irrigation treatments were 40 60 and 80 maximum allowable drainage of soil and control water no irrigation irrigation treatments were applied from the third leaf growth stage onward the ceres maize model was calibrated using optimal irrigation and stress free treatment in 2012 22nd of june 6th of july and 21st of july sowing dates and two treatments of the first experiment in 2007 3rd of april and 18th of april sowing dates the model was evaluated using 2008 2012 and 2013 experimental data to evaluate the model root means square error rmse determination of the coefficient r2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse were obtained by comparing the evaluated data with the observed data data not shown to assess model accuracy grain yield and dry matter production were measured up to physiological maturity and harvest time as well as the highest leaf area index and yield components in which characteristics were implicated after determining the anthesis time by the evaluated model the percentage of those days by tmax 35 c from three days before to seven days after anthesis occurrence hereafter pdt35 was also quantified this model has been tested over a wide range of environments for different purposes all over the world and used to estimate maize growth and yield at different planting dates saseendran et al 2005 binder et al 2008 mokhtarpour 2011 adnan et al 2017 rugira et al 2021 rugira et al 2021 reported that ceres maize had predicted plant phenological development and yield with high accuracy in northern china adnan et al 2017 also used this model to optimize maize production at different planting dates in sudan savanna they reported that the model predictions about the results obtained for grain yield and biomass production in the two cultivars studied were well done rmse 5 high d index 0 8 and r2 0 9 for the calibration trials to calculate the pdt35 at each planting date the days with tmax 35 c were counted from three days before to seven days after anthesis occurrence as an output of ceres maize model the pdt35 values for each planting date in all meteorological stations were interpolated to convert them to a raster layers classified by the reclassification method syn jenks were presented to divide the study area into different areas with different sensitivities to heat stress which often occurs when the product experiences higher temperatures a flowchart was designed and it summarized the work fig 3 in this region the average temperature for the corn growing season is in the desired range 3 results 3 1 climatic and topographic state of the studied region for maize cultivation the results using the mean of long term climate data as reclassified raster layers for the growing season revealed that maize did not experience restricting temperatures throughout the growing season in the study area minimum average and maximum temperature data based on the mean of long term data indicated that the average temperature for the growing season of summer maize was in the desired range the average maximum temperature varied from 26 to 29 1⁰c fig 4 mean air relative humidity slope and rainfall were also considered in the present study the humidity map showed that the highest and the lowest relative humidity percent were seen in the western near the caspian sea and the eastern parts of the study area respectively fig 4 in contrast the areas with a slope of more than 6 were located in farming areas of kalaleh county also the amount of rainfall decreased from south to north and the maximum value 400 430 mm was related to the south of kalaleh county and the agricultural lands of kordkuy county fig 4 3 2 land suitability assessment for maize cultivation based on the ahp method with a consistency ratio of 0 02 the maximum temperature with the highest relative weight 0 25 was determined as the most effective factor among climatic factors rain and minimum temperature with a relative weight of 0 15 and 0 1 fell in the following ranks affecting the suitability of maize cultivation all the provided layers including minimum temperature maximum temperature average temperature rainfall elevation slope aspect and ec were overlaid to provide a suitability map for maize cultivation the created map showed that the lands were categorized into five groups from very suitable s1 to unsuitable s5 most of the arable lands in the west of the study region were located in a highly suitable s1 class which covered 138 000 ha 1 43 of the total lands fig 5 slope ec ds m 1 minimum temperature maximum temperature and average temperatures c in the study area were in the optimal range table 2 fig 4 suitable areas s2 with an area of 94 000 ha 1 29 of total lands were located in the east of golestan province where the maximum temperature occurred fig 5 these results show that the maize cultivation could be satisfactory in the east oriented fields because the average temperature during the maize growing season is in an optimal range 20 30⁰c 3 3 model calibration and output results the genetic coefficients of maize for consideration in the model structure obtained using the above complementary experiments are presented in table 3 after determining the initial values of genetic coefficients in the field to adjust the best genetic coefficients the iterative sensitivity analysis was performed the results of the ceres maize evaluation showed that the simulation of days to anthesis both for averaged and plot based values in 2008 2012 and 2013 at different planting dates was reliable fig 6 therefore the obtained anthesis dates for each sowing date were considered to determine the pdt35 with a delay in planting date days to anthesis decreased because of high temperatures fig 6 3 4 mapping probability and intensity of hsi by extreme temperatures around anthesis at different sowing dates in the total arable lands of kordkuy county and some areas of gorgan country the pdt35 was at most 40 at all planting dates this means that in all these arable lands the temperature did not exceed 35 c for more than four days the highest pdt35 was related to the arable lands of gonbad county from 3rd of july until 18th of july fig 7 the results showed that pdt35 increased in the agricultural lands of gonbad city when planting was delayed until june up to 89 9 while it gradually decreased on july due to the decrease in daily temperature table 4 the results reveal that the number of days with tmax 35 c around the anthesis stage hereafter ndt35 on the 7th of april and 19th of april sowing dates was 2 days fig 7 and table 4 in addition the suitable areas on the 7th of april and 19th of april sowing dates with pdt35 20 covered 11 5 of irrigated lands table 4 this class was located in the farming areas of bandar turkaman kordkuy and bandar gaz counties located near the caspian sea the highest pdt35 was related to the 3rd of june and 18th of june sowing dates fig 7 and table 4 but it decreased at the two late sowing dates i e 18th of june and 3rd of july on 18th of june maize can be sown in all suitable areas except in some arable lands of kalaleh where the pdt35 was more than 40 fig 7 and table 4 on the 3rd of july sowing date the highest pdt35 was about 22 this revealed that maize could be planted after the 3rd of june to avoid dealing with days with the risk of hsi in the anthesis stage this was especially the case in the agricultural lands of gonbad and kalaleh counties fig 7 and table 4 the results show that the lowest pdt35 in the arable lands of gonbad county usually occurred from the 3rd of july sowing date onward to avoid dealing with the days with tmax 35 c around the anthesis stage in this area the sowing of the maize from 3rd of july onwards is recommended because of the lowest pdt35 3rd of july onwards was recommended as the proper sowing date for the arable lands of gonbad county to avoid dealing with days with tmax 35 c around the anthesis stage 3 5 land suitability of real maize grown fields overlaying the detected map using satellite imagery and supervised classification method and the map of land suitability showed that the area of real maize grown fields was 15 600 ha 1 most maize grown fields 10 085 ha 1 were located in the very suitable s1 class fig 8 this reveals that most farmers also have selected suitable sowing dates empirically to avoid kernel abortion disorder kad it should also be noted that the selection of areas under corn cultivation by farmers in the study area is not based solely on the prevention of kad and various other factors also affect it farmers have realized through years of trial and error that the best yield is obtained in these lands also the results showed that the maize grown fields in gonbad and aq qala counties are in the weaker suitability classes compared to other maize grown fields 4 discussion 4 1 effect of sowing date and highly extreme temperatures on kernel abortion disorder kad considering extreme temperatures the maize growing season usually starts in early april and continues until mid november in golestan province the average daily temperature from early april 1 date of early planting to harvest time in mid to late october varied between 10 and 34 c respectively in their experiments in golestan province mokhtarpour 2011 and feyzbakhsh et al 2011 mentioned that with a delay in planting date yield and yield components of maize decreased because of high temperatures until june still they decreased after june because of low temperatures as wang et al 2022 reported climate change is breaking global food supplies the environmental climate model is capable of simulating crop productivity for hundreds of years under various climate scenarios environmental conditions and management systems and is often used to study the impact of climate change on agriculture according to their findings the accuracy of the model is greatly improved by determining the genetic parameters of crops modifying the parameters according to the weather land use and technical conditions and by establishing the local and even global model parameter database the uncertainty of model parameters input data and model structure is analyzed to improve the stability of the model moeinirad et al 2011 showed that corn should be cultivated by the end of the third decade of june to achieve the desired yield in golestan province also adnan et al 2017 stated that in cultivars with different growing periods planting dates had different effects on the yield as the highest grain yields were obtained in late july in extra early and in mid june for early maize cultivars the yield also declined in mid august in the study of different maize hybrids in pakistan ali et al 2020 also found that out of the three planting dates 25th of february 6th of march and 14th of march the first planting date resulted in the best corn performance rugira et al 2021 also stated that in different irrigation states corn yields increased from about 8 264 tons ha 1 to about 10 tons ha 1 by changing the planting date from april 20 to may 20 in northern china while delay in planting date until may 25 caused a significant reduction in the yields they stated that the optimal planting date is site specific and can vary in different regions depending on the prevailing climatic conditions according to the results the pdt35 varied in different sowing dates this reveals that in each county maize could be planted at different sowing dates for example in the arable lands of bandar gaz and some areas in the arable lands of kordkuy county maize could be planted at all planting dates but at late planting dates 3rd of july and 18th of july the relative humidity data are not shown and therefore kernel abortion disorder kad increase as a result and the quality of grain decreases which means that farmers should be concerned also the results showed that maize could be planted in gonbad and kalaleh counties after 3rd of june to avoid the risk of kad fig 6 kad is one of the concerns which emerges when temperatures more than 35 c rise around the anthesis stage this is a challenge when the sowing date is far from optimal more days with tmax 35 c during the anthesis stage is the main reason for reducing kernel per ear schoper et al 1987a 1987b noor et al 2019 and the grain yield wei et al 2020 yun et al 2017 stated that in warm days the tassel might develop and shed pollen before completion of the ear and silk formation resulting in poor or incomplete pollination as a result the silk grows slowly and cannot receive pollen reducing the number of cores in each ear corn production handbook 2007 other similar studies e g noor et al 2019 lizasoa et al 2018 have concluded that high temperatures can alter yield components reducing the maize yield several studies e g wei et al 2020 lizasoa et al 2018 found that high temperatures are lethal to maize pollen viability 4 2 land suitability assessment for the cultivation of grain maize without hsi the results showed that less than 14 6 47 200 ha of the total arable land is in the very poor category this area was located in the west of kalaleh county fig 5 with a high slope and soil ec was higher than the salinity tolerance threshold for maize table 2 and fig 4 maize is moderately sensitive to salt stress farooq et al 2015 at a salinity level of 5 9 ds m 1 yield reduction is up to 50 hall 2000 nevertheless jahromi et al 2010 have suggested higher threshold values around eight dsm 1 the results indicate that 138 000 ha 1 of available arable lands are very suitable for maize cultivation this reveals that maize cultivation areas both grain and forage maize could be developed in golestan province one of the reasons for the decrease in the area under grain maize cultivation in golestan province is the presence of soybeans and rice which have been considered by farmers due to its satisfactory economic benefits and guaranteed purchase in summer rotations unsuitable planting dates also lead to high temperatures around the anthesis stage tmax 35 c as a result the yield and quality of forage are reduced humidity is also one of the factors that influence kad the highest humidity was seen in the west of golestan province fig 4 in addition to reducing pollen survival high relative humidity reduces the intensity and quality of sunlight thereby reducing photosynthesis icrisat 2010 pacini 1990 these results indicate that the disorder can be more widespread in areas with high relative humidity and at the same time higher temperatures around anthesis other studies e g niu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 have reported the effects of temperature on the pollination success of plants and their grain set as well as the impact of relative humidity on the survival of pollen grains after release from the anther pacini 1990 5 conclusion heat stress around the anthesis stage is a challenge for farmers dealing with high temperatures at inappropriate sowing dates the failure of the crop to complete pollination could incommode the farmers just when they are waiting for a reasonable yield providing the probability maps to forecast probable adverse events pre season forecasting could help farmers and agricultural decision makers mainly to avoid dealing with unwanted events such as kad previous findings emphasize the effect of temperatures higher than 35 c when the maize is in the anthesis stage therefore the pdt35 was mapped spatially in this study using crop simulation modeling and gis then the reclassified map was used to determine high risk zones concerning probable hsi in the maize fields the results revealed that the irrigated lands of the study area had different degrees of suitability for maize cropping and different sensitivities to hsi around anthesis although the major parts of golestan province were located in suitable areas for maize cultivation based on average temperature topographic and soil related factors the days with tmax 35 c around anthesis and consequently kad were determined as the limiting factors affecting the final suitability of irrigated lands for reliable maize production the results also led to introducing more reliable and proper sowing dates which could be recommended to avoid kad the results showed that gis and crop modeling ceres maize could be considered as valuable tools to select arable lands for cost effective agriculture by considering various factors affecting agricultural ecosystems also the results confirmed that those maps are provided based on the average values of climatic factors in general and temperature in particular which cannot be a reliable source to decide whether or not a region is suitable for growing a specific crop in this study maximum temperature based on average long term data showed no limitation for maize cultivation while investigating the extreme temperatures around anthesis was followed by entirely different results therefore considering extreme events is seriously recommended for this kind of investigation cultivation of those lands that are generally suitable for maize cultivation and are at the same time in low risk classes due to the possibility of extreme heat makes farmers more interested in cultivating grain maize on the other hand maize silage including cobs increases the quality of silage fodder for livestock this study showed that guiding farmers to choose the appropriate sowing date can prevent the crop from being exposed to high temperatures during the critical anthesis phases according to new agricultural policies in iran rice cultivation is prohibited or restricted in many parts of the province due to excessive water consumption providing a suitable cultivation pattern with the presence of grain maize can be a good alternative for farmers in golestan province to determine more accurately the effect of critical temperatures on grain formation in summer grain maize conducting experiments with consecutive planting dates close to each other and in different geographical coordinates is recommended it is also necessary to update some data especially soil data to achieve more accurate results in determining land

24181,dealing with high temperatures during the anthesis stage is an important factor that can affect summer maize here the possibility of heat stress injury hsi in the summer maize grown fields of golestan province was investigated a multi criteria weighted overlay procedure was used to determine the suitability of arable land for maize cultivation using the ceres maize model and long term meteorological data the map of the days with tmax 35 c from three days before to seven days after anthesis was provided the results showed that the irrigated corn fields in the study area have suitable degrees for corn cultivation and different conditions in the field of hsi experience around pollination although most of the fields were located in highly suitable areas probable hsi as described by pdt35 affected the final suitability also more reliable sowing dates were introduced the results revealed that on 18th of june maize could be sown at all suitable areas except in some arable lands of kalaleh where the pdt35 was more than 40 the results showed that hsi should also be considered around the pollination stage to obtain reliable results from land suitability keywords abiotic stress maize disorders planting date geostatistical interpolation extreme temperature data availability data will be made available on request once the manuscript is accepted the data will be archived in the repository of the ferdowsi university of mashhad and a link will be made available 1 introduction the emergence of potential stresses in agro ecosystems makes it difficult for farmers to maintain and develop some crops as a result the area under cultivation of these crops is gradually reduced however this crop may have economic justification as well as a good place in regional cultivation patterns grain maize is one of the plants in which seed formation is not done properly due to possible exposure to high temperatures in the anthesis stage and its area under cultivation has been severely reduced in golestan province northern iran pourhadian et al 2019 farmers knowledge of the potential for critical temperatures in the seed stage can help them decide whether to incorporate the plant into the cultivation pattern or not exposure to extreme temperatures in a particular stage of a plant s development especially cereals could adversely affect its growth development or productivity watkins et al 2021 asfaw et al 2019 the stress response depends on the sensitivity of the growth stage during which it occurs chakraborty et al 2017 for instance of all the phenological stages of maize anthesis shows the highest sensitivity to heat stress wang et al 2020 and 2021 as stated by zhang et al 2019 maize is more sensitive to hsi compared to other main cereals e g wheat and rice in another study zhang et al 2020 stated that maize is extremely vulnerable to critical high temperatures during different phenological phases including tasseling flowering pollination and kernel filling the high temperature thresholds for maize have been reported as 39 2 c 0 6 c from emergence to the end of tassel initiation 37 3 c 1 3 c in anthesis and 36 0 c 1 4 c in the grain filling period sanchez et al 2014 wei et al 2020 and shiferaw et al 2011 noticed that when maize is exposed to temperatures above 35 c its growth and development are affected and the pollen viability decreases dupuis and dumas 1990 also the results of simulation models show that by increasing the earth s temperature by one degrees celsius corn yield decreases by 10 dong et al 2021 the occurrence of high temperatures in conditions where the plant is in the reproductive growth stage can lead to reduced yield by reducing the number of grains wu et al 2019 and kernel weight niu et al 2021 jung et al 2020 for instance zhang et al 2021 mentioned that for each increase of one degrees celsius above 30 celsius the yield of maize decreased by 1 1 7 in another study lobell et al 2011 also showed that for every degree of the day above 30 c the yield of african corn grain was reduced by 1 7 zhou et al 2017 stated that at early sowing dates when the average temperature at the grain filling stage reached more than 32 2 c the grain growth rate and ultimately the grain weight reduced the effects of high temperatures on corn yield have also been considered in recent studies e g rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 luo et al 2014 wei et al 2020 showed that an increase of one degrees celsius above 35 c can lead to a 1 34 4 29 reduction in yield when the temperature reaches 35 c pollen survival is reduced and cell division is impaired commuri and jones 2001 dupuis and dumas 1990 li et al 2017 showed that the process based modeling models could simulate soil temperature moisture and respiration for corn and winter wheat under both monoculture and rotation in humid southwestern ontario canada but crop parameter adjustments are required to simulate soybean therefore it can help to interpret experimental results and gain more insights into agroecosystems heat stress damage is very severe in the crucial stages of plant development especially the reproductive growth stage it leads to the production of sterile pollen grains or pollen viability dordel et al 2011 de storme and geelen 2014 lizaso et al 2018 an asynchronous flowering period with high temperatures can help reduce the adverse effects of heat stress especially during climate change rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 under high temperatures insufficient pollination and fertilization occur wu et al 2019 young et al 2004 leading to kernel abortion following a reduction in production per unit area watkins et al 2021 reported that moderate heat stress over a short time during a very sensitive phase tetrad stage can severely affect the related metabolic pathways and ultimately can lead to the production of defective pollen followed by a sharp decline in corn yield they also reported that infertility due to reduced starch content reduced enzymatic activity and reduced pollen germination they reported that sterility reduced enzymatic activity and pollen germination due to reduced starch content heat stress is a detrimental event that has influenced the extension of grain maize fields in golestan province during the last decade the summer temperature has become warmer and yields for summer planting dates have declined 4700 kg ha 1 decreasing grain number per ear is a common consequence of heat stress that reduces the yield and some essential yield components such as the ears and number of grains per ear noor et al 2019 improper planting date could affect the time of occurrence of plant phenological stages and as a result the availability of nutrients and water as well as the possibility of the plant being exposed to high temperature stress mokhtarpour et al 2010 accelerating development rate and shortened vegetative and reproductive phases could restrict terminate or harm plant growth and development sindelar et al 2010 lizasoa et al 2018 by affecting the grain filling period and rate wilhelm et al 1999 zhou et al 2017 huang et al 2006 noted that selecting planting dates must ensure that the thermal environment is favorable for crop establishment and completion of its life cycle without reducing the yield monjardino et al 2005 exposed maize clusters to heat stress conditions for at 35 c for five days after pollination respectively they observed a 20 and a 48 reduction in kernel weight for two and four days of heat stress respectively higher temperatures also shortened the grain filling period zhou et al 2017 norwood and currie 1996 concluded that there was no difference in incremental yield production between late and mid may planting and that the lowest yield was related to mid may planting sun et al 2016 reported that summer corn yield increased in the north china plain by keeping planting dates in a specific range after june in a study on maize in northern nigeria adnan et al 2017 reported that delay in planting date reduced yields by 39 2 and 74 4 in very early and early maturing cultivars respectively previous studies on the effects of high critical temperature on corn grain regulation have focused mainly on plot based field experiments which have yet to be extensively and regionally studied therefore this study was conducted to combine modeling approaches of crop simulation and remote sensing to determine the suitability of arable lands for summer corn cultivation and the sensitivity of those areas with the possibility of corn cultivation to high temperatures in golestan province iran awareness of the possibility of temperature stress at the time of anthesis of maize as one of the most susceptible phenological phases to temperature stress can be effective in deciding whether to include this crop in cropping patterns or to optimize crop management e g by choosing the correct planting date therefore many suitable lands without considering critical temperatures may be shifted to lower suitability levels by considering the possibility of high temperatures occurring shortly before or after anthesis in these circumstances it is advisable to optimally select the recommended planting date to prevent the crop from being exposed to high temperature stress at phonologically sensitive stages or to remove a specific crop from the cultivation patterns this study aimed to investigate the possibility of hsi in arable lands and real maize grown fields of golestan province using a modeling approach and a geospatial information system gis hsi happens due to high temperatures from a few days before to a few days after the maize anthesis stage 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area was golestan province located in the north of iran near the caspian sea 36 44 n to 38 05 n 51 53 e to 56 14 e fig 1 regarding the de martonne classification method this province has a variable climate including the semi arid humid and semi humid regions kamkar et al 2021 overall golestan has a moderate and humid climate with moderately cool springs and warm and humid summers mokhtarpour 2011 golestan province is in fourth place among 33 of iran s provinces in terms of production of various agricultural products with more than four million tons of farm products maize rice and soybean are the major summer crops in this province kamkar et al 2021 which are usually included after wheat canola and barely as autumn crops in rotations one of the reasons that the area under grain maize cultivation has sharply decreased in recent years is that the maize is exposed to high temperatures during the anthesis stages in many places and as a result grain size is too small for production to be profitable for this reason most farmers have tended to grow forage maize the golestan province s weather allows maize to be planted for extended periods from early april until mid july maize in golestan province is usually cultivated in mid april as the main crop but it is also common in early july and after the wheat harvest as a summer crop in this study all irrigated arable lands of golestan province 323 000 ha 1 are identified fig 1 to prepare a general map of land suitability for corn cultivation and all lands under current cultivation including cereals and forage corn to determine their sensitivity to high temperatures 2 2 map of maize fields in this study for the extraction of lu lc landsat 8 datasets of 2014 early april to mid november were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs portal http earthexplorer usgs gov the details of the landsat imagery used are shown in table 1 the images were acquired with less than 10 cloud cover in the growing stage of the maize as a summer crop in the rotations of golestan province a supervised classification method using 48 ground control points recorded using 550 garmin gps device taken from both grain and forage maize fields was used to detect the maize grown areas given that the climatic and ecological requirements for grain and forage maize growth are almost the same all the maize grown fields irrespective of grain or forage maize were detected and used in the suitability analysis the map on utm coordinates is based on wgs84 data using erdas imagine v 11 the accuracy of extracted maize fields was assessed using two standard performance metrics i e kappa index and overall accuracy k taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2020 k shows the probability that a class is classified by chance kappa values of 0 and 1 mean a poor and almost perfect agreement between the two maps respectively mokarram et al 2010 the overall accuracy is calculated as the ratio of all appropriately classified land classes to all data used to create maps higher overall accuracy means better performance of the models involved taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2020 kappa and overall accuracy coefficients for the finalized layer were 0 94 and 0 81 respectively the extracted maize fields layer was used to clip vectors or mask raster layers 2 3 land suitability 2 3 1 providing the base layers for generating maize land suitability map in the study area using 3 d topographic maps 1 25 000 scale a 90 m digital elevation model dem was created then elevation slope and aspect raster layers were extracted by dem using spatial analyst tools and were reclassified in arcgis 10 4 the layers were reclassified based on the least reported general requirements e g some climatic topographic and soil related variables of maize growth table 2 temperature relative humidity and precipitation data were provided from 30 meteorological stations located in the study extent and the neighboring provinces including semnan mazandaran and northern khorasan provinces with five to over 30 years of historical data fig 2 the universal kriging geostatistical interpolation procedure involved preparing maps related to climatic variables for the study area table 2 the universal kriging interpolation method is a type of geostatistical interpolation method xiao et al 2016 that divides the random function into two different components including the residual random function with an integrated linear combination of definite functions and a smooth non uniform process gundogdu and guney 2007 ganesh prasad and sushma 2016 the soil electrical conductivity layer ec was created by the inverse distance weighted method using 330 sampled points data obtained from golestan agricultural and natural research center and samples obtained from other projects by the author data not shown for this purpose 200 samples were used to make the layer and the remaining 130 points were used to evaluate the accuracy of the produced layer 2 3 2 weighting and overlaying layers for weighting of each layer analytical hierarchy process ahp was involved saaty and alexander 1989 this procedure estimates the relative weight of factors through pair wise comparisons each of the experts i e 30 experts in the field of maize production compared the relative importance of each pair of components using a predesigned questionnaire the weighted overlay function was used to apply ahp coefficients on the reclassified layers in arcgis v 10 4 esri 2014 the reliability of the filled questionnaires was checked by calculating the inconsistency coefficient for ahp analysis then the rasters of involved climatic factors soil ec and topographic related layers i e elevation slope and aspect were reclassified afterward to generate a land suitability map lsm the weighted overlay procedure overlaid reclassified layers to assess the suitability of arable land for corn production in five categories indicated by s1 to s5 from very suitable s1 to unsuitable s5 2 4 the ceres maize models calibration and evaluation the ceres maize model was used to determine anthesis time in involved meteorological stations for calibration and evaluation of the model additional data from other works in 2007 2008 2012 and 2013 were employed the first experiment investigated the effects of two planting dates 3rd of april and 18th of april and two planting densities during 2007 and 2008 a factorial experiment in a completely randomized block design with four replications by two sowing dates 3rd of april and 18th of april and two sowing densities 4 5 and 6 5 plants m 2 were considered these experiments were conducted for two years at the agricultural research station of gorgan the experimental plots were planted in four lines with a length of twelve meters and a row spacing of seventy five centimeters during 2012 and 2013 three different sowing dates i e 22nd of june 6th of july and 21st of july and four irrigation treatments of the total available soil water taw the irrigation treatments were 40 60 and 80 maximum allowable drainage of soil and control water no irrigation irrigation treatments were applied from the third leaf growth stage onward the ceres maize model was calibrated using optimal irrigation and stress free treatment in 2012 22nd of june 6th of july and 21st of july sowing dates and two treatments of the first experiment in 2007 3rd of april and 18th of april sowing dates the model was evaluated using 2008 2012 and 2013 experimental data to evaluate the model root means square error rmse determination of the coefficient r2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse were obtained by comparing the evaluated data with the observed data data not shown to assess model accuracy grain yield and dry matter production were measured up to physiological maturity and harvest time as well as the highest leaf area index and yield components in which characteristics were implicated after determining the anthesis time by the evaluated model the percentage of those days by tmax 35 c from three days before to seven days after anthesis occurrence hereafter pdt35 was also quantified this model has been tested over a wide range of environments for different purposes all over the world and used to estimate maize growth and yield at different planting dates saseendran et al 2005 binder et al 2008 mokhtarpour 2011 adnan et al 2017 rugira et al 2021 rugira et al 2021 reported that ceres maize had predicted plant phenological development and yield with high accuracy in northern china adnan et al 2017 also used this model to optimize maize production at different planting dates in sudan savanna they reported that the model predictions about the results obtained for grain yield and biomass production in the two cultivars studied were well done rmse 5 high d index 0 8 and r2 0 9 for the calibration trials to calculate the pdt35 at each planting date the days with tmax 35 c were counted from three days before to seven days after anthesis occurrence as an output of ceres maize model the pdt35 values for each planting date in all meteorological stations were interpolated to convert them to a raster layers classified by the reclassification method syn jenks were presented to divide the study area into different areas with different sensitivities to heat stress which often occurs when the product experiences higher temperatures a flowchart was designed and it summarized the work fig 3 in this region the average temperature for the corn growing season is in the desired range 3 results 3 1 climatic and topographic state of the studied region for maize cultivation the results using the mean of long term climate data as reclassified raster layers for the growing season revealed that maize did not experience restricting temperatures throughout the growing season in the study area minimum average and maximum temperature data based on the mean of long term data indicated that the average temperature for the growing season of summer maize was in the desired range the average maximum temperature varied from 26 to 29 1⁰c fig 4 mean air relative humidity slope and rainfall were also considered in the present study the humidity map showed that the highest and the lowest relative humidity percent were seen in the western near the caspian sea and the eastern parts of the study area respectively fig 4 in contrast the areas with a slope of more than 6 were located in farming areas of kalaleh county also the amount of rainfall decreased from south to north and the maximum value 400 430 mm was related to the south of kalaleh county and the agricultural lands of kordkuy county fig 4 3 2 land suitability assessment for maize cultivation based on the ahp method with a consistency ratio of 0 02 the maximum temperature with the highest relative weight 0 25 was determined as the most effective factor among climatic factors rain and minimum temperature with a relative weight of 0 15 and 0 1 fell in the following ranks affecting the suitability of maize cultivation all the provided layers including minimum temperature maximum temperature average temperature rainfall elevation slope aspect and ec were overlaid to provide a suitability map for maize cultivation the created map showed that the lands were categorized into five groups from very suitable s1 to unsuitable s5 most of the arable lands in the west of the study region were located in a highly suitable s1 class which covered 138 000 ha 1 43 of the total lands fig 5 slope ec ds m 1 minimum temperature maximum temperature and average temperatures c in the study area were in the optimal range table 2 fig 4 suitable areas s2 with an area of 94 000 ha 1 29 of total lands were located in the east of golestan province where the maximum temperature occurred fig 5 these results show that the maize cultivation could be satisfactory in the east oriented fields because the average temperature during the maize growing season is in an optimal range 20 30⁰c 3 3 model calibration and output results the genetic coefficients of maize for consideration in the model structure obtained using the above complementary experiments are presented in table 3 after determining the initial values of genetic coefficients in the field to adjust the best genetic coefficients the iterative sensitivity analysis was performed the results of the ceres maize evaluation showed that the simulation of days to anthesis both for averaged and plot based values in 2008 2012 and 2013 at different planting dates was reliable fig 6 therefore the obtained anthesis dates for each sowing date were considered to determine the pdt35 with a delay in planting date days to anthesis decreased because of high temperatures fig 6 3 4 mapping probability and intensity of hsi by extreme temperatures around anthesis at different sowing dates in the total arable lands of kordkuy county and some areas of gorgan country the pdt35 was at most 40 at all planting dates this means that in all these arable lands the temperature did not exceed 35 c for more than four days the highest pdt35 was related to the arable lands of gonbad county from 3rd of july until 18th of july fig 7 the results showed that pdt35 increased in the agricultural lands of gonbad city when planting was delayed until june up to 89 9 while it gradually decreased on july due to the decrease in daily temperature table 4 the results reveal that the number of days with tmax 35 c around the anthesis stage hereafter ndt35 on the 7th of april and 19th of april sowing dates was 2 days fig 7 and table 4 in addition the suitable areas on the 7th of april and 19th of april sowing dates with pdt35 20 covered 11 5 of irrigated lands table 4 this class was located in the farming areas of bandar turkaman kordkuy and bandar gaz counties located near the caspian sea the highest pdt35 was related to the 3rd of june and 18th of june sowing dates fig 7 and table 4 but it decreased at the two late sowing dates i e 18th of june and 3rd of july on 18th of june maize can be sown in all suitable areas except in some arable lands of kalaleh where the pdt35 was more than 40 fig 7 and table 4 on the 3rd of july sowing date the highest pdt35 was about 22 this revealed that maize could be planted after the 3rd of june to avoid dealing with days with the risk of hsi in the anthesis stage this was especially the case in the agricultural lands of gonbad and kalaleh counties fig 7 and table 4 the results show that the lowest pdt35 in the arable lands of gonbad county usually occurred from the 3rd of july sowing date onward to avoid dealing with the days with tmax 35 c around the anthesis stage in this area the sowing of the maize from 3rd of july onwards is recommended because of the lowest pdt35 3rd of july onwards was recommended as the proper sowing date for the arable lands of gonbad county to avoid dealing with days with tmax 35 c around the anthesis stage 3 5 land suitability of real maize grown fields overlaying the detected map using satellite imagery and supervised classification method and the map of land suitability showed that the area of real maize grown fields was 15 600 ha 1 most maize grown fields 10 085 ha 1 were located in the very suitable s1 class fig 8 this reveals that most farmers also have selected suitable sowing dates empirically to avoid kernel abortion disorder kad it should also be noted that the selection of areas under corn cultivation by farmers in the study area is not based solely on the prevention of kad and various other factors also affect it farmers have realized through years of trial and error that the best yield is obtained in these lands also the results showed that the maize grown fields in gonbad and aq qala counties are in the weaker suitability classes compared to other maize grown fields 4 discussion 4 1 effect of sowing date and highly extreme temperatures on kernel abortion disorder kad considering extreme temperatures the maize growing season usually starts in early april and continues until mid november in golestan province the average daily temperature from early april 1 date of early planting to harvest time in mid to late october varied between 10 and 34 c respectively in their experiments in golestan province mokhtarpour 2011 and feyzbakhsh et al 2011 mentioned that with a delay in planting date yield and yield components of maize decreased because of high temperatures until june still they decreased after june because of low temperatures as wang et al 2022 reported climate change is breaking global food supplies the environmental climate model is capable of simulating crop productivity for hundreds of years under various climate scenarios environmental conditions and management systems and is often used to study the impact of climate change on agriculture according to their findings the accuracy of the model is greatly improved by determining the genetic parameters of crops modifying the parameters according to the weather land use and technical conditions and by establishing the local and even global model parameter database the uncertainty of model parameters input data and model structure is analyzed to improve the stability of the model moeinirad et al 2011 showed that corn should be cultivated by the end of the third decade of june to achieve the desired yield in golestan province also adnan et al 2017 stated that in cultivars with different growing periods planting dates had different effects on the yield as the highest grain yields were obtained in late july in extra early and in mid june for early maize cultivars the yield also declined in mid august in the study of different maize hybrids in pakistan ali et al 2020 also found that out of the three planting dates 25th of february 6th of march and 14th of march the first planting date resulted in the best corn performance rugira et al 2021 also stated that in different irrigation states corn yields increased from about 8 264 tons ha 1 to about 10 tons ha 1 by changing the planting date from april 20 to may 20 in northern china while delay in planting date until may 25 caused a significant reduction in the yields they stated that the optimal planting date is site specific and can vary in different regions depending on the prevailing climatic conditions according to the results the pdt35 varied in different sowing dates this reveals that in each county maize could be planted at different sowing dates for example in the arable lands of bandar gaz and some areas in the arable lands of kordkuy county maize could be planted at all planting dates but at late planting dates 3rd of july and 18th of july the relative humidity data are not shown and therefore kernel abortion disorder kad increase as a result and the quality of grain decreases which means that farmers should be concerned also the results showed that maize could be planted in gonbad and kalaleh counties after 3rd of june to avoid the risk of kad fig 6 kad is one of the concerns which emerges when temperatures more than 35 c rise around the anthesis stage this is a challenge when the sowing date is far from optimal more days with tmax 35 c during the anthesis stage is the main reason for reducing kernel per ear schoper et al 1987a 1987b noor et al 2019 and the grain yield wei et al 2020 yun et al 2017 stated that in warm days the tassel might develop and shed pollen before completion of the ear and silk formation resulting in poor or incomplete pollination as a result the silk grows slowly and cannot receive pollen reducing the number of cores in each ear corn production handbook 2007 other similar studies e g noor et al 2019 lizasoa et al 2018 have concluded that high temperatures can alter yield components reducing the maize yield several studies e g wei et al 2020 lizasoa et al 2018 found that high temperatures are lethal to maize pollen viability 4 2 land suitability assessment for the cultivation of grain maize without hsi the results showed that less than 14 6 47 200 ha of the total arable land is in the very poor category this area was located in the west of kalaleh county fig 5 with a high slope and soil ec was higher than the salinity tolerance threshold for maize table 2 and fig 4 maize is moderately sensitive to salt stress farooq et al 2015 at a salinity level of 5 9 ds m 1 yield reduction is up to 50 hall 2000 nevertheless jahromi et al 2010 have suggested higher threshold values around eight dsm 1 the results indicate that 138 000 ha 1 of available arable lands are very suitable for maize cultivation this reveals that maize cultivation areas both grain and forage maize could be developed in golestan province one of the reasons for the decrease in the area under grain maize cultivation in golestan province is the presence of soybeans and rice which have been considered by farmers due to its satisfactory economic benefits and guaranteed purchase in summer rotations unsuitable planting dates also lead to high temperatures around the anthesis stage tmax 35 c as a result the yield and quality of forage are reduced humidity is also one of the factors that influence kad the highest humidity was seen in the west of golestan province fig 4 in addition to reducing pollen survival high relative humidity reduces the intensity and quality of sunlight thereby reducing photosynthesis icrisat 2010 pacini 1990 these results indicate that the disorder can be more widespread in areas with high relative humidity and at the same time higher temperatures around anthesis other studies e g niu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 have reported the effects of temperature on the pollination success of plants and their grain set as well as the impact of relative humidity on the survival of pollen grains after release from the anther pacini 1990 5 conclusion heat stress around the anthesis stage is a challenge for farmers dealing with high temperatures at inappropriate sowing dates the failure of the crop to complete pollination could incommode the farmers just when they are waiting for a reasonable yield providing the probability maps to forecast probable adverse events pre season forecasting could help farmers and agricultural decision makers mainly to avoid dealing with unwanted events such as kad previous findings emphasize the effect of temperatures higher than 35 c when the maize is in the anthesis stage therefore the pdt35 was mapped spatially in this study using crop simulation modeling and gis then the reclassified map was used to determine high risk zones concerning probable hsi in the maize fields the results revealed that the irrigated lands of the study area had different degrees of suitability for maize cropping and different sensitivities to hsi around anthesis although the major parts of golestan province were located in suitable areas for maize cultivation based on average temperature topographic and soil related factors the days with tmax 35 c around anthesis and consequently kad were determined as the limiting factors affecting the final suitability of irrigated lands for reliable maize production the results also led to introducing more reliable and proper sowing dates which could be recommended to avoid kad the results showed that gis and crop modeling ceres maize could be considered as valuable tools to select arable lands for cost effective agriculture by considering various factors affecting agricultural ecosystems also the results confirmed that those maps are provided based on the average values of climatic factors in general and temperature in particular which cannot be a reliable source to decide whether or not a region is suitable for growing a specific crop in this study maximum temperature based on average long term data showed no limitation for maize cultivation while investigating the extreme temperatures around anthesis was followed by entirely different results therefore considering extreme events is seriously recommended for this kind of investigation cultivation of those lands that are generally suitable for maize cultivation and are at the same time in low risk classes due to the possibility of extreme heat makes farmers more interested in cultivating grain maize on the other hand maize silage including cobs increases the quality of silage fodder for livestock this study showed that guiding farmers to choose the appropriate sowing date can prevent the crop from being exposed to high temperatures during the critical anthesis phases according to new agricultural policies in iran rice cultivation is prohibited or restricted in many parts of the province due to excessive water consumption providing a suitable cultivation pattern with the presence of grain maize can be a good alternative for farmers in golestan province to determine more accurately the effect of critical temperatures on grain formation in summer grain maize conducting experiments with consecutive planting dates close to each other and in different geographical coordinates is recommended it is also necessary to update some data especially soil data to achieve more accurate results in determining land

24182,the impacts of reduced precipitation on plant functional diversity and how its components richness evenness divergence and composition modulate the amazon carbon balance remain elusive we present a novel trait based approach the carbon and ecosystem functional trait evaluation caetê model to investigate the role of plant trait diversity in representing vegetation carbon c storage and net primary productivity npp in current climatic conditions we assess impacts of plant functional diversity on vegetation c storage under low precipitation in the amazon basin by employing two approaches low and high plant trait diversity respectively i a plant functional type pft approach comprising three pfts and ii a trait based approach representing 3000 plant life strategies plss the pfts plss are defined by combinations of six traits c allocation and residence time in leaves wood and fine roots we found that including trait variability improved the model s performance in representing npp and vegetation c storage in the amazon when considering the whole basin simulated reductions in precipitation caused vegetation c storage loss by 60 for both model approaches while the pft approach simulated a more widespread c loss and abrupt changes in neighboring grid cells we found that owing to high trait variability in the trait based approach the plant community was able to functionally reorganize itself via changes in the relative abundance of different plant life strategies which therefore resulted in the emergence of previously rare trait combinations in the model simulation the trait based approach yielded strategies that invest more heavily in fine roots to deal with limited water availability which allowed the occupation of grid cells where none of the pfts were able to establish the prioritization of root investment at the expense of other tissues in response to drought has been observed in other studies however the higher investment in roots also had consequences it resulted for the trait based approach in a higher root shoot ratio a mean increase of 74 74 leading to a lower vegetation c storage in some grid cells our findings highlight that accounting for plant functional diversity is crucial when evaluating the sensitivity of the amazon forest to climate change and therefore allow for a more mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity for tropical forest ecosystem functioning keywords trait based model climate change carbon allocation functional trait space functional reorganization trait variability abbreviations c

the current study are available in the unicamp research data repository redu https doi org 10 25824 redu zgth17 1 introduction climate model projections based on future socioeconomic scenarios indicate that the amazon forest will experience more frequent and more extreme moisture stress in the 21st century lee et al 2021 moisture stress can induce biodiversity shifts including changes in functional diversity aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 esquivel muelbert et al 2018 and associated effects on vegetation carbon hereafter c storage da costa et al 2010 hubau et al 2020 however how these climatic changes will affect different components of functional diversity composition richness evenness and divergence carmona et al 2016 mason et al 2005 and the role functional diversity plays in determining vegetation c storage remains poorly understood esquivel muelbert et al 2017 2018 poorter et al 2015 sakschewski et al 2016 due to differences in life history strategies among plants adler et al 2014 reich et al 2003 functional diversity plays a vital role in determining ecosystem functioning and its responses to environmental changes díaz and cabido 2001 song et al 2014 cadotte 2017 ultimately functional traits delineate plant communities responses and effects to biotic and abiotic conditions and also shape ecosystem processes and functions such as vegetation c storage lavorel and garnier 2002 funk et al 2017 violle et al 2007 it is widely accepted that more taxonomically and functionally diverse communities are less impacted by environmental changes cadotte et al 2011 mori et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 schmitt et al 2019 the insurance hypothesis for example postulates that a higher diversity richness of plant functional strategies provides higher variability of plant functional responses under new environmental conditions mori et al 2013 yachi and loreau 1999 thus maintaining ecosystem functioning by providing a buffer effect against environmental fluctuations fauset et al 2015 lohbeck et al 2016 yachi and loreau 1999 such a buffering effect is expected through the process of functional density compensation which enables the functional composition of a community to reorganize and adjust to new environmental conditions thus enabling types of plants that previously exerted a less relevant functional role low density to increase their dominance and vice versa mori et al 2013 smith et al 2022 accordingly it has been suggested that environmental fluctuations lead to changes in the abundance of plant strategies that compose the communities and consequently changes on how the available functional trait space is occupied then redefining plant functional diversity components boersma et al 2016 carmona et al 2019 de bello et al 2021 enquist et al 2017 however there is no consensus under which condition whether environmental changes select traits and lead to homogenization decrease in functional diversity or allow multiple functional traits to persist generating diversification increase in functional diversity smith et al 2022 for example reduced precipitation was found to exert a strong environmental filter by selecting a subset of functional trait combinations that are more suitable to cope with moisture stress mouillot et al 2013a in such a scenario according to the optimal partitioning theory cannell and dewar 1994 metcalfe et al 2010 thornley 1972 a common strategy would be to invest more c to fine root production to acquire limiting belowground resources such as soil water and nutrients required for aboveground plant productivity such a selection for more conservative resource use would restrict the range of functional trait values and thus reduce the functional trait space occupied by the community lower functional richness cornwell et al 2006 funk et al 2017 kleidon et al 2009 on the other hand it has been found that disturbances especially intermediate disturbances can trigger an increase in the occupation of the functional trait space higher functional richness herben et al 2018 in line with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis bongers et al 2009 which predicts that local species diversity is maximized at an intermediate level of disturbance it has been suggested that also functional diversity should increase via the functional reorganization of the community allowing new ecological strategies to be more abundant in the communities smith et al 2022 vegetation models have been widely used to explore the fate of the amazon forest carbon balance under future potential climatic conditions cox et al 2004 galbraith et al 2010 huntingford et al 2013 lapola et al 2009 longo et al 2018 rammig et al 2010 some of these models project a dramatic loss in amazon forest c stocks due to reduced precipitation cox et al 2000 2004 lapola et al 2009 oyama and nobre 2003 most model simulations have not reproduced these patterns afterward but there is ongoing discussion on the likelihood of such projections levine et al 2016 malhi et al 2009 malhi et al 2018 lapola et al 2018 other models simulate an abrupt replacement of the dominant humid tree cover found in large parts of amazon forests with more arid affiliated vegetation under reduced precipitation hutyra et al 2005 salazar et al 2007 one of the underlying reasons that models are challenged by simulating unprecedent climatic conditions is their underrepresentation of plant diversity pavlick et al 2013 scheiter et al 2013 commonly models represent plant functions based on a very small and discrete set of pfts plant functional types and plant functional traits parameters are previously a priori defined prentice et al 2007 consequently the diversity of plant life strategies i e the combination of traits found in these model ecosystems is oversimplified and the emergence of alternative trait combinations in response to a changing environmental scenario is strongly limited or is not even captured due to the small number of pfts that compose the communities fyllas et al 2014 mori et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 as a result fixed a priori defined parameters commonly lead to an overestimation of the impacts of environmental changes due to abrupt changes in plant performance and establishment success berzaghi et al 2020 pavlick et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 verheijen et al 2015 and important mechanisms involved in ecosystem resilience such as the functional reorganization of the plant community enquist and enquist 2011 fauset et al 2012 2015 wieczynski et al 2019 are not represented in such model approaches the development of the models with a higher representation of trait variability so called trait based vegetation models e g fyllas et al 2014 joshi et al 2022 pavlick et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2015 scheiter et al 2013 schmitt et al 2019 is an attempt to overcome these limitations of underrepresenting functional diversity with pfts such a modeling approach allows replacing the small number of pfts with a more realistic representation of functional diversity and thus increasing the representation of possible functional traits combinations by several orders of magnitude pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2014 webb et al 2010 wullschleger et al 2014 this provides the opportunity to explore multiple aspects of plant ecology and community composition in combination with biogeochemical fluxes and pools berzaghi et al 2020 sakschewski et al 2016 zakharova et al 2019 for example trait based vegetation models are able to explore the role of different components of plant functional diversity on ecosystem functioning the processes that determine community assembly and structure and how these interact with environmental changes fisher et al 2018 mason et al 2005 mouillot et al 2013b song et al 2014 an increasing number of trait based models has been applied to understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning and the role of functional diversity on these impacts nonetheless most of the functional ecological aspects highlighted in the scientific literature remain underexplored but see hofhansl et al 2021 few studies applying trait based vegetation models have explored how environmental changes affect plant functional diversity per se and when they do the focus is specially on functional richness pappas et al 2015 sakschewski et al 2016 scheiter et al 2013 none of them investigated how these changes affect the underlying components of functional diversity i e functional richness evenness and divergence and how these different components affect ecosystem functioning hence despite the proposed mechanistic linkage between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning mason et al 2005 mouillot et al 2013b the ability of trait based models to conjointly capture plant functional diversity and ecosystem functional responses to environmental changes has yet to be tested building on these previous efforts we here present a new trait based vegetation model the carbon and ecosystem functional trait evaluation caetê model to assess the effect of including trait variability in vegetation models we compare two approaches of caetê a standard pft approach that represents vegetation through three pfts i e low functional diversity and a trait based approach hereafter called as pls approach that represents a higher level of functional diversity by using 3000 combinations of trait values that seeks to express the variability of plant life strategies plss found in nature six traits are used to characterize the pfts and the plss c allocation and c residence time in three plant structural compartments leaves wood and fine roots we compared the performance of the two modeling approaches in representing vegetation c storage and npp for the amazon basin region to evaluate whether plant trait diversity improves the representation of biogeochemical cycling we also applied a scenario of reduced precipitation in the study area and by comparing model results generated from either the low diversity i e pft versus the high diversity i e pls parameterization we assess whether the degree of plant functional diversity affects the response of ecosystem to moisture deficits using vegetation c stocks as an indicative additional analyses are made with pls approach to evaluate the impacts of lower water availability on simulated functional composition and functional diversity components richness evenness and divergence and its association with the impacts on c storage 2 material and methods 2 1 the caetê model an overview we present an overview of the caetê model and how the two used levels of diversity parametrization are defined in this study and for both approaches we employed a non transient version of the caetê model which calculates equilibrium solutions based on long term mean monthly climate variables the difference between the pft and the pls approach is only the degree of trait variability represented the model process formulations and principles are the same for both each plant functional type for pft approach or plant life strategy for pls approach represents an average individual like in lpj model sitch et al 2003 the next section presents the procedures of model setup for this study and the supplementary material sm 1 provides a more detailed description of the caetê model for the pls approach the underlying premise for creating the plss is that the range of values of a functional trait observed in nature can be regarded as one axis of a multidimensional hypervolume formed by the combination of n chosen functional traits fig 1 blonder 2017 villéger et al 2008 in that sense each point inside of this hypervolume is a unique combination of values for each of the functional traits representing a pls the values of traits that compose them are sampled from the complete range of values used as reference see sm 1 1 1 the volume occupied by the sampled traits can be seen as a potential functional space with tens of thousands of combinations like other trait based models e g pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2011 caetê assumes that sampling an appropriate number of plss from the potential functional space see sensitivity test in sm 2 combined with an environmental filtering mechanism allows the model to produce reasonable biogeochemical and functional diversity patterns on the other hand in its pft approach the model s user previously defines the number of pfts and their traits values are based on previous vegetation models the physiological processes and the interaction of each pls pft with the environment are determined by several functional traits for example the maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation eq sm 16 and nitrogen to carbon ratio on plant tissues eq sm 25 however in this study six functional traits are used to distinguish each pls or pft since the analyses presented here are focused on the assessment of vegetation c storage three traits represent the c allocation percentage of the npp distributed to different plant tissues compartments leaves fine roots and wood and the other three traits represented c residence time in the respective plant tissues the combination of allocation and residence time for each tissue define its c stock and then the total plant c stock the functional trait values assigned to each pls pft determine its ecophysiological behavior and its responses and effects to the environment for example each pls pft as a distinct combination of functional traits constitutes a differential way of storing c and capturing water and light thus the functional traits of a pls or a pft ultimately determine its performance and survivorship during each iteration in a daily time step the distinct performances of plss pfts determines the ecosystem scale processes and properties eq 6 such as gpp growth primary productivity evapotranspiration and c storage which together with environmental conditions will determine the composition of plss and pfts in each grid cell for the next iteration the performance is determined as the relative abundance eq 1 of a pls pft in a specific grid cell from now on the symbol i refers to an average individual of a pls or pft y to a grid cell and z to a plant compartment the values for the allocation α and residence time τ traits can be found on table sm 1 for the pls approach and on table sm 2 for the pft approach the relative abundance a r i y of a pls pft is the fraction of the grid cell that it occupies based on the relative contribution of this strategy to the total carbon stock in this grid cell c t y considering the number of living pls pft s 1 a r i y c i y c t y 2 c t y i 1 s c i y where c i y is the carbon stock of a pls pft eq 3 this procedure has support on the biomass ratio hypothesis grime 1998 which predicts that immediate effects of a species are proportional to its relative contribution to the total c storage of the community the c i y is the sum of carbon stored c z i y in each of the three plant compartments 3 c i y z 1 3 c z i y and the c z i y in a certain time step t is determined by the percentage of n p p i y allocated to each plant c compartment α z i and the carbon residence time τ z i in these compartments 4 d c z i y d t α z i n p p i y c z i y τ z i n p p i y is the carbon available for allocation derived from gross primary productivity g p p i y eq sm 3 discounting the costs of autotrophic respiration r a i y eq sm 23 5 n p p i y g p p i y r a i y from the relative abundances it is possible to aggregate the biogeochemical variables from the pls pft scale to the grid cell scale that is the flux or state of a variable in a grid cell is given by the sum of the values of this variable for each existing pls pft s weighted by their relative abundance for example the net primary productivity in a grid cell scale n p p g r i d y is 6 n p p g r i d y i 1 s n p p i y a r i y accordingly the composition of plss pfts and their respective traits in a grid cell determine ecosystem scale processes and properties each functional trait f is represented in a grid cell scale f g r i d y by a unique value which is the sum of this trait value f i y calculated for each pls pft alive in the grid cell weighted by their relative abundances a r i y 7 f g r i d y i 1 s a r i y f i y this community weighted mean value can be understood as the dominant trait value in a community díaz et al 2007 differential survival and performance between plss pfts are also possible because each functional trait is related to at least one trade off pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2014 trade offs are here defined as relationships of costs and benefits that impact the ecophysiological processes of a pls or functional type they ultimately determine the pls pft s performances and whether they will be able to deal with a specific environmental condition pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2011 importantly the trade offs also prevent the model from enabling the survivorship of the so called darwinian demons law 1979 in other words optimal but rather unrealistic strategies that maximize all the functions that contribute to plant fitness and survival pavlick et al 2013 scheiter et al 2013 for example to respect mass conservation scheiter et al 2013 any c investment i e allocation and residence time traits combination in one tissue will always be at the expense of other investing c in leaves can increase photosynthesis rate by increasing solar radiation absorption eq sm 21 and sm 22 however such investment is at the expense of investing in fine roots which is responsible for water uptake also a limiting resource for photosynthesis eq sm 35 beyond that an intrinsic trade off emerges from the allocation traits per principle their combination for all plant tissues must add up to 1 and the traits combination that do not respect this rule is excluded before model starts running see sm 1 1 1 carbon allocation strategies also lead to indirect competitive ability for light what may also exclude life strategies see sm 1 6 the ecophysiological processes linked to each functional trait its trade offs and associated formulations are summarized in table sm 3 2 2 simulation setup for both caetê approaches we employed mean monthly climate variables and atmospheric co2 concentration from 1980 to 2010 for the amazon basin fig sm 1 at a spatial resolution of 0 5º x 0 5º see sm 1 2 for input data for the modeling experiment the precipitation was reduced in 50 for the same 1980 2010 monthly climatology used in the control this reduction was homogeneous it was applied for the whole period of the study and for all the grid cells equally we are aware that the frequency and intensity of droughts are not homogeneous over time or along environmental gradients across the basin furthermore this precipitation reduction is quite severe despite having occurred in isolated events in the past marengo et al 2008 and it is also within some projections cox et al 2000 2004 betts et al 2004 this massive decrease in water availability is also justifiable for modeling purposes as extreme scenarios can be used to test the sensibility of ecological processes and properties simulated then for this study we did not intend to make reliable predictions of drought for the region instead we used this 50 precipitation reduction scenario as a proof of concept and as a mean to test our hypotheses once the effects of extreme drought events to ecosystem processes and biodiversity it is still not entirely clear allen et al 2010 for the pft approach we defined 3 tropical pfts and their traits values were chosen based on those used by other vegetation models table sm 2 for the pls approach we used 3000 plss and this number was defined based on a sensitivity test see supplementary material sm 2 the ranges of values of each functional trait considered in this approach were based on empirical experimental literature and are presented in table sm 1 in both approaches all grid cells are initialized with the same set of plss or pfts under conditions that are analogous to bare soil however in each grid cell the plss pfts will perform differently such that some strategies will survive each of them occupying a different portion of the cell while others will be excluded from the spatial grain in the simulation and cannot be reestablished importantly for this study there is no repopulation of the pfts or plss excluded rather the model is run until equilibrium with 3000 plss 3 pfts and regular climate condition and after it is run again with the same 3000 plss 3 pfts but with reduced precipitation that is why it is possible that plss pfts can be excluded with regular climatic conditions but increase decrease their abundance with reduced precipitation before the model execution a model initialization phase is performed i to determine the initial c content in plant compartments and it is run until the attaining the stability attained for the total c stock i e the sum of c in all plant compartments in all the grid cells see details in sm 1 1 2 and ii to check the viability of each newly created pls see sm 1 1 1 after the initialization phase the model runs by continuously repeating the input data series under regular climate or under reduced precipitation until the stability of simulated results was attained 2 3 caetê performance evaluation the performance of the two modeling approaches in representing the spatial distribution of vegetation c storage and npp in the amazon region was compared with reference data for c storage we used data from baccini et al 2012 and saatchi et al 2011 and for npp the data came from modis npp project mod17a3 running and zhao 2021 these comparisons were made under current climatic conditions 1980 2010 we considered that 47 5 of living dry biomass from reference data is comprised of c thomas and martin 2012 following the reference data only the aboveground component was considered for the model performance evaluation we estimated the absolute difference between maps from caetê simulations and maps from reference data and a scatterplot analysis was performed to identify the trends in the model approaches simulations 2 4 assessing functional diversity and composition in this study we focused on large scale analyses of functional diversity and its components across the amazon basin it means that trait distributions used to evaluate functional diversity corresponds to the distribution of the set of dominant trait values obtained for each grid cell as explained in section 2 1 eq 4 as mentioned in the introduction using only a small number of pfts to represent variability precludes access to functional diversity analyses hence functional diversity analyses are here limited only to the pls approach functional diversity and functional composition of communities were analyzed both considering each functional trait independently single trait analyses and the combinations of traits multi trait analyses the single trait and multi trait analyses allow a broader understanding of how the community occupies the functional trait space and how it is functionally organized by computing its composition occurrence and abundance of trait values the relative dominance between trait values and the functional diversity components in the single trait analyses distribution curves were generated by using the functional traits occurrence following the study by carmona et al 2016 emphasizing that each trait value is derived from a grid cell in this method the full range of trait values is considered as the total functional trait space and the occurrence and abundance of the trait values express the occupancy of this space calculated through probability density distributions i e the trait probability density distributions from these distributions we assessed the three functional diversity components as defined by carmona et al 2016 i functional richness the amount of functional space occupied by the community i e the total range of trait values for a specific functional trait considering all organisms plss in our case ii functional evenness the regularity of the density distribution of the plss trait values in the functional trait space and iii functional divergence the degree to which the abundance of trait values of plss are distributed toward the extremes of their functional trait space for the multi trait analyses we used the hypervolume metric proposed by blonder et al 2014 which combines the distribution of n trait values to create a multidimensional functional space and calculates functional diversity component metrics within such a hypervolume the functional richness can be interpreted as the amount of volume that is occupied by the community relative to the potentially available functional space based on the frequency of trait values that compose this community the distribution of trait values around the centroid that is the variation around the mean value can be used to evaluate the functional composition of the system barros et al 2016 following the recommendation by barros et al 2016 we performed a principal component analysis pca with a centered and scaled method before creating the hypervolumes for more detail see sm 3 using the factor scores on the chosen principal components we were able to fulfill the statistical assumptions for constructing the hypervolumes despite the focus of our analyses being on the basin scale we made some additional functional diversity analyses on a finer scale using three spatial windows of 10 10 grid cells each along a northwest to southeast axis fig sm 2 looking into finer scales enables the evaluation whether the results obtained from the whole amazon basin scale analyses are not only a product of the natural environmental heterogeneity once the basin is well known to present a large scale variation in climatic and edaphic properties ter steege et al 2006 quesada et al 2012 sombroek 2000 2 5 assessing effects of decreased precipitation in the experiment of 50 reduction in precipitation we compared the degree of change in c stock between the two modeling approaches used in this study to evaluate if trait variability influences c storage under environmental change further from the results simulated by the pls approach we also evaluated the role of the different components of functional diversity in this change for this we assessed whether the plant communities were functionally reorganized in the scenario of reduced precipitation by computing the dissimilarity index degree of overlap between the trait probability density distributions from the regular climate scenario and those from the reduced precipitation scenario carmona et al 2016 this index varies from 0 completely functionally similar overlapping density curves to 1 completely functionally different no overlap to estimate the changes in hypervolumes due to precipitation reduction we computed their overlap degree through the jaccard similarity index which ranges from 0 completely different no overlap to 1 completely similar overlapping hypervolumes in addition we assessed whether a centroid displacement occurred with the applied precipitation reduction the displacement indicates how much the mean values of the communities were dislocated from their previous location within the hypervolume to test the degree of communities functional reorganization we analyzed the changes in trait abundance throughout the functional space generated by the trait probability density distributions from this analysis we were able to observe for example the exclusion of trait values and or the increase in the occurrence of trait values that were rare under regular climatic conditions to understand the impacts of precipitation reduction on functional diversity facets richness evenness and divergence for the single trait analysis we computed the percentage change in their values between regular and reduced precipitation climatic conditions for the multi trait analysis we compared the hypervolume sizes before and after the reduced precipitation application once change in volume sizes represents a shift in the community functional richness we also performed these analyses for the finer scale we estimated the change in trait distributions with reduced precipitation using the same method described before for single and multi traits but in this scale with focus on the functional reorganization of the community and on functional richness 3 results 3 1 caetê model performance evaluation within the studied region the pft approach simulates 127 9 pg c stored in aboveground c and the pls approach simulates 86 0 pg c while baccini et al 2012 estimates 80 2 pg c of total aboveground c stock and saatchi et al 2011 estimates 71 7 pg c in terms of spatial patterns in vegetation c storage both modeling approaches show over or underestimation in the values simulated the overestimation is especially concentrated in naturally drier areas for example in north western amazonia we also observed an overestimation along the basin edges which are known as regions of transition to drier areas fire prone vegetations and subject to the intensive land use haghtalab et al 2020 morton et al 2013 nobre et al 2016 however the caetê in its pft approach tends to show the overestimation in a much higher degree and in more locations throughout the basin with emphasis on the central region and basin edges when compared to the pls fig 2 on the other hand the pls approach tends to underestimate mean c values in some regions for example in the east and southwest parts of the basin the pls approach presented more areas with no differences between simulated and reference values white cells in figs 2b and e and a higher number of points closer to the 1 1 line in the scatter plot fig 2c and f thereby matching the values used as reference reasonably well the caetê model simulated a total annual npp of 122 3 pg c yr ¹ pft approach and 76 0 pg c yr ¹ pls approach for the amazon basin modis based estimation is 74 6 pg c yr ¹ running and zhao 2021 by comparing the npp simulated by caetê with remote sensing npp estimations modis running and zhao 2021 the pls approach revealed a reasonably good ability to capture broad spatial patterns of remotely sensed npp estimations modis running and zhao 2021 fig sm 3b and sm 3c despite an underestimation in the andean region and a small overestimation in the northwest central basin region in contrast using a small number of pfts resulted in a widespread and prominent overestimation for this variable fig sm 3b and sm3c except for the underestimation in the andean region 3 2 carbon stocks under reduced precipitation the 50 reduction in precipitation caused a widespread decrease in c stocks throughout the basin in both model approaches fig 3a and b when considering the whole basin total c loss was equal to 73 48 pg c and 49 43 pg c for the pft and pls approach respectively representing a similar percentage decrease compared to regular climatic conditions 57 75 for pft and 57 48 for pls approach however the spatial pattern of change was significantly distinct the pls approach was able to maintain c stocks in several grid cells where none of the pfts survived in the pft approach this difference is more evident in central amazon and naturally drier areas such as in the transition between the amazon forest and the cerrado savannah in the southeast furthermore the c losses simulated by the pls approach presents a smoother gradient between a grid cell value and its neighboring cells and across different basin regions unlike in the pft approach which shows more abrupt differences between grid cells surprisingly in grid cells where both modeling approaches maintained at least a minimum c stock the pft approach presented higher values when compared to those from the pls one fig 3a and b specific plant compartments also showed distinct patterns of changes when comparing the employed modeling approaches fig 3c and d for fine roots fig sm 4 for leaves and wood none of the compartments showed an increase in c stock with precipitation reduction except for the fine roots compartment in the simulation with the pls approach blue areas in fig 3d such an increase is more apparent in the transition between the amazon and cerrado and in the northeast part of the basin the increased investment in fine roots resulted in a rise in the root shoot ratio for the pls approach with an average increase of 74 7 in contrast to an average decrease of 7 7 for the pft approach 3 3 effects of reduced precipitation on functional composition after applying the precipitation reduction we found high dissimilarity index values close to 1 table 1 owing to changes in the trait probability density distributions for the six plant functional traits fig 4 these dissimilarities degrees indicate that the communities significantly changed in terms of their structure and composition under moisture stress for example trait composition shifted away from hyperdominance decrease in the peaks of the curves of a previously restricted range of values toward a density increase in other trait values that were previously rare very low density or absent fig 4 additionally the traits in the hypervolumes presented a pronounced modification in the way they occupy the functional space fig 5 the overlap degree between the hypervolumes of the two climatic scenarios yielded a value of 0 038 when considering the whole amazon finally the centroid showed a displacement after imposing the climatic alteration indicating a change in the communities mean values and compositions fig 5 beyond that with lower water availability the distribution of the single traits along the functional space showed a higher diversity of values that presented an increase in density that is a higher probability of occurrence which resulted in a much more diffuse distribution within the functional space fig 4 the same pattern of distribution along functional space observed for single traits arose when considering all traits combined through the hypervolumes an increase in the functional space occupation by the traits fig 5 the increase in density was observed in traits with higher carbon allocation values to fine roots lower carbon allocation to leaves and to wood fig 4a b and c also higher values for carbon residence time in leaves and fine roots but a decrease in wood fig 4d e and f regarding the analyses in the finer scale our results show the same pattern that was found when considering the large scale the whole amazon basin an increase in the occupation of the functional space for all the six functional traits in their probability distributions fig sm 5 and sm 6 and an increase in the volume occupied when considering the six traits together fig sm 7 the high dissimilarity indices between trait probability density distributions with regular climate and decreased precipitation table sm 4 together with the small overlap between hypervolume indicate that as well as found in the amazon basin scale the communities in the three 10 10 grid region underwent a functional restructuration 3 4 reduced precipitation impacts on functional diversity facets the alterations in the density distribution of functional traits drove changes in the three facets of functional diversity fig 6 functional richness and functional evenness increased in a level higher than 100 for all the six considered traits divergence had an increase of more than 200 for the leaf allocation trait while the other traits displayed a reduction in this facet fig 6c from a multi trait perspective there was an increase in richness due to the enlargement in the volume occupied by the communities within the functional space fig 5 under current climatic conditions the size of the volume that the data occupied was equal to 1 71 while under reduced precipitation we found a volume size of 47 84 on the finer scales like in the whole basin an increase in the range of trait values table sm 4 and in the volume occupied when considering the six traits together fig sm 7 indicate a rise in functional richness beyond that the curves from the trait probability density distributions fig sm 5 and sm 6 and table sm 4 showed a high distribution dissimilarity 1 and the hypervolumes regular climate and reduced precipitation presented a small overlap for the three analyzed regions 0 006 0 001 and 0 007 for the northwest the center and the southeast respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model performance our results indicate that the inclusion of trait variability in vegetation models may lead to considerable improvement when simulating the vegetation c cycle with current climatic conditions compared to reference data fig 2 and sm 3 our simulations with the pls approach were able to represent npp and vegetation c storage reasonably well and showed better agreement spatial distribution and total values than the pft approach improved accuracy in biogeochemical variables has already been observed in other pft based models when trait variability was added fyllas et al 2014 sakschewski et al 2015 verheijen et al 2013 trait variability confers a higher diversity of community responses to environmental filtering through climatic heterogeneity thereby allowing a more realistic simulation of plant community assembly keddy 1992 avoiding a complete switch in vegetation state such as a catastrophic amazon dieback lapola et al 2018 due to abrupt changes in plant performance and establishment success fyllas et al 2014 sakschewski et al 2015 scheiter et al 2013 both modeling approaches show some mismatch with regard to the reference maps such that there appears to be an overestimation of aboveground vegetation c storage and npp and especially so for the pft approach fig 2 and sm 3 this is because the pfts chosen from previous pfts implemented in other vegetation models are already parameterized to present a high performance or optimal trait combination in the climatic envelope found in regions dominated by tropical forests which allowed a more frequent occurrence of pfts with higher vegetation c storage scheiter et al 2013 verheijen et al 2013 furthermore both approaches show a tendency to overestimate vegetation c storage and npp at the edges and in the central northwestern amazon basin fig 2 and sm 3 these inconsistencies could be attenuated through the improvement of some caveats of the caetê model first such an overestimation can be linked to the lack of representation of human land use and fire for determining vegetation distribution in the model houghton et al 2001 saatchi et al 2007 another important caveat is that the model does not yet represent impacts on vulnerability to cavitation and embolism anderegg et al 2016 oliveira et al 2021 the lack of representation of human land use fire and plant hydraulics may be particularly important to achieve a more realistic representation of c storage in the edges of the basin eller et al 2018 joshi et al 2022 papastefanou et al 2020 rowland et al 2015 furthermore nutrient cycling nitrogen and phosphorus is not represented in our model and low soil nutrient availability in the amazon may limit vegetation c storage across the amazon basin fleischer et al 2019 yang et al 2019 it is important to highlight that despite using the maps produced by saatchi et al 2011 and baccini et al 2012 as reference these maps include other sources of uncertainties mitchard et al 2013 and therefore present different estimates of aboveground biomass across the amazon basin 4 2 reduced precipitation impacts on vegetation carbon storage comparing a pft with a trait based modeling approach we found that in accordance with previous literature enquist and enquist 2011 fauset et al 2012 2015 wieczynski et al 2019 the inclusion of trait variability in vegetation models in fact matters for projecting the impacts of environmental change in ecosystems although the two approaches applied in this study i e pft vs pls show similar changes with regard to total basin vegetation c budget spatial patterns showed that only considering this biogeochemical variable can hide important details about the mechanism in which trait diversity determines ecosystem functioning for example the inclusion of trait variability in the model avoided sharp boundaries especially in naturally in drier regions showing a more subtle less sensitive and probably more realistic change in c stock across the basin fig 3 when compared to models pft based that commonly simulate the amazon dieback cox et al 2000 2004 lapola et al 2009 oyama and nobre 2003 disturbances are expected to trigger shifts in the occurrence and abundance of species functional traits to adapt to the new environmental conditions aguirre gutiérrez et al 2020 barros et al 2016 esquivel muelbert et al 2018 such changes were well captured in our modeling experiment for the pls approach similarity dissimilarity indices for the single and multi trait perspectives together with centroid displacements showed that the functional structure and composition of the plant communities were significantly modified by the climatic forcing scenario this ability to functionally reorganize and cope with new climatic conditions in the pls approach allowed by trait variability was decisive to the effects of reduced precipitation on both the total and the spatial distribution of c vegetation storage trait variability allows for functional density compensation process that counterbalances losses or decreases in the dominance of plant life strategies thus decreasing the impact of perturbation on ecosystem functioning gonzalez and loreau 2009 mori et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 on the other hand in the pft approach alternative pfts are too few to compensate for losses in establishments hence this model approach prevents better suited trait combinations to establish leading to higher occurrence of grid cells in which none of the pft s survived fig 3 this severe effect of environmental change using a pft approach corroborates other modeling studies huntingford et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 our results reinforce the importance of functional diversity for maintaining ecosystem functioning and give support for the insurance hypothesis mori et al 2013 yachi and loreau 1999 thus strengthening the assumption that diversity can promote ecosystem stability tilman et al 2006 4 3 functional composition and the selection of plant life strategies the changes in functional composition and structure due to reduced precipitation in the pls simulation is supported by the dissimilarity similarity indices found between the trait probability density distributions and the hypervolumes respectively the centroids displacements also showed that the dominant values composition were modified with the new climatic condition this high capacity of communities in the pls approach simulations to functionally reorganize enabled shifts in functional community composition thus corroborating with the hypothesis of a selection toward plant strategies with higher investment in roots in drier climate conditions fig 4b and e the higher investment in roots simulated by the pls approach was to the detriment of investment in leaves fig 4a and d and woody tissue fig 4c and f thus leading to higher root shoot ratios higher root biomass enabled water uptake and allowed the community of the pls simulation to better deal with the imposed moisture stress and maintain c stocks or reduce the degree of biomass loss when compared to the simulation using pfts the prioritization of root investment at the expense of other tissues in response to drought has been observed in manipulative ecosystem experiments and from monitoring forest inventory plots doughty et al 2014 kannenberg et al 2019 rowland et al 2014 given the limited trait variability the pft approach did not show these changes in c investment increasing mortality rates and preventing the pfts from establishing in some grid cells thereby rendering the ecosystem more vulnerable in general fig 3a as predicted notwithstanding an unexpected result was that in some grid cells the amount of c stock in the pft was higher than that in the pls approach with the applied reduced precipitation fig 3a and b this occurred due to an increase in the root shoot ratio in the simulations with high trait variability that is c was allocated toward pools with shorter turnover times fine roots which result in less total vegetation c storage chave et al 2009 de kauwe et al 2014 although the increase in fine roots in the pls approach provides resistance to moisture stress thereby preventing the total loss of carbon in several grid cells it also led to lower vegetation c storage in some locations compared to the pft approach this result is contrary to the widely accepted paradigm that higher functional diversity maximizes ecosystem function cadotte 2017 tilman et al 1997 tilman et al 2014 our findings of the community wide reorganization and associated increase in trait variability in response to novel climatic conditions indicate that functional diversity per se does not necessarily maximize ecosystem functions and properties such as c storage chiang et al 2016 holzwarth et al 2015 but that functional diversity can influence ecosystem functions in more than one direction hooper et al 2005 shen et al 2016 in our study the functional composition and especially the dominant plant functional trait was more critical in determining the c stock than functional richness with other studies finding similar results chiang et al 2016 finegan et al 2015 ruiz jaen and potvin 2011 roscher et al 2012 overall this suggests that trait based modeling approaches can improve our mechanistic understanding of the linkage between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning 4 4 environmental changes modify functional diversity components our results from analyses of the pls approach showed that a reduction of precipitation modified the way that traits occupy the functional space fig 4 and 5 and as consequence the functional diversity facets fig 6 for example reduced precipitation led to a wider range of expressed trait values in functional space fig 4 and 5 and thus increased the community s richness fig 6a this increase in functional richness contradicts the expected outcomes from the environmental filtering hypothesis keddy 1992 grime 1998 boersma et al 2016 funk et al 2017 perronne and gaba 2017 our findings may be explained by a decrease in hyperdominance in response to simulated climate change which allowed a higher range of ecological strategies to become viable in accordance with the compensatory dynamics theory gonzales and loreau 2009 walker et al 1999 importantly these results provide further evidence that environmental filtering not always reduce trait diversity le bagousse pinget et al 2017 laughlin and laughlin 2013 and that functional richness can increase after disturbance especially so if environmental change mainly affects the dominant plant functional strategies boersma et al 2016 funk et al 2017 mouillot et al 2013a beyond that it is necessary to consider that the role of the environmental filtering as a driver of functional structure will strongly depend on the traits being considered de la riva et al 2017 the observed increase in functional richness is also certainly linked to the caetê functioning mechanism model experiment of reduced precipitation resulted in higher functional richness mainly to the increase in the range of traits values of traits related to roots c allocation and residence time which in turn thanks to the considered trade offs was metabolically balanced by increases in functional richness related to other traits in addition one could hypothesize that the overestimation of c storage in drier regions at the edges of the amazon basin would be the cause of higher simulated functional richness under reduced precipitation however it is more reasonable to first consider that at the community scale higher c stock may not be directly linked to functional richness for instance we found that despite the model simulates higher value for total c in the northwest of the amazon basin this region also showed lower functional richness than the southeast for all the functional traits beyond a smaller increase of functional richness with reduced precipitation table sm 4 and fig sm 5 and sm 6 and the concentration of trait values in certain restricted areas of the functional space volume could be one of the causes of such pattern there was an increase in evenness in all traits considered in the pls approach fig 6b the evenness increase is tightly related to the observed decrease in dominance and increase in the abundance of trait values that were very rare in regular climate condition evenness can also be interpreted as evidence of the effectiveness of using the functional niche space the higher the evenness is the higher the utilization of the total functional space is de la riva et al 2017 hillebrand et al 2008 mouillot et al 2011 therefore our results indicate that a change in the environment can force the community to better occupy the functional niche space thus providing a lower sensitivity to the applied reduced precipitation if the community presents sufficient variability in its trait values we observed a general decrease in divergence fig 6c which was caused by the strong decrease in abundance of previous dominant trait values which tended to concentrate at the extremes of functional spaces with the regular climate condition consequently other trait values concentrated along the functional axis that were not as abundant became significant for the community after the reduction in precipitation based on empirical evidence obtained by analyzing a disturbance gradient mouillot et al 2013a also found a decreasing divergence with greater disturbance which was attributed to a declining in the abundance of specialist species that were the most impacted by the disturbance in addition this decrease in divergence can be additional evidence that the frequency distribution of trait values in the functional niche space maximizes the total community variation in functional characters mason et al 2005 it could be argued that the observed changes in functional diversity especially the increase in functional richness can be attributed to the fact that we considered the whole amazon basin as a single ecological unit while it is known that a high environmental heterogeneity exists throughout the basin however a similar pattern was found across a gradient of precipitation sampled from the northwest center and southeast of the amazon basin fig sm 5 sm 6 and sm 7 this finding highlight that our results are not dependent on the spatial scale of analysis or the degree of environmental heterogeneity nevertheless to avoid a simplification of diversity when considering large spatial scales we recommend that future studies should try to integrate functional diversity across spatial scales in this case from grid cells to the whole amazon basin as described in carmona et al 2016 5 concluding remarks in this study we show that incorporating trait variability in a vegetation model improves accuracy in representing ecosystem functioning and also plays an import role on ecosystem response to climate change the trait based modeling approach allows for a more in depth analysis on the mechanisms that connect ecosystem functioning and the different components of functional diversity with the pls approach we show that the traits diversity allows the community to functionally reorganize under environmental changes occupying a greater amount of functional space and increasing the occurrence of strategies that deal better with the applied lower water availability higher investment in fine roots investment in roots at the expense of investment in leaves and wood led to a relatively lower total carbon storage functional reorganization also triggered changes in the primary components of functional diversity increase in richness and evenness and decrease in divergence on the other hand the use of a small number of pfts restrict changes in the functional structure of the community leading to a more expressive impact of environmental change on ecosystem functioning in addition pft approach hinders the assess to functional diversity analyses this study brings further evidence that the inclusion of trait variability may have implications for modeling the so called amazon tipping point lovejoy and nobre 2018 since a trait based like approach would potentially yield more subtle but not necessarily less relevant responses of the forest

24182,the impacts of reduced precipitation on plant functional diversity and how its components richness evenness divergence and composition modulate the amazon carbon balance remain elusive we present a novel trait based approach the carbon and ecosystem functional trait evaluation caetê model to investigate the role of plant trait diversity in representing vegetation carbon c storage and net primary productivity npp in current climatic conditions we assess impacts of plant functional diversity on vegetation c storage under low precipitation in the amazon basin by employing two approaches low and high plant trait diversity respectively i a plant functional type pft approach comprising three pfts and ii a trait based approach representing 3000 plant life strategies plss the pfts plss are defined by combinations of six traits c allocation and residence time in leaves wood and fine roots we found that including trait variability improved the model s performance in representing npp and vegetation c storage in the amazon when considering the whole basin simulated reductions in precipitation caused vegetation c storage loss by 60 for both model approaches while the pft approach simulated a more widespread c loss and abrupt changes in neighboring grid cells we found that owing to high trait variability in the trait based approach the plant community was able to functionally reorganize itself via changes in the relative abundance of different plant life strategies which therefore resulted in the emergence of previously rare trait combinations in the model simulation the trait based approach yielded strategies that invest more heavily in fine roots to deal with limited water availability which allowed the occupation of grid cells where none of the pfts were able to establish the prioritization of root investment at the expense of other tissues in response to drought has been observed in other studies however the higher investment in roots also had consequences it resulted for the trait based approach in a higher root shoot ratio a mean increase of 74 74 leading to a lower vegetation c storage in some grid cells our findings highlight that accounting for plant functional diversity is crucial when evaluating the sensitivity of the amazon forest to climate change and therefore allow for a more mechanistic understanding of the role of

indicate that the amazon forest will experience more frequent and more extreme moisture stress in the 21st century lee et al 2021 moisture stress can induce biodiversity shifts including changes in functional diversity aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 esquivel muelbert et al 2018 and associated effects on vegetation carbon hereafter c storage da costa et al 2010 hubau et al 2020 however how these climatic changes will affect different components of functional diversity composition richness evenness and divergence carmona et al 2016 mason et al 2005 and the role functional diversity plays in determining vegetation c storage remains poorly understood esquivel muelbert et al 2017 2018 poorter et al 2015 sakschewski et al 2016 due to differences in life history strategies among plants adler et al 2014 reich et al 2003 functional diversity plays a vital role in determining ecosystem functioning and its responses to environmental changes díaz and cabido 2001 song et al 2014 cadotte 2017 ultimately functional traits delineate plant communities responses and effects to biotic and abiotic conditions and also shape ecosystem processes and functions such as vegetation c storage lavorel and garnier 2002 funk et al 2017 violle et al 2007 it is widely accepted that more taxonomically and functionally diverse communities are less impacted by environmental changes cadotte et al 2011 mori et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 schmitt et al 2019 the insurance hypothesis for example postulates that a higher diversity richness of plant functional strategies provides higher variability of plant functional responses under new environmental conditions mori et al 2013 yachi and loreau 1999 thus maintaining ecosystem functioning by providing a buffer effect against environmental fluctuations fauset et al 2015 lohbeck et al 2016 yachi and loreau 1999 such a buffering effect is expected through the process of functional density compensation which enables the functional composition of a community to reorganize and adjust to new environmental conditions thus enabling types of plants that previously exerted a less relevant functional role low density to increase their dominance and vice versa mori et al 2013 smith et al 2022 accordingly it has been suggested that environmental fluctuations lead to changes in the abundance of plant strategies that compose the communities and consequently changes on how the available functional trait space is occupied then redefining plant functional diversity components boersma et al 2016 carmona et al 2019 de bello et al 2021 enquist et al 2017 however there is no consensus under which condition whether environmental changes select traits and lead to homogenization decrease in functional diversity or allow multiple functional traits to persist generating diversification increase in functional diversity smith et al 2022 for example reduced precipitation was found to exert a strong environmental filter by selecting a subset of functional trait combinations that are more suitable to cope with moisture stress mouillot et al 2013a in such a scenario according to the optimal partitioning theory cannell and dewar 1994 metcalfe et al 2010 thornley 1972 a common strategy would be to invest more c to fine root production to acquire limiting belowground resources such as soil water and nutrients required for aboveground plant productivity such a selection for more conservative resource use would restrict the range of functional trait values and thus reduce the functional trait space occupied by the community lower functional richness cornwell et al 2006 funk et al 2017 kleidon et al 2009 on the other hand it has been found that disturbances especially intermediate disturbances can trigger an increase in the occupation of the functional trait space higher functional richness herben et al 2018 in line with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis bongers et al 2009 which predicts that local species diversity is maximized at an intermediate level of disturbance it has been suggested that also functional diversity should increase via the functional reorganization of the community allowing new ecological strategies to be more abundant in the communities smith et al 2022 vegetation models have been widely used to explore the fate of the amazon forest carbon balance under future potential climatic conditions cox et al 2004 galbraith et al 2010 huntingford et al 2013 lapola et al 2009 longo et al 2018 rammig et al 2010 some of these models project a dramatic loss in amazon forest c stocks due to reduced precipitation cox et al 2000 2004 lapola et al 2009 oyama and nobre 2003 most model simulations have not reproduced these patterns afterward but there is ongoing discussion on the likelihood of such projections levine et al 2016 malhi et al 2009 malhi et al 2018 lapola et al 2018 other models simulate an abrupt replacement of the dominant humid tree cover found in large parts of amazon forests with more arid affiliated vegetation under reduced precipitation hutyra et al 2005 salazar et al 2007 one of the underlying reasons that models are challenged by simulating unprecedent climatic conditions is their underrepresentation of plant diversity pavlick et al 2013 scheiter et al 2013 commonly models represent plant functions based on a very small and discrete set of pfts plant functional types and plant functional traits parameters are previously a priori defined prentice et al 2007 consequently the diversity of plant life strategies i e the combination of traits found in these model ecosystems is oversimplified and the emergence of alternative trait combinations in response to a changing environmental scenario is strongly limited or is not even captured due to the small number of pfts that compose the communities fyllas et al 2014 mori et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 as a result fixed a priori defined parameters commonly lead to an overestimation of the impacts of environmental changes due to abrupt changes in plant performance and establishment success berzaghi et al 2020 pavlick et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 verheijen et al 2015 and important mechanisms involved in ecosystem resilience such as the functional reorganization of the plant community enquist and enquist 2011 fauset et al 2012 2015 wieczynski et al 2019 are not represented in such model approaches the development of the models with a higher representation of trait variability so called trait based vegetation models e g fyllas et al 2014 joshi et al 2022 pavlick et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2015 scheiter et al 2013 schmitt et al 2019 is an attempt to overcome these limitations of underrepresenting functional diversity with pfts such a modeling approach allows replacing the small number of pfts with a more realistic representation of functional diversity and thus increasing the representation of possible functional traits combinations by several orders of magnitude pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2014 webb et al 2010 wullschleger et al 2014 this provides the opportunity to explore multiple aspects of plant ecology and community composition in combination with biogeochemical fluxes and pools berzaghi et al 2020 sakschewski et al 2016 zakharova et al 2019 for example trait based vegetation models are able to explore the role of different components of plant functional diversity on ecosystem functioning the processes that determine community assembly and structure and how these interact with environmental changes fisher et al 2018 mason et al 2005 mouillot et al 2013b song et al 2014 an increasing number of trait based models has been applied to understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning and the role of functional diversity on these impacts nonetheless most of the functional ecological aspects highlighted in the scientific literature remain underexplored but see hofhansl et al 2021 few studies applying trait based vegetation models have explored how environmental changes affect plant functional diversity per se and when they do the focus is specially on functional richness pappas et al 2015 sakschewski et al 2016 scheiter et al 2013 none of them investigated how these changes affect the underlying components of functional diversity i e functional richness evenness and divergence and how these different components affect ecosystem functioning hence despite the proposed mechanistic linkage between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning mason et al 2005 mouillot et al 2013b the ability of trait based models to conjointly capture plant functional diversity and ecosystem functional responses to environmental changes has yet to be tested building on these previous efforts we here present a new trait based vegetation model the carbon and ecosystem functional trait evaluation caetê model to assess the effect of including trait variability in vegetation models we compare two approaches of caetê a standard pft approach that represents vegetation through three pfts i e low functional diversity and a trait based approach hereafter called as pls approach that represents a higher level of functional diversity by using 3000 combinations of trait values that seeks to express the variability of plant life strategies plss found in nature six traits are used to characterize the pfts and the plss c allocation and c residence time in three plant structural compartments leaves wood and fine roots we compared the performance of the two modeling approaches in representing vegetation c storage and npp for the amazon basin region to evaluate whether plant trait diversity improves the representation of biogeochemical cycling we also applied a scenario of reduced precipitation in the study area and by comparing model results generated from either the low diversity i e pft versus the high diversity i e pls parameterization we assess whether the degree of plant functional diversity affects the response of ecosystem to moisture deficits using vegetation c stocks as an indicative additional analyses are made with pls approach to evaluate the impacts of lower water availability on simulated functional composition and functional diversity components richness evenness and divergence and its association with the impacts on c storage 2 material and methods 2 1 the caetê model an overview we present an overview of the caetê model and how the two used levels of diversity parametrization are defined in this study and for both approaches we employed a non transient version of the caetê model which calculates equilibrium solutions based on long term mean monthly climate variables the difference between the pft and the pls approach is only the degree of trait variability represented the model process formulations and principles are the same for both each plant functional type for pft approach or plant life strategy for pls approach represents an average individual like in lpj model sitch et al 2003 the next section presents the procedures of model setup for this study and the supplementary material sm 1 provides a more detailed description of the caetê model for the pls approach the underlying premise for creating the plss is that the range of values of a functional trait observed in nature can be regarded as one axis of a multidimensional hypervolume formed by the combination of n chosen functional traits fig 1 blonder 2017 villéger et al 2008 in that sense each point inside of this hypervolume is a unique combination of values for each of the functional traits representing a pls the values of traits that compose them are sampled from the complete range of values used as reference see sm 1 1 1 the volume occupied by the sampled traits can be seen as a potential functional space with tens of thousands of combinations like other trait based models e g pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2011 caetê assumes that sampling an appropriate number of plss from the potential functional space see sensitivity test in sm 2 combined with an environmental filtering mechanism allows the model to produce reasonable biogeochemical and functional diversity patterns on the other hand in its pft approach the model s user previously defines the number of pfts and their traits values are based on previous vegetation models the physiological processes and the interaction of each pls pft with the environment are determined by several functional traits for example the maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation eq sm 16 and nitrogen to carbon ratio on plant tissues eq sm 25 however in this study six functional traits are used to distinguish each pls or pft since the analyses presented here are focused on the assessment of vegetation c storage three traits represent the c allocation percentage of the npp distributed to different plant tissues compartments leaves fine roots and wood and the other three traits represented c residence time in the respective plant tissues the combination of allocation and residence time for each tissue define its c stock and then the total plant c stock the functional trait values assigned to each pls pft determine its ecophysiological behavior and its responses and effects to the environment for example each pls pft as a distinct combination of functional traits constitutes a differential way of storing c and capturing water and light thus the functional traits of a pls or a pft ultimately determine its performance and survivorship during each iteration in a daily time step the distinct performances of plss pfts determines the ecosystem scale processes and properties eq 6 such as gpp growth primary productivity evapotranspiration and c storage which together with environmental conditions will determine the composition of plss and pfts in each grid cell for the next iteration the performance is determined as the relative abundance eq 1 of a pls pft in a specific grid cell from now on the symbol i refers to an average individual of a pls or pft y to a grid cell and z to a plant compartment the values for the allocation α and residence time τ traits can be found on table sm 1 for the pls approach and on table sm 2 for the pft approach the relative abundance a r i y of a pls pft is the fraction of the grid cell that it occupies based on the relative contribution of this strategy to the total carbon stock in this grid cell c t y considering the number of living pls pft s 1 a r i y c i y c t y 2 c t y i 1 s c i y where c i y is the carbon stock of a pls pft eq 3 this procedure has support on the biomass ratio hypothesis grime 1998 which predicts that immediate effects of a species are proportional to its relative contribution to the total c storage of the community the c i y is the sum of carbon stored c z i y in each of the three plant compartments 3 c i y z 1 3 c z i y and the c z i y in a certain time step t is determined by the percentage of n p p i y allocated to each plant c compartment α z i and the carbon residence time τ z i in these compartments 4 d c z i y d t α z i n p p i y c z i y τ z i n p p i y is the carbon available for allocation derived from gross primary productivity g p p i y eq sm 3 discounting the costs of autotrophic respiration r a i y eq sm 23 5 n p p i y g p p i y r a i y from the relative abundances it is possible to aggregate the biogeochemical variables from the pls pft scale to the grid cell scale that is the flux or state of a variable in a grid cell is given by the sum of the values of this variable for each existing pls pft s weighted by their relative abundance for example the net primary productivity in a grid cell scale n p p g r i d y is 6 n p p g r i d y i 1 s n p p i y a r i y accordingly the composition of plss pfts and their respective traits in a grid cell determine ecosystem scale processes and properties each functional trait f is represented in a grid cell scale f g r i d y by a unique value which is the sum of this trait value f i y calculated for each pls pft alive in the grid cell weighted by their relative abundances a r i y 7 f g r i d y i 1 s a r i y f i y this community weighted mean value can be understood as the dominant trait value in a community díaz et al 2007 differential survival and performance between plss pfts are also possible because each functional trait is related to at least one trade off pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2014 trade offs are here defined as relationships of costs and benefits that impact the ecophysiological processes of a pls or functional type they ultimately determine the pls pft s performances and whether they will be able to deal with a specific environmental condition pavlick et al 2013 reu et al 2011 importantly the trade offs also prevent the model from enabling the survivorship of the so called darwinian demons law 1979 in other words optimal but rather unrealistic strategies that maximize all the functions that contribute to plant fitness and survival pavlick et al 2013 scheiter et al 2013 for example to respect mass conservation scheiter et al 2013 any c investment i e allocation and residence time traits combination in one tissue will always be at the expense of other investing c in leaves can increase photosynthesis rate by increasing solar radiation absorption eq sm 21 and sm 22 however such investment is at the expense of investing in fine roots which is responsible for water uptake also a limiting resource for photosynthesis eq sm 35 beyond that an intrinsic trade off emerges from the allocation traits per principle their combination for all plant tissues must add up to 1 and the traits combination that do not respect this rule is excluded before model starts running see sm 1 1 1 carbon allocation strategies also lead to indirect competitive ability for light what may also exclude life strategies see sm 1 6 the ecophysiological processes linked to each functional trait its trade offs and associated formulations are summarized in table sm 3 2 2 simulation setup for both caetê approaches we employed mean monthly climate variables and atmospheric co2 concentration from 1980 to 2010 for the amazon basin fig sm 1 at a spatial resolution of 0 5º x 0 5º see sm 1 2 for input data for the modeling experiment the precipitation was reduced in 50 for the same 1980 2010 monthly climatology used in the control this reduction was homogeneous it was applied for the whole period of the study and for all the grid cells equally we are aware that the frequency and intensity of droughts are not homogeneous over time or along environmental gradients across the basin furthermore this precipitation reduction is quite severe despite having occurred in isolated events in the past marengo et al 2008 and it is also within some projections cox et al 2000 2004 betts et al 2004 this massive decrease in water availability is also justifiable for modeling purposes as extreme scenarios can be used to test the sensibility of ecological processes and properties simulated then for this study we did not intend to make reliable predictions of drought for the region instead we used this 50 precipitation reduction scenario as a proof of concept and as a mean to test our hypotheses once the effects of extreme drought events to ecosystem processes and biodiversity it is still not entirely clear allen et al 2010 for the pft approach we defined 3 tropical pfts and their traits values were chosen based on those used by other vegetation models table sm 2 for the pls approach we used 3000 plss and this number was defined based on a sensitivity test see supplementary material sm 2 the ranges of values of each functional trait considered in this approach were based on empirical experimental literature and are presented in table sm 1 in both approaches all grid cells are initialized with the same set of plss or pfts under conditions that are analogous to bare soil however in each grid cell the plss pfts will perform differently such that some strategies will survive each of them occupying a different portion of the cell while others will be excluded from the spatial grain in the simulation and cannot be reestablished importantly for this study there is no repopulation of the pfts or plss excluded rather the model is run until equilibrium with 3000 plss 3 pfts and regular climate condition and after it is run again with the same 3000 plss 3 pfts but with reduced precipitation that is why it is possible that plss pfts can be excluded with regular climatic conditions but increase decrease their abundance with reduced precipitation before the model execution a model initialization phase is performed i to determine the initial c content in plant compartments and it is run until the attaining the stability attained for the total c stock i e the sum of c in all plant compartments in all the grid cells see details in sm 1 1 2 and ii to check the viability of each newly created pls see sm 1 1 1 after the initialization phase the model runs by continuously repeating the input data series under regular climate or under reduced precipitation until the stability of simulated results was attained 2 3 caetê performance evaluation the performance of the two modeling approaches in representing the spatial distribution of vegetation c storage and npp in the amazon region was compared with reference data for c storage we used data from baccini et al 2012 and saatchi et al 2011 and for npp the data came from modis npp project mod17a3 running and zhao 2021 these comparisons were made under current climatic conditions 1980 2010 we considered that 47 5 of living dry biomass from reference data is comprised of c thomas and martin 2012 following the reference data only the aboveground component was considered for the model performance evaluation we estimated the absolute difference between maps from caetê simulations and maps from reference data and a scatterplot analysis was performed to identify the trends in the model approaches simulations 2 4 assessing functional diversity and composition in this study we focused on large scale analyses of functional diversity and its components across the amazon basin it means that trait distributions used to evaluate functional diversity corresponds to the distribution of the set of dominant trait values obtained for each grid cell as explained in section 2 1 eq 4 as mentioned in the introduction using only a small number of pfts to represent variability precludes access to functional diversity analyses hence functional diversity analyses are here limited only to the pls approach functional diversity and functional composition of communities were analyzed both considering each functional trait independently single trait analyses and the combinations of traits multi trait analyses the single trait and multi trait analyses allow a broader understanding of how the community occupies the functional trait space and how it is functionally organized by computing its composition occurrence and abundance of trait values the relative dominance between trait values and the functional diversity components in the single trait analyses distribution curves were generated by using the functional traits occurrence following the study by carmona et al 2016 emphasizing that each trait value is derived from a grid cell in this method the full range of trait values is considered as the total functional trait space and the occurrence and abundance of the trait values express the occupancy of this space calculated through probability density distributions i e the trait probability density distributions from these distributions we assessed the three functional diversity components as defined by carmona et al 2016 i functional richness the amount of functional space occupied by the community i e the total range of trait values for a specific functional trait considering all organisms plss in our case ii functional evenness the regularity of the density distribution of the plss trait values in the functional trait space and iii functional divergence the degree to which the abundance of trait values of plss are distributed toward the extremes of their functional trait space for the multi trait analyses we used the hypervolume metric proposed by blonder et al 2014 which combines the distribution of n trait values to create a multidimensional functional space and calculates functional diversity component metrics within such a hypervolume the functional richness can be interpreted as the amount of volume that is occupied by the community relative to the potentially available functional space based on the frequency of trait values that compose this community the distribution of trait values around the centroid that is the variation around the mean value can be used to evaluate the functional composition of the system barros et al 2016 following the recommendation by barros et al 2016 we performed a principal component analysis pca with a centered and scaled method before creating the hypervolumes for more detail see sm 3 using the factor scores on the chosen principal components we were able to fulfill the statistical assumptions for constructing the hypervolumes despite the focus of our analyses being on the basin scale we made some additional functional diversity analyses on a finer scale using three spatial windows of 10 10 grid cells each along a northwest to southeast axis fig sm 2 looking into finer scales enables the evaluation whether the results obtained from the whole amazon basin scale analyses are not only a product of the natural environmental heterogeneity once the basin is well known to present a large scale variation in climatic and edaphic properties ter steege et al 2006 quesada et al 2012 sombroek 2000 2 5 assessing effects of decreased precipitation in the experiment of 50 reduction in precipitation we compared the degree of change in c stock between the two modeling approaches used in this study to evaluate if trait variability influences c storage under environmental change further from the results simulated by the pls approach we also evaluated the role of the different components of functional diversity in this change for this we assessed whether the plant communities were functionally reorganized in the scenario of reduced precipitation by computing the dissimilarity index degree of overlap between the trait probability density distributions from the regular climate scenario and those from the reduced precipitation scenario carmona et al 2016 this index varies from 0 completely functionally similar overlapping density curves to 1 completely functionally different no overlap to estimate the changes in hypervolumes due to precipitation reduction we computed their overlap degree through the jaccard similarity index which ranges from 0 completely different no overlap to 1 completely similar overlapping hypervolumes in addition we assessed whether a centroid displacement occurred with the applied precipitation reduction the displacement indicates how much the mean values of the communities were dislocated from their previous location within the hypervolume to test the degree of communities functional reorganization we analyzed the changes in trait abundance throughout the functional space generated by the trait probability density distributions from this analysis we were able to observe for example the exclusion of trait values and or the increase in the occurrence of trait values that were rare under regular climatic conditions to understand the impacts of precipitation reduction on functional diversity facets richness evenness and divergence for the single trait analysis we computed the percentage change in their values between regular and reduced precipitation climatic conditions for the multi trait analysis we compared the hypervolume sizes before and after the reduced precipitation application once change in volume sizes represents a shift in the community functional richness we also performed these analyses for the finer scale we estimated the change in trait distributions with reduced precipitation using the same method described before for single and multi traits but in this scale with focus on the functional reorganization of the community and on functional richness 3 results 3 1 caetê model performance evaluation within the studied region the pft approach simulates 127 9 pg c stored in aboveground c and the pls approach simulates 86 0 pg c while baccini et al 2012 estimates 80 2 pg c of total aboveground c stock and saatchi et al 2011 estimates 71 7 pg c in terms of spatial patterns in vegetation c storage both modeling approaches show over or underestimation in the values simulated the overestimation is especially concentrated in naturally drier areas for example in north western amazonia we also observed an overestimation along the basin edges which are known as regions of transition to drier areas fire prone vegetations and subject to the intensive land use haghtalab et al 2020 morton et al 2013 nobre et al 2016 however the caetê in its pft approach tends to show the overestimation in a much higher degree and in more locations throughout the basin with emphasis on the central region and basin edges when compared to the pls fig 2 on the other hand the pls approach tends to underestimate mean c values in some regions for example in the east and southwest parts of the basin the pls approach presented more areas with no differences between simulated and reference values white cells in figs 2b and e and a higher number of points closer to the 1 1 line in the scatter plot fig 2c and f thereby matching the values used as reference reasonably well the caetê model simulated a total annual npp of 122 3 pg c yr ¹ pft approach and 76 0 pg c yr ¹ pls approach for the amazon basin modis based estimation is 74 6 pg c yr ¹ running and zhao 2021 by comparing the npp simulated by caetê with remote sensing npp estimations modis running and zhao 2021 the pls approach revealed a reasonably good ability to capture broad spatial patterns of remotely sensed npp estimations modis running and zhao 2021 fig sm 3b and sm 3c despite an underestimation in the andean region and a small overestimation in the northwest central basin region in contrast using a small number of pfts resulted in a widespread and prominent overestimation for this variable fig sm 3b and sm3c except for the underestimation in the andean region 3 2 carbon stocks under reduced precipitation the 50 reduction in precipitation caused a widespread decrease in c stocks throughout the basin in both model approaches fig 3a and b when considering the whole basin total c loss was equal to 73 48 pg c and 49 43 pg c for the pft and pls approach respectively representing a similar percentage decrease compared to regular climatic conditions 57 75 for pft and 57 48 for pls approach however the spatial pattern of change was significantly distinct the pls approach was able to maintain c stocks in several grid cells where none of the pfts survived in the pft approach this difference is more evident in central amazon and naturally drier areas such as in the transition between the amazon forest and the cerrado savannah in the southeast furthermore the c losses simulated by the pls approach presents a smoother gradient between a grid cell value and its neighboring cells and across different basin regions unlike in the pft approach which shows more abrupt differences between grid cells surprisingly in grid cells where both modeling approaches maintained at least a minimum c stock the pft approach presented higher values when compared to those from the pls one fig 3a and b specific plant compartments also showed distinct patterns of changes when comparing the employed modeling approaches fig 3c and d for fine roots fig sm 4 for leaves and wood none of the compartments showed an increase in c stock with precipitation reduction except for the fine roots compartment in the simulation with the pls approach blue areas in fig 3d such an increase is more apparent in the transition between the amazon and cerrado and in the northeast part of the basin the increased investment in fine roots resulted in a rise in the root shoot ratio for the pls approach with an average increase of 74 7 in contrast to an average decrease of 7 7 for the pft approach 3 3 effects of reduced precipitation on functional composition after applying the precipitation reduction we found high dissimilarity index values close to 1 table 1 owing to changes in the trait probability density distributions for the six plant functional traits fig 4 these dissimilarities degrees indicate that the communities significantly changed in terms of their structure and composition under moisture stress for example trait composition shifted away from hyperdominance decrease in the peaks of the curves of a previously restricted range of values toward a density increase in other trait values that were previously rare very low density or absent fig 4 additionally the traits in the hypervolumes presented a pronounced modification in the way they occupy the functional space fig 5 the overlap degree between the hypervolumes of the two climatic scenarios yielded a value of 0 038 when considering the whole amazon finally the centroid showed a displacement after imposing the climatic alteration indicating a change in the communities mean values and compositions fig 5 beyond that with lower water availability the distribution of the single traits along the functional space showed a higher diversity of values that presented an increase in density that is a higher probability of occurrence which resulted in a much more diffuse distribution within the functional space fig 4 the same pattern of distribution along functional space observed for single traits arose when considering all traits combined through the hypervolumes an increase in the functional space occupation by the traits fig 5 the increase in density was observed in traits with higher carbon allocation values to fine roots lower carbon allocation to leaves and to wood fig 4a b and c also higher values for carbon residence time in leaves and fine roots but a decrease in wood fig 4d e and f regarding the analyses in the finer scale our results show the same pattern that was found when considering the large scale the whole amazon basin an increase in the occupation of the functional space for all the six functional traits in their probability distributions fig sm 5 and sm 6 and an increase in the volume occupied when considering the six traits together fig sm 7 the high dissimilarity indices between trait probability density distributions with regular climate and decreased precipitation table sm 4 together with the small overlap between hypervolume indicate that as well as found in the amazon basin scale the communities in the three 10 10 grid region underwent a functional restructuration 3 4 reduced precipitation impacts on functional diversity facets the alterations in the density distribution of functional traits drove changes in the three facets of functional diversity fig 6 functional richness and functional evenness increased in a level higher than 100 for all the six considered traits divergence had an increase of more than 200 for the leaf allocation trait while the other traits displayed a reduction in this facet fig 6c from a multi trait perspective there was an increase in richness due to the enlargement in the volume occupied by the communities within the functional space fig 5 under current climatic conditions the size of the volume that the data occupied was equal to 1 71 while under reduced precipitation we found a volume size of 47 84 on the finer scales like in the whole basin an increase in the range of trait values table sm 4 and in the volume occupied when considering the six traits together fig sm 7 indicate a rise in functional richness beyond that the curves from the trait probability density distributions fig sm 5 and sm 6 and table sm 4 showed a high distribution dissimilarity 1 and the hypervolumes regular climate and reduced precipitation presented a small overlap for the three analyzed regions 0 006 0 001 and 0 007 for the northwest the center and the southeast respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model performance our results indicate that the inclusion of trait variability in vegetation models may lead to considerable improvement when simulating the vegetation c cycle with current climatic conditions compared to reference data fig 2 and sm 3 our simulations with the pls approach were able to represent npp and vegetation c storage reasonably well and showed better agreement spatial distribution and total values than the pft approach improved accuracy in biogeochemical variables has already been observed in other pft based models when trait variability was added fyllas et al 2014 sakschewski et al 2015 verheijen et al 2013 trait variability confers a higher diversity of community responses to environmental filtering through climatic heterogeneity thereby allowing a more realistic simulation of plant community assembly keddy 1992 avoiding a complete switch in vegetation state such as a catastrophic amazon dieback lapola et al 2018 due to abrupt changes in plant performance and establishment success fyllas et al 2014 sakschewski et al 2015 scheiter et al 2013 both modeling approaches show some mismatch with regard to the reference maps such that there appears to be an overestimation of aboveground vegetation c storage and npp and especially so for the pft approach fig 2 and sm 3 this is because the pfts chosen from previous pfts implemented in other vegetation models are already parameterized to present a high performance or optimal trait combination in the climatic envelope found in regions dominated by tropical forests which allowed a more frequent occurrence of pfts with higher vegetation c storage scheiter et al 2013 verheijen et al 2013 furthermore both approaches show a tendency to overestimate vegetation c storage and npp at the edges and in the central northwestern amazon basin fig 2 and sm 3 these inconsistencies could be attenuated through the improvement of some caveats of the caetê model first such an overestimation can be linked to the lack of representation of human land use and fire for determining vegetation distribution in the model houghton et al 2001 saatchi et al 2007 another important caveat is that the model does not yet represent impacts on vulnerability to cavitation and embolism anderegg et al 2016 oliveira et al 2021 the lack of representation of human land use fire and plant hydraulics may be particularly important to achieve a more realistic representation of c storage in the edges of the basin eller et al 2018 joshi et al 2022 papastefanou et al 2020 rowland et al 2015 furthermore nutrient cycling nitrogen and phosphorus is not represented in our model and low soil nutrient availability in the amazon may limit vegetation c storage across the amazon basin fleischer et al 2019 yang et al 2019 it is important to highlight that despite using the maps produced by saatchi et al 2011 and baccini et al 2012 as reference these maps include other sources of uncertainties mitchard et al 2013 and therefore present different estimates of aboveground biomass across the amazon basin 4 2 reduced precipitation impacts on vegetation carbon storage comparing a pft with a trait based modeling approach we found that in accordance with previous literature enquist and enquist 2011 fauset et al 2012 2015 wieczynski et al 2019 the inclusion of trait variability in vegetation models in fact matters for projecting the impacts of environmental change in ecosystems although the two approaches applied in this study i e pft vs pls show similar changes with regard to total basin vegetation c budget spatial patterns showed that only considering this biogeochemical variable can hide important details about the mechanism in which trait diversity determines ecosystem functioning for example the inclusion of trait variability in the model avoided sharp boundaries especially in naturally in drier regions showing a more subtle less sensitive and probably more realistic change in c stock across the basin fig 3 when compared to models pft based that commonly simulate the amazon dieback cox et al 2000 2004 lapola et al 2009 oyama and nobre 2003 disturbances are expected to trigger shifts in the occurrence and abundance of species functional traits to adapt to the new environmental conditions aguirre gutiérrez et al 2020 barros et al 2016 esquivel muelbert et al 2018 such changes were well captured in our modeling experiment for the pls approach similarity dissimilarity indices for the single and multi trait perspectives together with centroid displacements showed that the functional structure and composition of the plant communities were significantly modified by the climatic forcing scenario this ability to functionally reorganize and cope with new climatic conditions in the pls approach allowed by trait variability was decisive to the effects of reduced precipitation on both the total and the spatial distribution of c vegetation storage trait variability allows for functional density compensation process that counterbalances losses or decreases in the dominance of plant life strategies thus decreasing the impact of perturbation on ecosystem functioning gonzalez and loreau 2009 mori et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 on the other hand in the pft approach alternative pfts are too few to compensate for losses in establishments hence this model approach prevents better suited trait combinations to establish leading to higher occurrence of grid cells in which none of the pft s survived fig 3 this severe effect of environmental change using a pft approach corroborates other modeling studies huntingford et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2016 our results reinforce the importance of functional diversity for maintaining ecosystem functioning and give support for the insurance hypothesis mori et al 2013 yachi and loreau 1999 thus strengthening the assumption that diversity can promote ecosystem stability tilman et al 2006 4 3 functional composition and the selection of plant life strategies the changes in functional composition and structure due to reduced precipitation in the pls simulation is supported by the dissimilarity similarity indices found between the trait probability density distributions and the hypervolumes respectively the centroids displacements also showed that the dominant values composition were modified with the new climatic condition this high capacity of communities in the pls approach simulations to functionally reorganize enabled shifts in functional community composition thus corroborating with the hypothesis of a selection toward plant strategies with higher investment in roots in drier climate conditions fig 4b and e the higher investment in roots simulated by the pls approach was to the detriment of investment in leaves fig 4a and d and woody tissue fig 4c and f thus leading to higher root shoot ratios higher root biomass enabled water uptake and allowed the community of the pls simulation to better deal with the imposed moisture stress and maintain c stocks or reduce the degree of biomass loss when compared to the simulation using pfts the prioritization of root investment at the expense of other tissues in response to drought has been observed in manipulative ecosystem experiments and from monitoring forest inventory plots doughty et al 2014 kannenberg et al 2019 rowland et al 2014 given the limited trait variability the pft approach did not show these changes in c investment increasing mortality rates and preventing the pfts from establishing in some grid cells thereby rendering the ecosystem more vulnerable in general fig 3a as predicted notwithstanding an unexpected result was that in some grid cells the amount of c stock in the pft was higher than that in the pls approach with the applied reduced precipitation fig 3a and b this occurred due to an increase in the root shoot ratio in the simulations with high trait variability that is c was allocated toward pools with shorter turnover times fine roots which result in less total vegetation c storage chave et al 2009 de kauwe et al 2014 although the increase in fine roots in the pls approach provides resistance to moisture stress thereby preventing the total loss of carbon in several grid cells it also led to lower vegetation c storage in some locations compared to the pft approach this result is contrary to the widely accepted paradigm that higher functional diversity maximizes ecosystem function cadotte 2017 tilman et al 1997 tilman et al 2014 our findings of the community wide reorganization and associated increase in trait variability in response to novel climatic conditions indicate that functional diversity per se does not necessarily maximize ecosystem functions and properties such as c storage chiang et al 2016 holzwarth et al 2015 but that functional diversity can influence ecosystem functions in more than one direction hooper et al 2005 shen et al 2016 in our study the functional composition and especially the dominant plant functional trait was more critical in determining the c stock than functional richness with other studies finding similar results chiang et al 2016 finegan et al 2015 ruiz jaen and potvin 2011 roscher et al 2012 overall this suggests that trait based modeling approaches can improve our mechanistic understanding of the linkage between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning 4 4 environmental changes modify functional diversity components our results from analyses of the pls approach showed that a reduction of precipitation modified the way that traits occupy the functional space fig 4 and 5 and as consequence the functional diversity facets fig 6 for example reduced precipitation led to a wider range of expressed trait values in functional space fig 4 and 5 and thus increased the community s richness fig 6a this increase in functional richness contradicts the expected outcomes from the environmental filtering hypothesis keddy 1992 grime 1998 boersma et al 2016 funk et al 2017 perronne and gaba 2017 our findings may be explained by a decrease in hyperdominance in response to simulated climate change which allowed a higher range of ecological strategies to become viable in accordance with the compensatory dynamics theory gonzales and loreau 2009 walker et al 1999 importantly these results provide further evidence that environmental filtering not always reduce trait diversity le bagousse pinget et al 2017 laughlin and laughlin 2013 and that functional richness can increase after disturbance especially so if environmental change mainly affects the dominant plant functional strategies boersma et al 2016 funk et al 2017 mouillot et al 2013a beyond that it is necessary to consider that the role of the environmental filtering as a driver of functional structure will strongly depend on the traits being considered de la riva et al 2017 the observed increase in functional richness is also certainly linked to the caetê functioning mechanism model experiment of reduced precipitation resulted in higher functional richness mainly to the increase in the range of traits values of traits related to roots c allocation and residence time which in turn thanks to the considered trade offs was metabolically balanced by increases in functional richness related to other traits in addition one could hypothesize that the overestimation of c storage in drier regions at the edges of the amazon basin would be the cause of higher simulated functional richness under reduced precipitation however it is more reasonable to first consider that at the community scale higher c stock may not be directly linked to functional richness for instance we found that despite the model simulates higher value for total c in the northwest of the amazon basin this region also showed lower functional richness than the southeast for all the functional traits beyond a smaller increase of functional richness with reduced precipitation table sm 4 and fig sm 5 and sm 6 and the concentration of trait values in certain restricted areas of the functional space volume could be one of the causes of such pattern there was an increase in evenness in all traits considered in the pls approach fig 6b the evenness increase is tightly related to the observed decrease in dominance and increase in the abundance of trait values that were very rare in regular climate condition evenness can also be interpreted as evidence of the effectiveness of using the functional niche space the higher the evenness is the higher the utilization of the total functional space is de la riva et al 2017 hillebrand et al 2008 mouillot et al 2011 therefore our results indicate that a change in the environment can force the community to better occupy the functional niche space thus providing a lower sensitivity to the applied reduced precipitation if the community presents sufficient variability in its trait values we observed a general decrease in divergence fig 6c which was caused by the strong decrease in abundance of previous dominant trait values which tended to concentrate at the extremes of functional spaces with the regular climate condition consequently other trait values concentrated along the functional axis that were not as abundant became significant for the community after the reduction in precipitation based on empirical evidence obtained by analyzing a disturbance gradient mouillot et al 2013a also found a decreasing divergence with greater disturbance which was attributed to a declining in the abundance of specialist species that were the most impacted by the disturbance in addition this decrease in divergence can be additional evidence that the frequency distribution of trait values in the functional niche space maximizes the total community variation in functional characters mason et al 2005 it could be argued that the observed changes in functional diversity especially the increase in functional richness can be attributed to the fact that we considered the whole amazon basin as a single ecological unit while it is known that a high environmental heterogeneity exists throughout the basin however a similar pattern was found across a gradient of precipitation sampled from the northwest center and southeast of the amazon basin fig sm 5 sm 6 and sm 7 this finding highlight that our results are not dependent on the spatial scale of analysis or the degree of environmental heterogeneity nevertheless to avoid a simplification of diversity when considering large spatial scales we recommend that future studies should try to integrate functional diversity across spatial scales in this case from grid cells to the whole amazon basin as described in carmona et al 2016 5 concluding remarks in this study we show that incorporating trait variability in a vegetation model improves accuracy in representing ecosystem functioning and also plays an import role on ecosystem response to climate change the trait based modeling approach allows for a more in depth analysis on the mechanisms that connect ecosystem functioning and the different components of functional diversity with the pls approach we show that the traits diversity allows the community to functionally reorganize under environmental changes occupying a greater amount of functional space and increasing the occurrence of strategies that deal better with the applied lower water availability higher investment in fine roots investment in roots at the expense of investment in leaves and wood led to a relatively lower total carbon storage functional reorganization also triggered changes in the primary components of functional diversity increase in richness and evenness and decrease in divergence on the other hand the use of a small number of pfts restrict changes in the functional structure of the community leading to a more expressive impact of environmental change on ecosystem functioning in addition pft approach hinders the assess to functional diversity analyses this study brings further evidence that the inclusion of trait variability may have implications for modeling the so called amazon tipping point lovejoy and nobre 2018 since a trait based like approach would potentially yield more subtle but not necessarily less relevant responses of the forest

24183,models coupling photosynthesis a n and stomatal conductance g s have been widely used for their estimation since it was found that a n and g s are correlated although a cubic equation for a n

in appropriate solutions and no physical and biological logic for selecting the appropriate solution in this study a method is proposed to solve these problems using a different expression of

biologically appropriate solutions this study showed that the proposed method can solve all the above problems and can provide an appropriate analytical solution for each of environmental conditions tested the proposed method can be used in various studies on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in the future keywords photosynthesis stomatal conductance analytical solution model cubic equation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are major determinants for the exchange of carbon and water between the land surface and atmosphere the land surface absorbs carbon through plant photosynthesis 130 pgc yr 1 which accounts for 12 3 times the carbon emissions from human activities 10 6 pgc yr 1 which cause climate change friedlingstein et al 2022 a similar amount of carbon is released from land surfaces through respiration by plants soil microbes and other organisms however on a net basis 3 1 pgc yr 1 of carbon is absorbed thereby the net carbon absorption mitigates carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and slows climate change and its impact shevliakova et al 2013 keenan et al 2016 water fluxes from land surfaces to the atmosphere can be divided into evaporation and transpiration the majority of which have been found to be attributed to transpiration through vegetation jasechko et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 stomata are the doors within plants between the land surface and atmosphere through which carbon and water vapor pass and their opening and closing in response to various environments affect the global carbon and water cycles accurate estimates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are therefore essential for understanding the global carbon and water cycles and for assessing future climate change and its impacts since the discovery of the linear relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance wong et al 1979 models that couple photosynthesis a n and stomatal conductance g s have been widely used wherein a photosynthesis model e g farquhar et al 1980 and a stomatal conductance model e g ball et al 1987 leuning 1995 medlyn et al 2011 including photosynthesis as an explanatory variable in addition to co2 concentration and humidity are incorporated although the coupled a n g s model can be solved numerically collatz et al 1991 baldocchi 1994 found that the numerical solutions can be unstable however the coupled a n g s model can be reduced to a cubic equation for a n with three analytical solutions and among the three solutions of the cubic equation only one solution is appropriate therefore usage of analytical solutions for the coupled a n g s model is an effective approach for avoiding the instability of numerical solutions further computation time can be reduced by using analytical solutions however the method proposed by baldocchi 1994 has the following problems problem i the appropriate solution among the three analytical solutions of the cubic equation may vary depending on the environmental conditions problem ii there are environmental conditions where analytical solutions do not exist problem iii the physical and biological logic to select one from the three analytical solutions remain unclear fig 1 shows the rubisco limited and rubp limited a n obtained according to the method described by baldocchi 1994 as humidity is varied from 0 to 1 based on this figure the appropriate solution changes in the low humidity region problem i and there is no solution in the low humidity region problem ii in the case that the appropriate solution varies determining the logic of which solution to choose is necessary but unclear problem iii therefore this study proposes a method to avoid the above problems in analytical solutions for the coupled a n g s model for c3 plants for this purpose polynomials that a n must satisfy for both a n 0 and a n 0 were first derived these polynomials are given under each case of the three photosynthetic constraints i e rubisco limited rubp limited and product limited when the polynomial was cubic a different expression of the analytical solutions from baldocchi 1994 was used to solve the problem of no solutions problem ii next a method to select the only appropriate analytical solution in case of multiple analytical solutions is proposed problem i and iii finally the feasibility of the proposed method under a wide range of environmental conditions was numerically tested 2 model and method 2 1 coupled a n g s model the coupled a n g s model used in the present study is based on collatz et al 1991 in the coupled a n g s model the net photosynthesis rate a n μmol m 2 s 1 is based on farquher et al 1980 and given by 1 a n min a c a j a p r d where a c a j and a p μmol m 2 s 1 indicate the rubisco limited rubp limited and product limited photosynthesis respectively r d μmol m 2 s 1 is dark respiration which is a function of leaf temperature t l k appendix a c a j and a p are expressed as 2 a c v cmax c i γ c i k c 1 o 2 p a k o 3 a j j c i γ 4 c i 8 γ 4 a p 0 5 v cmax where v cmax μmol m 2 s 1 is the maximum rate of carboxylation j μmol m 2 s 1 is the electron transport rate c i ppm is the internal leaf co2 concentration o 2 pa is the partial pressure of atmospheric o2 p a pa is the surface air pressure γ ppm is the co2 compensation point k c ppm and k o mmol mol 1 are the michaelis menten constants for co2 and o2 respectively v cmax γ k c and k o are the functions of t l appendix and j is the function of t l and q ab μmol m 2 s 1 which is absorbed photosynthetically active radiation par appendix o 2 is set at 20 900 pa the model of stomatal conductance for co2 mol m 2 s 1 is based on ball et al 1987 and given by 5 g sc g 0 c g 1 c r h a n c s a n 0 g 0 c a n 0 where c s ppm is co2 concentration at the leaf surface r h is relative humidity at the leaf surface and g 0 c and g 1 c are model parameters set at 0 00625 mol m 2 s 1 and 5 625 respectively oleson and lawrence 2013 note that the parameter values for g 0 c and g 1 c are those in oleson lawrence 2013 divided by 1 6 which is the ratio of diffusivity of h2o to co2 in case of a n 0 g sc is assumed to be the minimum g 0 c a n g sc and boundary layer conductance for co2 g bc mol m 2 s 1 are related by physical relationships as follows 6 a

c p a and c a are environmental variables which should be provided externally and a n g sc c i and c s are internal variables which are analytically solved from the equations 2 2 polynomial equations for a n according to the algebraic procedures described by baldocchi 1994 polynomial equations for a n can be derived from the coupled a n g s model as shown in table 1 the equations for rubisco limited a n and rubp limited a n are cubic equations under a n 0 whereas those under a n 0 are quadratic equations table 1 in other cases exact expressions for a n are obtained in the present study the equations for a n under a n 0 are expressed as f p a n 0 and those under a n 0 are expressed as f n a n 0 2 3 solutions to the equations for a n first an expression for the solutions of the cubic equation is presented baldocchi 1994 used viete s solution for the cubic equation press et al 2007 however viete s solution is an expression that assumes that all three solutions are real therefore no solution can be obtained when the number of actual solutions is one or two in this study the cardano formula discovered by del farro which can provide three analytical solutions including imaginary solutions was used when the cubic equation is expressed by the following equation 8 a x 3 b x 2 c x d 0 the analytical solutions are expressed as follows 9 x 1 b 3 a 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 10 x 2 b 3 a 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω 2 11 x 3 b 3 a 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω 2 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω where 12 p b 2 3 ac 3 a 2 q 2 b 3 9 abc 27 a 2 d 27 a 3 ω 1 3 i 2 when f p a n 0 is a cubic equation the three solutions are expressed as x1p x2p and x3p when f p a n 0 or f n a n 0 is a quadratic equation the two solutions are expressed as x1p and x2p or x1n and x2n where x1p and x1n have positive signs in the denominator 2 4 selection of appropriate solution in the coupled a n g s model the maximum number of possible real solutions are 5 5 and 2 for rubisco rubp and product limited a n respectively for a given environmental condition whether a n is positive or negative is not known until the calculation is completed for example in the case of rubisco limited a n there are at most three real solutions when a n 0 and at most two real solutions when a n 0 the total number of possible real solutions is at most five in this study the following method is proposed for selecting the appropriate solution among multiple analytical solutions method step 1 three requirements a b and c are imposed on possible solutions step 2 since there is always only one solution that satisfies requirements a b and c only one solution should be selected as the appropriate solution requirement a the solution must be a positive or zero real solution satisfying f p x 0 or a negative real solution satisfying f n x 0 requirement b g sc 0 requirement c c i 0 requirement a is the basic requirement that the solutions satisfy and requirements b and c are the physical and biological requirements for g sc and c i whether only one appropriate solution can be selected through the proposed method depends on whether the following hypothesis described in step 2 of the method is proven hypothesis there is always one solution that satisfies requirements a b and c if this is proved problems i and iii described in section 1 are solved and there is no need to consider the selection of the appropriate solution hence the specific objective of the present paper come down to prove the hypothesis it is likely to be difficult to analytically prove the hypothesis but not difficult to numerically test it under various environmental conditions the numerical method and results of this test are described in the sections 2 5 and 3 respectively 2 5 numerical test for the hypothesis to verify the hypothesis a wide range of possible values for the input variables were substituted into the coupled a n g s model and the analytical solutions were calculated table 2 shows the range of inputs and increments in total 238 483 120 212 environmental conditions were tested the calculations were coded with quadruple precision in fortran and the code was compiled using intel fortran ver 13 1 3 real and imaginary solutions were determined with 10 digits 3 results 3 1 test for hypothesis i it was found that there was always only one solution that satisfied requirements a b and c under the environmental conditions tested therefore hypothesis i is valid indicating that only one appropriate solution can be selected through requirements a b and c 3 2 a n for c3 plants fig 2 shows rubisco limited a n a c r d and rubp limited a n a j r d with r h changed from 0 to 1 under q ab 2300 μmol m 2 s 1 t l 300 k r h 0 7 u c 1 m s 1 p a 1013 hpa c a 400 ppm which form the standard environmental setting in this study x3p is selected when humidity is higher than about 0 2 in both cases of rubisco limited left and rubp limited right when humidity is lower x1p or x2p is selected the humidity at which the solution changes is different for a c and a j importantly only one solution is obtained for the entire range of r h even if solutions change and these different solutions are smoothly connected this means that the method proposed in this study works and solves the problems i ii and iii fig 3 shows the a n c i top and a n c a bottom curves for rubisco limited a n left and rubp limited a n right with c a changed from 0 to 1500 ppm in the standard environmental setting only one solution is available for the entire range of c a the a n c i and a n c a curves show that x3p a positive solution i e a n 0 is selected for almost all the range of c i and c a but x2n a negative solution i e a n 0 is selected at low c i and c a and the two different solutions are smoothly connected the result that a n becomes negative at low c i and c a is consistent with the existing theories and observations thus the results show that the method proposed in this study works fig 4 shows rubisco limited a n left and rubp limited a n right with q ab changed from 0 to 2300 μmol m 2 s 1 in the standard environmental setting first rubisco limited a n is not affected even with q ab changed this result is consistent with the theory in contrast rubp limited a n increases and saturates as q ab increases further when q ab is very small rubp limited a n becomes negative these are also expected based on the existing theories and observations even if different analytical solutions are selected the two solutions are smoothly connected therefore these results confirm that the method proposed in this study works to determine how the three requirements a b and c select only one appropriate solution fig 5 shows all the solutions for rubisco limited a n a c r d and g s and c i calculated from a n when r h is varied from 0 to 1 in the standard environment first the solutions satisfying requirement a are x1p at r h 0 0 01 and 0 03 1 x2p at r h 0 0 02 and x3p at r h 0 0 01 and 0 18 1 x1n and x2n do not satisfy requirement a next the solutions satisfying requirements b and c are x1p at r h 0 03 0 17 x2p at r h 0 0 02 and x3p at r h 0 18 1 hence the solutions satisfying all the requirements are x1p at r h 0 03 0 17 x2p at r h 0 0 02 and x3p at r h 0 18 1 thus requirements a b and c can select the only one appropriate solution in the entire region of r h fig 6 shows all the solutions for rubp limited a n a j r d and g s and c i calculated from a n further only one appropriate solution is selected through the three requirements a b and c for rubp limited a n a j r d similar to that for rubisco limited a n a c r d 4 discussion 4 1 solutions for problems baldocchi 1994 showed that the coupled a n g s model can be reduced to a cubic equation for a n and therefore analytical solutions can be obtained for a n however there was a region where no solution could be obtained because viete s solution was used for the analytical solutions fig 1 and problem ii this is because viete s solution assumes that all the solutions are real to solve this problem use of cardano s solution in the cubic equation was proposed then it was showed that there is no region where no solution can be obtained figs 2 4 thus problem ii was solved the present study also proposed three requirements for selecting the appropriate analytical solution in case of more than one analytical solution baldocchi 1994 concluded that one specific solution is appropriate based on simulations under a wide range of environmental conditions however at low r h the appropriate solutions change as shown in fig 1 problem i thus a method for selecting the only appropriate analytical solution is needed problem iii this study showed that the only appropriate analytical solution can be selected by imposing the physically and biologically obvious requirements g sc 0 and c i 0 requirements b and c in addition to the basic requirement that the solutions should be satisfied requirement a the proposed method is significant as it pays attention not only to a n but also to the physical and biological requirements for g sc and c i in selecting solutions the consideration of g sc and c i decisively help for selecting the appropriate solutions actually the numerical simulations under a wide range of environmental conditions proved there is always only one solution that satisfies requirements a b and c this indicates the existence and uniqueness of physically and biologically appropriate solution for the coupled a n g s model for c3 plants ensuring that one solution can be always selected without bothering even when there are multiple analytical solutions and the appropriate solutions changes thus problems i and iii were solved note that the only one solution is implicitly assumed to be appropriate although there is no objective method to prove it however if the number of solutions is one it is reasonable to assume that only one solution is appropriate if not the coupled a n g s model itself is wrong as an important challenge of the proposed method the existence and uniqueness of the solutions should be analytically proved although it was numerically proved in this study under a wide range of environmental conditions but specific values for model parameters e g v cmax 60 μmol m 2 s 1 achieving analytical proof is the ultimate goal 4 2 stomatal conductance models in coupled a n g s models in this study the bwb model ball et al 1987 was used as the stomatal conductance model when a n 0 and the minimum value of g s g 0 c when a n 0 however stomata respond to transpiration rate rather than humidity mott and parkhurst 1991 therefore rogers et al 2017 recommended the use of stomatal conductance models with vapor pressure deficit which is proportional to transpiration e g the leuning model leuning 1995 and medlyn model medlyn et al 2011 however even if the bwb model is replaced with the leuning or medlyn model in coupled a n g s models a cubic equation can be derived in the cases of rubisco limited and rubp limited and it is possible to obtain the only one appropriate analytical solution using the method presented here regarding stomatal conductance models when a n 0 recent studies have shown that the nighttime g s is not constant but has a linear relationship with a n as in the daytime yu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 hence it is better to use stomatal conductance models which respond to a n and the environment when a n 0 however a cubic equation can be derived even if any linear models to a n for stomatal conductance are used therefore the method presented here can be applied to a wide type of stomatal conductance models even for a n 0 although it has not been confirmed whether only one appropriate solution can be obtained when stomatal conductance models other than the bwb model are used for a n 0 4 3 coupled a n e g s and more integrated models in this study r h was provided externally but r h itself can be considered a variable determined from g s in this case the equations for determining evapotranspiration e mol m 2 s 1 should be included in coupled a n g s models i e coupled a n e g s models as follows 13 e 1 6 g sc e sat e s p a 14 e 1 4 g bc e s e a p a 15 r h e s e sat where e sat e s and e a are the partial pressures of vapor in the inner leaf at the leaf surface and in air respectively and 1 6 and 1 4 are factors for differences in diffusivity between co2 and h2o from the equations above the following equation for r h can be derived 16 r h 1 6 g sc e sat 1 4 g bc e a 1 6 g sc 1 4 g bc e sat coupling eq 16 with eqs 1 7 a fifth order equation with respect to g s can be derived therefore coupled a n e g s models should be numerically solved similarly longo et al 2019 also showed that a fifth order equation with respect to c i can be derirved from coupled a n e g s models thus the analytical solution for coupled a n g s models can be obtained when r h is provided externally furthermore leaf temperature t l can be an internal variable determined by energy balance between incoming radiation absorbed longwave radiation emitted sensible heat flux and latent heat flux as follows 17 r ab 2 ε σ t l 4 λ w h 2 o e ρ c p g bh t l t a where r ab w m 2 is the incoming radiation absorbed ε is the longwave emissivity σ w m 2 k 4 is the boltzman constant λ j kg 1 is

for heat nikolov et al 1995 and su et al 1996 proposed an integrated model of the coupled a n e g s models with eq 17 masutomi et al 2016a b presented a more integrated model that considers energy balance not only at canopy but also ground to internally calculate ground temperatures while it is certain that more integrated models can be presented it is impossible to analytically solve them 5 conclusions this study proposed a method to obtain the only appropriate analytical solution for coupled a n g s models for c3 plants the method was tested under a wide range of environmental conditions and the only appropriate analytical solution was actually obtained the proposed method is expected to be applied to various situations and models in future credit authorship contribution

surfaces to the atmosphere can be divided into evaporation and transpiration the majority of which have been found to be attributed to transpiration through vegetation jasechko et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 stomata are the doors within plants between the land surface and atmosphere through which carbon and water vapor pass and their opening and closing in response to various environments affect the global carbon and water cycles accurate estimates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are therefore essential for understanding the global carbon and water cycles and for assessing future climate change and its impacts since the discovery of the linear relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance wong et al 1979 models that couple photosynthesis a n and stomatal conductance g s have been widely used wherein a photosynthesis model e g farquhar et al 1980 and a stomatal conductance model e g ball et al 1987 leuning 1995 medlyn et al 2011 including photosynthesis as an explanatory variable in addition to co2 concentration and humidity are incorporated although the coupled a n g s model can be solved numerically collatz et al 1991 baldocchi 1994 found that the numerical solutions can be unstable however the coupled a n g s model can be reduced to a cubic equation for a n with three analytical solutions and among the three solutions of the cubic equation only one solution is appropriate therefore usage of analytical solutions for the coupled a n g s model is an effective approach for avoiding the instability of numerical solutions further computation time can be reduced by using analytical solutions however the method proposed by baldocchi 1994 has the following problems problem i the appropriate solution among the three analytical solutions of the cubic equation may vary depending on the environmental conditions problem ii there are environmental conditions where analytical solutions do not exist problem iii the physical and biological logic to select one from the three analytical solutions remain unclear fig 1 shows the rubisco limited and rubp limited a n obtained according to the method described by baldocchi 1994 as humidity is varied from 0 to 1 based on this figure the appropriate solution changes in the low humidity region problem i and there is no solution in the low humidity region problem ii in the case that the appropriate solution varies determining the logic of which solution to choose is necessary but unclear problem iii therefore this study proposes a method to avoid the above problems in analytical solutions for the coupled a n g s model for c3 plants for this purpose polynomials that a n must satisfy for both a n 0 and a n 0 were first derived these polynomials are given under each case of the three photosynthetic constraints i e rubisco limited rubp limited and product limited when the polynomial was cubic a different expression of the analytical solutions from baldocchi 1994 was used to solve the problem of no solutions problem ii next a method to select the only appropriate analytical solution in case of multiple analytical solutions is proposed problem i and iii finally the feasibility of the proposed method under a wide range of environmental conditions was numerically tested 2 model and method 2 1 coupled a n g s model the coupled a n g s model used in the present study is based on collatz et al 1991 in the coupled a n g s model the net photosynthesis rate a n μmol m 2 s 1 is based on farquher et al 1980 and given by 1 a n min a c a j a p r d where a c a j and a p μmol m 2 s 1 indicate the rubisco limited rubp limited and product limited photosynthesis respectively r d μmol m 2 s 1 is dark respiration which is a function of leaf temperature t l k appendix a c a j and a p are expressed as 2 a c v cmax c i γ c i k c 1 o 2 p a k o 3 a j j c i γ 4 c i 8 γ 4 a p 0 5 v cmax where v cmax μmol m 2 s 1 is the maximum rate of carboxylation j μmol m 2 s 1 is the electron transport rate c i ppm is the internal leaf co2 concentration o 2 pa is the partial pressure of atmospheric o2 p a pa is the surface air pressure γ ppm is the co2 compensation point k c ppm and k o mmol mol 1 are the michaelis menten constants for co2 and o2 respectively v cmax γ k c and k o are the functions of t l appendix and j is the function of t l and q ab μmol m 2 s 1 which is absorbed photosynthetically active radiation par appendix o 2 is set at 20 900 pa the model of stomatal conductance for co2 mol m 2 s 1 is based on ball et al 1987 and given by 5 g sc g 0 c g 1 c r h a n c s a n 0 g 0 c a n 0 where c s ppm is co2 concentration at the leaf surface r h is relative humidity at the leaf surface and g 0 c and g 1 c are model parameters set at 0 00625 mol m 2 s 1 and 5 625 respectively oleson and lawrence 2013 note that the parameter values for g 0 c and g 1 c are those in oleson lawrence 2013 divided by 1 6 which is the ratio of diffusivity of h2o to co2 in case of a n 0 g sc is assumed to be the minimum g 0 c a n g sc and boundary layer conductance for co2 g bc mol m 2 s 1 are related by physical relationships as follows 6 a

c p a and c a are environmental variables which should be provided externally and a n g sc c i and c s are internal variables which are analytically solved from the equations 2 2 polynomial equations for a n according to the algebraic procedures described by baldocchi 1994 polynomial equations for a n can be derived from the coupled a n g s model as shown in table 1 the equations for rubisco limited a n and rubp limited a n are cubic equations under a n 0 whereas those under a n 0 are quadratic equations table 1 in other cases exact expressions for a n are obtained in the present study the equations for a n under a n 0 are expressed as f p a n 0 and those under a n 0 are expressed as f n a n 0 2 3 solutions to the equations for a n first an expression for the solutions of the cubic equation is presented baldocchi 1994 used viete s solution for the cubic equation press et al 2007 however viete s solution is an expression that assumes that all three solutions are real therefore no solution can be obtained when the number of actual solutions is one or two in this study the cardano formula discovered by del farro which can provide three analytical solutions including imaginary solutions was used when the cubic equation is expressed by the following equation 8 a x 3 b x 2 c x d 0 the analytical solutions are expressed as follows 9 x 1 b 3 a 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 10 x 2 b 3 a 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω 2 11 x 3 b 3 a 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω 2 3 3 q 27 q 2 4 p 3 6 3 3 ω where 12 p b 2 3 ac 3 a 2 q 2 b 3 9 abc 27 a 2 d 27 a 3 ω 1 3 i 2 when f p a n 0 is a cubic equation the three solutions are expressed as x1p x2p and x3p when f p a n 0 or f n a n 0 is a quadratic equation the two solutions are expressed as x1p and x2p or x1n and x2n where x1p and x1n have positive signs in the denominator 2 4 selection of appropriate solution in the coupled a n g s model the maximum number of possible real solutions are 5 5 and 2 for rubisco rubp and product limited a n respectively for a given environmental condition whether a n is positive or negative is not known until the calculation is completed for example in the case of rubisco limited a n there are at most three real solutions when a n 0 and at most two real solutions when a n 0 the total number of possible real solutions is at most five in this study the following method is proposed for selecting the appropriate solution among multiple analytical solutions method step 1 three requirements a b and c are imposed on possible solutions step 2 since there is always only one solution that satisfies requirements a b and c only one solution should be selected as the appropriate solution requirement a the solution must be a positive or zero real solution satisfying f p x 0 or a negative real solution satisfying f n x 0 requirement b g sc 0 requirement c c i 0 requirement a is the basic requirement that the solutions satisfy and requirements b and c are the physical and biological requirements for g sc and c i whether only one appropriate solution can be selected through the proposed method depends on whether the following hypothesis described in step 2 of the method is proven hypothesis there is always one solution that satisfies requirements a b and c if this is proved problems i and iii described in section 1 are solved and there is no need to consider the selection of the appropriate solution hence the specific objective of the present paper come down to prove the hypothesis it is likely to be difficult to analytically prove the hypothesis but not difficult to numerically test it under various environmental conditions the numerical method and results of this test are described in the sections 2 5 and 3 respectively 2 5 numerical test for the hypothesis to verify the hypothesis a wide range of possible values for the input variables were substituted into the coupled a n g s model and the analytical solutions were calculated table 2 shows the range of inputs and increments in total 238 483 120 212 environmental conditions were tested the calculations were coded with quadruple precision in fortran and the code was compiled using intel fortran ver 13 1 3 real and imaginary solutions were determined with 10 digits 3 results 3 1 test for hypothesis i it was found that there was always only one solution that satisfied requirements a b and c under the environmental conditions tested therefore hypothesis i is valid indicating that only one appropriate solution can be selected through requirements a b and c 3 2 a n for c3 plants fig 2 shows rubisco limited a n a c r d and rubp limited a n a j r d with r h changed from 0 to 1 under q ab 2300 μmol m 2 s 1 t l 300 k r h 0 7 u c 1 m s 1 p a 1013 hpa c a 400 ppm which form the standard environmental setting in this study x3p is selected when humidity is higher than about 0 2 in both cases of rubisco limited left and rubp limited right when humidity is lower x1p or x2p is selected the humidity at which the solution changes is different for a c and a j importantly only one solution is obtained for the entire range of r h even if solutions change and these different solutions are smoothly connected this means that the method proposed in this study works and solves the problems i ii and iii fig 3 shows the a n c i top and a n c a bottom curves for rubisco limited a n left and rubp limited a n right with c a changed from 0 to 1500 ppm in the standard environmental setting only one solution is available for the entire range of c a the a n c i and a n c a curves show that x3p a positive solution i e a n 0 is selected for almost all the range of c i and c a but x2n a negative solution i e a n 0 is selected at low c i and c a and the two different solutions are smoothly connected the result that a n becomes negative at low c i and c a is consistent with the existing theories and observations thus the results show that the method proposed in this study works fig 4 shows rubisco limited a n left and rubp limited a n right with q ab changed from 0 to 2300 μmol m 2 s 1 in the standard environmental setting first rubisco limited a n is not affected even with q ab changed this result is consistent with the theory in contrast rubp limited a n increases and saturates as q ab increases further when q ab is very small rubp limited a n becomes negative these are also expected based on the existing theories and observations even if different analytical solutions are selected the two solutions are smoothly connected therefore these results confirm that the method proposed in this study works to determine how the three requirements a b and c select only one appropriate solution fig 5 shows all the solutions for rubisco limited a n a c r d and g s and c i calculated from a n when r h is varied from 0 to 1 in the standard environment first the solutions satisfying requirement a are x1p at r h 0 0 01 and 0 03 1 x2p at r h 0 0 02 and x3p at r h 0 0 01 and 0 18 1 x1n and x2n do not satisfy requirement a next the solutions satisfying requirements b and c are x1p at r h 0 03 0 17 x2p at r h 0 0 02 and x3p at r h 0 18 1 hence the solutions satisfying all the requirements are x1p at r h 0 03 0 17 x2p at r h 0 0 02 and x3p at r h 0 18 1 thus requirements a b and c can select the only one appropriate solution in the entire region of r h fig 6 shows all the solutions for rubp limited a n a j r d and g s and c i calculated from a n further only one appropriate solution is selected through the three requirements a b and c for rubp limited a n a j r d similar to that for rubisco limited a n a c r d 4 discussion 4 1 solutions for problems baldocchi 1994 showed that the coupled a n g s model can be reduced to a cubic equation for a n and therefore analytical solutions can be obtained for a n however there was a region where no solution could be obtained because viete s solution was used for the analytical solutions fig 1 and problem ii this is because viete s solution assumes that all the solutions are real to solve this problem use of cardano s solution in the cubic equation was proposed then it was showed that there is no region where no solution can be obtained figs 2 4 thus problem ii was solved the present study also proposed three requirements for selecting the appropriate analytical solution in case of more than one analytical solution baldocchi 1994 concluded that one specific solution is appropriate based on simulations under a wide range of environmental conditions however at low r h the appropriate solutions change as shown in fig 1 problem i thus a method for selecting the only appropriate analytical solution is needed problem iii this study showed that the only appropriate analytical solution can be selected by imposing the physically and biologically obvious requirements g sc 0 and c i 0 requirements b and c in addition to the basic requirement that the solutions should be satisfied requirement a the proposed method is significant as it pays attention not only to a n but also to the physical and biological requirements for g sc and c i in selecting solutions the consideration of g sc and c i decisively help for selecting the appropriate solutions actually the numerical simulations under a wide range of environmental conditions proved there is always only one solution that satisfies requirements a b and c this indicates the existence and uniqueness of physically and biologically appropriate solution for the coupled a n g s model for c3 plants ensuring that one solution can be always selected without bothering even when there are multiple analytical solutions and the appropriate solutions changes thus problems i and iii were solved note that the only one solution is implicitly assumed to be appropriate although there is no objective method to prove it however if the number of solutions is one it is reasonable to assume that only one solution is appropriate if not the coupled a n g s model itself is wrong as an important challenge of the proposed method the existence and uniqueness of the solutions should be analytically proved although it was numerically proved in this study under a wide range of environmental conditions but specific values for model parameters e g v cmax 60 μmol m 2 s 1 achieving analytical proof is the ultimate goal 4 2 stomatal conductance models in coupled a n g s models in this study the bwb model ball et al 1987 was used as the stomatal conductance model when a n 0 and the minimum value of g s g 0 c when a n 0 however stomata respond to transpiration rate rather than humidity mott and parkhurst 1991 therefore rogers et al 2017 recommended the use of stomatal conductance models with vapor pressure deficit which is proportional to transpiration e g the leuning model leuning 1995 and medlyn model medlyn et al 2011 however even if the bwb model is replaced with the leuning or medlyn model in coupled a n g s models a cubic equation can be derived in the cases of rubisco limited and rubp limited and it is possible to obtain the only one appropriate analytical solution using the method presented here regarding stomatal conductance models when a n 0 recent studies have shown that the nighttime g s is not constant but has a linear relationship with a n as in the daytime yu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 hence it is better to use stomatal conductance models which respond to a n and the environment when a n 0 however a cubic equation can be derived even if any linear models to a n for stomatal conductance are used therefore the method presented here can be applied to a wide type of stomatal conductance models even for a n 0 although it has not been confirmed whether only one appropriate solution can be obtained when stomatal conductance models other than the bwb model are used for a n 0 4 3 coupled a n e g s and more integrated models in this study r h was provided externally but r h itself can be considered a variable determined from g s in this case the equations for determining evapotranspiration e mol m 2 s 1 should be included in coupled a n g s models i e coupled a n e g s models as follows 13 e 1 6 g sc e sat e s p a 14 e 1 4 g bc e s e a p a 15 r h e s e sat where e sat e s and e a are the partial pressures of vapor in the inner leaf at the leaf surface and in air respectively and 1 6 and 1 4 are factors for differences in diffusivity between co2 and h2o from the equations above the following equation for r h can be derived 16 r h 1 6 g sc e sat 1 4 g bc e a 1 6 g sc 1 4 g bc e sat coupling eq 16 with eqs 1 7 a fifth order equation with respect to g s can be derived therefore coupled a n e g s models should be numerically solved similarly longo et al 2019 also showed that a fifth order equation with respect to c i can be derirved from coupled a n e g s models thus the analytical solution for coupled a n g s models can be obtained when r h is provided externally furthermore leaf temperature t l can be an internal variable determined by energy balance between incoming radiation absorbed longwave radiation emitted sensible heat flux and latent heat flux as follows 17 r ab 2 ε σ t l 4 λ w h 2 o e ρ c p g bh t l t a where r ab w m 2 is the incoming radiation absorbed ε is the longwave emissivity σ w m 2 k 4 is the boltzman constant λ j kg 1 is latent heat of vaporization w h 2 o kg mol 1 is the molar weight of vapor ρ kg m 3 is the density of air c p j k 1 kg 1 is the specific heat of water and g bh m s 1 is the boundary layer conductance for heat nikolov et al 1995 and su et al 1996 proposed an integrated model of the coupled a n e g s models with eq 17 masutomi et al 2016a b presented a more integrated model that considers energy balance not only at canopy but also ground to internally calculate ground temperatures while it is certain that more integrated models can be presented it is impossible to analytically solve them 5

24184,cnidaria marine invertebrates that include reef building stony corals often rely on photosynthetic endosymbionts to obtain the energy they need for growth increased temperatures and or nutrient pollution can disrupt mutualistic properties of the symbiosis leading to host mortality however the precise mechanism by which this dysbiosis occurs is still unclear sea anemones other cnidarians that may host algal endosymbionts are used as a model organism for the coral holobiont to understand the costs and benefits of symbionts but the exact nature of the costs of symbionts on the hosts is still unclear here we developed a dynamic energy budget deb model and fit the model to data from the anemone exaiptasia pallida and its endosymbiotic algae breviolum minutum in order to identify the most likely mechanism of symbiont costs in order to match the laboratory dataset our model needed an explicit symbiont demand term in which the symbiont can consume host tissue to forcibly extract nitrogen the model demonstrates the role of the symbiont as an amplifier of the host s state a growing anemone grows better with symbionts while a malnourished anemone looses biomass faster with a symbiont than without this model allows us to project cnidaria holobiont growth as a function of environmental conditions and adds a new framework for which to capture the direct cost a symbiont has on cnidaria hosts keywords deb model mutualism parasitism anemone cnidaria symbiodiniaceae endosymbiosis data availability the code for this project has been implemented in wolfram mathematica 13 2 the code is freely available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7699157 1 introduction coral reefs are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet crossland et al 1991 fisher et al 2015 this biodiversity is supported by a symbiotic relationship that stony corals and some other cnidaria share with photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the family symbiodiniaceae cnidarian hosts obtain photosynthate from their algal endosymbionts in exchange for nitrogen this increases nutrient recycling efficacy and supports coral growth in nutrient poor environments muscatine and porter 1977 however the close relationship between cnidaria and their algal symbionts can break down under thermal stress resulting in the symbionts being expelled from the cnidaria tissue a phenomenon referred to as coral bleaching van oppen and lough 2018 as climate change increases the frequency and severity of coral bleaching it is important to understand this mutualism between cnidarians and their symbionts especially conditions in which this mutualism degrades and potentially becomes parasitic hughes et al 2018 to understand the balance of mutualism and parasitism in cnidarian dinoflagellate symbioses we need to understand the translocation of nutrients between the host and symbiont it is well known that cnidarian hosts share nitrogen and other nutrients with their symbionts while symbionts share carbohydrates with their hosts clayton and lasker 1984 farrant et al 1987 muscatine and cernichiari 1969 the exact mechanism of translocation of nutrient between host and symbiont is still not fully understood one supported mechanism for the translocation of nutrients from symbiont to host is that the host releases a host release factor hrf that encourages the symbiont to share photosynthate with the host rather than storing the photosynthate for its own use davy and cook 2001 grant et al 2006 davy et al 2012 a potential way to approximate this dynamic is by assuming that the symbiont uses some photosynthetically acquired carbon for growth and shares the remaining carbon with the host the host only receives leftover carbon from photosynthesis reverse translocation of nutrients from the host to the symbiont is significantly less well understood davy et al 2012 the symbiont receives phosphate and nitrogen in the form of ammonium n h 4 davy et al 2012 the symbiont may also receive carbon from the host cook 1972 davy et al 2012 though reverse translocation of carbon is thought to be minor in comparison to the products of photosynthesis especially in well lit environments falkowski and raven 2013 davy et al 2012 cornwall 2017 though symbionts hosted by acropora corals may acquire and use carbon from the host it is suggested that symbionts in the anemone exaiptasia pallida do not jinkerson et al 2022 furthermore some isolated symbiodinium have been shown to be capable of feeding jeong et al 2012 and there are many examples of symbiodinium heterotrophically acquiring nutrients from a host baker et al 2018 steen 1987 tremblay et al 2016 steen 1988 indeed some symbiodinium have been shown to impose significant and potentially fatal heterotrophic burdens on the host siegel 1960 steen 1986 peng et al 2020 the shift from mutualism to parasitism of symbiodinium under different environments has been reported in excavating sponges fang et al 2017 in jellyfish sachs and wilcox 2006 and in the gastropod strombus gigas banaszak et al 2013 to understand the shift from mutualism to parasitism in corals scientists often use the sea anemone e pallida as a model system e pallida shares many characteristics with corals but it is easy to maintain in the laboratory and can survive with or without symbionts this allows for studies that vary conditions for inoculated and aposymbiotic anemones to understand the impacts the symbionts have on the anemone peng et al 2020 studied the impact that food deprivation stress has on the mutualism parasitism balance found in e pallida they grew anemones inoculated with the endosymbiotic alga brevolium minutum and aposymbiotic anemones under fed and starved conditions and measured the changes in the symbiotic and anemone population over 8 weeks this study showed a surprising amplification effect of symbionts on anemone performance while well fed anemones grew faster with symbionts than without them starved anemones shrank and died much faster when they were inoculated with symbionts this amplifying effect shows the important role the environmental conditions have on the balance between mutualism and parasitism there are a few existing models that describe the transfer of nutrients between the host and the symbiont in cnidarian dinoflagellate systems muller et al 2009 cunning et al 2017 xu et al 2022 these models do not directly capture the significant cost a symbiont can incur on a host which is evident in the starved anemone in the experiments by peng et al 2020 and other examples of symbiont parasitism in cnidarian dinoflagellate systems stat et al 2008 wooldridge 2010 to close this gap we constructed a dynamic energy budget deb model of the interactions between an anemone host and its symbiotic algae including mechanisms through which the symbiont not only shares carbon with the host but also inflicts a metabolic burden deb models describe the rate of nutrient assimilation and utilization of organisms as a function of their environments van der meer 2006 nisbet et al 2000 kooijman 2001 simplified deb models and theory have previously been used to describe nutrients exchange between a tree s roots and a tree s shoots russo et al 2022 similarly our deb model describes the nutrient exchange between e pallida and b minutumas seen in the experiments of peng et al 2020 we built this model based on the assumption that the host only receives leftover carbon and we approximated reverse translocation and the metabolic cost of the symbiont on the host as the symbiont consumes the host we tested the ability of this approximation to capture the amplification effect found by peng et al 2020 we parameterized the model with the 6 data sets provided by peng et al 2020 to validate the model once validated we perturbed the model to simulate variations in environmental conditions and original parameters to extend the model predictions 2 methods 2 1 model description to understand how resource translocation explains the symbiont amplification effect seen in peng et al 2020 we developed a bio energetic model that focuses on the nitrogen and carbon dynamics of the system to describe this system we considered two state variables host biomass h and symbiont biomass s we focused on nitrogen and carbohydrates as the nutrients that mediate the relationship between the host and its symbionts a diagram of this system is shown in fig 1 the parameters used to describe this system are listed in table 2 and state variables and fluxes are in table 1 we used two ordinary differential equations odes to describe the rate of change of the host biomass h and the symbiont biomass s over time 1 d s d t j s g j s t 2 d h d t j h g j h t here j s g is the symbiont growth rate j s t is the symbiont turnover rate j h g is the host growth rate and j h t is the host turnover rate turnover rate is the rate at which biomass is lost including natural mortality the change in symbiont biomass over time is described as the difference between total symbiont growth rate and symbiont turnover rate similarly the rate of change of the host biomass is described as the difference between total host growth rate and total host turnover rate the growth of the symbiont is dependent on how much nitrogen and carbon the symbiont has at any given time the total symbiont growth rate is described as 3 j s g m i n j s c n s n 1 j s n where j s c is the total flux of carbon to the symbiont and j s n is the total flux of nitrogen to the symbiont the parameter n s n is the nitrogen to carbon ratio of the symbiont we used n s n to adjust moles nitrogen to moles carbon needed for symbiont growth the symbiont follows liebig s law of the minimum and grows at a rate determined by the stoichiometrically limiting nutrient von liebig 1841 the total symbiont turnover rate j s t is described as 4 j s t d s s where d s is the per symbiont death rate in this model the symbiont only acquires nitrogen through consuming the host so j s n is the total symbiont consumption of the host f s h 5 j s n y n n h n f s h adjusted by the conversion efficiency of host nitrogen to symbiont nitrogen y n furthermore the function f s h describes the total consumption of the host by the symbionts in units of carbon moles therefore the nitrogen to carbon ratio of the host n h n is used to adjust moles of host carbon to moles of host nitrogen the symbiont can acquire carbon from photosynthesis at rate p and from consuming the host 6 j s c p s in e pallida the symbionts do not receive carbon or cannot grow only using host carbon jinkerson et al 2022 the host growth j h g also follows liebig s law of the minimum and grows at a rate determined by the stoichiometrically limiting nutrient von liebig 1841 the total host growth rate is described as 7 j h g m i n j h c n h n 1 j h n where j h c is the flux of carbon to the host and j h n is the flux of nitrogen to the host since the host biomass is measured in carbon moles the flux of nitrogen j h n is converted to carbon moles with the parameter n h n the parameter n h n is the nitrogen to carbon ratio of the host the turnover of the host is dependent on the base mortality of the host d h and the mortality caused by the symbiont consuming the host f s h 8 j h t f s h d h h the host can only acquire nitrogen through feeding which we assume is proportional to the hosts surface the nitrogen uptake rate of the host is thus 9 j h n r n h 2 3 where h 2 3 is proportional to the surface of the host and r n is the surface specific nitrogen uptake rate of the host the host can acquire carbon both through leftover carbon from the symbiont at rate b and from surface specific uptake at rate r c 10 j h c b r c h 2 3 where h 2 3 is proportional to the surface of the host furthermore we assumed that the host only receive the leftover photosynthate that the symbiont would otherwise be allocating to long term storage davy and cook 2001 grant et al 2006 davy et al 2012 therefore the translocation of carbon from the symbiont to the host b is defined as 11 b j s c j s g the function b is the total amount of carbon fixed by the symbiont minus the amount of carbon the symbiont uses for its own growth we will use a holling type ii functional response of the per symbiont consumption of the host h s to approximate the total metabolic cost of the symbiont on the host and the translocation of nutrients from the host to the symbiont the holling type ii functional response is characterized as a decelerating rate of consumption of prey by the predator as prey density increases eventually reaching an asymptote holling 1959 here we classify the symbiont as the predator consuming the host which is interpreted as the prey the function 12 f s h s a h s 1 a w h s 13 s a h s a w h describes the total consumption of the host by the symbiont in the system the parameter a is the attack rate of the symbiont on the host which is the initial slope of the functional response the parameter w is the symbiont handling time the average time for a unit of symbiont to handle a unit of host putting together all parts of the model the full equations are 14 d s d t m i n p s a h n h n s y n s n s n a h n s n w d s s 15 d h d t a h s s a h w d h h m i n h 2 3 r n n h n h 2 3 r c p s m i n p s a h n h n s y n s n s n a h n s n w we parameterized this model with the data from peng et al 2020 in order to use the data provided by peng et al 2020 we first converted from units of anemone base area mm 2 and number of symbiont cells to mol c of host h and mol c of symbiont s our method for biomass conversion is shown in appendix a we used a log likelihood approach to optimize the model fit for the peng et al 2020 data our parameter fitting method is described in appendix b to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter values we used the bias corrected and accelerated b c a bootstrapping method which is shown in appendix c all model fitting and model analysis was doen in mathematica 13 2 wolfram research inc 2021 3 results 3 1 the model reproduces observed anemone symbiont dynamics our model both qualitatively and quantitatively captures anemone and algal dynamics observed by peng et al 2020 fig 2 the model captures the increase in anemone biomass under fed conditions and the decrease in the anemone biomass under starved conditions the model also captures the two different symbiont dynamics found in the inoculated treatments while the model fits the data well there are some small differences between the model predictions and the data particularly the symbiont biomass in the starved treatment did not peak at the same magnitude as the data fig 2e furthermore the model predicts a constant decline of the host biomass in the starved inoculated treatment rather than a period of no change in the first four weeks followed by a quick decline as seen in the data fig 2c it is unclear why starved anemones with symbionts do not lose biomass immediately in the peng et al 2020 study it may be that the host is still digesting food that was eaten before the start of the experiment and using carbon from the symbiont to maintain the same biomass before the host runs out of undigested food and begins to lose biomass despite some differences in the data and the model predictions the model captures the key dynamics of the system we also explored the equilibrium dynamics of the model and found that a fed host with symbiont has a much higher equilibrium biomass than a fed host without symbiont figure s1 furthermore the symbiont is predominantly nitrogen limited regardless of initial biomass of the host and symbiont at the fitted parameter values while the host shifts from carbon limited to nitrogen limited as the symbiont biomass increases figure s2 3 2 mutualism and parasitism balance in varied environmental conditions and parameter values a vital component of this system as described by peng et al 2020 is the switch from mutualism in fed anemone to parasitism in starved anemone to quantify the effect of the symbiont on the host we define δ as a measure of the magnitude of mutualism or parasitism in the system at a given set of parameters we calculate δ as the difference between the model predictions of inoculated host biomass h i and the model prediction of aposymbiotic host biomass h a at a given set of parameter values 16 δ h i h a we compute δ after 8 weeks of simulation following the 8 week experiment duration used by peng et al 2020 for δ 0 the relationship is parasitic as the symbiont decreases the host s biomass over time starved anemone fig 3a for δ 0 the relationship is mutualistic as the symbiont increases the host s biomass over time fed anemone fig 3b we plotted δ as a function of one parameter at a time while holding all other parameter values constant at their fitted parameter values fig 4 the most dominant trend shown throughout these figures is that when the host is carbon limited and the symbiont provides more carbon to the host than the cost of hosting a symbiont then δ 0 and the system is mutualistic when the host is nitrogen limited or the carbon cost of hosting a symbiont outbalances the carbon shared from the symbiont then δ 0 and the system is parasitic see figure s3 for exploration of how nutrient limitation produces the dynamics observed in fig 4 particularly varying attack rate a initially increases δ as the symbiont has more access to nitrogen but once the cost of a hight attack rate begins to outweigh the benefit δ decreases below zero increasing handling time w decreases δ as the symbiont gains less nitrogen from the host varying photosynthesis rate p initially decreases δ as the symbiont can survive and are costly to the host but do not share carbon further increasing p results in more carbon shared to the host and δ increases varying host to symbion nitrogen conversion efficiency y n initially decreases δ as the symbiont can survive but does not share significant carbon further increasing y n results in more carbon shared with the host and δ increases increasing symbiont mortality rate d s decreases δ as this parameter makes the symbiont lose biomass and thus becomes less beneficial increasing host mortality rate d h decreases δ as the host dies quickly regardless of the symbiont increasing host carbon uptake rate r c initially increases δ as the symbiont supplements the host s carbon but once the host becomes nitrogen limited and acquires all the needed carbon on its own the symbiont is just a cost initial increases in the host nitrogen uptake rate r n decreases δ extra nitrogen helps the host maintain biomass at the beginning of the experiment but also allows significant symbiont population growth leading to an overshoot of symbiont where the host biomass collapses rapidly further increasing r n inverts the trend leading to an increase in δ as the extra nitrogen allows the host to sustain a beneficial symbiont population simulations of this mechanism are shown in figure s7 in the supplementary materials we further investigated the effect of two environmental factors known to strongly impact cnidarian systems nutrient availability and light conditions falkowski et al 1984 morris et al 2019 fig 5 we jointly varied nutrient availability and light condition to explore the combined impacts on the symbiont host symbiosis we approximated nutrient availability with a combined host uptake rate r which determines host carbon uptake rate as r c r and host nitrogen uptake as r n γ r hereby γ is the ratio of nitrogen uptake rate to carbon uptake rate of the fitted parameter values γ r n r c 1 466 further we approximated changes in the light availability by directly altering the photosynthetic rate p the system is predominant parasitic at low photosynthesis rates and predominantly mutualistic at higher photosynthesis rate fig 5a changes in photosynthesis have similar impacts on δ regardless of combined uptake rate though the effect of increasing p is amplified at higher uptake rates fig 5b at low photosynthesis rates there is little to no carbon shared from the symbiont to the host so the cost of hosting a symbiont is greater than the benefit and δ 0 fig 5c at a high photosynthesis rate the symbiont has leftover carbohydrates and shares a lot with the host increasing the benefit to the host conversely increases in uptake rate increase parasitism at low photosynthesis rates but increase mutualism at higher photosynthesis rates figures s4 s5 and s6 in the supplementary material further explore the nutrient limitations leading to the dynamics seen in fig 5 4 discussion though cnidarian dinoflagellate symbioses are often considered mutualisms the role of endosymbiotic algae exists on a continuum between mutualism and parasitism stat et al 2008 wooldridge 2010 changes in environmental conditions can shift the role of symbionts from mutualism to parasitism baker et al 2018 our simple bioenergetics model highlights how symbionts can be environmental amplifiers increasing the magnitude of host responses to the environment our findings recapitulate peng et al 2020 our validated model demonstrates the importance of nutrient limitations to the balance of parasitism and mutualism it is clear that symbionts are only beneficial to the anemone host in this model when the anemone is both carbon limited and receives more carbon than it looses to the added metabolic cost of hosting a symbiont conversely the symbionts are predominantly controlled by the availability of nitrogen both in this model and experimentally xiang et al 2020 improving one characteristic of the system may not result in higher magnitude of mutualism as feeding rates of the host or food availability increase the symbionts are only beneficial to the host if there is a sufficiently high photosynthesis rate though the costs of symbionts on cnidarian hosts are well reported lesser et al 2013 peng et al 2020 steen 1986 the exact mechanisms are still unclear similarly the apparent importance of the reverse translocation of nitrogen in this system is still unclear rädecker et al 2018 davy et al 2012 the model presented here approximates these uncertainties through one combined approximation of the symbiont consuming the host this allows the symbiont to impose a metabolic cost on the host and to acquire nitrogen and potentially carbon from the interaction further this approximation recapitulates the balance between mutualism and parasitism found in the peng et al 2020 study there are a few limitations of this approximation this model simplifies the ability for symbionts to get nitrogen and simplifies the expulsion of symbionts from an anemone host in our model the symbiont can only acquire nitrogen directly from consuming the host in reality the symbiont might get nitrogen partially from waste products from the host cui et al 2019 rahav et al 1989 or directly from the water column cook and d elia 1987 smith and muscatine 1999 davy et al 2006 2012 or from particulate organic nitrogen davy et al 2006 2012 increased nitrogen availability increases the symbionts growth eventually leading to significant cost of symbionts on the host and in coral systems coral bleaching wooldridge 2009 relaxing the assumption that symbionts can only acquire nitrogen from the host may improve the model s ability to capture the costs of significantly increased growth of the symbiont in higher nitrogen conditions similarly the death rate of the symbiont is a simplification of the death rate of the symbiont and expulsion rate of the symbiont though this simplification appears to be appropriate here it may be less appropriate when the symbionts are limited by light jinkerson et al 2022 or space jones and yellowlees 1997 indeed there are a variety of ways that cnidarian hosts may regulate symbiont populations including limiting nutrient transport to the symbiont and limiting light availability to the symbiont baird et al 2009 cunning et al 2015 which are not incorporated into this model these simplifications limited the number of parameters needed to capture the food dependent symbioses in this system as our understanding of the exact cost of symbiont on the host and the molecular pathways that are involved in reverse translocation improves the model can be adjusted to more accurately capture the molecular dynamics though the set of parameters explored here are specific to e pallida and b minutum this model has the potential to be applied to other cnidarian dinoflagellate symbioses different symbiont species have varying ability to infect hosts dunn and weis 2009 and once infected can have significant varied impacts on the host sproles et al 2020 cantin et al 2009 little et al 2004 starzak et al 2014 adjusting parameters like the attack rate of the symbiont on the host and nitrogen conversion efficiency y n allows the model to both adjust the cost of the symbiont on the host and the ability of the symbiont to benefit from changes in the cost further the symbiont does not receive carbon from its host in our model this has been demonstrated for our host species e pallida but other species such as acropora tenuis are known to share carbon with their symbionts jinkerson et al 2022 further adjustments of this model are necessary to capture these differences between species this model has clearly demonstrated that the approximation of the symbiont consuming the host can mechanistically describe the system this model adds to the existing deb models that describe cnidarian symbiosis and reveals the importance of including a direct cost of hosting a symbiont furthermore this work reinforces the need for more experimental evidence to support the exact cellular mechanism that results in reverse translocation and

conversion in the data from peng et al 2020 the anemone were measured in foot base area mm 2 and the symbionts were measured as the number of symbionts per host in order to use the data provided by peng et al 2020 to parameterize this model we first need to convert from units of mm 2 and number of symbiont cells to mol c host h and mol c symbiont s using the total carbon per symbiont of b minutum sp found by wong et al 2021 we can convert the number of symbiont cells to total mol c of symbiont 17 s n u m b e r o f s y m b i o n t c e l l s 63 pg c c e l l 1 0 12 g pg 12 0 1 1 mol 1 c g next the anemones had two separate morphological forms through the experiment during the first three weeks all anemone maintained the morphology of a typical anemone but from the fourth week on some anemones in the symbiotic starved treatments morphologically changed into tissue balls due to the morphological differences between an anemone and a tissue ball we converted from base area to mol c in two distinct ways we converted the anemones with typical morphology to c moles by first calculating base diameter mm assuming the base area mm 2 of an anemone was circular 18 b a s e a r e a π r a d i u s 2 19 r a d i u s b a s e a r e a π 20 d i a m e t e r 2 b a s e a r e a π we then converted diameter mm to dry weight mg using the conversation found in leal et al 2012 21 d r y w e i g h t 1 0 0 7013 mg mm 2 4124 d i a m e t e r 2 4124 next since anemone dry weight is approximately 55 carbon we converted from total mg dry weight to total mg carbon zamer 1986 finally we converted mg carbon to g carbon and then g carbon to carbon moles using the molar mass of carbon 22 h d r y w e i g h t 0 55 mg c t o t a l mg 1 0 3 g mg 12 0 1 1 mol c g the final equation to convert an anemone with an

approximately hemispheres as they were still attached to the base of the tank and therefore not full spheres we assumed the base area of a tissue ball were circular and calculated the radius mm from the base area mm 2 measurements provided by peng et al 2020 24 b a s e a r e a π r a d i u s 2 25 r a d i u s b a s e a r e a π we then used the radius to calculate the volume mm 3 of tissue balls 26 v o l u m e 2 3 π r a d i u s 3 we assumed that the wet weight mg of an anemone tissue ball was approximately the weight of an equivalent volume of water using the results of leal et al 2012 fig 1 a we found that anemone dry weight mg is approximately 0 16 of the wet weight mg 27 d r y w e i g h t v o l u m e 1 mg 1 mm 3 0 16 mg mg next anemone dry weight is approximately 55 carbon and we converted mg carbon to g carbon and use the molar mass of carbon to convert to mol c zamer 1986 the final equation to convert base area of tissue balls is 28 h 2 3 π r a d i u s 3 0 16 mg mg 0 55 mg c t o t a l mg 1 0 3 g mg 12 0 1 1 mol c g peng et al 2020 provided the number of anemones that had become tissue balls each week for each treatment but did not specify exactly which anemone changed to tissue balls for weeks with tissue balls we transformed the smallest base area measurements to tissue balls for example on week 4 of the starved symbiotic anemone treatment there was only one anemone that had become a tissue ball so we transformed the smallest base area as a tissue ball and all the others as anemone with anemone morphology appendix b parameter fitting this model was built to understand the dynamics of the anemone and symbiont system under four separate treatments and six distinct data sets provided by peng et al 2020 there are four anemone data sets of the base area of the anemone corresponding to all four treatments there are two symbiont data sets of the number of symbionts per anemone corresponding to the two inoculated treatments all parameters except s 0 r n and r c are fit to one value throughout all treatments the parameter y c is set to be zero assuming that the symbiont gains no carbohydrates from the host the parameters s 0 r n and r c correspond to presence or absence of feeding and the presence or absences of the symbiont and are therefore not the same in all treatments the parameters are either set to zero or adopt each their own fitted value note that these parameters are only fitted to one value not to separate values for each non zero treatment for example the parameter s 0 is set to zero for all aposymbiotic treatments but is fit to one value for both the inoculated treatments to parameterize this model we used the method outlined in jager and ashauer 2018 we calculate the minimum log likelihood ℓ i for each data set i as 29 ℓ i c λ i 2 log s i where λ i is the number of data points in the data set i and c is a constant the constant only depends on the data and not on the dimensions and therefore can be dropped in the optimization s i is the sum of squared error of variables x x h for anemone data sets and x s for symbiont data sets 30 s i j x t j x j 2 where x t j is the model prediction at time t j and x j is the actual value at time t j the joint log likelihood for all data sets is the sum of each individual ℓ i 31 ℓ t o t a l i 1 6 ℓ i this follows from the assumption that the standard deviations are different between data sets minimizing ℓ t o t a l for some set of parameters provided us with parameter values that maximized the fit for all treatments the fitted parameter values can be found in table 2 appendix c bootstrapping distributions and confidence intervals since we had 420 distinct data points to fit this model to we found bootstrapping as described in efron and tibshirani 1994 to be an appropriate method to estimate 95 confidence intervals for the fitted parameter values we sampled each of the six data sets λ i times with replacement where λ i represents the number of data points in the data set i after sampling all six of the data sets we refitted the model we completed this process 1000 times re sampling the data and fitting the model each time this process providing us with a distribution of parameter values for each parameter as shown in appendix fig 6 most of the distributions were non normal so simple methods like reverse percentile interval could not be used to extract the 95 confidence intervals from the distribution instead to account for the non normal distributions we used the bias corrected and accelerated b c a method as described in efron and tibshirani 1994 chapter 14 to extract the 95 confidence intervals which are shown in table 2 appendix d supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found online at https

24184,cnidaria marine invertebrates that include reef building stony corals often rely on photosynthetic endosymbionts to obtain the energy they need for growth increased temperatures and or nutrient pollution can disrupt mutualistic properties of the symbiosis leading to host mortality however the precise mechanism by which this dysbiosis occurs is still unclear sea anemones other cnidarians that may host algal endosymbionts are used as a model organism for the coral holobiont to understand the costs and benefits of symbionts but the exact nature of the costs of symbionts on the hosts is still unclear here we developed a dynamic energy budget deb model and fit the model to data from the anemone exaiptasia pallida and its endosymbiotic algae breviolum minutum in order to identify the most likely mechanism of symbiont costs in order to match the laboratory dataset our model needed an explicit symbiont demand term in which the symbiont can consume host tissue to forcibly extract nitrogen the model demonstrates the role of the symbiont as an amplifier of the host s state a growing anemone grows better with symbionts while a malnourished anemone looses biomass faster with a symbiont than without this model allows us to project cnidaria holobiont growth as a function of environmental conditions and adds a new framework for which to capture the direct cost a symbiont has on cnidaria hosts keywords deb model mutualism parasitism anemone cnidaria symbiodiniaceae endosymbiosis data availability the code for this project has been implemented in wolfram mathematica 13 2 the code is freely available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7699157 1 introduction coral reefs are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet crossland et al 1991 fisher et al 2015 this biodiversity is supported by a symbiotic relationship that stony corals and some other cnidaria share with photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the family symbiodiniaceae cnidarian hosts obtain photosynthate from their algal endosymbionts in exchange for nitrogen this increases nutrient recycling efficacy and supports coral growth in nutrient poor environments muscatine and porter 1977 however the close relationship between cnidaria and their algal symbionts can break down under thermal stress resulting in the symbionts being expelled from the cnidaria tissue a phenomenon referred to as coral bleaching van oppen and lough 2018 as climate change increases the frequency and severity of coral bleaching it is important to understand this mutualism between cnidarians and their symbionts especially conditions in which this mutualism degrades and potentially becomes parasitic hughes et al 2018 to understand the balance of mutualism and parasitism in cnidarian dinoflagellate symbioses we need to understand the translocation of nutrients between the host and symbiont it is well known that cnidarian hosts share nitrogen and other nutrients with their symbionts while symbionts share carbohydrates with their hosts clayton and lasker 1984 farrant et al 1987 muscatine and cernichiari 1969 the exact mechanism of translocation of nutrient between host and symbiont is still not fully understood one supported mechanism for the translocation of nutrients from symbiont to host is that the host releases a host release factor hrf that encourages the symbiont to share photosynthate with the host rather than storing the photosynthate for its own use davy and cook 2001 grant et al 2006 davy et al 2012 a potential way to approximate this dynamic is by assuming that the symbiont uses some photosynthetically acquired carbon for growth and shares the remaining carbon with the host the host only receives leftover carbon from photosynthesis reverse translocation of nutrients from the host to the symbiont is significantly less well understood davy et al 2012 the symbiont receives phosphate and nitrogen in the form of ammonium n h 4 davy et al 2012 the symbiont may also receive carbon from the host cook 1972 davy et al 2012 though reverse translocation of carbon is thought to be minor in comparison to the products of photosynthesis especially in well lit environments falkowski and raven 2013 davy et al 2012 cornwall 2017 though symbionts hosted by acropora corals may acquire and use carbon from the host it is suggested that symbionts in the anemone exaiptasia pallida do not jinkerson et al 2022 furthermore some isolated symbiodinium have been shown to be capable of feeding jeong et al 2012 and there are many examples of symbiodinium heterotrophically acquiring nutrients from a host baker et al 2018 steen 1987 tremblay et al 2016 steen 1988 indeed some symbiodinium have been shown to impose significant and potentially fatal heterotrophic burdens on the host siegel 1960 steen 1986 peng et al 2020 the shift from mutualism to parasitism of symbiodinium under different environments has been reported in excavating sponges fang et al 2017 in jellyfish sachs and wilcox 2006 and in the gastropod strombus gigas banaszak et al 2013 to understand the shift from mutualism to parasitism in corals scientists often use the sea anemone e pallida as a model system e pallida shares many characteristics with corals but it is easy to maintain in the laboratory and can survive with or without symbionts this allows for studies that vary conditions for inoculated and aposymbiotic anemones to understand the impacts the symbionts have on the anemone peng et al 2020 studied the impact that food deprivation stress has on the mutualism parasitism balance found in e pallida they grew anemones inoculated with the endosymbiotic alga brevolium minutum and aposymbiotic anemones under fed and starved conditions and measured the changes in the symbiotic and anemone population over 8 weeks this study showed a surprising amplification effect of symbionts on anemone performance while well fed anemones grew faster with symbionts than without them starved anemones shrank and died much faster when they were inoculated with symbionts this amplifying effect shows the important role the environmental conditions have on the balance between mutualism and parasitism there are a few existing models that describe the transfer of nutrients between the host and the symbiont in cnidarian dinoflagellate systems muller et al 2009 cunning et al 2017 xu et al 2022 these models do not directly capture the significant cost a symbiont can incur on a host which is evident in the starved anemone in the experiments by peng et al 2020 and other examples of symbiont parasitism in cnidarian dinoflagellate systems stat et al 2008 wooldridge 2010 to close this gap we constructed a dynamic energy budget deb model of the interactions between an anemone host and its symbiotic algae including mechanisms through which the symbiont not only shares carbon with the host but also inflicts a metabolic burden deb models describe the rate of nutrient assimilation and utilization of organisms as a function of their environments van der meer 2006 nisbet et al 2000 kooijman 2001 simplified deb models and theory have previously been used to describe nutrients exchange between a tree s roots and a tree s shoots russo et al 2022 similarly our deb model describes the nutrient exchange between e pallida and b minutumas seen in the experiments of peng et al 2020 we built this model based on the assumption that the host only receives leftover carbon and we approximated reverse translocation and the metabolic cost of the symbiont on the host as the symbiont consumes the host we tested the ability of this approximation to capture the amplification effect found by peng et al 2020 we parameterized the model with the 6 data sets provided by peng et al 2020 to validate the model once validated we perturbed the model to simulate variations in environmental conditions and original parameters to extend the model predictions 2 methods 2 1 model description to understand how resource translocation explains the symbiont amplification effect seen in peng et al 2020 we developed a bio energetic model that focuses on the nitrogen and carbon dynamics of the system to describe this system we considered two state variables host biomass h and symbiont biomass s we focused on nitrogen and carbohydrates as the nutrients that mediate the relationship between the host and its symbionts a diagram of this system is shown in fig 1 the parameters used to describe this system are listed in table 2 and state variables and fluxes are in table 1 we used two ordinary differential equations odes to describe the rate of change of the host biomass h and the symbiont biomass s over time 1 d s d t j s g j s t 2 d h d t j h g j h t here j s g is the symbiont growth rate j s t is the symbiont turnover rate j h g is the host growth rate and j h t is the host turnover rate turnover rate is the rate at which biomass is lost including natural mortality the change in symbiont biomass over time is described as the difference between total symbiont growth rate and symbiont turnover rate similarly the rate of change of the host biomass is described as the difference between total host growth rate and total host turnover rate the growth of the symbiont is dependent on how much nitrogen and carbon the symbiont has at any given time the total symbiont growth rate is described as 3 j s g m i n j s c n s n 1 j s n where j s c is the total flux of carbon to the symbiont and j s n is the total flux of nitrogen to the symbiont the parameter n s n is the nitrogen to carbon ratio of the symbiont we used n s n to adjust moles nitrogen to moles carbon needed for symbiont growth the symbiont follows liebig s law of the minimum and grows at a rate determined by the stoichiometrically limiting nutrient von liebig 1841 the total symbiont turnover rate j s t is described as 4 j s t d s s where d s is the per symbiont death rate in this model the symbiont only acquires nitrogen through consuming the host so j s n is the total symbiont consumption of the host f s h 5 j s n y n n h n f s h adjusted by the conversion efficiency of host nitrogen to symbiont nitrogen y n furthermore the function f s h describes the total consumption of the host by the symbionts in units of carbon moles therefore the nitrogen to carbon ratio of the host n h n is used to adjust moles of host carbon to moles of host nitrogen the symbiont can acquire carbon from photosynthesis at rate p and from consuming the host 6 j s c p s in e pallida the symbionts do not receive carbon or cannot grow only using host carbon jinkerson et al 2022 the host growth j h g also follows liebig s law of the minimum and grows at a rate determined by the stoichiometrically limiting nutrient von liebig 1841 the total host growth rate is described as 7 j h g m i n j h c n h n 1 j h n where j h c is the flux of carbon to the host and j h n is the flux of nitrogen to the host since the host biomass is measured in carbon moles the flux of nitrogen j h n is converted to carbon moles with the parameter n h n the parameter n h n is the nitrogen to carbon ratio of the host the turnover of the host is dependent on the base mortality of the host d h and the mortality caused by the symbiont consuming the host f s h 8 j h t f s h d h h the host can only acquire nitrogen through feeding which we assume is proportional to the hosts surface the nitrogen uptake rate of the host is thus 9 j h n r n h 2 3 where h 2 3 is proportional to the surface of the host and r n is the surface specific nitrogen uptake rate of the host the host can acquire carbon both through leftover carbon from the symbiont at rate b and from surface specific uptake at rate r c 10 j h c b r c h 2 3 where h 2 3 is proportional to the surface of the host furthermore we assumed that the host only receive the leftover photosynthate that the symbiont would otherwise be allocating to long term storage davy and cook 2001 grant et al 2006 davy et al 2012 therefore the translocation of carbon from the symbiont to the host b is defined as 11 b j s c j s g the function b is the total amount of carbon fixed by the symbiont minus the amount of carbon the symbiont uses for its own growth we will use a holling type ii functional response of the per symbiont consumption of the host h s to approximate the total metabolic cost of the symbiont on the host and the translocation of nutrients from the host to the symbiont the holling type ii functional response is characterized as a decelerating rate of consumption of prey by the predator as prey density increases eventually reaching an asymptote holling 1959 here we classify the symbiont as the predator consuming the host which is interpreted as the prey the function 12 f s h s a h s 1 a w h s 13 s a h s a w h describes the total consumption of the host by the symbiont in the system the parameter a is the attack rate of the symbiont on the host which is the initial slope of the functional response the parameter w is the symbiont handling time the average time for a unit of symbiont to handle a unit of host putting together all parts of the model the full equations are 14 d s d t m i n p s a h n h n s y n s n s n a h n s n w d s s 15 d h d t a h s s a h w d h h m i n h 2 3 r n n h n h 2 3 r

anemone base area mm 2 and number of symbiont cells to mol c of host h and mol c of symbiont s our method for biomass conversion is shown in appendix a we used a log likelihood approach to optimize the model fit for the peng et al 2020 data our parameter fitting method is described in appendix b to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter values we used the bias corrected and accelerated b c a bootstrapping method which is shown in appendix c all model fitting and model analysis was doen in mathematica 13 2 wolfram research inc 2021 3 results 3 1 the model reproduces observed anemone symbiont dynamics our model both qualitatively and quantitatively captures anemone and algal dynamics observed by peng et al 2020 fig 2 the model captures the increase in anemone biomass under fed conditions and the decrease in the anemone biomass under starved conditions the model also captures the two different symbiont dynamics found in the inoculated treatments while the model fits the data well there are some small differences between the model predictions and the data particularly the symbiont biomass in the starved treatment did not peak at the same magnitude as the data fig 2e furthermore the model predicts a constant decline of the host biomass in the starved inoculated treatment rather than a period of no change in the first four weeks followed by a quick decline as seen in the data fig 2c it is unclear why starved anemones with symbionts do not lose biomass immediately in the peng et al 2020 study it may be that the host is still digesting food that was eaten before the start of the experiment and using carbon from the symbiont to maintain the same biomass before the host runs out of undigested food and begins to lose biomass despite some differences in the data and the model predictions the model captures the key dynamics of the system we also explored the equilibrium dynamics of the model and found that a fed host with symbiont has a much higher equilibrium biomass than a fed host without symbiont figure s1 furthermore the symbiont is predominantly nitrogen limited regardless of initial biomass of the host and symbiont at the fitted parameter values while the host shifts from carbon limited to nitrogen limited as the symbiont biomass increases figure s2 3 2 mutualism and parasitism balance in varied environmental conditions and parameter values a vital component of this system as described by peng et al 2020 is the switch from mutualism in fed anemone to parasitism in starved anemone to quantify the effect of the symbiont on the host we define δ as a measure of the magnitude of mutualism or parasitism in the system at a given set of parameters we calculate δ as the difference between the model predictions of inoculated host biomass h i and the model prediction of aposymbiotic host biomass h a at a given set of parameter values 16 δ h i h a we compute δ after 8 weeks of simulation following the 8 week experiment duration used by peng et al 2020 for δ 0 the relationship is parasitic as the symbiont decreases the host s biomass over time starved anemone fig 3a for δ 0 the relationship is mutualistic as the symbiont increases the host s biomass over time fed anemone fig 3b we plotted δ as a function of one parameter at a time while holding all other parameter values constant at their fitted parameter values fig 4 the most dominant trend shown throughout these figures is that when the host is carbon limited and the symbiont provides more carbon to the host than the cost of hosting a symbiont then δ 0 and the system is mutualistic when the host is nitrogen limited or the carbon cost of hosting a symbiont outbalances the carbon shared from the symbiont then δ 0 and the system is parasitic see figure s3 for exploration of how nutrient limitation produces the dynamics observed in fig 4 particularly varying attack rate a initially increases δ as the symbiont has more access to nitrogen but once the cost of a hight attack rate begins to outweigh the benefit δ decreases below zero increasing handling time w decreases δ as the symbiont gains less nitrogen from the host varying photosynthesis rate p initially decreases δ as the symbiont can survive and are costly to the host but do not share carbon further increasing p results in more carbon shared to the host and δ increases varying host to symbion nitrogen conversion efficiency y n initially decreases δ as the symbiont can survive but does not share significant carbon further increasing y n results in more carbon shared with the host and δ increases increasing symbiont mortality rate d s decreases δ as this parameter makes the symbiont lose biomass and thus becomes less beneficial increasing host mortality rate d h decreases δ as the host dies quickly regardless of the symbiont increasing host carbon uptake rate r c initially increases δ as the symbiont supplements the host s carbon but once the host becomes nitrogen limited and acquires all the needed carbon on its own the symbiont is just a cost initial increases in the host nitrogen uptake rate r n decreases δ extra nitrogen helps the host maintain biomass at the beginning of the experiment but also allows significant symbiont population growth leading to an overshoot of symbiont where the host biomass collapses rapidly further increasing r n inverts the trend leading to an increase in δ as the extra nitrogen allows the host to sustain a beneficial symbiont population simulations of this mechanism are shown in figure s7 in the supplementary materials we further investigated the effect of two environmental factors known to strongly impact cnidarian systems nutrient availability and light conditions falkowski et al 1984 morris et al 2019 fig 5 we jointly varied nutrient availability and light condition to explore the combined impacts on the symbiont host symbiosis we approximated nutrient availability with a combined host uptake rate r which determines host carbon uptake rate as r c r and host nitrogen uptake as r n γ r hereby γ is the ratio of nitrogen uptake rate to carbon uptake rate of the fitted parameter values γ r n r c 1 466 further we approximated changes in the light availability by directly altering the photosynthetic rate p the system is predominant parasitic at low photosynthesis rates and predominantly mutualistic at higher photosynthesis rate fig 5a changes in photosynthesis have similar impacts on δ regardless of combined uptake rate though the effect of increasing p is amplified at higher uptake rates fig 5b at low photosynthesis rates there is little to no carbon shared from the symbiont to the host so the cost of hosting a symbiont is greater than the benefit and δ 0 fig 5c at a high photosynthesis rate the symbiont has leftover carbohydrates and shares a lot with the host increasing the benefit to the host conversely increases in uptake rate increase parasitism at low photosynthesis rates but increase mutualism at higher photosynthesis rates figures s4 s5 and s6 in the supplementary material further explore the nutrient limitations leading to the dynamics seen in fig 5 4 discussion though cnidarian dinoflagellate symbioses are often considered mutualisms the role of endosymbiotic algae exists on a continuum between mutualism and parasitism stat et al 2008 wooldridge 2010 changes in environmental conditions can shift the role of symbionts from mutualism to parasitism baker et al 2018 our simple bioenergetics model highlights how symbionts can be environmental amplifiers increasing the magnitude of host responses to the environment our findings recapitulate peng et al 2020 our validated model demonstrates the importance of nutrient limitations to the balance of parasitism and mutualism it is clear that symbionts are only beneficial to the anemone host in this model when the anemone is both carbon limited and receives more carbon than it looses to the added metabolic cost of hosting a symbiont conversely the symbionts are predominantly controlled by the availability of nitrogen both in this model and experimentally xiang et al 2020 improving one characteristic of the system may not result in higher magnitude of mutualism as feeding rates of the host or food availability increase the symbionts are only beneficial to the host if there is a sufficiently high photosynthesis rate though the costs of symbionts on cnidarian hosts are well reported lesser et al 2013 peng et al 2020 steen 1986 the exact mechanisms are still unclear similarly the apparent importance of the reverse translocation of nitrogen in this system is still unclear rädecker et al 2018 davy et al 2012 the model presented here approximates these uncertainties through one combined approximation of the symbiont consuming the host this allows the symbiont to impose a metabolic cost on the host and to acquire nitrogen and potentially carbon from the interaction further this approximation recapitulates the balance between mutualism and parasitism found in the peng et al 2020 study there are a few limitations of this approximation this model simplifies the ability for symbionts to get nitrogen and simplifies the expulsion of symbionts from an anemone host in our model the symbiont can only acquire nitrogen directly from consuming the host in reality the symbiont might get nitrogen partially from waste products from the host cui et al 2019 rahav et al 1989 or directly from the water column cook and d elia 1987 smith and muscatine 1999 davy et al 2006 2012 or from particulate organic nitrogen davy et al 2006 2012 increased nitrogen availability increases the symbionts growth eventually leading to significant cost of symbionts on the host and in coral systems coral bleaching wooldridge 2009 relaxing the assumption that symbionts can only acquire nitrogen from the host may improve the model s ability to capture the costs of significantly increased growth of the symbiont in higher nitrogen conditions similarly the death rate of the symbiont is a simplification of the death rate of the symbiont and expulsion rate of the symbiont though this simplification appears to be appropriate here it may be less appropriate when the symbionts are limited by light jinkerson et al 2022 or space jones and yellowlees 1997 indeed there are a variety of ways that cnidarian hosts may regulate symbiont populations including limiting nutrient transport to the symbiont and limiting light availability to the symbiont baird et al 2009 cunning et al 2015 which are not incorporated into this model these simplifications limited the number of parameters needed to capture the food dependent symbioses in this system as our understanding of the exact cost of symbiont on the host and the molecular pathways that are involved in reverse translocation improves the model can be adjusted to more accurately capture the molecular dynamics though the set of parameters explored here are specific to e pallida and b minutum this model has the potential to be applied to other cnidarian dinoflagellate symbioses different symbiont species have varying ability to infect hosts dunn and weis 2009 and once infected can have significant varied impacts on the host sproles et al 2020 cantin et al 2009 little et al 2004 starzak et al 2014 adjusting parameters like the attack rate of the symbiont on the host and nitrogen conversion efficiency y n allows the model to both adjust the cost of the symbiont on the host and the ability of the symbiont to benefit from changes in the cost further the symbiont does not receive carbon from its host in our model this has been demonstrated for our host species e pallida but other species such as acropora tenuis are known to share carbon with their symbionts jinkerson et al 2022 further adjustments of this model are necessary to capture these differences between species this model has clearly demonstrated that the approximation of the symbiont consuming the host can mechanistically describe the system this model adds to the existing deb models that describe cnidarian symbiosis and reveals the importance of including a direct cost of hosting a symbiont furthermore this work reinforces the need for more experimental evidence to support the exact cellular mechanism that results in reverse translocation and

conversion in the data from peng et al 2020 the anemone were measured in foot base area mm 2 and the symbionts were measured as the number of symbionts per host in order to use the data provided by peng et al 2020 to parameterize this model we first need to convert from units of mm 2 and number of symbiont cells to mol c host h and mol c symbiont s using the total carbon per symbiont of b minutum sp found by wong et al 2021 we can convert the number of symbiont cells to total mol c of symbiont 17 s n u m b e r o f s y m b i o n t c e l l s 63 pg c c e l l 1 0 12 g pg 12 0 1 1 mol 1 c g next the anemones had two separate morphological forms through the experiment during the first three weeks all anemone maintained the morphology of a typical anemone but from the fourth week on some anemones in the symbiotic starved treatments morphologically changed into tissue balls due to the morphological differences between an anemone and a tissue ball we converted from base area to mol c in two distinct ways we converted the anemones with typical morphology to c moles by first calculating base diameter mm assuming the base area mm 2 of an anemone was circular 18 b a s e a r e a π r a d i u s 2 19 r a d i u s b a s e a r e a π 20 d i a m e t e r 2 b a s e a r e a π we then converted diameter mm to dry weight mg using the conversation found in leal et al 2012 21 d r y w e i g h t 1 0 0 7013 mg mm 2 4124 d i a m e t e r 2 4124 next since anemone dry weight is approximately 55 carbon we converted from total mg dry weight to total mg carbon zamer 1986 finally we converted mg carbon to g carbon and then g carbon to carbon moles using the molar mass of carbon 22 h d r y w e i g h t 0 55 mg c t o t a l mg 1 0 3 g mg 12 0 1 1 mol c g the final equation to convert an anemone with an

approximately hemispheres as they were still attached to the base of the tank and therefore not full spheres we assumed the base area of a tissue ball were circular and calculated the radius mm from the base area mm 2 measurements provided by peng et al 2020 24 b a s e a r e a π r a d i u s 2 25 r a d i u s b a s e a r e a π we then used the radius to calculate the volume mm 3 of tissue balls 26 v o l u m e 2 3 π r a d i u s 3 we assumed that the wet weight mg of an anemone tissue ball was approximately the weight of an equivalent volume of water using the results of leal et al 2012 fig 1 a we found that anemone dry weight mg is approximately 0 16 of the wet weight mg 27 d r y w e i g h t v o l u m e 1 mg 1 mm 3 0 16 mg mg next anemone dry weight is approximately 55 carbon and we converted mg carbon to g carbon and use the molar mass of carbon to convert to mol c zamer 1986 the final equation to convert base area of tissue balls is 28 h 2 3 π r a d i u s 3 0 16 mg mg 0 55 mg c t o t a l mg 1 0 3 g mg 12 0 1 1 mol c g peng et al 2020 provided the number of anemones that had become tissue balls each week for each treatment but did not specify exactly which anemone changed to tissue balls for weeks with tissue balls we transformed the smallest base area measurements to tissue balls for example on week 4 of the starved symbiotic anemone treatment there was only one anemone that had become a tissue ball so we transformed the smallest base area as a tissue ball and all the others as anemone with anemone morphology appendix b parameter fitting this model was built to understand the dynamics of the anemone and symbiont system under four separate treatments and six distinct data sets provided by peng et al 2020 there are four anemone data sets of the base area of the anemone corresponding to all four treatments there are two symbiont data sets of the number of symbionts per anemone corresponding to the two inoculated treatments all parameters except s 0 r n and r c are fit to one value throughout all treatments the parameter y c is set to be zero assuming that the symbiont gains no carbohydrates from the host the parameters s 0 r n and r c correspond to presence or absence of feeding and the presence or absences of the symbiont and are therefore not the same in all treatments the parameters are either set to zero or adopt each their own fitted value note that these parameters are only fitted to one value not to separate values for each non zero treatment for example the parameter s 0 is set to zero for all aposymbiotic treatments but is fit to one value for both the inoculated treatments to parameterize this model we used the method outlined in jager and ashauer 2018 we calculate the minimum log likelihood ℓ i for each data set i as 29 ℓ i c λ i 2 log s i where λ i is the number of data points in the data set i and c is a constant the constant only depends on the data and not on the dimensions and therefore can be dropped in the optimization s i is the sum of squared error of variables x x h for anemone data sets and x s for symbiont data sets 30 s i j x t j x j 2 where x t j is the model prediction at time t j and x j is the actual value at time t j the joint log likelihood for all data sets is the sum of each individual ℓ i 31 ℓ t o t a l i 1 6 ℓ i this follows from the assumption that the standard deviations are different between data sets minimizing ℓ t o t a l for some set of parameters provided us with parameter values that maximized the fit for all treatments the fitted parameter values can be found in table 2 appendix c bootstrapping distributions and confidence intervals since we had 420 distinct data points to fit this model to we found bootstrapping as described in efron and tibshirani 1994 to be an appropriate method to estimate 95 confidence intervals for the fitted parameter values we sampled each of the six data sets λ i times with replacement where λ i represents the number of data points in the data set i after sampling all six of the data sets we refitted the model we completed this process 1000 times re sampling the data and fitting the model each time this process providing us with a distribution of parameter values for each parameter as shown in appendix fig 6 most of the distributions were non normal so simple methods like reverse percentile interval could not be used to extract the 95 confidence intervals from the distribution instead to account for the non normal distributions we used the bias corrected and accelerated b c a method as described in efron and tibshirani 1994 chapter 14 to extract the 95 confidence intervals which are shown in table 2 appendix d supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found online at https
