22150,this paper developed the new route decision making method that implements the wave added resistance estimation method using forecast 2d wave spectra in a frequency and a direction domain specified through a ship s voyage route in the accepted conventional method a 1d idealized spectrum is applied to estimate the wave added resistance calculation in the process of performance evaluation in the route decision making algorithm wave added resistance estimation using an 1d idealized spectrum assumes that the statistical characteristics of the sea do not vary over the ship s route with regard to geography and season in the real world the characteristics of the sea continually vary according to the voyage route in which a vessel passes by this paper provides the method that calculates the added resistance of waves using forecast 2d wave spectra that provided tailor made stochastic data at any particular time and position along the route of the vessel the difference of the wave added resistance estimation using conventional 1d idealized spectrum method and the proposed forecast 2d wave spectra method is investigated by the comparative study of the estimation results model tests and the measured power during the real voyage case of 173k lngc in the pacific and atlantic ocean keywords route decision making wave added resistance weather routing operation profile lng carrier wave forecast 2d wave spectra weather forecast operation profile analysis autonomous vessel smart ship 1 introduction 1 1 motivation a vast shift from manned shipping to autonomous shipping is coming soon globally the international maritime organization declared merchant autonomous surface ship international maritime organization 2018 there are two main navigation algorithms by which autonomous vessels are controlled a route decision making algorithm and a collision avoidance algorithm of the two the routing algorithm which makes decisions regarding the macro route of autonomous vessels is at the forefront of research because it controls the efficiency and safety of the ship s navigation in macro view moreover the routing algorithm provides the reference route that is the initial route for collision avoidance generally the object function of route decision making is to minimize fuel oil consumption foc during a voyage while fulfilling the safety criteria motion risk comfort and required time arrival rta the foc is the key index that shows the performance of the voyage also shipowners are highly interested in the foc of ships which has led to a trend in the shipbuilding sector called the foc war even a 1 reduction in foc is crucial in the market because the foc is not only the most substantial contributor of operating expenditure opex but also the foc has positive proportional green house gas ghg stopford 2009 the foc of the ship is formulated of the function of time power and resistance kim and kim 2018 the main contributor to foc is the resistance of the hull itself and environmental loads such as wind current swell and wave naturally the quality of route decision making counts on the accuracy of the modeling of the resistance power and foc of the ship accordingly realistic power and resistance estimations assure the quality of route decision making strategy the power of the vessel has obtained the combination of thrust and resistance the thrust of the vessel generally obtained from a propeller open water and a self propulsion test among the components of resistance the wave added resistance is a crucial component because the contribution of wave load varies a lot due to environmental changes optimizing the route decision making process rests on it the effects of bare hull resistance and wind load on the route decision making optimization are less sensitive compared to the wave added resistance of a vessel to calculate the wave added resistance of ship the frequency domain analysis is the conventional method the wave added resistance is modeled as the integration of the wave spectrum and the quadratic transfer function qtf in the frequency domain approach the qtf is generally obtained from the frequency domain motion analysis or the model test in the case of spectrum modeling the estimation of wave loads traditionally assumes that every sea has a similar representative stochastic characteristic which is regarded as a fully developed sea but a sea is never fully developed characteristics of a sea vary in accordance with its geography and season environments always vary according to the route of a voyage therefore this variation of the environment along route is significant in route decision making modeling naturally a performance evaluation considering these environmental variations is essential to the investigation of the efficiency of a ship in terms of what the ship will experience during a voyage at this moment there are many needs of the shipowner to analyze the ship s performance not only simplified design conditions but realistic operation profile however the state of the art of the ship performance evaluation frame is done under the assumption of ideal calm sea conditions and the 1d spectrum which differs from a real sea where a ship s voyage actually occurs offshore platform and wind turbine industries adopt quite a different approach in which they consider environmental conditions especially wave conditions natskår et al 2015 this paper proposes a newly developed method for estimating wave added resistance using forecast 2d wave spectra which are made to fit the performance evaluation in accordance with the operation profile of a ship for routing decision making in actual position and time this wave spectra describe variations in wave spreading characteristics due to the geographical and seasonal differences using a 1d idealized wave spectrum causes the wave added resistance to be overestimated because it cannot consider the spreading factor in addition the 1d idealized spectrum assumes that the energy of wave is condensed in the dominant heading the proposed method is expected to improve the estimation of wave added resistance by considering the actual characteristics of the sea in the route decision making procedure the more precise estimation of wave added resistance promises a more accurate evaluation of the performance of a ship during the route decision making optimization routing performance was evaluated using an in house routing simulation program which is based on a three dimensional dynamic programming method that is validated by comparing the measured operation power and model test reference for the 173 k m3 cubic meter lng carrier towing tank test and wind tunnel test data of lng carrier is used in the analysis 1 2 state of the art for the estimation of the wave added resistance the frequency domain approach is the standard because the motion analysis is based on a linear superposition theory of frequency components faltinsen 1993 in the frequency domain approach the qtf and the wave spectrum are the two main components used to calculate wave added resistance various researchers have researched the spectrum of a wave among them pierson moskwitz pierson and moskowitz 1964 measured waves in the pacific ocean and created a spectrum that describes the relationship between wind and waves assuming a fully developed sea however sea is never fully developed and always varies according to its geography and seasons in other words pierson moskwitz spectrum could not represent all stochastic character of seas therefore various spectrums are invented to describe several other sea characteristics joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum is also invented to present the characteristic of the north sea s north sea is harsher than pacific sea so jonswap spectrum has higher peak of wave spectrum than pierson moskwitz spectrum bretschneider modified the pierson moskwitz spectrum to include the wave spreading as a cosine function bretschneider 1959 ochi and hubble 1977 propose a bi modal spectrum that could model the effects of a swell in a different way than an uni modal spectrum such as pierson moskwitz and bretschneider spectrum currently meteorological organizations provide a forecast and hindcast wave spectrum that is 2d in a particular position and time tolman 2009 this paper uses forecast 2d wave spectra provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to estimate wave added resistance throughout the voyage route of a ship bjornsson björnsson 2013 compared the wave added resistance of bulk carrier under 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra conditions according to his research the wave added resistance estimation between the 1d wave spectrum and the 2d wave spectra cases generally differ by an average of 8 and in the worst case scenario they differ by more than 50 also he expanded his researches to study the dynamic stability of the ship by comparison 1d wave spectrum condition and 2d wave spectra condition rosén et al 2013 graham juszko graham and juszko 1993 developed a 10 parameter spectrum that could be applied to both uni and bi modal seas other than the above mentioned references there is very rare mention in the literature of any exploration of the effects of wave spectrum characteristics on wave added resistance and the performance of a vessel for the weather routing decision making various researchers have studied to develop an efficient route decision making algorithm generally such efforts focus on the optimization algorithm at first dijkstra and a star method are the representative graphical approach based optimization algorithm that is applied to ship route decision making these methods could find the route time effective but it also has a deficit in that all grids should be generated to calculate for the whole interest domain in order to solve this deficit shao shao et al 2012 the three dimensional dynamic programming method was proposed dynamic programming does not need a grid for whole interests so that this approach can reduce the computational burden kwon 2008 proposed a simplified method which is to calculate the degraded speed performance under sea conditions using only a ship s heading and the beaufort number which represents the harshness of sea henry chen 1978 firstly tried to apply 2d directional wave spectra to motion response in route decision making problem but he does not consider 2d wave spectra in wave added resistance calculation he only calculates the wave added resistance by using a simplified wave empirical formula without considering its directionality and 2d directional wave spectra are used to calculate the motion response of a vessel which is the constraint of the route decision making optimization in regard to the navigation technique the voyage standard in the 1800s was to operate along a rhumb line which is the straight line in the mercator map not considering the geoid in a modern voyage the great circle line which is the shortest line on the geoid is the basic reference route for the voyage in 1950 meteorologists made pre arranged routes because environmental factors are crucial they must be considered in order to ensure the safety of the route at first meteorologists chose routes in order to escape harsh weather this approach is the state of the art at this moment since the oil price crisis in 2000 foc has become an important consideration in route decision making in recent years environmental regulations have become strict therefore there has been an effort to reduce emissions principally emission is highly related to fuel consumption therefore the need for fuel saving routing is high the accomplishment of route decision making relies on the accuracy of the performance of the ship as the performance estimation is realistic as the route decision making become credible and accurate therefore many studies have been conducted to predict the realistic performance of a ship iso 15016 is proposed as the standard method by which estimates the ship performance iso 2002 this procedure also is the basis of the energy efficiency design index eedi and the energy efficiency operation index eeoi calculations in iso 15016 the main components of resistance such as calm water wind wave current temperature and others are included iso 15016 assumes the 1d idealized wave spectrum in order to evaluate the added resistance of wave kim also compared to estimate the power of vessel based on iso 15016 method and compared to real measurement during the sea kim et al 2017 in this paper a new method is proposed to estimate the ship s performance accurately based on the realistic environments what the vessel really experiences the new method uses forecast wave 2d spectra that fit the ship s voyage route to estimate the wave added resistance to evaluate the performance of the new method the comparative analysis of the difference between the 1d idealized spectrum and the forecast 2d spectra for the 173k lng carrier would be conducted by routing decision making simulation in the pacific and atlantic oceans in section 2 the background theory of route decision making and waved added resistance calculation are stated that section also introduces the state of the art of wave added resistance estimation and route decision making optimization in section 3 modeling is performed for the wave added resistance according to the 1d idealized spectrum and the forecast tailor made 2d wave spectra in section 4 the validation results are shown using the comparison of model tests and a calculation using the 1d idealized spectrum besides the uncertainty effects on route decision making procedure is exploited section 5 investigated the estimation difference according to the 1d wave spectrum and the forecast tailor made 2d wave forecast by comparison with power measurement during the real voyage data of 173k lng carrier the route decision making performance is assessed when the great circle line voyage the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra is hired in the pacific and atlantic oceans in section 6 the result of this research is concluded 2 mathematical modeling in this section the algorithm of routing decision making is defined mathematically the route decision making could be formulated as the optimization problem which is consists of an object function design variables and constraints the object function of routing decision making is to minimize fuel oil consumption foc which is the function of resistance propulsion and environments to determine foc the modeling of resistance caused by the hull itself and environmental loads is necessary among environmental loads modeled wave load modeling is primary because the wave load is the most influential component when the environment becomes harsh this paper proposes an improved method by which to estimate the wave load therefore its mathematical modeling process will be stated in detail at this section 2 1 problem formulation route decision making is the process of choosing the best candidate among possible route candidates not only achieving the goal of the voyage but fulfilling safety criteria at an earlier route decision making research stage the strategy of finding the shortest path is employed but this strategy requires grids that cover all search areas eskild 2014 currently the grid less approach 3d dynamic programming 3ddp is the state of the art larsson and simonsen 2014 for route decision making because it has shorter computation time than the traditional grid based approach in this paper 3ddp is employed to solve the optimization problem in section 2 2 the detail usage demonstration of 3ddp would be described with visual examples in order to solve the optimization problem route decision making could be formulated as follows route decision making problem formulation object function to minimize the fuel oil consumption of the ship constraints required arrival time land avoidance speed heading and power limitations design variables heading and speed of ship fig 1 presents the schematic diagram for overall route decision making process the great circle line is set to as the initial route of the optimization procedure which is the shortest path considering the curvature of the earth after that the algorithm generates sub stages of the route that are the unit of dynamic programming next the algorithm evaluates the foc caused by the summation of resistance of the hull and environmental loads then the algorithm chooses the candidate of route that requires the minimum foc while staying within the constraints fig 2 compares the conventional method with the proposed route decision making method there are two distinctive procedures that are in dotted line square at the figure the conventional method always applies identical sea characteristics the pierson moskowtiz spectrum is adopted for all candidates of the target route in the shipbuilding era meanwhile the proposed method loads the corresponding forecast wave spectra of candidates then the conventional method uses only the quadratic transfer function qtf according to the dominant wave direction but the proposed method calculates all the qtfs that are in the 2d wave spectra of route candidates accordingly the propose method considers every frequency and direction of the waves that the sea has at that time 2 2 the demonstration of 3ddp in this section the route decision optimization procedure of 3ddp s is demonstrated the proposed method hired the 3ddp is the main optimization frame for the route decision making optimization 3ddp is state of the art for optimization solving strategy which divides the whole big optimization problem into small sub problems applying bellman s principal the optimal of the whole problem could be the integration of the optimal of sub problems bellman and zadeh 1970 according to the shao shao et al 2012 research shows the 3ddp s performance is superior to other conventional route decision strategies dijkstra monochromatic and a method fig 3 shows the typical 3ddp s grid system that consists of the great circle line as an initial route in black and a grid next to the stages on the great circle line as red dots the 3ddp method uses a combination of the speed and heading that are design values toward the next stages possible destination and chose the best candidate which minimizes the fuel consumption fig 3 shows the grid system of 3ddp red circles with black line are the stage on the along the great circle line in longitudinal direction the great circle line is divided into the number of stages n red circles are the substages in latitudinal direction the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra both adopt the three dimensional dynamic positioning method 3ddp for routing optimization the procedure of 3ddp could be exploited as following steps step 1 generate the great circle line from departure and arrival as presented in fig 4 step 2 set the great circle line as the reference route that is the initial condition of route decision making process step 3 divide the reference route into stages in a longitudinal direction as like in fig 5 generally the number of stages depends on the distance of the route but twenty stages give good converged result shao et al 2012 step 4 in latitudinal direction the 10 latitudinal stage points are generated as like fig 6 generally the number of stages depends on the distance of the route but ten substages give good converged result shao et al 2012 step 5 the route candidates are defined by the combination of a longitudinal and latitudinal points on stage these candidates decide the vessel s heading so far the two dimensional i e longitudinal and latitudinal route candidates are generated each heading candidates have the speed candidates therefore the route candidates have three dimensions longitudinal latitudinal and speed as like in fig 7 in consequence the foc of vessel variates the route in speed and heading wise step 6 the foc of all route candidates are calculated then method select the route candidate which has minimum foc in the stages and the substages the combination of the minimum route candidates is the final optimal route 2 3 performance estimation fuel oil consumption estimation the 3ddp method is a way to choose the best candidate in every stage which minimizes the object function which is generally the estimation of the foc therefore when the foc estimation is realistic it promises a truthful result for the route decision making therefore the model of the foc of the ship is directly determined by the accuracy of the resistance estimation one of the aims of this paper is to enhance the quality of the foc estimation using the more precise estimation of the wave added resistance considering the operation profile of the ship the foc is modeled as the function of power as in equation 1 kim and kim 2018 the relation between power and foc could be defined using the specific fuel oil consumption rate sfoc which is grounded in engine characteristics for the power evaluation the overall procedure followed iso 15016 1 f u e l o i l c o n s u m p t i o n p o w e r t s f o c 1000 3600 p o w e r r v t v a where r total resistance v ship actual speed t time sfoc specific fuel oil consumption t thrust va ship speed after the estimation of power then the amounts of fuel oil consumption and co2 emission are obtained by the specific fuel oil consumption sfoc and emission rate that are the engine characteristics kim and kim 2018 man 12500 kw engines 2 ea which are installed in 173k lngc are used for the modeling fig 8 presents the sfoc and the non dimensional amount of carbon dioxide see fig 7 in routing decision making there is two way to consider the effect of environmental loads such as wind wave and current load the first way is to regard the environmental loads as the source of speed loss kwon 2008 and lu lu et al 2015 under this sense the ship keeps the power then the speed of the vessel decreased as the amount of the additional environmental load as like equation as shown in equation 2 2 p actual r calm r wind r wave r current v actual where vactual vcalm vspeed loss due to environment the second way is to keep the speed vtarget vcalm and put additional power penvironment that overcome the environmental loads in this research the route decision making method speed evaluation adopts this way during the optimization therefore this research regards the environmental loads are the additional power as describe in equation 3 3 p calm p environment r calm r wind r wave r current v target where vtarget vcalm speed candidate consequently this routing optimization method of this research regards the environmental loads as the additional cost of fuel oil consumption and power therefore the optimization method act to minimize additional environmental loads for added resistance estimation following component should be considered in equation 4 4 r t o t a l r c a l m w a t e r r w i n d r w a v e r c u r r e n t rtotal total resistance rcalm resistance in calm water rwave added wave added resistance rwind wind resistance wind load could be formulated as in equation 5 wind loads could be modeled based on the multiplication of the projection area and the square of wind speed c aa is obtained from the wind tunnel tank test here it is based on the wind coefficient and area 22 kim et al 2012 isherwood 1972 5 r w i n d 0 5 ρ a c a a ψ w r a t v w r 2 ρa air density vwr and ψwr relative wind speed and direction respectively at and vg projected area and advancing speed of the ship respectively caa wind load coefficient in route decision making the wave load modeling is the most critical part because the contribution of wave load increases exponentially when the sea state becomes severe fig 9 presents the ratio between wave load and calm sea hull resistance on the lng carrier based on the results of the model test in the wave tank basin in sea state 4 the wave added resistance accounted for only 30 of the hull resistance but the wave resistance is bigger than the hull resistance in sea states 6 and 8 it increases exponentially as the sea state becomes harsh an interesting topic for future work is the power allocation which is applied to thrust power regard to overcoming wave load and hull resistance an examination of this issue is not included in this paper 2 4 wave added resistance calculation in the following sections 2 4 1 2 4 2 and 2 4 3 the theoretical background of the wave added resistance calculation and its procedure is described 2 4 1 wave theory for wave added resistance and motion analysis in a frequency domain wave theory assumes that ship meets irregular waves which consists of the various frequency of regular waves also the irregular waves have linear characteristics so their impact on the ship could be obtained by predicting the superposed form of regular waves the characteristics of a partial regular wave could be formulated as in equation 6 6 ζ i a i cos ω i t ε i where ai is i th half wave height ωi is i th frequencies εi is random phase t is time and ζi is i th partial wave component according to bjornsson björnsson 2013 wave environment could be represented as the statistical spectral formulation of the seaway in the frequency domain the 1d spectrum and 2d spectra could be modeled as in equation 7 7 1 d m n 0 s ω ω n d ω 2 d m n 0 0 2 π s ω μ ω n d ω d μ where m is the spectral moment s ω is spectrum ω is the frequency and μ is the wave direction in conventional ship motion analysis the wave added resistance and the motion characteristics of a ship are assessed under the 1d wave spectrum assumption wave added resistance and motion could be integrated into the multiplication of qtf quadratic transfer function response amplitude operator and wave spectrum as in equation 8 faltinsen 1993 8 w a v e a d d e d re s i s tan c e 0 q t f ω s ω d ω 1 d m n 0 s ω ω n d ω 2 d m n 0 0 2 π s ω μ ω n d ω d μ m o t i o n 0 r a o ω s ω d ω where rao is the unit response operator due to unit wave qtf is the quadratic transfer function s ω is spectrum ω is the frequency therefore the wave spectrum and spectra roles are used to describe the relationship between the wave spectral density and the wave frequencies and direction for the wave added resistance and motion calculation the wave spectrum information is an essential component basically the wave spectrum is generated from the wave measurement by a statistical approach which means that the wave spectrum represents the characteristics in a particular sea sector pierson and moskowitz 1964 therefore it is not possible that certain sea spectra could represent all sea sectors ochi and hubble 1977 therefore in the following section the various wave spectra used in a frequency domain are reviewed and 2d wave spectra which is the target to be analyzed in this paper are described 2 4 2 wave spectrum the pierson moskwitz spectrum which is generally applied to ship motion analysis in a shipbuilding sector natskår et al 2015 assumes a fully developed wind driven sea for the sea to become fully developed by wind the wind must blow uni directionally and continuously for more than 8 h in the actual seas it is hard to reproduce a fully developed sea sea and wind are always changing so this is an idealized condition that aims to standardize the wave added resistance calculation this idealized 1d spectrum is formulated as in equation 9 9 s ω 123 95 h s 2 t z 4 e t z 4 ω 4 495 8 ω 5 where ω is wave radial frequency hs is the significant wave height and tz is mean zero crossing period from now the representative wave spectrums in contemporary motion analysis are reviewed 2d and 3d view of the wave spectrum are presented for comparison to 2d wave spectra fig 10 shows the coordinate of 3d view of wave spectrum that coordinate is the cylindrical coordinate the radial distance means the radial frequency ω and the angular coordinate means the wave incident angle μ the height of figure means the spectral density fig 11 shows the representation of the pierson moskwitz spectrum in a 3d view the pierson moskwitz spectrum represents the uni directional wave which has condensed energy density in the dominant direction without considering wave spreading the disadvantage of the pierson moskwitz application is that it overestimates the effect of a wave in the dominant direction compared to the real sea environment in route decision making it excessively eliminates the route candidates of harsh wave conditions the pierson moskwitz spectrum is widely employed for the motion performance assessment of the vessel however three respects of the pierson moskwitz spectrum can be improved first the pierson moskwitz spectrum could not present the bi modal spectrum which indicates a sea dominated by swells as in the seas of west africa or australia second the peak of the pierson moskwitz spectrum is too moderate to describe a harsh environment at last the pierson moskwitz spectrum could not describe the wav spreading phenomenon these three factors are why the ochi hubble jonswap and bretschneider spectrum were invented to consider the wave spreading effect the bret schneider spectrum was proposed employing the direction factor μ as in equation 10 10 s ω b r e t s h n e i d e r 2 π cos 2 μ 123 95 h s 2 t z 4 e t z 4 ω 4 495 8 90 μ 90 where ω is wave frequency hs is the wave height tz is zero crossing period μ is the wave incident direction as seen in fig 12 in the bretschneider spectrum model the peak and spreading due to the wave heading however the bretschnider spectrum has a limitation in that it considers wave spreading as just one uniform distribution uniform distribution does not describe the variation of wave spreading and the swell effect in the peak of the spectrum moreover if there are multiple wave components from different sources those could not be included in the spectrum a swell driven sea is caused by remote distant events such as storms therefore its wave length is long and after traveling fast and covering several thousand of sea miles they dissipate completely it makes another peak in the wave spectrum in low frequency to describe these bi modal characteristics of a swell driven sea the ochi hubble spectrum was invented it is shown in equation 11 and in fig 13 11 s ω o c h i h u b b l e 1 4 4 λ 1 4 ω m 4 γ λ 1 h s 2 ω 4 λ 1 e 4 λ 1 4 ω m ω 4 where γ is gamma function λ is wave length ω radial frequency ωm is lower radial frequency in this paper forecast 2d wave spectra corresponding to the route of the ship are adopted for the wave added resistance estimation the 2d wave spectra could be provided by a meteorological organization such as the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the 2d spectra describe the realistic sea environment a vessel experiences through the course of a voyage better than the conventional spectrum fig 14 presents the example of forecast 2d wave spectra showing the function of wave frequency and direction forecast 2d wave spectra applied to motion analysis and wave added resistance could offer three benefits this method could consider the effects caused by distribution of wave spreading geographical changes and seasonal characteristics also regard to shipping the prime benefit of the 2d wave spectra application is that the proposed method predicts wave added resistance precisely because the suggested method applies the corresponding 2d wave spectra due to the operation profile of a ship specifically this method gives a realistic methodology by which to calculate the wave added resistance well which is the prime factor in the route decision making throughout the voyage the conventional method uses a spectrum that only represents a generalized fully developed sea but the developed method could describe the environmental characteristics in an operational weather window figs 15 and 16 show the series of forecast 2d wave spectra due to a stage of route profile for the calculation the all grid and sub grid of the route candidates have the forecast 2d wave spectra set meanwhile the conventional method treats all grid has an identical wave spectrum the pierson moskwitz spectrum 3 wave added resistance calculation using 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra in this section the method used to calculate the wave added resistance using the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra are explained a quadratic transfer function qtf is obtained by the motion analysis and the model test of the ship here the frequency domain motion analysis tool was used to calculate the qtf of 173k lngc under regular wave conditions 22 kim et al 2012 isherwood 1972 the methods used to calculate a wave resistance when it uses 1d and 2d wave spectra are described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 respectively 3 1 wave added resistance calculation modeling 1d idealized spectrum wave added resistance is the most contribute component in route decision making wave added resistance could be formulated the integral form of qtf and wave spectrum in the frequency domain approach wave resistance could be calculated as in equation 12 12 r w a v e a d d e d q t f ω s ω d ω where ω represent the frequency of the wave respectively and s ω represents the wave spectrum qtf ω is quadratic transfer function which is the response function of second order fig 17 presents the 1d qtf of the lngc under speeds of 14 17 and 20 knots the value of the y axis is non dimensional value 3 2 wave added resistance calculation modeling 2d wave spectra through section 2 4 to 3 the difference between the proposed 2d wave spectra base wave added resistance calculation and the conventional 1d idealized spectra are stated according to björnsson 2013 the accuracy of the 2d wave spectra method is improved compared to the conventional 1d idealized method by about 30 in wave added resistance estimation the reason why the 2d wave spectra method is superior to the 1d ideal wave spectrum is in the wave estimation resistance that the 2d wave spectra method could consider the wave spreading in a frequency and a direction domain and the temporal stochastic characteristic variation of an actual sea generally the pierson moskwitz spectrum is used in the wave added resistance calculation in the merchant ship area but it assumes the ideal fully developed sea condition moreover it could not consider the wave spreading and real time stochastic variation of seas the wave basin model test is a probable way to compare the difference between the 1d ideal wave method and the 2d wave spectra method the multi direction and frequency wave generator is necessary to compare the 1d and the 2d method at the wave model test basin the real scale wave added resistance measurement at the voyage would be another option to compare the precision of the1d and the 2d wave method conventional wave added resistance estimation using the 1d idealized spectrum overestimates the total force and it cannot capture the directionality and the spreading of wind driven waves and the multi modal characteristics of a swell the wave added resistance is estimated using forecast 2d spectra as defined in equation 13 this form could consider the effects caused by the variation of a spectral density of wave frequencies and direction 13 r w a v e a d d e d μ ω q t f ω μ s ω μ d ω d μ where ω and μ represent the frequency and direction the wave respectively and s ω μ represents the wave spectrum qtf ω μ is quadratic transfer function which is the response function of second order fig 18 presents the 2d and 3d view of 2d qtfs that are the function of wave frequency and wave incident angle at vessel speed 14 17 and 21 knots z value in 3d view and y value in 2d view is non dimensional value respectively 4 wave added resistance estimation validation to model test and uncertainty assessment to prove the validity of the wave added resistance calculation the wave added resistance estimation developed by the simulation program is compared to the model test results under identical environment conditions the wave added resistance calculation developed by using the 1d idealized wave spectrum is compared to the model test under the sea states 4 6 and 8 from a head sea wave using the in house simulation program in house simulation program is included in the route decision making algorithm is developed to calculate the environmental added resistance given in house wave added resistance calculation module calculates the wave added resistance under irregular sea condition by using the combination of wave spectrum and qtf quadratic transfer function in case of qtf was obtained from wish which is ship motion analysis program based on the rankine panel method park et al 2019 4 1 target vessel the 173 000 m3 liquefied natural gas carrier lngc is targeted for the simulation lngc is the representative vessel for the contemporary lng shipping business fig 19 shows the mesh model for the wave frequency domain motion analysis table 1 summarizes the ship particulars of 173 k lngc the environmental conditions used in the simulation and model test are summarized in table 2 sea state 4 6 and 8 are adopted to compare the model test with the estimation results 4 2 comparison of estimation and model test result for wave added using 1d spectrum for the validation the wave added resistance estimation result achieved by motion analysis is compared to the model test result under identical wave spectrum employing the pierson moskwitz spectrum under sea state 4 6 and 8 the comparison results are shown in fig 20 the grey bar shows the estimation result and the doted bar present the model test results both results are well matched in overall sea states the comparison results show the simulation tool which was invented for this research is valid for use in reproducing the wave added resistance the error is under 2 y value of chart is non dimensional value which is non dimensionalized an wave added resistance at sea state 8 model test 4 3 uncertainty assessment the route decision making optimization procedure is the process that decides the best route candidate among the possible route candidates by comparative analysis based on the ship performance estimation the estimation of a ship s performance has related to various uncertainty such as method uncertainty and input data uncertainty insel 2008 tillig et al 2018 the method uncertainty is that the outcome difference caused by the difference of the method in the resistance environmental load and propulsion power estimation this research evaluated the possible route candidate by using identical ship performance modeling based on iso 15016 that is the standard ship performance evaluation method iso 2002 therefore uncertainty from the difference in the way of estimation does not affect the route selection the main source of uncertainty in foc estimation is uncertainty of input data the primary source of the uncertainty is the weather data the other design data such as the hull form the propeller and the engine data are accurately obtained from the real ship design data and model test data in the detail design and construction therefore this study does not target to analyze the uncertainty from the difference in dimension of the vessel the forecast weather uncertainty generally counts on the estimation error of the forecast accordingly this study conducts the uncertainty assessment that analyzes the contribution to foc estimation caused by the weather input data the monte carlo method is hired for the uncertainty assessment the author assessed the uncertainty of the route decision making method by investigating the quantitative change of fuel oil consumption due to the uncertainty amount of the input variables such as wind wave and current the uncertainty of the proposed method could be determined as seen in equation 14 14 u n c e r t a i n t y f u e l o

uncertainty the maximum 10 percent intended error is included in the assessment the intended uncertainty is included in the input variables wave direction wave period wave height current direction current speed wind direction and wind speed it is assumed that the input variables have a normal distribution 10 000 samples made by the combination of the input variables such as wind wave and current are used in the assessment fig 21 presents the result of uncertainty assessment that reveals the relation between the estimation of foc and the weather uncertainty variables the wave direction is the most sensitive factor to make a difference in the foc estimation the estimation uncertainty due to wave direction and significant wave height is 1 2 and 0 9 of total foc the summation of uncertainty due to weather is 2 7 of foc in this study the distribution of weather forecast is assumed but precisely its distribution and quantity are related to the weather forecast quality of meteorological organization such as noaa s wave watch iii model also the time window of weather forecasts is related in the future works an ensemble weather routing analysis that combines the weather uncertainty and the ship routing decision making together 5 simulation results in this section two main results are revealed in section 5 1 the forecast 2d wave spectra is employed to estimate the power of the ship during the voyage this estimation result measures how much the proposed 2d wave spectra method well estimates the power during voyage the 1d idealized wave spectrum method the proposed method and the measured power during the voyage i e actual value were compared in the case of measured power history the real voyage operation data of 173 000 m3 lngc is employed in 5 2 the proposed 2d wave spectra method is applied to the route decision making a comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance route decision making between 1d conventional spectrum and the proposed method the pacific and atlantic are the target simulation cases 5 1 the comparison study of power estimation 1d idealized spectrum vs forecast 2d wave spectra fig 22 the comparison among measured power which is true value the power estimation based on one dimensional wave spectrum calculation and the proposed new method which adopts forecast 2d wave spectra the black line indicated the measured power during the 173 k lngc voyage the one dimensional wave spectrum is the blue dotted line and two dimensional wave spectra method is the red line according to the result in the overall view the proposed 2d wave spectra method estimated the power better than the conventional 1d idealized method the power estimation result of the conventional method shows many spikes due to the change in the wave direction this spike means that the estimation result of the conventional wave overestimated the change of direction also the prediction method of 1d spectrum is sensitive due to the direction change 5 2 route decision making results 5 2 1 simulation cases the performance of route decision making is investigated with regard to the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra upon different sea conditions in the pacific and atlantic oceans august 2017 was picked as the simulated season for the route decision optimization the reason why the summer season was chosen for the simulation is the wave condition harsher compared to the winter season due to tropical storm and typhoon the route decision making gives the efficient and safe route simultaneously under even the harsh weather therefore the summer condition is selected in the future works the effect of the various weather season and condition is worth to be investigated environmental data is acquired form the national oceanic and atmospheric administration table 3 shows the route information on target seas the pacific ocean has more moderate conditions than the atlantic two routes were selected to compare the differences of routing performance achieved by using 1d and 2d wave spectrum methods fig 23 shows the great circle lines which are the shortest paths between departures and arrivals for the pacific and atlantic oceans the great circle line is used as the initial condition of the optimization procedure the pacific route is the next promising route for the lng import and export between the united states and asia the atlantic route is selected to present the difference between the 1d wave spectrum method and the 2d wave spectra in a strong swell area 5 2 2 the result of route decision making the pacific ocean case great circle line voyage the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra methods are compared in route decision making performances for the pacific ocean route in the case of the 2d wave spectra method different 2d wave spectra are considered according to corresponding stages and substages of route decision making optimization fig 24 shows forecast 2d wave spectra corresponding to the stages that are divided unit time segments of 6 h of the route optimization procedure fig 24 shows the plan view of the 2d wave spectra forecast data at corresponding stages along the great circle line that is the initial condition of the route decision making process the figure is the plan view of 2d wave spectra the color of the figure describes the intensity of the spectral density s μ ω the number in the figure presents the stages the proposed route decision making process used these forecast 2d wave spectra to estimate the wave added resistance of the route candidates noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration provides the 2d wave forecast data where wave measurement buoy located tolman 2009 fig 25 shows the averaged weather of voyage and route together on the surface of the earth the different routes are the great circle line the route using the 1d wave spectrum and the route using the 2d wave spectra the red line is the great circle line the route based on the 1d wave spectrum is the navy dash dotted line and the route based on the 2d wave spectra is the purple dotted line the route using the forecast 2d wave spectra goes toward where the wave condition is harsher than the 1d wave spectrum route decision also in the case of the direction of the heading the 2d wave spectra case uses the head sea condition more than the 1d wave spectrum because the peak of the heading of the 2d wave spectra is lower than that of the 1d wave spectrum fig 24 shows the corresponding 2d wave spectra according to the stages of the route the forecast 2d wave spectra changed a lot along the way points of route the conventional 1d ideal wave spectrum could not capture this variation in the route decision making algorithm and it degraded the performance of the route decision making the 1d ideal method tends to overestimate the wave load and fuel consumption table 4 summarizes the performance of the route optimization method in the pacific the fuel oil consumption in the 2d wave method is noticeably better than the 1d ideal method and the great circle route by 6 and 9 respectively in table 4 the average speed due to methods and speed variation in each stage are summarized in speed regards the great circle line method chooses the vessel speed that satisfies the required time arrival the 1d and 2d method s vessel speeds are varied to environments of the stage based on the results the 2d wave spectra method chooses harsher wave and lower vessel speed than the 1d wave spectrum method because the 2d wave spectra method estimates the wave added resistance more precise and chooses the shorter route than the 1d wave spectrum method low speed result of 2d wave spectra method is found from v3 to v10 due to power constraint the 1d wave spectrum method chooses the longer distance and high speed due to escape harsh weather in table 4 v1 v2 and v20 denotes that the speed optimization result at each stage i e v1 is the speed optimization result at the first stage and v20 denotes the 20th stage speed optimization the motion criteria due to 1d and 2d wave spectra are also a fascinating issue and worth analyzing in the future 5 2 3 the atlantic ocean case fig 26 shows the samples of 2d wave spectra along the stages of the great circle route which is the initial state of route optimization near west africa the swell is quite intense compared to the pacific sea therefore multiple components could be found in the figure such as stage 9 10 13 20 fig 27 shows the global routes and the corresponding averaged weather weather is milder in the atlantic than in the pacific during this season near the west of africa the route based on the 1d wave spectrum is the navy dash dotted line and the route based on the proposed forecast 2d wave spectra method is the purple dotted line table 5 summarizes the performance of the route optimization method in the atlantic the fuel oil consumption of the 2d wave method showed a noticeable improvement over the 1d ideal method and great circle route there are two reason 2d wave method yields such impressive results first the 2d wave spectra could figure the optimal route that minimize the environmental loads efficiently second the swell component is very dominant in the south atlantic so the 2d wave spectra could capture it brilliantly in table 5 the average speed due to methods and speed variation in each stage are summarized in speed regards the great circle line method simply chooses the vessel speed that satisfies the required time arrival rta the 1d and 2d method s vessel speeds satisfied the rta but also methods consider its environmental load variation in the atlantic case the 2d wave spectra based route decision making method shows more noticeable foc reduction compared to the pacific case the 2d wave spectra method could save 11 more than the great circle navigation and 8 more than the conventional 1d spectrum method 6 conclusion in this research the newly developed route decision making method is described that uses forecast 2d wave spectra that fit into corresponding weather along with the operation profile of the ship s voyage its performance was compared to the conventional 1d idealized spectrum method to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method a 173 k lng carrier in the pacific and the atlantic ocean are simulated and compared to real measurement data the comparison of measured operation data proved the accuracy of the resistance estimation of the proposed 2d wave spectra method the 2d wave spectra method estimates the power well compared to the conventional 1d ideal wave spectrum method because 2d wave spectra method could capture the geographical and chronical characteristics of the voyage route in the case of foc performance the proposed method saved 6 more foc than the conventional 1d idealized spectrum in the pacific ocean in the atlantic ocean the proposed method was 8 better than the 1d idealized wave spectrum method the performance in the atlantic ocean showed that the proposed method can segregate the swell and multi modal effect well it could save 9 and 11 in the pacific and the atlantic respectively over the typical great circle route voyage the 2d wave spectra method tends to choose more the beam sea wave direction and moderate wave height than with the conventional method because the 2d wave spectra method can capture the intensity of wave added resistance more accurately with considering the spreading and the directionality the proposed 2d wave spectra method can be used not only for route decision making strategies but to evaluate other features of a ship s performance such as sloshing fatigue and motion the beauty of the proposed method is that it

22150,this paper developed the new route decision making method that implements the wave added resistance estimation method using forecast 2d wave spectra in a frequency and a direction domain specified through a ship s voyage route in the accepted conventional method a 1d idealized spectrum is applied to estimate the wave added resistance calculation in the process of performance evaluation in the route decision making algorithm wave added resistance estimation using an 1d idealized spectrum assumes that the statistical characteristics of the sea do not vary over the ship s route with regard to geography and season in the real world the characteristics of the sea continually vary according to the voyage route in which a vessel passes by this paper provides the method that calculates the added resistance of waves using forecast 2d wave spectra that provided tailor made stochastic data at any particular time and position along the route of the vessel the difference of the wave added resistance estimation using conventional 1d idealized spectrum method and the proposed forecast 2d wave spectra method is investigated by the comparative study of the estimation results model tests and the measured power during the real voyage case of 173k lngc in the pacific and atlantic ocean keywords route decision making wave added resistance weather routing operation profile lng carrier wave forecast 2d wave spectra weather forecast operation profile analysis autonomous vessel smart ship 1 introduction 1 1 motivation a vast shift from manned shipping to autonomous shipping is coming soon globally the international maritime organization declared merchant autonomous surface ship international maritime organization 2018 there are two main navigation algorithms by which autonomous vessels are controlled a route decision making algorithm and a collision avoidance algorithm of the two the routing algorithm which makes decisions regarding the macro route of autonomous vessels is at the forefront of research because it controls the efficiency and safety of the ship s navigation in macro view moreover the routing algorithm provides the reference route that is the initial route for collision avoidance generally the object function of route decision making is to minimize fuel oil consumption foc during a voyage while fulfilling the safety criteria motion risk comfort and required time arrival rta the foc is the key index that shows the performance of the voyage also shipowners are highly interested in the foc of ships which has led to a trend in the shipbuilding sector called the foc war even a 1 reduction in foc is crucial in the market because the foc is not only the most substantial contributor of operating expenditure opex but also the foc has positive proportional green house gas ghg stopford 2009 the foc of the ship is formulated of the function of time power and resistance kim and kim 2018 the main contributor to foc is the resistance of the hull itself and environmental loads such as wind current swell and wave naturally the quality of route decision making counts on the accuracy of the modeling of the resistance power and foc of the ship accordingly realistic power and resistance estimations assure the quality of route decision making strategy the power of the vessel has obtained the combination of thrust and resistance the thrust of the vessel generally obtained from a propeller open water and a self propulsion test among the components of resistance the wave added resistance is a crucial component because the contribution of wave load varies a lot due to environmental changes optimizing the route decision making process rests on it the effects of bare hull resistance and wind load on the route decision making optimization are less sensitive compared to the wave added resistance of a vessel to calculate the wave added resistance of ship the frequency domain analysis is the conventional method the wave added resistance is modeled as the integration of the wave spectrum and the quadratic transfer function qtf in the frequency domain approach the qtf is generally obtained from the frequency domain motion analysis or the model test in the case of spectrum modeling the estimation of wave loads traditionally assumes that every sea has a similar representative stochastic characteristic which is regarded as a fully developed sea but a sea is never fully developed characteristics of a sea vary in accordance with its geography and season environments always vary according to the route of a voyage therefore this variation of the environment along route is significant in route decision making modeling naturally a performance evaluation considering these environmental variations is essential to the investigation of the efficiency of a ship in terms of what the ship will experience during a voyage at this moment there are many needs of the shipowner to analyze the ship s performance not only simplified design conditions but realistic operation profile however the state of the art of the ship performance evaluation frame is done under the assumption of ideal calm sea conditions and the 1d spectrum which differs from a real sea where a ship s voyage actually occurs offshore platform and wind turbine industries adopt quite a different approach in which they consider environmental conditions especially wave conditions natskår et al 2015 this paper proposes a newly developed method for estimating wave added resistance using forecast 2d wave spectra which are made to fit the performance evaluation in accordance with the operation profile of a ship for routing decision making in actual position and time this wave spectra describe variations in wave spreading characteristics due to the geographical and seasonal differences using a 1d idealized wave spectrum causes the wave added resistance to be overestimated because it cannot consider the spreading factor in addition the 1d idealized spectrum assumes that the energy of wave is condensed in the dominant heading the proposed method is expected to improve the estimation of wave added resistance by considering the actual characteristics of the sea in the route decision making procedure the more precise estimation of wave added resistance promises a more accurate evaluation of the performance of a ship during the route decision making optimization routing performance was evaluated using an in house routing simulation program which is based on a three dimensional dynamic programming method that is validated by comparing the measured operation power and model test reference for the 173 k m3 cubic meter lng carrier towing tank test and wind tunnel test data of lng carrier is used in the analysis 1 2 state of the art for the estimation of the wave added resistance the frequency domain approach is the standard because the motion analysis is based on a linear superposition theory of frequency components faltinsen 1993 in the frequency domain approach the qtf and the wave spectrum are the two main components used to calculate wave added resistance various researchers have researched the spectrum of a wave among them pierson moskwitz pierson and moskowitz 1964 measured waves in the pacific ocean and created a spectrum that describes the relationship between wind and waves assuming a fully developed sea however sea is never fully developed and always varies according to its geography and seasons in other words pierson moskwitz spectrum could not represent all stochastic character of seas therefore various spectrums are invented to describe several other sea characteristics joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum is also invented to present the characteristic of the north sea s north sea is harsher than pacific sea so jonswap spectrum has higher peak of wave spectrum than pierson moskwitz spectrum bretschneider modified the pierson moskwitz spectrum to include the wave spreading as a cosine function bretschneider 1959 ochi and hubble 1977 propose a bi modal spectrum that could model the effects of a swell in a different way than an uni modal spectrum such as pierson moskwitz and bretschneider spectrum currently meteorological organizations provide a forecast and hindcast wave spectrum that is 2d in a particular position and time tolman 2009 this paper uses forecast 2d wave spectra provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to estimate wave added resistance throughout the voyage route of a ship bjornsson björnsson 2013 compared the wave added resistance of bulk carrier under 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra conditions according to his research the wave added resistance estimation between the 1d wave spectrum and the 2d wave spectra cases generally differ by an average of 8 and in the worst case scenario they differ by more than 50 also he expanded his researches to study the dynamic stability of the ship by comparison 1d wave spectrum condition and 2d wave spectra condition rosén et al 2013 graham juszko graham and juszko 1993 developed a 10 parameter spectrum that could be applied to both uni and bi modal seas other than the above mentioned references there is very rare mention in the literature of any exploration of the effects of wave spectrum characteristics on wave added resistance and the performance of a vessel for the weather routing decision making various researchers have studied to develop an efficient route decision making algorithm generally such efforts focus on the optimization algorithm at first dijkstra and a star method are the representative graphical approach based optimization algorithm that is applied to ship route decision making these methods could find the route time effective but it also has a deficit in that all grids should be generated to calculate for the whole interest domain in order to solve this deficit shao shao et al 2012 the three dimensional dynamic programming method was proposed dynamic programming does not need a grid for whole interests so that this approach can reduce the computational burden kwon 2008 proposed a simplified method which is to calculate the degraded speed performance under sea conditions using only a ship s heading and the beaufort number which represents the harshness of sea henry chen 1978 firstly tried to apply 2d directional wave spectra to motion response in route decision making problem but he does not consider 2d wave spectra in wave added resistance calculation he only calculates the wave added resistance by using a simplified wave empirical formula without considering its directionality and 2d directional wave spectra are used to calculate the motion response of a vessel which is the constraint of the route decision making optimization in regard to the navigation technique the voyage standard in the 1800s was to operate along a rhumb line which is the straight line in the mercator map not considering the geoid in a modern voyage the great circle line which is the shortest line on the geoid is the basic reference route for the voyage in 1950 meteorologists made pre arranged routes because environmental factors are crucial they must be considered in order to ensure the safety of the route at first meteorologists chose routes in order to escape harsh weather this approach is the state of the art at this moment since the oil price crisis in 2000 foc has become an important consideration in route decision making in recent years environmental regulations have become strict therefore there has been an effort to reduce emissions principally emission is highly related to fuel consumption therefore the need for fuel saving routing is high the accomplishment of route decision making relies on the accuracy of the performance of the ship as the performance estimation is realistic as the route decision making become credible and accurate therefore many studies have been conducted to predict the realistic performance of a ship iso 15016 is proposed as the standard method by which estimates the ship performance iso 2002 this procedure also is the basis of the energy efficiency design index eedi and the energy efficiency operation index eeoi calculations in iso 15016 the main components of resistance such as calm water wind wave current temperature and others are included iso 15016 assumes the 1d idealized wave spectrum in order to evaluate the added resistance of wave kim also compared to estimate the power of vessel based on iso 15016 method and compared to real measurement during the sea kim et al 2017 in this paper a new method is proposed to estimate the ship s performance accurately based on the realistic environments what the vessel really experiences the new method uses forecast wave 2d spectra that fit the ship s voyage route to estimate the wave added resistance to evaluate the performance of the new method the comparative analysis of the difference between the 1d idealized spectrum and the forecast 2d spectra for the 173k lng carrier would be conducted by routing decision making simulation in the pacific and atlantic oceans in section 2 the background theory of route decision making and waved added resistance calculation are stated that section also introduces the state of the art of wave added resistance estimation and route decision making optimization in section 3 modeling is performed for the wave added resistance according to the 1d idealized spectrum and the forecast tailor made 2d wave spectra in section 4 the validation results are shown using the comparison of model tests and a calculation using the 1d idealized spectrum besides the uncertainty effects on route decision making procedure is exploited section 5 investigated the estimation difference according to the 1d wave spectrum and the forecast tailor made 2d wave forecast by comparison with power measurement during the real voyage data of 173k lng carrier the route decision making performance is assessed when the great circle line voyage the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra is hired in the pacific and atlantic oceans in section 6 the result of this research is concluded 2 mathematical modeling in this section the algorithm of routing decision making is defined mathematically the route decision making could be formulated as the optimization problem which is consists of an object function design variables and constraints the object function of routing decision making is to minimize fuel oil consumption foc which is the function of resistance propulsion and environments to determine foc the modeling of resistance caused by the hull itself and environmental loads is necessary among environmental loads modeled wave load modeling is primary because the wave load is the most influential component when the environment becomes harsh this paper proposes an improved method by which to estimate the wave load therefore its mathematical modeling process will be stated in detail at this section 2 1 problem formulation route decision making is the process of choosing the best candidate among possible route candidates not only achieving the goal of the voyage but fulfilling safety criteria at an earlier route decision making research stage the strategy of finding the shortest path is employed but this strategy requires grids that cover all search areas eskild 2014 currently the grid less approach 3d dynamic programming 3ddp is the state of the art larsson and simonsen 2014 for route decision making because it has shorter computation time than the traditional grid based approach in this paper 3ddp is employed to solve the optimization problem in section 2 2 the detail usage demonstration of 3ddp would be described with visual examples in order to solve the optimization problem route decision making could be formulated as follows route decision making problem formulation object function to minimize the fuel oil consumption of the ship constraints required arrival time land avoidance speed heading and power limitations design variables heading and speed of ship fig 1 presents the schematic diagram for overall route decision making process the great circle line is set to as the initial route of the optimization procedure which is the shortest path considering the curvature of the earth after that the algorithm generates sub stages of the route that are the unit of dynamic programming next the algorithm evaluates the foc caused by the summation of resistance of the hull and environmental loads then the algorithm chooses the candidate of route that requires the minimum foc while staying within the constraints fig 2 compares the conventional method with the proposed route decision making method there are two distinctive procedures that are in dotted line square at the figure the conventional method always applies identical sea characteristics the pierson moskowtiz spectrum is adopted for all candidates of the target route in the shipbuilding era meanwhile the proposed method loads the corresponding forecast wave spectra of candidates then the conventional method uses only the quadratic transfer function qtf according to the dominant wave direction but the proposed method calculates all the qtfs that are in the 2d wave spectra of route candidates accordingly the propose method considers every frequency and direction of the waves that the sea has at that time 2 2 the demonstration of 3ddp in this section the route decision optimization procedure of 3ddp s is demonstrated the proposed method hired the 3ddp is the main optimization frame for the route decision making optimization 3ddp is state of the art for optimization solving strategy which divides the whole big optimization problem into small sub problems applying bellman s principal the optimal of the whole problem could be the integration of the optimal of sub problems bellman and zadeh 1970 according to the shao shao et al 2012 research shows the 3ddp s performance is superior to other conventional route decision strategies dijkstra monochromatic and a method fig 3 shows the typical 3ddp s grid system that consists of the great circle line as an initial route in black and a grid next to the stages on the great circle line as red dots the 3ddp method uses a combination of the speed and heading that are design values toward the next stages possible destination and chose the best candidate which minimizes the fuel consumption fig 3 shows the grid system of 3ddp red circles with black line are the stage on the along the great circle line in longitudinal direction the great circle line is divided into the number of stages n red circles are the substages in latitudinal direction the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra both adopt the three dimensional dynamic positioning method 3ddp for routing optimization the procedure of 3ddp could be exploited as following steps step 1 generate the great circle line from departure and arrival as presented in fig 4 step 2 set the great circle line as the reference route that is the initial condition of route decision making process step 3 divide the reference route into stages in a longitudinal direction as like in fig 5 generally the number of stages depends on the distance of the route but twenty stages give good converged result shao et al 2012 step 4 in latitudinal direction the 10 latitudinal stage points are generated as like fig 6 generally the number of stages depends on the distance of the route but ten substages give good converged result shao et al 2012 step 5 the route candidates are defined by the combination of a longitudinal and latitudinal points on stage these candidates decide the vessel s heading so far the two dimensional i e longitudinal and latitudinal route candidates are generated each heading candidates have the speed candidates therefore the route candidates have three dimensions longitudinal latitudinal and speed as like in fig 7 in consequence the foc of vessel variates the route in speed and heading wise step 6 the foc of all route candidates are calculated then method select the route candidate which has minimum foc in the stages and the substages the combination of the minimum route candidates is the final optimal route 2 3 performance estimation fuel oil consumption estimation the 3ddp method is a way to choose the best candidate in every stage which minimizes the object function which is generally the estimation of the foc therefore when the foc estimation is realistic it promises a truthful result for the route decision making therefore the model of the foc of the ship is directly determined by the accuracy of the resistance estimation one of the aims of this paper is to enhance the quality of the foc estimation using the more precise estimation of the wave added resistance considering the operation profile of the ship the foc is modeled as the function of power as in equation 1 kim and kim 2018 the relation between power and foc could be defined using the specific fuel oil consumption rate sfoc which is grounded in engine characteristics for the power evaluation the overall procedure followed iso 15016 1 f u e l o i l c o n s u m p t i o n p o w e r t s f o c 1000 3600 p o w e r r v t v a where r total resistance v ship actual speed t time sfoc specific fuel oil consumption t thrust va ship speed after the estimation of power then the amounts of fuel oil consumption and co2 emission are obtained by the specific fuel oil consumption sfoc and emission rate that are the engine characteristics kim and kim 2018 man 12500 kw engines 2 ea which are installed in 173k lngc are used for the modeling fig 8 presents the sfoc and the non dimensional amount of carbon dioxide see fig 7 in routing decision making there is two way to consider the effect of environmental loads such as wind wave and current load the first way is to regard the environmental loads as the source of speed loss kwon 2008 and lu lu et al 2015 under this sense the ship keeps the power then the speed of the vessel decreased as the amount of the additional environmental load as like equation as shown in equation 2 2 p actual r calm r wind r wave r current v actual where vactual vcalm vspeed loss due to environment the second way is to keep the speed vtarget vcalm and put additional power penvironment that overcome the environmental loads in this research the route decision making method speed evaluation adopts this way during the optimization therefore this research regards the environmental loads are the additional power as describe in equation 3 3 p calm p environment r calm r wind r wave r current v target where vtarget vcalm speed candidate consequently this routing optimization method of this research regards the environmental loads as the additional cost of fuel oil consumption and power therefore the optimization method act to minimize additional environmental loads for added resistance estimation following component

wind resistance wind load could be formulated as in equation 5 wind loads could be modeled based on the multiplication of the projection area and the square of wind speed c aa is obtained from the wind tunnel tank test here it is based on the wind coefficient and area 22 kim et al 2012 isherwood 1972 5 r w i n d 0 5 ρ a c a a ψ w r a t v w r 2 ρa air density vwr and ψwr relative wind speed and direction respectively at and vg projected area and advancing speed of the ship respectively caa wind load coefficient in route decision making the wave load modeling is the most critical part because the contribution of wave load increases exponentially when the sea state becomes severe fig 9 presents the ratio between wave load and calm sea hull resistance on the lng carrier based on the results of the model test in the wave tank basin in sea state 4 the wave added resistance accounted for only 30 of the hull resistance but the wave resistance is bigger than the hull resistance in sea states 6 and 8 it increases exponentially as the sea state becomes harsh an interesting topic for future work is the power allocation which is applied to thrust power regard to overcoming wave load and hull resistance an examination of this issue is not included in this paper 2 4 wave added resistance calculation in the following sections 2 4 1 2 4 2 and 2 4 3 the theoretical background of the wave added resistance calculation and its procedure is described 2 4 1 wave theory for wave added resistance and motion analysis in a frequency domain wave theory assumes that ship meets irregular waves which consists of the various frequency of regular waves also the irregular waves have linear characteristics so their impact on the ship could be obtained by predicting the superposed form of regular waves the characteristics of a partial regular wave could be formulated as in equation 6 6 ζ i a i cos ω i t ε i where ai is i th half wave height ωi is i th frequencies εi is random phase t is time and ζi is i th partial wave component according to bjornsson björnsson 2013 wave environment could be represented as the statistical spectral formulation of the seaway in the frequency domain the 1d spectrum and 2d spectra could be modeled as in equation 7 7 1 d m n 0 s ω ω n d ω 2 d m n 0 0 2 π s ω μ ω n d ω d μ where m is the spectral moment s ω is spectrum ω is the frequency and μ is the wave direction in conventional ship motion analysis the wave added resistance and the motion characteristics of a ship are assessed under the 1d wave spectrum assumption wave added resistance and motion could be integrated into the multiplication of qtf quadratic transfer function response amplitude operator and wave spectrum as in equation 8 faltinsen 1993 8 w a v e a d d e d re s i s tan c e 0 q t f ω s ω d ω 1 d m n 0 s ω ω n d ω 2 d m n 0 0 2 π s ω μ ω n d ω d μ m o t i o n 0 r a o ω s ω d ω where rao is the unit response operator due to unit wave qtf is the quadratic transfer function s ω is spectrum ω is the frequency therefore the wave spectrum and spectra roles are used to describe the relationship between the wave spectral density and the wave frequencies and direction for the wave added resistance and motion calculation the wave spectrum information is an essential component basically the wave spectrum is generated from the wave measurement by a statistical approach which means that the wave spectrum represents the characteristics in a particular sea sector pierson and moskowitz 1964 therefore it is not possible that certain sea spectra could represent all sea sectors ochi and hubble 1977 therefore in the following section the various wave spectra used in a frequency domain are reviewed and 2d wave spectra which is the target to be analyzed in this paper are described 2 4 2 wave spectrum the pierson moskwitz spectrum which is generally applied to ship motion analysis in a shipbuilding sector natskår et al 2015 assumes a fully developed wind driven sea for the sea to become fully developed by wind the wind must blow uni directionally and continuously for more than 8 h in the actual seas it is hard to reproduce a fully developed sea sea and wind are always changing so this is an idealized condition that aims to standardize the wave added resistance calculation this idealized 1d spectrum is formulated as in equation 9 9 s ω 123 95 h s 2 t z 4 e t z 4 ω 4 495 8 ω 5 where ω is wave radial frequency hs is the significant wave height and tz is mean zero crossing period from now the representative wave spectrums in contemporary motion analysis are reviewed 2d and 3d view of the wave spectrum are presented for comparison to 2d wave spectra fig 10 shows the coordinate of 3d view of wave spectrum that coordinate is the cylindrical coordinate the radial distance means the radial frequency ω and the angular coordinate means the wave incident angle μ the height of figure means the spectral density fig 11 shows the representation of the pierson moskwitz spectrum in a 3d view the pierson moskwitz spectrum represents the uni directional wave which has condensed energy density in the dominant direction without considering wave spreading the disadvantage of the pierson moskwitz application is that it overestimates the effect of a wave in the dominant direction compared to the real sea environment in route decision making it excessively eliminates the route candidates of harsh wave conditions the pierson moskwitz spectrum is widely employed for the motion performance assessment of the vessel however three respects of the pierson moskwitz spectrum can be improved first the pierson moskwitz spectrum could not present the bi modal spectrum which indicates a sea dominated by swells as in the seas of west africa or australia second the peak of the pierson moskwitz spectrum is too moderate to describe a harsh environment at last the pierson moskwitz spectrum could not describe the wav spreading phenomenon these three factors are why the ochi hubble jonswap and bretschneider spectrum were invented to consider the wave spreading effect the bret schneider spectrum was proposed employing the direction factor μ as in equation 10 10 s ω b r e t s h n e i d e r 2 π cos 2 μ 123 95 h s 2 t z 4 e t z 4 ω 4 495 8 90 μ 90 where ω is wave frequency hs is the wave height tz is zero crossing period μ is the wave incident direction as seen in fig 12 in the bretschneider spectrum model the peak and spreading due to the wave heading however the bretschnider spectrum has a limitation in that it considers wave spreading as just one uniform distribution uniform distribution does not describe the variation of wave spreading and the swell effect in the peak of the spectrum moreover if there are multiple wave components from different sources those could not be included in the spectrum a swell driven sea is caused by remote distant events such as storms therefore its wave length is long and after traveling fast and covering several thousand of sea miles they dissipate completely it makes another peak in the wave spectrum in low frequency to describe these bi modal characteristics of a swell driven sea the ochi hubble spectrum was invented it is shown in equation 11 and in fig 13 11 s ω o c h i h u b b l e 1 4 4 λ 1 4 ω m 4 γ λ 1 h s 2 ω 4 λ 1 e 4 λ 1 4 ω m ω 4 where γ is gamma function λ is wave length ω radial frequency ωm is lower radial frequency in this paper forecast 2d wave spectra corresponding to the route of the ship are adopted for the wave added resistance estimation the 2d wave spectra could be provided by a meteorological organization such as the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf or the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the 2d spectra describe the realistic sea environment a vessel experiences through the course of a voyage better than the conventional spectrum fig 14 presents the example of forecast 2d wave spectra showing the function of wave frequency and direction forecast 2d wave spectra applied to motion analysis and wave added resistance could offer three benefits this method could consider the effects caused by distribution of wave spreading geographical changes and seasonal characteristics also regard to shipping the prime benefit of the 2d wave spectra application is that the proposed method predicts wave added resistance precisely because the suggested method applies the corresponding 2d wave spectra due to the operation profile of a ship specifically this method gives a realistic methodology by which to calculate the wave added resistance well which is the prime factor in the route decision making throughout the voyage the conventional method uses a spectrum that only represents a generalized fully developed sea but the developed method could describe the environmental characteristics in an operational weather window figs 15 and 16 show the series of forecast 2d wave spectra due to a stage of route profile for the calculation the all grid and sub grid of the route candidates have the forecast 2d wave spectra set meanwhile the conventional method treats all grid has an identical wave spectrum the pierson moskwitz spectrum 3 wave added resistance calculation using 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra in this section the method used to calculate the wave added resistance using the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra are explained a quadratic transfer function qtf is obtained by the motion analysis and the model test of the ship here the frequency domain motion analysis tool was used to calculate the qtf of 173k lngc under regular wave conditions 22 kim et al 2012 isherwood 1972 the methods used to calculate a wave resistance when it uses 1d and 2d wave spectra are described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 respectively 3 1 wave added resistance calculation modeling 1d idealized spectrum wave added resistance is the most contribute component in route decision making wave added resistance could be formulated the integral form of qtf and wave spectrum in the frequency domain approach wave resistance could be calculated as in equation 12 12 r w a v e a d d e d q t f ω s ω d ω where ω represent the frequency of the wave respectively and s ω represents the wave spectrum qtf ω is quadratic transfer function which is the response function of second order fig 17 presents the 1d qtf of the lngc under speeds of 14 17 and 20 knots the value of the y axis is non dimensional value 3 2 wave added resistance calculation modeling 2d wave spectra through section 2 4 to 3 the difference between the proposed 2d wave spectra base wave added resistance calculation and the conventional 1d idealized spectra are stated according to björnsson 2013 the accuracy of the 2d wave spectra method is improved compared to the conventional 1d idealized method by about 30 in wave added resistance estimation the reason why the 2d wave spectra method is superior to the 1d ideal wave spectrum is in the wave estimation resistance that the 2d wave spectra method could consider the wave spreading in a frequency and a direction domain and the temporal stochastic characteristic variation of an actual sea generally the pierson moskwitz spectrum is used in the wave added resistance calculation in the merchant ship area but it assumes the ideal fully developed sea condition moreover it could not consider the wave spreading and real time stochastic variation of seas the wave basin model test is a probable way to compare the difference between the 1d ideal wave method and the 2d wave spectra method the multi direction and frequency wave generator is necessary to compare the 1d and the 2d method at the wave model test basin the real scale wave added resistance measurement at the voyage would be another option to compare the precision of the1d and the 2d wave method conventional wave added resistance estimation using the 1d idealized spectrum overestimates the total force and it cannot capture the directionality and the spreading of wind driven waves and the multi modal characteristics of a swell the wave added resistance is estimated using forecast 2d spectra as defined in equation 13 this form could consider the effects caused by the variation of a spectral density of wave frequencies and direction 13 r w a v e a d d e d μ ω q t f ω μ s ω μ d ω d μ where ω and μ represent the frequency and direction the wave respectively and s ω μ represents the wave spectrum qtf ω μ is quadratic transfer function which is the response function of second order fig 18 presents the 2d and 3d view of 2d qtfs that are the function of wave frequency and wave incident angle at vessel speed 14 17 and 21 knots z value in 3d view and y value in 2d view is non dimensional value respectively 4 wave added resistance estimation validation to model test and uncertainty assessment to prove the validity of the wave added resistance calculation the wave added resistance estimation developed by the simulation program is compared to the model test results under identical environment conditions the wave added resistance calculation developed by using the 1d idealized wave spectrum is compared to the model test under the sea states 4 6 and 8 from a head sea wave using the in house simulation program in house simulation program is included in the route decision making algorithm is developed to calculate the environmental added resistance given in house wave added resistance calculation module calculates the wave added resistance under irregular sea condition by using the combination of wave spectrum and qtf quadratic transfer function in case of qtf was obtained from wish which is ship motion analysis program based on the rankine panel method park et al 2019 4 1 target vessel the 173 000 m3 liquefied natural gas carrier lngc is targeted for the simulation lngc is the representative vessel for the contemporary lng shipping business fig 19 shows the mesh model for the wave frequency domain motion analysis table 1 summarizes the ship particulars of 173 k lngc the environmental conditions used in the simulation and model test are summarized in table 2 sea state 4 6 and 8 are adopted to compare the model test with the estimation results 4 2 comparison of estimation and model test result for wave added using 1d spectrum for the validation the wave added resistance estimation result achieved by motion analysis is compared to the model test result under identical wave spectrum employing the pierson moskwitz spectrum under sea state 4 6 and 8 the comparison results are shown in fig 20 the grey bar shows the estimation result and the doted bar present the model test results both results are well matched in overall sea states the comparison results show the simulation tool which was invented for this research is valid for use in reproducing the wave added resistance the error is under 2 y value of chart is non dimensional value which is non dimensionalized an wave added resistance at sea state 8 model test 4 3 uncertainty assessment the route decision making optimization procedure is the process that decides the best route candidate among the possible route candidates by comparative analysis based on the ship performance estimation the estimation of a ship s performance has related to various uncertainty such as method uncertainty and input data uncertainty insel 2008 tillig et al 2018 the method uncertainty is that the outcome difference caused by the difference of the method in the resistance environmental load and propulsion power estimation this research evaluated the possible route candidate by using identical ship performance modeling based on iso 15016 that is the standard ship performance evaluation method iso 2002 therefore uncertainty from the difference in the way of estimation does not affect the route selection the main source of uncertainty in foc estimation is uncertainty of input data the primary source of the uncertainty is the weather data the other design data such as the hull form the propeller and the engine data are accurately obtained from the real ship design data and model test data in the detail design and construction therefore this study does not target to analyze the uncertainty from the difference in dimension of the vessel the forecast weather uncertainty generally counts on the estimation error of the forecast accordingly this study conducts the uncertainty assessment that analyzes the contribution to foc estimation caused by the weather input data the monte carlo method is hired for the uncertainty assessment the author assessed the uncertainty of the route decision making method by investigating the quantitative change of fuel oil consumption due to the uncertainty amount of the input variables such as wind wave and current the uncertainty of the proposed method could be determined as seen in equation 14 14 u n c e r t a i n t y f u e l o i l c o n s u m p t i o n w i t h i n p u t d a t a u n c e r t a i n t y f u e l o i l c o n s u m p t i o n w i t h o u t u n c e r t a i n t y to investigate the effect due to the input variable uncertainty the maximum 10 percent intended error is included in the assessment the intended uncertainty is included in the input variables wave direction wave period wave height current direction current speed wind direction and wind speed it is assumed that the input variables have a normal distribution 10 000 samples made by the combination of the input variables such as wind wave and current are used in the assessment fig 21 presents the result of uncertainty assessment that reveals the relation between the estimation of foc and the weather uncertainty variables the wave direction is the most sensitive factor to make a difference in the foc estimation the estimation uncertainty due to wave direction and significant wave height is 1 2 and 0 9 of total foc the summation of uncertainty due to weather is 2 7 of foc in this study the distribution of weather forecast is assumed but precisely its distribution and quantity are related to the weather forecast quality of meteorological organization such as noaa s wave watch iii model also the time window of weather forecasts is related in the future works an ensemble weather routing analysis that combines the weather uncertainty and the ship routing decision making together 5 simulation results in this section two main results are revealed in section 5 1 the forecast 2d wave spectra is employed to estimate the power of the ship during the voyage this estimation result measures how much the proposed 2d wave spectra method well estimates the power during voyage the 1d idealized wave spectrum method the proposed method and the measured power during the voyage i e actual value were compared in the case of measured power history the real voyage operation data of 173 000 m3 lngc is employed in 5 2 the proposed 2d wave spectra method is applied to the route decision making a comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance route decision making between 1d conventional spectrum and the proposed method the pacific and atlantic are the target simulation cases 5 1 the comparison study of power estimation 1d idealized spectrum vs forecast 2d wave spectra fig 22 the comparison among measured power which is true value the power estimation based on one dimensional wave spectrum calculation and the proposed new method which adopts forecast 2d wave spectra the black line indicated the measured power during the 173 k lngc voyage the one dimensional wave spectrum is the blue dotted line and two dimensional wave spectra method is the red line according to the result in the overall view the proposed 2d wave spectra method estimated the power better than the conventional 1d idealized method the power estimation result of the conventional method shows many spikes due to the change in the wave direction this spike means that the estimation result of the conventional wave overestimated the change of direction also the prediction method of 1d spectrum is sensitive due to the direction change 5 2 route decision making results 5 2 1 simulation cases the performance of route decision making is investigated with regard to the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra upon different sea conditions in the pacific and atlantic oceans august 2017 was picked as the simulated season for the route decision optimization the reason why the summer season was chosen for the simulation is the wave condition harsher compared to the winter season due to tropical storm and typhoon the route decision making gives the efficient and safe route simultaneously under even the harsh weather therefore the summer condition is selected in the future works the effect of the various weather season and condition is worth to be investigated environmental data is acquired form the national oceanic and atmospheric administration table 3 shows the route information on target seas the pacific ocean has more moderate conditions than the atlantic two routes were selected to compare the differences of routing performance achieved by using 1d and 2d wave spectrum methods fig 23 shows the great circle lines which are the shortest paths between departures and arrivals for the pacific and atlantic oceans the great circle line is used as the initial condition of the optimization procedure the pacific route is the next promising route for the lng import and export between the united states and asia the atlantic route is selected to present the difference between the 1d wave spectrum method and the 2d wave spectra in a strong swell area 5 2 2 the result of route decision making the pacific ocean case great circle line voyage the 1d wave spectrum and 2d wave spectra methods are compared in route decision making performances for the pacific ocean route in the case of the 2d wave spectra method different 2d wave spectra are considered according to corresponding stages and substages of route decision making optimization fig 24 shows forecast 2d wave spectra corresponding to the stages that are divided unit time segments of 6 h of the route optimization procedure fig 24 shows the plan view of the 2d wave spectra forecast data at corresponding stages along the great circle line that is the initial condition of the route decision making process the figure is the plan view of 2d wave spectra the color of the figure describes the intensity of the spectral density s μ ω the number in the figure presents the stages the proposed route decision making process used these forecast 2d wave spectra to estimate the wave added resistance of the route candidates noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration provides the 2d wave forecast data where wave measurement buoy located tolman 2009 fig 25 shows the averaged weather of voyage and route together on the surface of the earth the different routes are the great circle line the route using the 1d wave spectrum and the route using the 2d wave spectra the red line is the great circle line the route based on the 1d wave spectrum is the navy dash dotted line and the route based on the 2d wave spectra is the purple dotted line the route using the forecast 2d wave spectra goes toward where the wave condition is harsher than the 1d wave spectrum route decision also in the case of the direction of the heading the 2d wave spectra case uses the head sea condition more than the 1d wave spectrum because the peak of the heading of the 2d wave spectra is lower than that of the 1d wave spectrum fig 24 shows the corresponding 2d wave spectra according to the stages of the route the forecast 2d wave spectra changed a lot along the way points of route the conventional 1d ideal wave spectrum could not capture this variation in the route decision making algorithm and it degraded the performance of the route decision making the 1d ideal method tends to overestimate the wave load and fuel consumption table 4 summarizes the performance of the route optimization method in the pacific the fuel oil consumption in the 2d wave method is noticeably better than the 1d ideal method and the great circle route by 6 and 9 respectively in table 4 the average speed due to methods and speed variation in each stage are summarized in speed regards the great circle line method chooses the vessel speed that satisfies the required time arrival the 1d and 2d method s vessel speeds are varied to environments of the stage based on the results the 2d wave spectra method chooses harsher wave and lower vessel speed than the 1d wave spectrum method because the 2d wave spectra method estimates the wave added resistance more precise and chooses the shorter route than the 1d wave spectrum method low speed result of 2d wave spectra method is found from v3 to v10 due to power constraint the 1d wave spectrum method chooses the longer distance and high speed due to escape harsh weather in table 4 v1 v2 and v20 denotes that the speed optimization result at each stage i e v1 is the speed optimization result at the first stage and v20 denotes the 20th stage speed optimization the motion criteria due to 1d and 2d wave spectra are also a fascinating issue and worth analyzing in the future 5 2 3 the atlantic ocean case fig 26 shows the samples of 2d wave spectra along the stages of the great circle route which is the initial state of route optimization near west africa the swell is quite intense compared to the pacific sea therefore multiple components could be found in the figure such as stage 9 10 13 20 fig 27 shows the global routes and the corresponding averaged weather weather is milder in the atlantic than in the pacific during this season near the west of africa the route based on the 1d wave spectrum is the navy dash dotted line and the route based on the proposed forecast 2d wave spectra method is the purple dotted line table 5 summarizes the performance of the route optimization method in the atlantic the fuel oil consumption of the 2d wave method showed a noticeable improvement over the 1d ideal method and great circle route there are two reason 2d wave method yields such impressive results first the 2d wave spectra could figure the optimal route that minimize the environmental loads efficiently second the swell component is very dominant in the south atlantic so the 2d wave spectra could capture it brilliantly in table 5 the average speed due to methods and speed variation in each stage are summarized in speed regards the great circle line method simply chooses the vessel speed that satisfies the required time arrival rta the 1d and 2d method s vessel speeds satisfied the rta but also methods consider its environmental load variation in the atlantic case the 2d wave spectra based route decision making method shows more noticeable foc reduction compared to the pacific case the 2d wave spectra method could save 11 more than the great circle navigation and 8 more than the conventional 1d spectrum method 6 conclusion in this research the newly developed route decision making method is described that uses forecast 2d wave spectra that fit into corresponding weather along with the operation profile of the ship s voyage its performance was compared to the conventional 1d idealized spectrum method to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method a 173 k lng carrier in the pacific and the atlantic ocean are simulated and compared to real measurement data the comparison of measured operation data proved the accuracy of the resistance estimation of the proposed 2d wave spectra method the 2d wave spectra method estimates the power well compared to the conventional 1d ideal wave spectrum method because 2d wave spectra method could capture the geographical and chronical characteristics of the voyage route in the case of foc performance the proposed method saved 6 more foc than the conventional 1d idealized spectrum in the pacific ocean in the atlantic ocean the proposed method was 8 better than the 1d idealized wave spectrum method the performance in the atlantic ocean showed that the proposed method can segregate the swell and multi modal effect well it could save 9 and 11 in the pacific and the atlantic respectively over the typical great circle route voyage the 2d wave spectra method tends to choose more the beam sea wave direction and moderate wave height than with the conventional method because the 2d wave spectra method can capture the intensity of wave added resistance more accurately with considering the spreading and the directionality the proposed 2d wave spectra method can be used not only for route decision making strategies but to evaluate other features of a ship s performance such as sloshing fatigue and motion the beauty of the proposed method is that it considers environments realistically declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

22151,water shipping on the deck of structures is a problem in marine environments different types of shipping water events can be expected and systematic experiments are required to better understand their behavior in this work systematic experiments were carried out to analyse some patterns of shipping water events and the related vertical loads on the deck of a rectangular fixed structure using the wet dam break method to generate the incident waves the influence of bores generated with different wet dam break ratios on the resultant water shipping patterns and the trends of vertical loads on the structure was investigated conventional wave probes a force balance and a high speed camera were synchronized in a controlled environment for the investigation the results allowed a detailed visualization of different types of shipping water events mainly differentiated by the formation of different sized cavities at the bow of the structure quasi static vertical loads over the deck generated by the events were presented including forward and backflow loading this approach can be useful when performing simplified analyses to investigate the details of shipping water behavior and for acquiring detailed data for model validations keywords force balance wet dam break high speed visualization shipping water patterns vertical loads 1 introduction water shipping events on structures can cause important problems in coastal ocean and offshore engineering as they can affect operations and human safety the study of the physics involved during these events is vital to improve the design and safety of marine structures the shipping of water on the deck of structures has been investigated by analytical numerical and experimental methods among the experimental methods studies have been focused on the generated loads lee et al 2012 the kinematics of water propagating over the deck ryu et al 2007a and the identification of types of water shipping events greco et al 2007 the latter is of importance to have a better understanding of water shipping scenarios that can be expected however to attain this objective detailed analyses of flow propagation are required at experimental scale the shipping water phenomenon occurs rapidly it commonly has a short duration requiring the use of high speed cameras to capture details of the flow evolution moreover it is usually necessary to make simplifications to the experimental arrangements to facilitate flow visualization typical simplifications include a two dimensional setup and the use of a fixed structure for the analysis greco 2001 greco et al 2007 hernández fontes et al 2017 ryu et al 2007b for the case of a barge shaped fixed structure greco et al 2007 proposed a classification of shipping water events obtained with trains of regular waves they reported three types of these events dam break plunging dam break and hammer fist generated with unbroken waves for details see figures reported in greco et al 2007 2005 later ryu et al 2007 used a visualization technique to investigate the kinematics of a shipping water event generated by a focused broken wave interacting with a two dimensional fixed structure however the visual information of the water on deck was only shown in some snapshots research into water shipping usually uses incoming wave trains generated by oscillating wavemakers however it is also possible to generate incident waves using simplified methods such as the wet dam break basically in this method a vertical wall retains two different volumes of calm water when the wall is removed a bore propagating downstream is formed instantaneously the physics of the wet dam break method has been examined analytically in stoker 1957 numerically in ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 and yang et al 2018 and experimentally in the works of nakagawa et al 1969 and stansby et al 1998 this method has been employed to investigate the interaction of incident flows with structures regarding loads on vertical walls kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 ramsden 1993 loads on buildings with openings wüthrich et al 2018 and flow evolution on sloping beaches yeh et al 1989 recently hernández fontes et al 2018 2017 proposed the use of the wet dam break approach to identify patterns of shipping water on a barge shaped fixed structure they used this method to generate incident bores which in turn caused isolated water shipping events on the structure the use of a high speed camera allowed them to capture details of the initial stages of these events thus focusing on the visualization and measurements of the water elevations of the flow the wet dam break ratios h 0 h 1 0 6 hernández fontes et al 2017 and 0 4 hernández fontes et al 2018 where h 0 and h 1 are the depths of the water volumes located downstream and upstream of the vertical wall in the wet dam break setup respectively were combined with different freeboards to analyse the patterns of shipping water obtained the events generated had some resemblance to those defined in greco et al 2007 2005 it is important to perform more systematic studies that provide details of the interactions between shipping water and structures to have a better understanding of the phenomena and to obtain information that helps to optimize the design of structures subjected to shipping waves such as hydrodynamic loads on deck this information is relevant in design considerations for fixed structures e g bea et al 1999 park et al 2017 and in simulations of moving structures exposed to shipping water events e g fonseca et al 2010 rajendran et al 2016 with a better understanding of the physics involved in different types of shipping water events it would be possible to perform more detailed analytical and numerical model validations since not all types of water shipping events can be simulated by the same analytical or numerical approach this is because some events include the formation of air cavities of different sizes in the initial stages of the shipping where compressibility effects may be relevant e g plunging dam break colicchio et al 2011 greco et al 2007 whereas others do not have these cavities e g dam break type greco et al 2007 in this paper systematic wet dam break experiments were carried out to investigate shipping water events on a fixed structure generated with incoming bores obtained with different wet dam break ratios and freeboards the wet dam break strategy was selected since it uses a small installation to generate repeatable and short duration experiments that allowed the synchronized flow visualization and loading data to be captured the main objective was to investigate the effect of incoming bores of varying steepness on the main features of the water shipping and the related vertical loads on a deck analyses of the forward and backflow quasi static vertical loads over the complete deck of the structure in these events were performed that to the best of the authors knowledge have not been documented before see sect 4 for the definition of these loads the present study extends the previous works of hernández fontes et al 2018 2017 which only focused on the visualization of the initial stages of flow on the deck this study provides more insights into the classification of types of shipping water events generated by waves of different steepness increasing the knowledge of the trends of vertical loads generated during these events the experiments were carried out in a small dam break prismatic tank with an internal rectangular fixed structure representing the deck of a marine facility wet dam break ratios in the range 0 4 h 0 h 1 0 8 were considered for two different freeboards f b 0 030 and 0 042 m to generate the incident bores yielding isolated shipping water events conductive wave probes were used to relate information about the incoming wave and the freeboard exceedance on the structure a high speed camera was employed to obtain details of the events a force balance was used to measure the quasi static vertical loads on the deck of the structure all the sensors were synchronized and configured to acquire data at the same sampling rate this paper is divided as follows the experimental methods are described in sect 2 for the experiments with a freeboard of 0 030 m the results of the conventional wave probes are shown in sect 3 and the high speed camera and force balance results are described in sect 4 sect 5 presents a comparison of results obtained with two freeboards sect 6 discusses the effects of flume length in loading and finally the main conclusions are summarized in sect 7 2 experimental methods the experiments were carried out in a polymethyl methacrylate prismatic tank at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano of the coppe federal university of rio de janeiro brazil a rectangular fixed structure was installed on the downstream side of the tank to represent the deck of a barge shaped coastal naval or offshore facility the general arrangement of the wet dam break experiment including the main dimensions is shown in fig 1 at the beginning of the experiment a gate separated two volumes of calm water t 0 then a trigger activated all the sensors to begin measuring and released the gate the gate opened rapidly inducing the interaction of the upstream and downstream volumes through the action of gravity forming a bore this bore propagated downstream and interacted with the fixed structure resulting in bow run up and subsequent shipping water on the deck the theoretical wet dam break model described in stoker 1957 was used to analyse the maximum elevation of the bores in the experiments it is important to mention that this model considers infinite flow propagation conditions at both sides of the gate thus the effects on flow due to the tank walls have been disregarded in the present study conventional wave probe sensors a high speed camera and a force balance were used to obtain the experimental data these instruments were installed as shown in fig 1 four conductive wave probes wp0 wp3 were distributed along the tank to monitor water elevations at a sampling frequency of 500 hz these were made of two stainless steel rods of 2 4 mm diameter with a separation of 9 mm probes wp0 and wp1 measured water elevations downstream and upstream of the gate respectively whereas probes wp2 and wp3 measured the freeboard exceedance at the bow of the structure wave probe signals were obtained using a dhi 102e amplifier national instruments hardware and labview software calibration was performed based on the recommended procedures of ittc 2008 an uncertainty of 2 mm for each wave probe in the calibration procedure was verified a high speed camera cam qualisys 310 with an additional lens dc nikkor 105 mm f 2 d was used to capture details of the shipping water events at a sampling rate of 500 fps the camera was positioned parallel to the tank wall at a distance of approximately 3 m and centered with respect to the bow edge of the structure fig 1 the camera captured the complete height of the tank vertical field of view 0 45 m in the horizontal direction it allowed visualization from the position of wp0 to the end of the deck horizontal field of view 0 5 m qualisys qtm software was employed for the video analysis more details of the instrumentation and the experimental procedure regarding the wave probes and camera can be found in hernández fontes et al 2018 2017 to measure the vertical loads on the deck of the structure a force balance of four s type axial load cells was employed as shown in fig 1 the balance had a rigid wall that was in contact with the incoming wave and a rigid horizontal surface that was used as a sensing element these elements were made of 15 mm thick acrylic plates each side of the sensing element plate was 1 mm from the tank walls after each shipping water event small amounts of water entered through the balance and tank wall separations finally the remaining water under the balance was completely drained through a hole made in the tank wall the sampling rate of the balance was 500 hz with a low pass filter of 100 hz more details about the balance characteristics and the measurement procedures can be found in hernández fontes 2018 hernández fontes et al 2019 2 1 testing matrix different scenarios generated with wet dam break experiments were investigated two freeboards f b 0 030 and 0 042 m were tested for five designed wet dam break ratios r d h 0 h 1 0 8 0 7 0 6 0 5 and 0 4 where h 0 and h 1 corresponded to the initial water levels downstream and upstream of the gate respectively fig 1 to set the freeboards during the experiments the water level h 0 was varied but maintaining the same structure height in this work the experiments performed with f b 0 030 m were used to describe the specific details of patterns and loading of the water shipping obtained for the different wet dam break ratios sect 3 and 4 on the other hand the experiments carried out with f b 0 042 m were used to compare and discuss the general trends sect 5 experiments without the internal fixed structure employing only wave probe sensors were carried out to characterize the incoming flows sect 3 1 1 it is important to mention that for both freeboards the ratio h 0 h 1 0 8 did not present significant shipping water on the deck so this ratio was not considered in the analysis five runs were carried out for each study case to attain repeatability of the results and to estimate basic statistics of data such as mean and standard deviation values for all cases the time t 0 corresponded to the time when the trigger was activated to start the sensor measuring the gate release occurred between 0 4 s t 0 6 s approximately 3 analysis of the water elevation results in the wet dam break setup wave generation is very dependent on the initial h 0 and h 1 conditions the initial water levels were set visually using a ruler subject to human error although the designed parameters r d h 0 h 1 f b are given in the present work it is important to know the variations found in the parameters that were measured to allow other authors to reproduce the experiments table 1 summarizes the measured initial water levels h 0m h 1m wet dam break ratios r m and freeboards f bm h st h 0m where h st is the structure height including mean and standard deviation values obtained from the five repetitions the maximum difference between the designed and the mean measured values of wet dam break ratios was less than 2 for all cases in this work non dimensional terms for horizontal distance x x l water elevation η η h 1 time t t g h 1 and vertical force over the deck f f ρgh 1 l 2 were used to analyse the results the constant parameters used in these terms correspond to the structure length l 0 195 m water density ρ 1000 kg m3 gravitational acceleration g 9 81 m s2 and the designed initial water level of the upstream reservoir h 1 3 1 incoming wave features the water elevation data measured with probe wp0 for the experiments without the structure were used to analyse the incoming wave parameters fig 2 shows the water elevations η mean and standard deviation values measured by this probe for the four cases with h 0 0 120 m c1 c4 without the structure from which information can be extracted to characterize the incoming bore theoretical values for bore height based on stoker 1957 are plotted in the figure for comparison it can be observed that for each case the water level started to rise between 3 1 t 4 4 p and the maximum elevation m occurred at time o 5 1 t 7 1 for all the time series the water level rose from the static condition downstream of the gate to a maximum value incoming bore front the time interval between p and o varied for all cases with the bore crests reached faster in the cases with higher initial water levels h 1 in fact for higher the h 1 values the greater the initial potential energy in the upstream reservoir of water so the resultant flow that appears just after the gate is released rises more liu and liu 2017 next the upstream water volume pushes the downstream volume to move forward with it until a stage of gradual water level variation is attained in the present work the incoming wave height h w was defined for each case as the difference between the mean value of the maximum elevation measured by wp0 and the mean value of the initial water level downstream of the gate h 0 h 0 h 1 represented by the segments o m in fig 2 for c2 c3 and c4 h w was approximately 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 times the value obtained for c1 respectively the increase in h w is associated with the increase in the slope of the rising part of the time series rising limb as can be inferred from the slopes of the p m segments traced to each curve which also increased from c1 to c4 comparing the mean maximum elevations of the bores for each case with the theoretical values the experimental values overestimated the theoretical ones by approximately 10 0 10 4 14 2 and 16 4 for c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively in the present study the distance for bore development is short 0 505 m from the gate to the structure so the infinite domain for bore propagation considered in the theoretical approach was not attained to verify if the presence of the structure affects the increase of water elevation of the bore wave probe results from experiments performed with and without the fixed structure were analysed fig 3 shows the comparison of water elevations measured by wp1 fig 3a and wp0 fig 3b for c2 and c4 which were selected as representative of the other cases for wp1 the cases with and without the structure presented similar trends during the interaction between the volumes of water located up and downstream of the gate for t 7 the records differ in magnitudes due to the flow reflected by the tank wall for wp0 the mean maximum values of the incident wave for the case without the structure underestimated those obtained with the structure for c2 and c4 and showed a small time shift in their occurrence in the experiments performed with the structure a wave reflected by the structure just after the occurrence of the first peak was seen for longer times the cases without the structure also showed a reflected wave however this was caused by the tank wall the presence of the structure caused a small increase in incident bore amplitudes however it should also be noted that during the initial stage of bore generation a complex and unsteady flow occurs close to the gate see stansby et al 1998 for details which could explain the differences obtained with respect to the theoretical values 3 1 1 characterization of bore steepness in fig 3 the incoming bores generated have minor differences between the cases with and without the structure suggesting small wave diffraction effects in this framework to find relations between the incoming flows and the shipping water events generated the steepness of the incident wet dam break bores was characterized theoretically considering the available time series of water elevations given by wp0 for the experiments carried out without the internal structure unlike the oscillatory waves which mainly depend on wave height wave length and water depth the wet dam break bores obtained in this work were assumed as solitary waves which can be described in terms of their height and the constant water depth at which they propagate daily and stephan 1952 goring 1979 i e h w and h 0 for the present work respectively taking bores as solitary waves has been considered in the research of other authors such as duan et al 2018 and seelam and baldock 2009 for example duan et al 2018 considered the resulting flows from the gravity collapse method similar to the present approach but in a wave flume as solitary waves to validate their numerical analyses to estimate bore steepness it is necessary to find a characteristic length in a periodic wave this parameter is proportional to the wave length but for a non periodic shape there is no single length which describes the entire wave accurately hammack 1972 based on the works of goring 1979 hammack 1972 and silva et al 2000 the characteristic length of the resultant bores in this study was estimated as l c 1 5 h w h 0 1 2 h 0 thereby for c1 c2 c3 and c4 considering the experiments without the structure the steepness found ε h w l c was 0 12 0 21 0 33 and 0 55 respectively 3 2 water shipping elevations the three dimensional effects and the freeboard exceedance at the bow of the structure during the shipping water events were evaluated by the wave probes wp2 and wp3 fig 4 shows the water elevations at the bow for c1 and c4 which correspond to the maximum and minimum wet dam break ratios respectively small time shifts in the water elevation records for each pair of probes were observed as well as some differences in the maximum elevations suggesting some three dimensional effects during the initial stages of water shipping the deck was as horizontal as possible in the longitudinal and transversal directions i e inclination angles less than 0 1 but in the experiments a gate release guide was not used so it is possible that some of the three dimensional effects are related to small inclinations of the gate when it opened another possible source of these effects can be related to the installation of the wave probes these sensors particularly those made with rods of small diameter 2 4 mm in these experiments are subject to misalignment or deformation during installation this can produce errors in the measurements especially with linear calibration which was used in these experiments it is possible to quantify the three dimensional 3d effects in the water elevations in an approximate way by comparing the maximum values measured by wp2 i e wp2 m and wp3 i e wp3 m for the same case therefore the ratio wp2 m wp3 m for each pair of probes where wp2 m wp2 m h 1 and wp3 m wp3 m h 1 was calculated to quantify the 3d effects for the five repetitions of each case table 2 summarizes the mean and standard deviation of the wp2 m wp3 m ratios for all the study cases the results show an increase in the three dimensional effects associated with the reduction of the steepness of the bores i e from c4 to c1 the maximum and minimum three dimensional effects were presented for c1 23 of wp2 m wp3 m and c4 5 of wp2 m wp3 m respectively concerning the three dimensional behavior in the water elevations at the bow the non dimensional maximum freeboard exceedance he m for each case was estimated as wp2 m wp3 m 2 from this the mean and standard deviation values were found as shown in table 2 for c2 c3 and c4 he m was approximately 1 9 2 3 and 2 4 times the value obtained for c1 respectively fig 5 shows the relationship between the maximum freeboard exceedance he m and the bore height h w as defined earlier the horizontal and vertical error bars show the standard deviation for h w and he m respectively in fig 5 an almost linear relationship can be seen between the variables for c1 c2 and c3 however for c4 the results do not follow this trend which can be attributed to the features of water shipping of the steepest incoming bore when interacting with the structure this in turn caused a steep flow pattern at the bow as described in next section 4 analysis of video and force results in this section the results obtained from the high speed video and the vertical load data are presented for the four study cases of the f b 0 030 m experiments the patterns of water shipping over the deck and their respective vertical loads are discussed in this work two types of loading over the deck were defined forward and backflow loads the forward loads were considered as those generated by water propagating from the beginning of the deck to the stage at which it reached its maximum displacement over the tank wall during run up after this maximum tank wall run down took place and so backflow loads were considered including those caused by water returning to the reservoir the backflow loads may resemble the loads induced by the flow returned by a vertical structure installed on the deck of a marine facility the findings obtained with the specific configuration of this work i e a finite domain for shipping water propagation of 0 195 m in length can help to give a preliminary knowledge of the magnitudes of these loads with respect to the forward loads for different types of shipping water events particularly when the length of the vertical structure is longer than the length of the deck as is the case of the present experimental setup the time series of shipping water events for all the cases obtained with f b 30 mm shown by snapshots taken every δt 0 04 g h 1 are shown in figs 6 9 to identify the patterns defined by different bore steepnesses ε h w l c for all the cases the time series started approximately at the instant when the water level reached the deck level during the bow run up stage below each series of snapshots the time series of the vertical loads over the deck in terms of mean and standard deviation values for the five repetitions show the forward and backflow loading trends generated by each shipping water event to facilitate the analysis the time instants of the snapshots are defined in the time series of the loads fig 6 shows the time series for c1 r m 0 705 0 005 ε 0 12 from the snapshots it can be observed that after the water level reached the deck level water invaded the deck forming a small jet followed by the bulk of the water 7 44 t 8 36 for longer times t 8 36 the wavefront moved over the deck while the maximum elevation of the incident flow reached and surpassed the bow edge t 9 27 this maximum tended to decrease as the wavefront reached the vertical wall 9 57 t 10 18 forming a thin layer of fluid over the entire deck for t 10 18 the water on the deck interacted with the vertical tank wall resulting in run up note the obtuse angles of the crest of the flow in the early stages of the water shipping 8 36 t 9 57 125 θ 165 the forward vertical loads began at t 8 05 and the maximum mean values f 0 082 were reached between t 10 18 and t 10 48 when the complete deck was covered by water and the wall run up started between 10 48 t 10 79 the flow reached its maximum displacement during the wall run up reducing the loads over the deck then after t 10 79 wall run down was observed increasing the volume of water over the deck and causing a second a peak load f 0 073 between 11 7 t 12 0 after run down occurred returning to the water reservoir the time series for c2 r m 0 608 0 004 ε 0 21 are shown in fig 7 between 6 44 t 7 00 a small plunging wave reached the deck and encapsulated a small amount of air t 7 00 as the wave crest near the bow edge became steeper and approached the deck edge small forward and backward jets were formed by this plunging wave 7 00 t 7 56 the cavity size increased from t 7 00 to t 7 28 then the increasing water weight above it compressed the cavity by t 7 28 and t 7 56 and it completely disappeared at t 7 84 the process of cavity compression can be described as by lugni et al 2010 for a cavity formed during a flip through event on a vertical wall in this description an almost circular cavity is formed at the beginning of the phenomenon it is then deformed in all directions almost equally i e isotropic compression expansion subsequently the deformation of the cavity increases when a forward jet in contact with the wall surface is formed horizontal direction in our case that is it shows an anisotropic compression expansion finally the cavity is trapped by the flow until it collapses generating bubbles that mix into the flow similar behavior is observed in the present work even though the collapse of the cavity is not appreciated in the figures however it should be noted that in the present application the cavity deformation is mainly horizontal moreover there is a backward jet that contributes to the closure of the air cavity before it becomes completely trapped by the shipping flow in the present case the maximum elevation on the bow deck occurred at t 7 84 coinciding with the disappearance of the cavity once the cavity disappeared the wavefront of the shipped flow reached the vertical wall at t 8 40 causing run up later while wall run up occurred water was still flowing onto the deck forming an almost constant layer of fluid over the entire deck 8 68 t 9 52 which was larger than that observed in c1 furthermore in the present case the crest angle of the flow was sharper than in c1 from the beginning of the event 7 28 t 8 40 118 θ 158 in relation to the forward vertical loads these were taken into account for the force balance since the small cavity was formed at the bow edge and the plunging wave interacted with the deck t 7 00 in this case the mean maximum values f 0 24 were about 3 times greater than those observed for c1 and occurred earlier t 8 68 for the backflow loads which occurred from the beginning of the wall run down stage t 9 81 a second mean peak value of f 0 18 was observed between 10 64 t 10 93 overestimating 2 5 times that verified in c1 after the second peak t 10 93 the loads decreased while flow returned to the reservoir in fig 8 the time series of the shipping water for c3 r m 0 506 0 003 ε 0 33 are shown in general the patterns are similar to those of c2 including the formation of the cavity however in this case a greater amount of water was shipped onto the deck and the cavity formed at the edge of the bow 5 40 t 6 42 was larger than in c2 in c3 at t 6 42 the cavity had a weak three dimensional effect in its formation these effects were also confirmed in the freeboard exceedance measured by wp2 and wp3 in fig 4 for t 6 16 the formation of the forward and backward jets was as in c2 although they occurred further from the bow edge the cavity became trapped until the wave front approached the deck end t 6 93 and produced the run up on the vertical wall t 7 19 during the run up the wave continuously invaded the deck and a layer of water deeper than that observed in previous cases remained on the deck 7 44 t 8 72 unlike the previous cases the crest of the shipping flow was almost at right angles to the initial stages 6 16 t 6 67 117 θ 106 these angles then increased as the water on the deck propagated downstream entrapping the air cavity 6 93 t 7 19 121 θ 137 in the c3 load series it can be seen that the deck was loaded from the formation of the small water jets on the deck t 6 16 there is a small disturbance in the rising limb of the mean loads at t 7 19 which coincides with the stage when the air cavity was completely trapped by the flow the maximum mean forward load f 0 424 appeared between t 7 44 and t 7 70 overestimating by 176 and 517 the maximum values of c2 and c1 respectively this load occurred when the largest amount of water was over the deck and the wall run up began to take place the run down stage seemed to occur for t 8 46 causing backflow loading while the flow returned to the reservoir this backflow generated a second mean peak load of f 0 27 at t 10 when almost all the volume of shipped water was over the deck the c4 time series r m 0 408 0 005 ε 0 55 are presented in fig 9 although the patterns resemble those of c2 and c3 because of the cavity formation near the bow edge the largest cavity as well as the highest shipped water elevations on deck occurred in this case 5 72 t 6 63 the cavity extended horizontally to approximately 1 3 of the deck length 5 72 t 6 18 whereas the maximum elevation over the deck developed a forward pointing horn shape t 6 18 as seen in c3 there are three dimensional effects in the formation of the cavity 5 72 t 6 63 this case is best described as a block of water partially suspended over the bow which after touching the deck developed large upstream and downstream water jets almost at the end of the deck t 6 18 subsequently the shipping flow impacted directly with the tank wall t 6 40 a rapid run up occurred on the wall t 6 40 whilst water flooded onto the deck constantly from the bow even during backflow this case was the most severe shipping water event in the study as in c2 and c3 the vertical loads in c4 were measured when the plunging wave first touched the deck t 5 49 note that the mean maximum vertical load reached almost f 0 529 between 6 40 t 6 63 coinciding with the plunging wave hitting the deck and the vertical wall of the structure at the same time meanwhile the cavity was being closed by the jet propagating up the deck the curve of results presents a decline until a minimum of f 0 24 was attained at t 6 86 when the cavity was trapped by the flow and wall run up was occurring unlike the previous cases c4 presented a larger amount of water flooding the deck even when the wall run up was occurring then the wall run up and run down stages caused an almost constant loading of f 0 3 during 7 09 t 8 46 details of the cavity evolution and its relationship with the loading time series were not addressed in this work since these occurred simultaneously with the wall run up however in further research longer decks and load measuring techniques could be used allowing the analysis of the effects of cavity collapse in loading furthering the findings of other authors abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 lugni et al 2006 lyu et al 2017 it is important to mention that when shipping water loading begins impulsive vertical loads are seen followed by quasi static loads when the water floods the deck bea et al 1999 buchner 2002 in order to record these impulsive loads high rates of sampling are required this is often done using pressure sensors at specific locations buchner 2002 on the other hand in the present work the quasi static loads were analysed over almost the entire deck surface using the lower sampling frequency of the force balance fig 10 compares the vertical loads of each shipping water event obtained for the freeboard of 0 030 m c1 c4 considering h 1 for the non dimensional forces to visualize the complete time series for each case these data include the forward loading before the run up on the tank wall see mean maximum values for each case m 1 and the backflow loading after this run up note that the backflow loading also presents a considerable maximum load for each case m 2 with respect to m 1 for the present experimental configuration finite domain of 0 195 m in length for shipping water propagation the ratio m 2 m 1 was between 0 64 and 0 86 for all cases which suggests that the magnitudes of the backflow loads are significant in comparison with the forward loads therefore for similar structure configurations as the one employed in this work the backflow loads should be considered for design purposes note that c1 c2 and c3 show similar trends in the time series of loads that is the loads rose progressively during the forward loading reached a maximum then decayed before reaching a second peak due to the backflow loading however in c4 the vertical loads show a more rapid increase in the forward loading and the decay following the first peak than other cases the subsequent maximum values remained almost constant for a considerable time due to the huge amount of water present in the run down and backflow stages 5 discussion of the effects of different freeboards shipping water events have been previously analysed with regular waves interacting with a fixed structure greco et al 2007 these events were defined as dam break db plunging dam break pdb and hammer fist hf while the means of generating the shipping water events in this work is different from that used by greco et al visual inspection shows that some features of the c1 c2 c3 and c4 cases which were obtained for a freeboard of 30 mm resemble those reported for the db pdb and hf respectively for a detailed description of these events see greco et al 2007 in the present work the c1 event can be described as db since an air cavity did not form whereas the c2 c3 events can be related to pdb with a small cavity pdbsc with respect to the c4 event the video shows the formation of a narrow flow crest over the deck and a large plunging wave forming a large air cavity from the bow edge this differs from the description of greco et al 2007 for the hf event since in that event no cavity was reported therefore the event found here can be described as a pdb with a large cavity size pdblc the increase in the steepness of the incoming bores produced different shipping water patterns in c1 where the bore steepness was the lowest 0 12 the smallest amount of water went onto the deck without the formation of a cavity then for higher steepnesses c2 to c4 i e from 0 21 to 0 55 both the amount of water on the deck as well as the size of the cavity increased moreover the angle formed by the wave crest in the initial stages of the water invading the deck became steeper the crests changed from obtuse to a peculiar sharp angle from c1 to c4 respectively the non linear trend observed especially for c3 to c4 in fig 5 which showed the comparison of maximum freeboard exceedance he m and the assumed bore height h w can be partially related to the effect of the sharper crests formed in the shipping flow these formed almost a right angle when the maximum freeboard exceedance was attained see figs 9 and 5 49 t 5 72 the shipping water patterns found in the experiments with freeboard f b 0 042 m are in agreement with the classification made for the events reported for f b 0 030 m with the main differences being the size of the cavities and the magnitude of the loads on the deck however it is worth mentioning that for the ratios h 0 h 1 0 6 and 0 5 bores with a partially broken front were seen for f b 0 042 m causing particular features in the flow crests in the initial stages of shipping as shown in fig 11 although nakagawa et al 1969 reported that for h 0 h 1 0 6 unbroken bores are obtained the incoming flow features are in better agreement with the descriptions of kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 stansby et al 1998 and yeh et al 1989 who reported that for h 0 h 1 ratios lower than 0 6 broken bores can be observed results from experiments with different freeboards in this work indicate that lower water depths downstream of the gate h 0 influenced the breaking of the bores regardless of having the same h 0 h 1 ratio fig 12 shows the variation of the ratio of the cavity and its area for different wave steepnesses the cavity area was considered to be half of the area of an ellipse where x cav and z cav are its horizontal and vertical ratios respectively fig 12 these parameters were measured from the video recordings for the five repetitions the cavities were those formed at the instants when the plunging wave first touched the deck from fig 12 it can be observed that for both freeboards the aspect ratio defined as z cav x cav was less for steeper waves this means that for longer waves the cavities were more like an arc particularly for f b 0 030 m attaining a semi elliptical form with larger x cav ratios for steeper waves on the other hand for both freeboards the non dimensional area of the cavity a cav l 2 increased with a steeper bore note that the shipping water events obtained with the higher freeboard produced cavities of greater area than those obtained with the lower freeboard with respect to the shipping water vertical loads found for the two different freeboards mean maximum loads over the deck during the forward and backward loading stages m1 and m2 respectively were analysed for different incoming bore steepnesses as shown in fig 13 in order to compare these values the force was made non dimensional using the structure height h st 0 15 m it can be observed that the highest peak for the loads was in the experiments with the lowest freeboard f b 0 030 m note that for longer bores the peak loads m1 and m2 were very similar during forward and backflow loading for both freeboards the difference between m1 and m2 remained almost constant for bore steepnesses of between 0 2 and 0 35 m2 was less than 38 the value of m1 for each case however this difference increased for f b 0 030 m when the wave steepness was greatest close to 0 6 c4 in this case which corresponds to the shipping water event described in fig 9 the forward peak load m1 was the greatest of all the shipping water events analysed overestimating by 40 the peak backflow load the results show that steeper bores produce shipping water events with sharper wave crest angles at the beginning of the deck as well as larger cavities and greater vertical loads there is an evolution from db followed by pdbsc to pdblc type events as the incident bores increased their steepness similar findings were described by greco et al 2007 who suggested that with regular waves there is a transition from db to pdb and to hf type events from longer to steeper regular waves fig 14 summarizes the types of shipping water events found for the experiments performed in this work with different wet dam break ratios and the two freeboards similarly as done in greco et al 2007 the ratios between the vertical velocity of the incident wave w b and the vertical flow velocity at the bow w were evaluated these were calculated using mean values of the data measured by wave probes such as w b h w t 2 t 1 and w h e t 2 t 1 where t 2 is the time at which the maximum values occurred and t 1 is the time at which the wave probes started measuring the water elevation note that the distribution of shipping water scenarios reported in fig 14 in terms of w b w ratios and bore steepness resembles the qualitative distribution of events proposed by greco et al 2007 which is included in the figure in this sense the db and the pdbsc events found in the present work seem to fall into the regions of the graph defined by them it is important to note that although the patterns of the pbdlc case obtained in the present work differ from the hf event obtained with regular waves in greco et al 2007 mainly due to the large cavity formation it seems to fall into the region of the graph where such an event could be expected it is clear that the bores considered in this study are quite different from the regular waves typically used in studies on water shipping giving some differences between the patterns identified here and those reported in the literature however it was shown that the present approach can be a useful alternative for examining the behavior of water on deck allowing different shipping water scenarios to be generated in a practical way particularly for the investigation of specific details of flow propagation 6 discussion of the effect of flume length in loading in using the present approach to investigate shipping of water on structures it is important to consider that incoming waves with different features may generate different shipping water patterns and in turn different load trends over the deck besides the initial h 0 and h 1 conditions the features of the resultant wet dam break bores depend on the distance available for their development along the flume nakagawa et al 1969 performed wet dam break experiments in a wave flume 0 5 m wide 0 5 m high and 30 m long reporting that the waves resulting from wet dam break ratio h 0 h 1 0 6 are undular bores and those obtained with h 0 h 1 0 4 and 0 5 are broken flows when they are fully developed downstream of the gate in the present experiments this behavior was not observed for the ratios 0 4 and 0 5 with all the freeboards as the available distance for wave development i e 0 505 m is short in comparison to nakagawa et al 1969 the use of longer installations would allow study of shipping water due to broken incident flows with these ratios for the present experimental configuration the resulting incoming flows allowed study of the patterns shown previously in sect 4 the effect of flume length in the wave development was not treated in the present experimental program however to have an idea of its effect in the vertical loading on deck the results obtained in this work for the ratio 0 6 and freeboard of 0 042 m were compared with those reported in hernández fontes et al 2019 obtained with similar procedures in a larger installation hernández fontes et al 2019 performed wet dam break tests in an installation with a width of 0 5 m a distance for bore development of 1 258 m and an upstream reservoir of the same length as that used in the present study i e 0 3 m in that work a force balance with the same characteristics as that of the present study was embedded in a fixed structure 0 392 m long and 0 5 m wide and 0 15 m high fig 15 a to measure the forward vertical loads in that case the distance from the balance to the tank walls was longer than in the present study as illustrated in fig 15a fig 15b shows the comparison of the vertical loads obtained in the present work and in hernández fontes et al 2019 considering the instant at which the force balance started measuring the loads in both cases note that there is a good agreement during the rising limb of the signals however from t 11 6 the present results overestimate the loads found in the larger installation presenting a difference δf 0 025 between the mean peak forward loads which occurred almost at the same time δt 0 12 in the results of the present work it is possible to verify the occurrence of a second peak in the loads due to the backflow induced by the tank wall conversely in the case of hernández fontes et al 2019 this wall was located further from the balance and the load trends were unchanged regarding the comparison of fig 15b for the forward loading it is possible to conclude that the vertical loads over the deck were less in the larger installation this can be attributed to the longer distance for bore development but also to the width of the installation which is 1 5 times longer than that used in the present work the use of the larger installation allowed the wave to be well developed generating an unbroken undular bore for the ratio h 0 h 1 0 6 hernández fontes et al 2019 however it is important to consider that this wave may have lost energy in its propagation due to friction effects of the flume walls these effects could have contributed with the reduction of the resultant loads over the deck with respect to those measured in the smaller installation of the present work the comparisons shown in this section suggest that the shipping water patterns and loading obtained with the present approach can be sensitive to the dimensions of the dam break installation then to perform systematic evaluations a specific setup should be selected considering the expected features of the resulting flows 7 conclusions systematic experiments using the wet dam break method for wave generation were performed to analyse the influence of incident flows on the patterns of shipping water and the related vertical loads obtained on a rectangular fixed structure the main findings are as follows a the wet dam break ratio h 0 h 1 0 8 did not induce significant water shipping for the two freeboards considered b the events found with the present approach were mainly defined by the size of the cavity formed at the beginning of the deck and the angle of the flow crest formed during the initial stages of water shipping the size of the cavities was greater for lower wet dam break ratios which generated steeper bores c shipping water events obtained with wet dam break ratios h 0 h 1 0 7 0 6 0 5 and 0 4 were defined in this work as dam break type db plunging dam break type with small cavity pdbsc and plunging dam break type with large cavity pdblc respectively these events are similar to the classification made by greco et al 2007 for the dam break db plunging dam break pdb and hammer fist hf types of shipping water events respectively which were obtained using regular waves however in the present study the pdblc presented the formation of a large air cavity that was not reported in the hf d in the experiments with the two different freeboards it was seen that steeper bores generated events which had the largest cavities and the largest loads over the deck with respect to the cavities an increase in bore steepness was associated with an increase in their area but with a reduction in their aspect ratio z cav x cav becoming semi elliptical in shape in relation to the loads obtained for the present experimental configuration significant backflow loads of almost the same order as the forward loads were observed for all cases this underlines the importance of considering backflow loads for design purposes in cases where shipping water interacts with vertical walls of structures located on the deck of marine facilities the low water depth used for the wave propagation can restrict the use of the present approach for shallow water applications as for instance to study shipping water on coastal structures the results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach has potential for investigating the behavior of different types of shipping water on fixed structures in a detailed and practical way and particularly for capturing specific details of flow propagation which can be useful to extract valuable information for model validations further research is required to investigate the effect of flume length in the incoming flow features i e broken and unbroken flows and the resulting shipping water patterns and loads for different wet dam break ratios the experimental data presented in this work may be useful for performing model validations therefore the five repetitions of water elevations measured by wp0 and the loading time series

22151,water shipping on the deck of structures is a problem in marine environments different types of shipping water events can be expected and systematic experiments are required to better understand their behavior in this work systematic experiments were carried out to analyse some patterns of shipping water events and the related vertical loads on the deck of a rectangular fixed structure using the wet dam break method to generate the incident waves the influence of bores generated with different wet dam break ratios on the resultant water shipping patterns and the trends of vertical loads on the structure was investigated conventional wave probes a force balance and a high speed camera were synchronized in a controlled environment for the investigation the results allowed a detailed visualization of different types of shipping water events mainly differentiated by the formation of different sized cavities at the bow of the structure quasi static vertical loads over the deck generated by the events were presented including forward and backflow loading this approach can be useful when performing simplified analyses to investigate the details of shipping water behavior and for acquiring detailed data for model validations keywords force balance wet dam break high speed visualization shipping water patterns vertical loads 1 introduction water shipping events on structures can cause important problems in coastal ocean and offshore engineering as they can affect operations and human safety the study of the physics involved during these events is vital to improve the design and safety of marine structures the shipping of water on the deck of structures has been investigated by analytical numerical and experimental methods among the experimental methods studies have been focused on the generated loads lee et al 2012 the kinematics of water propagating over the deck ryu et al 2007a and the identification of types of water shipping events greco et al 2007 the latter is of importance to have a better understanding of water shipping scenarios that can be expected however to attain this objective detailed analyses of flow propagation are required at experimental scale the shipping water phenomenon occurs rapidly it commonly has a short duration requiring the use of high speed cameras to capture details of the flow evolution moreover it is usually necessary to make simplifications to the experimental arrangements to facilitate flow visualization typical simplifications include a two dimensional setup and the use of a fixed structure for the analysis greco 2001 greco et al 2007 hernández fontes et al 2017 ryu et al 2007b for the case of a barge shaped fixed structure greco et al 2007 proposed a classification of shipping water events obtained with trains of regular waves they reported three types of these events dam break plunging dam break and hammer fist generated with unbroken waves for details see figures reported in greco et al 2007 2005 later ryu et al 2007 used a visualization technique to investigate the kinematics of a shipping water event generated by a focused broken wave interacting with a two dimensional fixed structure however the visual information of the water on deck was only shown in some snapshots research into water shipping usually uses incoming wave trains generated by oscillating wavemakers however it is also possible to generate incident waves using simplified methods such as the wet dam break basically in this method a vertical wall retains two different volumes of calm water when the wall is removed a bore propagating downstream is formed instantaneously the physics of the wet dam break method has been examined analytically in stoker 1957 numerically in ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 and yang et al 2018 and experimentally in the works of nakagawa et al 1969 and stansby et al 1998 this method has been employed to investigate the interaction of incident flows with structures regarding loads on vertical walls kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 ramsden 1993 loads on buildings with openings wüthrich et al 2018 and flow evolution on sloping beaches yeh et al 1989 recently hernández fontes et al 2018 2017 proposed the use of the wet dam break approach to identify patterns of shipping water on a barge shaped fixed structure they used this method to generate incident bores which in turn caused isolated water shipping events on the structure the use of a high speed camera allowed them to capture details of the initial stages of these events thus focusing on the visualization and measurements of the water elevations of the flow the wet dam break ratios h 0 h 1 0 6 hernández fontes et al 2017 and 0 4 hernández fontes et al 2018 where h 0 and h 1 are the depths of the water volumes located downstream and upstream of the vertical wall in the wet dam break setup respectively were combined with different freeboards to analyse the patterns of shipping water obtained the events generated had some resemblance to those defined in greco et al 2007 2005 it is important to perform more systematic studies that provide details of the interactions between shipping water and structures to have a better understanding of the phenomena and to obtain information that helps to optimize the design of structures subjected to shipping waves such as hydrodynamic loads on deck this information is relevant in design considerations for fixed structures e g bea et al 1999 park et al 2017 and in simulations of moving structures exposed to shipping water events e g fonseca et al 2010 rajendran et al 2016 with a better understanding of the physics involved in different types of shipping water events it would be possible to perform more detailed analytical and numerical model validations since not all types of water shipping events can be simulated by the same analytical or numerical approach this is because some events include the formation of air cavities of different sizes in the initial stages of the shipping where compressibility effects may be relevant e g plunging dam break colicchio et al 2011 greco et al 2007 whereas others do not have these cavities e g dam break type greco et al 2007 in this paper systematic wet dam break experiments were carried out to investigate shipping water events on a fixed structure generated with incoming bores obtained with different wet dam break ratios and freeboards the wet dam break strategy was selected since it uses a small installation to generate repeatable and short duration experiments that allowed the synchronized flow visualization and loading data to be captured the main objective was to investigate the effect of incoming bores of varying steepness on the main features of the water shipping and the related vertical loads on a deck analyses of the forward and backflow quasi static vertical loads over the complete deck of the structure in these events were performed that to the best of the authors knowledge have not been documented before see sect 4 for the definition of these loads the present study extends the previous works of hernández fontes et al 2018 2017 which only focused on the visualization of the initial stages of flow on the deck this study provides more insights into the classification of types of shipping water events generated by waves of different steepness increasing the knowledge of the trends of vertical loads generated during these events the experiments were carried out in a small dam break prismatic tank with an internal rectangular fixed structure representing the deck of a marine facility wet dam break ratios in the range 0 4 h 0 h 1 0 8 were considered for two different freeboards f b 0 030 and 0 042 m to generate the incident bores yielding isolated shipping water events conductive wave probes were used to relate information about the incoming wave and the freeboard exceedance on the structure a high speed camera was employed to obtain details of the events a force balance was used to measure the quasi static vertical loads on the deck of the structure all the sensors were synchronized and configured to acquire data at the same sampling rate this paper is divided as follows the experimental methods are described in sect 2 for the experiments with a freeboard of 0 030 m the results of the conventional wave probes are shown in sect 3 and the high speed camera and force balance results are described in sect 4 sect 5 presents a comparison of results obtained with two freeboards sect 6 discusses the effects of flume length in loading and finally the main conclusions are summarized in sect 7 2 experimental methods the experiments were carried out in a polymethyl methacrylate prismatic tank at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano of the coppe federal university of rio de janeiro brazil a rectangular fixed structure was installed on the downstream side of the tank to represent the deck of a barge shaped coastal naval or offshore facility the general arrangement of the wet dam break experiment including the main dimensions is shown in fig 1 at the beginning of the experiment a gate separated two volumes of calm water t 0 then a trigger activated all the sensors to begin measuring and released the gate the gate opened rapidly inducing the interaction of the upstream and downstream volumes through the action of gravity forming a bore this bore propagated downstream and interacted with the fixed structure resulting in bow run up and subsequent shipping water on the deck the theoretical wet dam break model described in stoker 1957 was used to analyse the maximum elevation of the bores in the experiments it is important to mention that this model considers infinite flow propagation conditions at both sides of the gate thus the effects on flow due to the tank walls have been disregarded in the present study conventional wave probe sensors a high speed camera and a force balance were used to obtain the experimental data these instruments were installed as shown in fig 1 four conductive wave probes wp0 wp3 were distributed along the tank to monitor water elevations at a sampling frequency of 500 hz these were made of two stainless steel rods of 2 4 mm diameter with a separation of 9 mm probes wp0 and wp1 measured water elevations downstream and upstream of the gate respectively whereas probes wp2 and wp3 measured the freeboard exceedance at the bow of the structure wave probe signals were obtained using a dhi 102e amplifier national instruments hardware and labview software calibration was performed based on the recommended procedures of ittc 2008 an uncertainty of 2 mm for each wave probe in the calibration procedure was verified a high speed camera cam qualisys 310 with an additional lens dc nikkor 105 mm f 2 d was used to capture details of the shipping water events at a sampling rate of 500 fps the camera was positioned parallel to the tank wall at a distance of approximately 3 m and centered with respect to the bow edge of the structure fig 1 the camera captured the complete height of the tank vertical field of view 0 45 m in the horizontal direction it allowed visualization from the position of wp0 to the end of the deck horizontal field of view 0 5 m qualisys qtm software was employed for the video analysis more details of the instrumentation and the experimental procedure regarding the wave probes and camera can be found in hernández fontes et al 2018 2017 to measure the vertical loads on the deck of the structure a force balance of four s type axial load cells was employed as shown in fig 1 the balance had a rigid wall that was in contact with the incoming wave and a rigid horizontal surface that was used as a sensing element these elements were made of 15 mm thick acrylic plates each side of the sensing element plate was 1 mm from the tank walls after each shipping water event small amounts of water entered through the balance and tank wall separations finally the remaining water under the balance was completely drained through a hole made in the tank wall the sampling rate of the balance was 500 hz with a low pass filter of 100 hz more details about the balance characteristics and the measurement procedures can be found in hernández fontes 2018 hernández fontes et al 2019 2 1 testing matrix different scenarios generated with wet dam break experiments were investigated two freeboards f b 0 030 and 0 042 m were tested for five designed wet dam break ratios r d h 0 h 1 0 8 0 7 0 6 0 5 and 0 4 where h 0 and h 1 corresponded to the initial water levels downstream and upstream of the gate respectively fig 1 to set the freeboards during the experiments the water level h 0 was varied but maintaining the same structure height in this work the experiments performed with f b 0 030 m were used to describe the specific details of patterns and loading of the water shipping obtained for the different wet dam break ratios sect 3 and 4 on the other hand the experiments carried out with f b 0 042 m were used to compare and discuss the general trends sect 5 experiments without the internal fixed structure employing only wave probe sensors were carried out to characterize the incoming flows sect 3 1 1 it is important to mention that for both freeboards the ratio h 0 h 1 0 8 did not present significant shipping water on the deck so this ratio was not considered in the analysis five runs were carried out for each study case to attain repeatability of the results and to estimate basic statistics of data such as mean and standard deviation values for all cases the time t 0 corresponded to the time when the trigger was activated to start the sensor measuring the gate release occurred between 0 4 s t 0 6 s approximately 3 analysis of the water elevation results in the wet dam break setup wave generation is very dependent on the initial h 0 and h 1 conditions the initial water levels were set visually using a ruler subject to human error although the designed parameters r d h 0 h 1 f b are given in the present work it is important to know the variations found in the parameters that were measured to allow other authors to reproduce the experiments table 1 summarizes the measured initial water levels h 0m h 1m wet dam break ratios r m and freeboards f bm h st h 0m where h st is the structure height including mean and standard deviation values obtained from the five repetitions the maximum difference between the designed and the mean measured values of wet dam break ratios was less than 2 for all cases in this work non dimensional terms for horizontal distance x x l water elevation η η h 1 time t t g h 1 and vertical force over the deck f f ρgh 1 l 2 were used to analyse the results the constant parameters used in these terms correspond to the structure length l 0 195 m water density ρ 1000 kg m3 gravitational acceleration g 9 81 m s2 and the designed initial water level of the upstream reservoir h 1 3 1 incoming wave features the water elevation data measured with probe wp0 for the experiments without the structure were used to analyse the incoming wave parameters fig 2 shows the water elevations η mean and standard deviation values measured by this probe for the four cases with h 0 0 120 m c1 c4 without the structure from which information can be extracted to characterize the incoming bore theoretical values for bore height based on stoker 1957 are plotted in the figure for comparison it can be observed that for each case the water level started to rise between 3 1 t 4 4 p and the maximum elevation m occurred at time o 5 1 t 7 1 for all the time series the water level rose from the static condition downstream of the gate to a maximum value incoming bore front the time interval between p and o varied for all cases with the bore crests reached faster in the cases with higher initial water levels h 1 in fact for higher the h 1 values the greater the initial potential energy in the upstream reservoir of water so the resultant flow that appears just after the gate is released rises more liu and liu 2017 next the upstream water volume pushes the downstream volume to move forward with it until a stage of gradual water level variation is attained in the present work the incoming wave height h w was defined for each case as the difference between the mean value of the maximum elevation measured by wp0 and the mean value of the initial water level downstream of the gate h 0 h 0 h 1 represented by the segments o m in fig 2 for c2 c3 and c4 h w was approximately 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 times the value obtained for c1 respectively the increase in h w is associated with the increase in the slope of the rising part of the time series rising limb as can be inferred from the slopes of the p m segments traced to each curve which also increased from c1 to c4 comparing the mean maximum elevations of the bores for each case with the theoretical values the experimental values overestimated the theoretical ones by approximately 10 0 10 4 14 2 and 16 4 for c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively in the present study the distance for bore development is short 0 505 m from the gate to the structure so the infinite domain for bore propagation considered in the theoretical approach was not attained to verify if the presence of the structure affects the increase of water elevation of the bore wave probe results from experiments performed with and without the fixed structure were analysed fig 3 shows the comparison of water elevations measured by wp1 fig 3a and wp0 fig 3b for c2 and c4 which were selected as representative of the other cases for wp1 the cases with and without the structure presented similar trends during the interaction between the volumes of water located up and downstream of the gate for t 7 the records differ in magnitudes due to the flow reflected by the tank wall for wp0 the mean maximum values of the incident wave for the case without the structure underestimated those obtained with the structure for c2 and c4 and showed a small time shift in their occurrence in the experiments performed with the structure a wave reflected by the structure just after the occurrence of the first peak was seen for longer times the cases without the structure also showed a reflected wave however this was caused by the tank wall the presence of the structure caused a small increase in incident bore amplitudes however it should also be noted that during the initial stage of bore generation a complex and unsteady flow occurs close to the gate see stansby et al 1998 for details which could explain the differences obtained with respect to the theoretical values 3 1 1 characterization of bore steepness in fig 3 the incoming bores generated have minor differences between the cases with and without the structure suggesting small wave diffraction effects in this framework to find relations between the incoming flows and the shipping water events generated the steepness of the incident wet dam break bores was characterized theoretically considering the available time series of water elevations given by wp0 for the experiments carried out without the internal structure unlike the oscillatory waves which mainly depend on wave height wave length and water depth the wet dam break bores obtained in this work were assumed as solitary waves which can be described in terms of their height and the constant water depth at which they propagate daily and stephan 1952 goring 1979 i e h w and h 0 for the present work respectively taking bores as solitary waves has been considered in the research of other authors such as duan et al 2018 and seelam and baldock 2009 for example duan et al 2018 considered the resulting flows from the gravity collapse method similar to the present approach but in a wave flume as solitary waves to validate their numerical analyses to estimate bore steepness it is necessary to find a characteristic length in a periodic wave this parameter is proportional to the wave length but for a non periodic shape there is no single length which describes the entire wave accurately hammack 1972 based on the works of goring 1979 hammack 1972 and silva et al 2000 the characteristic length of the resultant bores in this study was estimated as l c 1 5 h w h 0 1 2 h 0 thereby for c1 c2 c3 and c4 considering the experiments without the structure the steepness found ε h w l c was 0 12 0 21 0 33 and 0 55 respectively 3 2 water shipping elevations the three dimensional effects and the freeboard exceedance at the bow of the structure during the shipping water events were evaluated by the wave probes wp2 and wp3 fig 4 shows the water elevations at the bow for c1 and c4 which correspond to the maximum and minimum wet dam break ratios respectively small time shifts in the water elevation records for each pair of probes were observed as well as some differences in the maximum elevations suggesting some three dimensional effects during the initial stages of water shipping the deck was as horizontal as possible in the longitudinal and transversal directions i e inclination angles less than 0 1 but in the experiments a gate release guide was not used so it is possible that some of the three dimensional effects are related to small inclinations of the gate when it opened another possible source of these effects can be related to the installation of the wave probes these sensors particularly those made with rods of small diameter 2 4 mm in these experiments are subject to misalignment or deformation during installation this can produce errors in the measurements especially with linear calibration which was used in these experiments it is possible to quantify the three dimensional 3d effects in the water elevations in an approximate way by comparing the maximum values measured by wp2 i e wp2 m and wp3 i e wp3 m for the same case therefore the ratio wp2 m wp3 m for each pair of probes where wp2 m wp2 m h 1 and wp3 m wp3 m h 1 was calculated to quantify the 3d effects for the five repetitions of each case table 2 summarizes the mean and standard deviation of the wp2 m wp3 m ratios for all the study cases the results show an increase in the three dimensional effects associated with the reduction of the steepness of the bores i e from c4 to c1 the maximum and minimum three dimensional effects were presented for c1 23 of wp2 m wp3 m and c4 5 of wp2 m wp3 m respectively concerning the three dimensional behavior in the water elevations at the bow the non dimensional maximum freeboard exceedance he m for each case was estimated as wp2 m wp3 m 2 from this the mean and standard deviation values were found as shown in table 2 for c2 c3 and c4 he m was approximately 1 9 2 3 and 2 4 times the value obtained for c1 respectively fig 5 shows the relationship between the maximum freeboard exceedance he m and the bore height h w as defined earlier the horizontal and vertical error bars show the standard deviation for h w and he m respectively in fig 5 an almost linear relationship can be seen between the variables for c1 c2 and c3 however for c4 the results do not follow this trend which can be attributed to the features of water shipping of the steepest incoming bore when interacting with the structure this in turn caused a steep flow pattern at the bow as described in next section 4 analysis of video and force results in this section the results obtained from the high speed video and the vertical load data are presented for the four study cases of the f b 0 030 m experiments the patterns of water shipping over the deck and their respective vertical loads are discussed in this work two types of loading over the deck were defined forward and backflow loads the forward loads were considered as those generated by water propagating from the beginning of the deck to the stage at which it reached its maximum displacement over the tank wall during run up after this maximum tank wall run down took place and so backflow loads were considered including those caused by water returning to the reservoir the backflow loads may resemble the loads induced by the flow returned by a vertical structure installed on the deck of a marine facility the findings obtained with the specific configuration of this work i e a finite domain for shipping water propagation of 0 195 m in length can help to give a preliminary knowledge of the magnitudes of these loads with respect to the forward loads for different types of shipping water events particularly when the length of the vertical structure is longer than the length of the deck as is the case of the present experimental setup the time series of shipping water events for all the cases obtained with f b 30 mm shown by snapshots taken every δt 0 04 g h 1 are shown in figs 6 9 to identify the patterns defined by different bore steepnesses ε h w l c for all the cases the time series started approximately at the instant when the water level reached the deck level during the bow run up stage below each series of snapshots the time series of the vertical loads over the deck in terms of mean and standard deviation values for the five repetitions show the forward and backflow loading trends generated by each shipping water event to facilitate the analysis the time instants of the snapshots are defined in the time series of the loads fig 6 shows the time series for c1 r m 0 705 0 005 ε 0 12 from the snapshots it can be observed that after the water level reached the deck level water invaded the deck forming a small jet followed by the bulk of the water 7 44 t 8 36 for longer times t 8 36 the wavefront moved over the deck while the maximum elevation of the incident flow reached and surpassed the bow edge t 9 27 this maximum tended to decrease as the wavefront reached the vertical wall 9 57 t 10 18 forming a thin layer of fluid over the entire deck for t 10 18 the water on the deck interacted with the vertical tank wall resulting in run up note the obtuse angles of the crest of the flow in the early stages of the water shipping 8 36 t 9 57 125 θ 165 the forward vertical loads began at t 8 05 and the maximum mean values f 0 082 were reached between t 10 18 and t 10 48 when the complete deck was covered by water and the wall run up started between 10 48 t 10 79 the flow reached its maximum displacement during the wall run up reducing the loads over the deck then after t 10 79 wall run down was observed increasing the volume of water over the deck and causing a second a peak load f 0 073 between 11 7 t 12 0 after run down occurred returning to the water reservoir the time series for c2 r m 0 608 0 004 ε 0 21 are shown in fig 7 between 6 44 t 7 00 a small plunging wave reached the deck and encapsulated a small amount of air t 7 00 as the wave crest near the bow edge became steeper and approached the deck edge small forward and backward jets were formed by this plunging wave 7 00 t 7 56 the cavity size increased from t 7 00 to t 7 28 then the increasing water weight above it compressed the cavity by t 7 28 and t 7 56 and it completely disappeared at t 7 84 the process of cavity compression can be described as by lugni et al 2010 for a cavity formed during a flip through event on a vertical wall in this description an almost circular cavity is formed at the beginning of the phenomenon it is then deformed in all directions almost equally i e isotropic compression expansion subsequently the deformation of the cavity increases when a forward jet in contact with the wall surface is formed horizontal direction in our case that is it shows an anisotropic compression expansion finally the cavity is trapped by the flow until it collapses generating bubbles that mix into the flow similar behavior is observed in the present work even though the collapse of the cavity is not appreciated in the figures however it should be noted that in the present application the cavity deformation is mainly horizontal moreover there is a backward jet that contributes to the closure of the air cavity before it becomes completely trapped by the shipping flow in the present case the maximum elevation on the bow deck occurred at t 7 84 coinciding with the disappearance of the cavity once the cavity disappeared the wavefront of the shipped flow reached the vertical wall at t 8 40 causing run up later while wall run up occurred water was still flowing onto the deck forming an almost constant layer of fluid over the entire deck 8 68 t 9 52 which was larger than that observed in c1 furthermore in the present case the crest angle of the flow was sharper than in c1 from the beginning of the event 7 28 t 8 40 118 θ 158 in relation to the forward vertical loads these were taken into account for the force balance since the small cavity was formed at the bow edge and the plunging wave interacted with the deck t 7 00 in this case the mean maximum values f 0 24 were about 3 times greater than those observed for c1 and occurred earlier t 8 68 for the backflow loads which occurred from the beginning of the wall run down stage t 9 81 a second mean peak value of f 0 18 was observed between 10 64 t 10 93 overestimating 2 5 times that verified in c1 after the second peak t 10 93 the loads decreased while flow returned to the reservoir in fig 8 the time series of the shipping water for c3 r m 0 506 0 003 ε 0 33 are shown in general the patterns are similar to those of c2 including the formation of the cavity however in this case a greater amount of water was shipped onto the deck and the cavity formed at the edge of the bow 5 40 t 6 42 was larger than in c2 in c3 at t 6 42 the cavity had a weak three dimensional effect in its formation these effects were also confirmed in the freeboard exceedance measured by wp2 and wp3 in fig 4 for t 6 16 the formation of the forward and backward jets was as in c2 although they occurred further from the bow edge the cavity became trapped until the wave front approached the deck end t 6 93 and produced the run up on the vertical wall t 7 19 during the run up the wave continuously invaded the deck and a layer of water deeper than that observed in previous cases remained on the deck 7 44 t 8 72 unlike the previous cases the crest of the shipping flow was almost at right angles to the initial stages 6 16 t 6 67 117 θ 106 these angles then increased as the water on the deck propagated downstream entrapping the air cavity 6 93 t 7 19 121 θ 137 in the c3 load series it can be seen that the deck was loaded from the formation of the small water jets on the deck t 6 16 there is a small disturbance in the rising limb of the mean loads at t 7 19 which coincides with the stage when the air cavity was completely trapped by the flow the maximum mean forward load f 0 424 appeared between t 7 44 and t 7 70 overestimating by 176 and 517 the maximum values of c2 and c1 respectively this load occurred when the largest amount of water was over the deck and the wall run up began to take place the run down stage seemed to occur for t 8 46 causing backflow loading while the flow returned to the reservoir this backflow generated a second mean peak load of f 0 27 at t 10 when almost all the volume of shipped water was over the deck the c4 time series r m 0 408 0 005 ε 0 55 are presented in fig 9 although the patterns resemble those of c2 and c3 because of the cavity formation near the bow edge the largest cavity as well as the highest shipped water elevations on deck occurred in this case 5 72 t 6 63 the cavity extended horizontally to approximately 1 3 of the deck length 5 72 t 6 18 whereas the maximum elevation over the deck developed a forward pointing horn shape t 6 18 as seen in c3 there are three dimensional effects in the formation of the cavity 5 72 t 6 63 this case is best described as a block of water partially suspended over the bow which after touching the deck developed large upstream and downstream water jets almost at the end of the deck t 6 18 subsequently the shipping flow impacted directly with the tank wall t 6 40 a rapid run up occurred on the wall t 6 40 whilst water flooded onto the deck constantly from the bow even during backflow this case was the most severe shipping water event in the study as in c2 and c3 the vertical loads in c4 were measured when the plunging wave first touched the deck t 5 49 note that the mean maximum vertical load reached almost f 0 529 between 6 40 t 6 63 coinciding with the plunging wave hitting the deck and the vertical wall of the structure at the same time meanwhile the cavity was being closed by the jet propagating up the deck the curve of results presents a decline until a minimum of f 0 24 was attained at t 6 86 when the cavity was trapped by the flow and wall run up was occurring unlike the previous cases c4 presented a larger amount of water flooding the deck even when the wall run up was occurring then the wall run up and run down stages caused an almost constant loading of f 0 3 during 7 09 t 8 46 details of the cavity evolution and its relationship with the loading time series were not addressed in this work since these occurred simultaneously with the wall run up however in further research longer decks and load measuring techniques could be used allowing the analysis of the effects of cavity collapse in loading furthering the findings of other authors abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 lugni et al 2006 lyu et al 2017 it is important to mention that when shipping water loading begins impulsive vertical loads are seen followed by quasi static loads when the water floods the deck bea et al 1999 buchner 2002 in order to record these impulsive loads high rates of sampling are required this is often done using pressure sensors at specific locations buchner 2002 on the other hand in the present work the quasi static loads were analysed over almost the entire deck surface using the lower sampling frequency of the force balance fig 10 compares the vertical loads of each shipping water event obtained for the freeboard of 0 030 m c1 c4 considering h 1 for the non dimensional forces to visualize the complete time series for each case these data include the forward loading before the run up on the tank wall see mean maximum values for each case m 1 and the backflow loading after this run up note that the backflow loading also presents a considerable maximum load for each case m 2 with respect to m 1 for the present experimental configuration finite domain of 0 195 m in length for shipping water propagation the ratio m 2 m 1 was between 0 64 and 0 86 for all cases which suggests that the magnitudes of the backflow loads are significant in comparison with the forward loads therefore for similar structure configurations as the one employed in this work the backflow loads should be considered for design purposes note that c1 c2 and c3 show similar trends in the time series of loads that is the loads rose progressively during the forward loading reached a maximum then decayed before reaching a second peak due to the backflow loading however in c4 the vertical loads show a more rapid increase in the forward loading and the decay following the first peak than other cases the subsequent maximum values remained almost constant for a considerable time due to the huge amount of water present in the run down and backflow stages 5 discussion of the effects of different freeboards shipping water events have been previously analysed with regular waves interacting with a fixed structure greco et al 2007 these events were defined as dam break db plunging dam break pdb and hammer fist hf while the means of generating the shipping water events in this work is different from that used by greco et al visual inspection shows that some features of the c1 c2 c3 and c4 cases which were obtained for a freeboard of 30 mm resemble those reported for the db pdb and hf respectively for a detailed description of these events see greco et al 2007 in the present work the c1 event can be described as db since an air cavity did not form whereas the c2 c3 events can be related to pdb with a small cavity pdbsc with respect to the c4 event the video shows the formation of a narrow flow crest over the deck and a large plunging wave forming a large air cavity from the bow edge this differs from the description of greco et al 2007 for the hf event since in that event no cavity was reported therefore the event found here can be described as a pdb with a large cavity size pdblc the increase in the steepness of the incoming bores produced different shipping water patterns in c1 where the bore steepness was the lowest 0 12 the smallest amount of water went onto the deck without the formation of a cavity then for higher steepnesses c2 to c4 i e from 0 21 to 0 55 both the amount of water on the deck as well as the size of the cavity increased moreover the angle formed by the wave crest in the initial stages of the water invading the deck became steeper the crests changed from obtuse to a peculiar sharp angle from c1 to c4 respectively the non linear trend observed especially for c3 to c4 in fig 5 which showed the comparison of maximum freeboard exceedance he m and the assumed bore height h w can be partially related to the effect of the sharper crests formed in the shipping flow these formed almost a right angle when the maximum freeboard exceedance was attained see figs 9 and 5 49 t 5 72 the shipping water patterns found in the experiments with freeboard f b 0 042 m are in agreement with the classification made for the events reported for f b 0 030 m with the main differences being the size of the cavities and the magnitude of the loads on the deck however it is worth mentioning that for the ratios h 0 h 1 0 6 and 0 5 bores with a partially broken front were seen for f b 0 042 m causing particular features in the flow crests in the initial stages of shipping as shown in fig 11 although nakagawa et al 1969 reported that for h 0 h 1 0 6 unbroken bores are obtained the incoming flow features are in better agreement with the descriptions of kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 stansby et al 1998 and yeh et al 1989 who reported that for h 0 h 1 ratios lower than 0 6 broken bores can be observed results from experiments with different freeboards in this work indicate that lower water depths downstream of the gate h 0 influenced the breaking of the bores regardless of having the same h 0 h 1 ratio fig 12 shows the variation of the ratio of the cavity and its area for different wave steepnesses the cavity area was considered to be half of the area of an ellipse where x cav and z cav are its horizontal and vertical ratios respectively fig 12 these parameters were measured from the video recordings for the five repetitions the cavities were those formed at the instants when the plunging wave first touched the deck from fig 12 it can be observed that for both freeboards the aspect ratio defined as z cav x cav was less for steeper waves this means that for longer waves the cavities were more like an arc particularly for f b 0 030 m attaining a semi elliptical form with larger x cav ratios for steeper waves on the other hand for both freeboards the non dimensional area of the cavity a cav l 2 increased with a steeper bore note that the shipping water events obtained with the higher freeboard produced cavities of greater area than those obtained with the lower freeboard with respect to the shipping water vertical loads found for the two different freeboards mean maximum loads over the deck during the forward and backward loading stages m1 and m2 respectively were analysed for different incoming bore steepnesses as shown in fig 13 in order to compare these values the force was made non dimensional using the structure height h st 0 15 m it can be observed that the highest peak for the loads was in the experiments with the lowest freeboard f b 0 030 m note that for longer bores the peak loads m1 and m2 were very similar during forward and backflow loading for both freeboards the difference between m1 and m2 remained almost constant for bore steepnesses of between 0 2 and 0 35 m2 was less than 38 the value of m1 for each case however this difference increased for f b 0 030 m when the wave steepness was greatest close to 0 6 c4 in this case which corresponds to the shipping water event described in fig 9 the forward peak load m1 was the greatest of all the shipping water events analysed overestimating by 40 the peak backflow load the results show that steeper bores produce shipping water events with sharper wave crest angles at the beginning of the deck as well as larger cavities and greater vertical loads there is an evolution from db followed by pdbsc to pdblc type events as the incident bores increased their steepness similar findings were described by greco et al 2007 who suggested that with regular waves there is a transition from db to pdb and to hf type events from longer to steeper regular waves fig 14 summarizes the types of shipping water events found for the experiments performed in this work with different wet dam break ratios and the two freeboards similarly as done in greco et al 2007 the ratios between the vertical velocity of the incident wave w b and the vertical flow velocity at the bow w were evaluated these were calculated using mean values of the data measured by wave probes such as w b h w t 2 t 1 and w h e t 2 t 1 where t 2 is the time at which the maximum values occurred and t 1 is the time at which the wave probes started measuring the water elevation note that the distribution of shipping water scenarios reported in fig 14 in terms of w b w ratios and bore steepness resembles the qualitative distribution of events proposed by greco et al 2007 which is included in the figure in this sense the db and the pdbsc events found in the present work seem to fall into the regions of the graph defined by them it is important to note that although the patterns of the pbdlc case obtained in the present work differ from the hf event obtained with regular waves in greco et al 2007 mainly due to the large cavity formation it seems to fall into the region of the graph where such an event could be expected it is clear that the bores considered in this study are quite different from the regular waves typically used in studies on water shipping giving some differences between the patterns identified here and those reported in the literature however it was shown that the present approach can be a useful alternative for examining the behavior of water on deck allowing different shipping water scenarios to be generated in a practical way particularly for the investigation of specific details of flow propagation 6 discussion of the effect of flume length in loading in using the present approach to investigate shipping of water on structures it is important to consider that incoming waves with different features may generate different shipping water patterns and in turn different load trends over the deck besides the initial h 0 and h 1 conditions the features of the resultant wet dam break bores depend on the distance available for their development along the flume nakagawa et al 1969 performed wet dam break experiments in a wave flume 0 5 m wide 0 5 m high and 30 m long reporting that the waves resulting from wet dam break ratio h 0 h 1 0 6 are undular bores and those obtained with h 0 h 1 0 4 and 0 5 are broken flows when they are fully developed downstream of the gate in the present experiments this behavior was not observed for the ratios 0 4 and 0 5 with all the freeboards as the available distance for wave development i e 0 505 m is short in comparison to nakagawa et al 1969 the use of longer installations would allow study of shipping water due to broken incident flows with these ratios for the present experimental configuration the resulting incoming flows allowed study of the patterns shown previously in sect 4 the effect of flume length in the wave development was not treated in the present experimental program however to have an idea of its effect in the vertical loading on deck the results obtained in this work for the ratio 0 6 and freeboard of 0 042 m were compared with those reported in hernández fontes et al 2019 obtained with similar procedures in a larger installation hernández fontes et al 2019 performed wet dam break tests in an installation with a width of 0 5 m a distance for bore development of 1 258 m and an upstream reservoir of the same length as that used in the present study i e 0 3 m in that work a force balance with the same characteristics as that of the present study was embedded in a fixed structure 0 392 m long and 0 5 m wide and 0 15 m high fig 15 a to measure the forward vertical loads in that case the distance from the balance to the tank walls was longer than in the present study as illustrated in fig 15a fig 15b shows the comparison of the vertical loads obtained in the present work and in hernández fontes et al 2019 considering the instant at which the force balance started measuring the loads in both cases note that there is a good agreement during the rising limb of the signals however from t 11 6 the present results overestimate the loads found in the larger installation presenting a difference δf 0 025 between the mean peak forward loads which occurred almost at the same time δt 0 12 in the results of the present work it is possible to verify the occurrence of a second peak in the loads due to the backflow induced by the tank wall conversely in the case of hernández fontes et al 2019 this wall was located further from the balance and the load trends were unchanged regarding the comparison of fig 15b for the forward loading it is possible to conclude that the vertical loads over the deck were less in the larger installation this can be attributed to the longer distance for bore development but also to the width of the installation which is 1 5 times longer than that used in the present work the use of the larger installation allowed the wave to be well developed generating an unbroken undular bore for the ratio h 0 h 1 0 6 hernández fontes et al 2019 however it is important to consider that this wave may have lost energy in its propagation due to friction effects of the flume walls these effects could have contributed with the reduction of the resultant loads over the deck with respect to those measured in the smaller installation of the present work the comparisons shown in this section suggest that the shipping water patterns and loading obtained with the present approach can be sensitive to the dimensions of the dam break installation then to perform systematic evaluations a specific setup should be selected considering the expected features of the resulting flows 7 conclusions systematic experiments using the wet dam break method for wave generation were performed to analyse the influence of incident flows on the patterns of shipping water and the related vertical loads obtained on a rectangular fixed structure the main findings are as follows a the wet dam break ratio h 0 h 1 0 8 did not induce significant water shipping for the two freeboards considered b the events found with the present approach were mainly defined by the size of the cavity formed at the beginning of the deck and the angle of the flow crest formed during the initial stages of water shipping the size of the cavities was greater for lower wet dam break ratios which generated steeper bores c shipping water events obtained with wet dam break ratios h 0 h 1 0 7 0 6 0 5 and 0 4 were defined in this work as dam break type db plunging dam break type with small cavity pdbsc and plunging dam break type with large cavity pdblc respectively these events are similar to the classification made by greco et al 2007 for the dam break db plunging dam break pdb and hammer fist hf types of shipping water events respectively which were obtained using regular waves however in the present study the pdblc presented the formation of a large air cavity that was not reported in the hf d in the experiments with the two different freeboards it was seen that steeper bores generated events which had the largest cavities and the largest loads over the deck with respect to the cavities an increase in bore steepness was associated with an increase in their area but with a reduction in their aspect ratio z cav x cav becoming semi elliptical in shape in relation to the loads obtained for the present experimental configuration significant backflow loads of almost the same order as the forward loads were observed for all cases this underlines the importance of considering backflow loads for design purposes in cases where shipping water interacts with vertical walls of structures located on the deck of marine facilities the low water depth used for the wave propagation can restrict the use of the present approach for shallow water applications as for instance to study shipping water on coastal structures the results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach has potential for investigating the behavior of different types of shipping water on fixed structures in a detailed and practical way and particularly for capturing specific details of flow propagation which can be useful to extract valuable information for model validations further research is required to investigate the effect of flume length in the incoming flow features i e broken and unbroken flows and the resulting shipping water patterns and loads for different wet dam break ratios the experimental data presented in this work may be useful for performing model validations therefore the five repetitions of water elevations measured by wp0 and the loading time series

22152,elevated pile cap which transits the load from sea crossing bridge pylon to pile group is always close to the sea level and suffering from extreme wave loadings this paper describes a wave flume experimental program to investigate wave loads on the elevated pile cap of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges two specimen configurations including isolated cap and cap with pile group were set up with different clearance heights wave forces on the cap including horizontal and vertical force and moment were measured simultaneously under five nonlinear regular wave trains the effects of pile group clearance height and wave height on wave forces on the cap were investigated the experimental results show that the clearance height and wave height affect wave forces significantly the largest horizontal force occurs when the cap is fully submerged while the largest vertical force occurs when the bottom of the cap locates at still water level swl as the wave height increases the horizontal forces increase except for the fully submerged case and the vertical forces increase firstly but decrease when the wave height exceeds 0 18 m pile group increases the vertical uplift forces on the cap when the bottom of the cap locates above swl keywords wave force elevated pile cap sea crossing bridges wave flume experiment pile group clearance height 1 introduction with the advent of booming demand in ground transportation across straits and channels development of long span sea crossing bridge is being pursued to connect the mainland and islands all over the world pile group foundations are widely used to support contemporary long span sea crossing bridges such as china east sea bridge liu et al 2007 san francisco oakland bay bridge frick 2008 hangzhou bay bridge ye 2010 and pingtan rail cum road sea crossing bridge ti et al 2019 due to its good applicability in deep water site and complex seabed terrain however the elevated pile cap which transits the load from bridge pylon to pile group is always close to the sea level and suffering from extreme wave loadings ti et al 2018 in recent years catastrophes like hurricanes ivan in 2004 katrina in 2005 ike in 2008 indian ocean tsunami in 2004 tohoku tsunami in 2011 and typhoon haiyan in 2013 caused extensive damage to infrastructures and led a large number of coastal bridges to be damaged or collapsed douglass et al 2004 robertson et al 2007 stearns and padgett 2011 unjoh 2006 kosa 2011 akiyama et al 2013 mas et al 2015 considering the risk of structural failure of sea crossing bridges due to extreme waves ti et al 2019 wei et al 2019 it is hence important to estimate wave loads on the elevated pile cap for assessments of structure safety and construction feasibility of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges many experiments were carried out to investigate the wave force and pressure on offshore elevated structures lan et al 2006 carried out an experiment to investigate the vertical force on a slab of sea crossing bridge piers under regular and irregular waves ding et al 2008 designed an experiment to investigate unidirectional random wave slamming on a platform structure and effects of the wave direction cuomo et al 2009 conducted large scale flume experiments to investigate the dynamics of wave loading on coastal highway bridges based on the experimental results cuomo et al 2010 introduced a prediction formula for quasi static and breaking wave induced impact forces and overturning moments at vertical seawalls and breakwaters bradner et al 2010 performed laboratory tests on 1 5 scale reinforced concrete specimen of coastal bridge superstructure to investigate wave in deck loads under regular and random waves considering the flexibility and dynamic properties of the supporting bridge substructure wei et al 2013 conducted an experiment to study the dynamic response of bridge pile foundations submerged in water guo et al 2015 conducted a hydrodynamic experiment to investigate the wave force acting on the superstructures of coastal bridge and compared to douglass et al 2006 and model of aashto guidelines 2008 seiffert et al 2014 experimentally studied the horizontal and vertical forces acting on a two dimensional horizontal plate by solitary waves wave loads under different wave heights water depths as well as submergence depths and elevations above still water level were discussed in detail chuang et al 2018 investigated the effect of aeration and air compressibility on the wave slamming forces of offshore platform experimentally however these studies paid little attention to the elevated pile cap of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges moreover ti et al 2018 conducted a field measurement of random wave pressure on a real cofferdam for sea crossing bridge during typhoon and observed the secondary peaks in the pressure spectrums although the first order diffraction theory is commonly used to assess the wave force on the large scale marine structures such as elevated pile cap it is not sufficient to deal with waves with nonlinear kinematics and caps locates above the mean sea level molin 2002 the blocking and shading effect of pile group on the wave force of the pile cap has yet been well understood this study investigates the wave forces acting on the elevated cap of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges experimentally the 5th order stokes regular waves with five different heights and the associated lower bound of periods according to testing breaking limits were used to simulate the extreme waves two configurations of the specimen including isolated cap and cap with pile group were set up considering five clearance heights the following two objectives are set 1 to discern the characteristics of the time history of wave forces under different clearance and wave height conditions and 2 to understand effects of clearance height wave height and pile group on the wave loads acting on the pile cap 2 experimental setup 2 1 wave testing facilities the experiments of this study were conducted in the wave flume at southwest jiaotong university the flume is equipped with a piston type wave generating system the flume is 60 m in length 2 m in width and 1 8 m in height with side walls comprised of steel frames and toughened glass which provides a clear and wide visual range during the testing as shown in fig 1 the piston type wave maker designed by dalian university of technology is installed at the right end of the flume and able to generate various one dimensional wave environments such as linear and nonlinear regular wave irregular wave focused wave breaking wave etc in the process of making waves the motion file of the wave maker could be updated automatically according to the feedback from actual wave condition obtained by the data acquisition system installed in the flume until the expected waves are made the wave absorbing beach which is made of porous polymer material is positioned at the left end of the flume to absorb the wave energy and to reduce the wave reflection the testing bridge locates and operates on the stainless steel tracks placed at the top of the side walls in the following testing we define the cartesian coordinate of the flume as illustrated in fig 1 a x direction is the longitudinal direction from the wave maker to the wave absorbing beach y direction is the transverse direction pointing from in plane to out of plane against the flume and z direction is the vertical direction with positive direction upward four wave gauges were installed in the flume to measure the water surface elevations as illustrated in fig 1 b wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg 4 were installed at 10 cm left 10 cm right and 10 cm rear of the tested cap specimen respectively wg1 was installed at 2 m front of the wg4 to measure the wave conditions in the empty wave flume after the testing specimen was mounted in the flume wg1 was relocated at 40 cm front of the cap in order to measure the reflection of the wave induced by the specimen the sampling frequency of wave gauges was set to 100 hz that is sufficient to record the fluctuation of water surface through a subsequent comparison for validity the f t force and torque transducer was used to measure both force and torque acting on the specimen along x y and z directions although the sampling frequency of the transducer can be set as high as 7000 hz it was found in previous experiments tomiczek et al 2017 guo et al 2015 that a sampling frequency of 200 hz is sufficient to capture the impulsive forces and structural responses signals in this study a sampling frequency of 1000 hz which is higher than 200 hz was chosen here to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the measurements during wave impacts on the cap all experimental processes were recorded visually through hd camera with a sampling speed of 60 fps 2 2 configuration of tested specimen the design of the reduced scale specimens tested in this study was inspired by a pile cap of the group pile foundation for a sea crossing bridge that crosses pingtan strait in the southeast coast of china as shown in fig 2 a the prototype foundation is composed of twelve concrete piles and one concrete pile cap the pile cap is 36 m in length 24 m in width and 13 5 m in height elevated on the piles with diameter of 4 5 m fig 2 b shows a photo of the wave acting on an elevated pile cap under construction the reduced scale tested specimen shown in fig 3 a with dimensions inspired from the prototype foundation was composed of a group of 12 circular piles and a rectangular pile cap considering the flume dimensions and abilities of experimental facilities the tested specimen was designed according to the froude similarity using a 1 90 geometric scaling the tested specimen was made of acrylic material which has light weight and high rigidity the pile was manufactured with external diameter of 5 cm and thickness of 5 mm to ensure its strength the dimension of the cap specimen was a rigid box with length of 40 cm width of 26 67 cm and height of 15 cm in order to study the effect of the pile group on the wave force of the pile cap two configurations of tested specimen 1 the isolated pile cap and 2 the pile cap with pile group were set up for the isolated pile cap configuration the f t transducer was fastened firmly on the testing bridge through the lifting rod the tested cap specimen was suspended on the bottom of the f t transducer by the rigid alloy frame as illustrated in fig 3 b for the pile cap with pile group configuration the piles were fully fixed on the floor of the wave flume considering the major objective of this study is to address the wave force acting on the pile cap a tiny gap approximately 1 mm was kept between the bottom of the cap and the top of the pile group to exclude the wave force on the pile group from the force measured by the f t transducer 2 3 clearance height setting in the actual practice of the pile group foundation one important design parameter is the clearance height between the bottom of the cap and still water level swl five different clearance heights s were investigated experimentally for both configurations of tested specimen as shown in fig 4 s 2 and 4 cm were two cases that the cap bottom was above the swl s 0 cm referred to the case that the cap bottom coincided with the swl and the latter two cases s 7 5 cm and 15 cm related to the cases that the cap was partially and fully submerged in the water respectively in the experiment the depth of the water d in the flume was fixed at 0 9 m during the whole experimental study which was conducive to comparison among the cases with different clearance heights and wave conditions therefore the clearance height s was increased or decreased by changing the length of the lifting rod the pile consists of five segments to meet five different clearance height requirements upper segment was connected to the lower segment by acylic when the clearance height was changed the height of the pile group was changed accordingly by adding or removing the segments to keep the air gap between cap and pile group constant 2 4 experimental wave conditions in this study the water depth in the flume was set to be 0 9 m the wave parameters of ten regular extreme wave trains with wave height h from 0 04 m to 0 5 m were extracted through wave conditions calibration tests in the flume the period of the calibrated extreme wave train is close to the lower bound of period which keeps the wave as steep as possible and exactly unbroken in the flume table 1 lists the wave parameters of the calibrated extreme wave trains in the flume five extreme wave trains with wave height h from 0 09 m to 0 21 m with increments of 0 03 m in table 1 were selected as the experimental wave conditions for the following study 3 experimental procedure 3 1 validation of regular wave train in the flume according to the wave parameters listed in tables 1 and i e h gt 2 and d gt 2 all five selected extreme wave conditions were found in the range of the 5th order stokes wave theory le mehaute 1976 to verify the quality of the generated regular waves water surface elevations measured by wave gauge wg2 in the flume and the theoretical elevations calculated by the 5th order stokes wave theory were compared in fig 5 good agreements can be found between the measured and theoretical water elevation for all five experimental wave conditions which demonstrates that the wave maker generates satisfactory regular wave trains in the flume moreover water surface elevations measured by wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg4 are compared as well to verify the stability of the wave along the flume because wg2 and wg3 locate in the same section only wg2 is used it is clear from fig 6 that there are few deviations among them in terms of wave heights and periods neglecting the phase difference caused by the position it can be concluded from the results that the wave train was stable while it was propagating in the flume 3 2 natural vibration testing although the support system of the cap specimen is expected to be designed as rigid as possible the natural vibration of the tested specimens is still difficult to be eliminated especially when it vibrates along x direction under wave impact moreover the extending length of the lifting rod changes with the clearance height and causes the change of natural vibration frequency of the specimen it is hence necessary to obtain the first order natural vibration frequency f 1 of the specimen installed on the testing bridge with different clearance heights the free vibration testing was conducted as soon as the specimen was installed in the flume an impact hammer was used to excite the specimen along the x axis free vibration testing of the specimen was repeated three times to guarantee the accuracy of the testing results fig 7 shows time domain and frequency domain results of x direction reaction force record from the f t transducer for the cap specimen with s 4 cm natural frequencies of cap specimens with five different clearance heights are listed in table 2 with range from 10 32 to 15 71 hz it should be noted that the smaller natural frequency is associated to smaller clearance height it is because 1 smaller clearance height relates to longer free length of the lifting rod and 2 when s becomes negative the cap specimen is submerged in water which reduces the natural frequency of the specimen zhang et al 2019 3 3 post processing of measured data figs 8 and 9 present a sample of horizontal and vertical force on the isolated cap specimen with s 2 cm under wave conditions with h 0 15 m and t 1 15s slamming force can be clearly found in the time histories of both horizontal and vertical force according to the fourier spectrum the first peak has the highest power and its frequency equals to the frequency of the regular wave except the first peak there are still many higher order peaks of which the frequencies are integer n times the first peak frequency similar phenomenon was also observed and reported by guo et al 2015 in their study the nonlinear waves and higher order velocity potentials induced by incident and diffracted waves are the reasons for the n times frequency wave forces it is interesting to notice that the amplitude of the fourier spectrum of the horizontal wave force fx increases in the range from 12 44 hz to 15 48 hz that equals the average value of the natural frequency of the tested specimen highlighted by the dashed black frame in fig 8b this is mainly caused by the disturbance from structural natural vibration however the lower bound of the range is smaller than natural frequency of the tested specimen fig 10 presents the inundation of the cap during wave propagation by images the frequency we tested in table 2 is structural frequency under still water fig 10a however the extent of inundation changes significantly due to the fluctuation of water surface during the propagation of a wave train previous experiment carried out by wei et al 2013 has shown that structural natural frequency of the cap varies with the inundation volume of the cap the larger the inundation volume is the lower the structural frequency is it can explain why the lower bound of the frequency range for the structural vibration becomes smaller the low pass 3rd order butterworth filter is used to filter the raw data the comparison of filtered data and raw data of horizontal force is illustrated in fig 11 when the cutoff frequency is set to be the exact natural frequency of specimen given in table 2 significant noise still exists in the curve however most of the noise can be filtered when the lower bound of structural vibration range e g 12 44 hz according to fig 8 is used as the cutoff frequency therefore the lower bound of structural vibration range is used as the cutoff frequency to filter the raw data of the horizontal force in the following sections for the vertical force since the natural frequency of the specimen in z direction is pretty high and no obvious contribution of the high frequency component is observed the raw data is directly used for the following analysis 4 results and discussions in this section the horizontal and vertical wave forces on the cap specimen are analyzed to obtain more insight into the characteristics of wave forces and the effects of pile group clearance height and wave height on the wave loads acting on the cap are investigated based on the experimental data five incident wave trains times five clearance heights constitute 25 experimental working conditions for each configuration of tested specimen e g the isolated pile cap and the pile cap with pile group 4 1 horizontal wave forces on the cap in order to show and compare all clearance height conditions in one figure the time axis of the time history of the wave force was normalized by the wave period corresponding to the given wave height the time histories for all working conditions use the same phase the duration of the time history is four times wave period fig 12 shows the normalized time series of the horizontal wave forces fx on the isolated cap and the cap with pile group the positive and negative value refer to forward and backward force along x direction respectively compared with the horizontal wave forces on the isolated cap the force on the pile cap with pile group does not show obvious dissimilarity in the shape of the curve for s 0 the horizontal wave force arises abruptly reaching to the crest in a short time then diminishes below zero and finally returns to zero with increase of submerged depth of the cap for s 0 the slamming nature of the horizontal wave force disappears gradually and the peak value of the force become more stable compared with the former cases with s 0 fig 13 shows the process of the wave acting on the cap with pile group obtained by images for case with s 2 cm and under wave condition with h 0 18 m and t 1 25 s the front of incoming wave breaks due to the reflection of last wave wave breaking combined with wave run up before the front of the cap occurs when horizontal wave force climbs to the peak finally the wave passes away with the wave force settling down and the slamming process is over the horizontal backward wave force in this case is small because the cap is hung above swl so that it is the wave crest that mainly acts on the cap and the wave trough gets through below the cap without any contact 4 2 vertical wave forces on the cap fig 14 shows the normalized time series of vertical wave forces fz on the isolated cap and the cap with pile group positive and negative value in the figure mean the uplift and downward force along z direction respectively it can be seen that vertical wave forces on the cap with pile group varies more intensely than those of isolated cap specifically when the bottom of the cap locates at or above swl the shading and blocking of pile group aggravates the movement of water particles below the cap specimen provokes more complex state of trapped air and leads to the larger vertical force compared with the case without pile group the vertical wave forces on the cap with s 0 generally go through three phases initially slamming force occurs with considerable magnitude but exceptionally short duration followed by quasi static uplift force dwindling down in a relatively long duration secondary peak appears sometimes and depends on the clearance height of the cap finally the vertical downward force occurs and turns to zero when the waves depart from the cap this three phase mode of vertical wave in deck force has been presented in the previous experiments reported by ren and wang 2003 cuomo et al 2007 and ren et al 2016 the vertical uplift force is significantly larger than the downward force when the bottom of the cap locates at or above swl however the vertical downward forces increase with the increase of the submerged depth and become larger than uplift forces when s 7 5 and 15 cm fig 15 shows the process of the wave acting on the cap for case with s 2 cm and s 15 cm compared fig 15 a with fig 13 b it can be found that the vertical wave force reaches its crest earlier than the horizontal wave force according to fig 15 b the crest of the wave has been higher than the top of the cap and the wave crest climbed over the top of the cap with a lot of water overtopping it which caused larger vertical downward force it can be found from figs 12 and 14 show that the vertical uplift force is larger than the horizontal forward force for elevated conditions while the vertical uplift force turns smaller than the horizontal forward force for submerged conditions 4 3 effect of pile group the horizontal vertical forces and moment on the pile cap under regular wave trains were measured in time domain by f t transducer simultaneously because the time history of wave force includes several crest and trough values in order to investigate different effects on the wave force acting on the cap the following representative values of the wave forces are defined for each working condition horizontal forward force positive horizontal backward force negative vertical uplift force positive and vertical downward force negative the representative value of horizontal forward force and backward force is equal to the mean value of the crest and trough values in the time history of horizontal wave force respectively likewise the representative value of vertical uplift force and vertical downward force is equal to the mean value of the crest and trough values in the time history of vertical wave force respectively comparison of four representative values of horizontal and vertical wave forces between the two configurations of specimens is illustrated in fig 16 because the wave used in the test is nonlinear the positive and the negative representative values are not equal therefore there are four points for each working condition and a total of 100 points for 25 working conditions without repeatability testing data it can be seen from fig 16 that the horizontal force of both specimens has negligible inequalities while the vertical uplift force of the cap with pile group is slightly larger than that of the isolated cap it is because pile group blocks the water particles passing under the cap and makes some of the forward moving particles turn into upward moving and slam on the bottom of the cap in order to understand the contribution of horizontal and vertical force to the moment as illustrated in fig 17 a the moment my is described as a function of horizontal force fx and vertical force fz by eq 1 considering the absolute value of the peak moment positive is much greater than that of the trough moment negative only the largest peak moment was selected for one working condition the horizontal and vertical wave force components which occur simultaneously with the largest moment were then extracted fig 17 b depicts three components of force on the isolated cap and the cap with pile group in the three dimensional 3d coordinates there are 25 points for each configuration of the specimen space plane was used to fit the data by least square method it is clear that the horizontal wave force contributes far more to the moment than the vertical wave force regardless of the specimen configuration the difference in the three components of force between two configurations of specimen are inconspicuous 1 m y f z x 0 f x l 0 z 0 4 4 effect of clearance height the standard deviation of the representative values of wave forces are calculated according to the experimental data to provide information about the repeatability of the data fig 18 illustrates the representative values and error bar of the wave forces on the cap with pile group varying with clearance heights because the incident wave in the study is regular and stable the deviation of the data is small for most of the working conditions it is clear from fig 18 a that both horizontal forward and backward wave forces decrease with increase of clearance height and the forward forces under all wave conditions occur when the cap is fully submerged in water it is because larger inundation area of the cap receives more pulling force during the propagation of wave while the vertical uplift force firstly increases until the case with the bottom of the cap located at swl then decreases with increasing clearance height according to fig 18 b in other words the largest vertical uplift force occurs when the clearance height is zero this phenomenon has also been found in previous studies park et al 2017 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 seiffert et al 2015 the vertical downward force is almost constant under either s 0 or s 0 the absolute value of the force for s 0 is larger than that for s 0 contrary to the uplift force the absolute value of downward force is small for the clearance height of s 0 it should be noted that the tiny air gap in this study fig 3 influences the vertical wave force especially for setup of s 0 cm two cfd models were established to evaluate the effect of air gap on the wave forces of the pile cap one is that the pile group is firmly attached to the cap without any air gap and the other one includes a tiny air gap of 0 001 m between cap and pile refined grid size k ω turbulent model and the volume of fluid method vof are adopted according to the cfd simulations the air gap increases the peak value and causes a 15 positive mean shift of the vertical wave force on the cap with s 0 this is because the water particles entrapped inside the air gap when the wave crest passed through the cap with s 0 the water inside the gap increases not only the bottom wetted area of the cap but also the distribution of uplift pressure and hence gives birth to the increase and mean shift of vertical wave forces therefore the value of vertical uplift force for s 0 could be overestimated due to the existence of air gap 4 5 effect of wave height fig 19 presents the representative values and error bar of the wave forces on the cap with pile group as a function of wave heights fig 19 a indicates that the horizontal forward force increases nearly linearly with increasing wave height when the bottom of the cap locates at or above water while the horizontal backward force varies slowly as the wave height increases from 0 09 m to 0 15 m and increases distinctly as wave height increases from 0 15 m to 0 21 m in this study larger wave has longer wave length and can diffract around the cap much easier the movement of water particle in the opposite direction induces apparent horizontal backward force nevertheless both absolute values of horizontal forward and backward wave forces firstly increase then decrease with the increase of wave height for clearance height of 15 cm with the largest value occurring under wave height of 0 15 m it is because the water particle of larger wave is much easier to pass above the cap than that of smaller wave fig 19 b shows that the vertical uplift force increases with an increment in wave height from 0 09 m to 0 18 m but decreases when the wave height is up to 0 21 m because large wave would overtop the top of the cap and diminish the vertical uplift force as s 0 the variation of vertical downward force is not obvious under various wave heights however when the cap is submerged in water the vertical downward force is significantly affected by the wave height and the wave with large height would induce large vertical downward force 5 conclusions this paper presents an experimental program of extreme wave forces on the elevated pile cap of pile group foundation for sea crossing bridge the reduced scale pile cap specimens including the isolated cap and pile cap with pile group were set up in the wave flume the results are presented and discussed as a function of clearance height wave height and pile group the wave force on the cap is a function of both clearance height and wave height the largest horizontal wave force occurs when the cap is fully submerged while the largest vertical uplift force occurs when the bottom of the cap locates at swl higher clearance height reduces the horizontal wave force but induces larger vertical wave force on the cap wave slamming force occurs when the bottom of the cap locates above swl compared with horizontal slamming force the vertical slamming force has more than two times magnitude and shorter rising time therefore the clearance height of the cap should be given considerable attention to balance the horizontal and vertical components of wave forces the increase of wave height induces a growth in horizontal wave force except for the fully submerged case the vertical wave force increases firstly but exhibits a decreasing tendency when the wave height exceeds 0 18 m due to overtopping waves the horizontal wave force contributes more to the moment than the vertical force on the cap pile group increases the vertical uplift force slightly when the bottom of the cap locates above swl it should be noted that the conclusions are drawn based on some assumptions firstly the waves used in this experiment are merely unidirectional waves and the incident direction of the wave is perpendicular to the front of the specimen the directionality of the specimen installation is worthy to be investigated experimentally to attain some more generalizable results secondly irregular waves which are more paralleled to the reality should also be considered and it is interesting to compare the results of regular waves with that of irregular waves furthermore the tiny air gap which was originally set up between pile and cap to exclude the force on the pile group from the measured force is found to influence the vertical wave forces significantly when s 0 some waterproof countermeasure such as the rubber socket scheme lan et al 2010 should be applied in the future to keep the water out of the gap and eliminate the experimental error acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of national natural science foundation of china grants no 51708455 and the

22152,elevated pile cap which transits the load from sea crossing bridge pylon to pile group is always close to the sea level and suffering from extreme wave loadings this paper describes a wave flume experimental program to investigate wave loads on the elevated pile cap of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges two specimen configurations including isolated cap and cap with pile group were set up with different clearance heights wave forces on the cap including horizontal and vertical force and moment were measured simultaneously under five nonlinear regular wave trains the effects of pile group clearance height and wave height on wave forces on the cap were investigated the experimental results show that the clearance height and wave height affect wave forces significantly the largest horizontal force occurs when the cap is fully submerged while the largest vertical force occurs when the bottom of the cap locates at still water level swl as the wave height increases the horizontal forces increase except for the fully submerged case and the vertical forces increase firstly but decrease when the wave height exceeds 0 18 m pile group increases the vertical uplift forces on the cap when the bottom of the cap locates above swl keywords wave force elevated pile cap sea crossing bridges wave flume experiment pile group clearance height 1 introduction with the advent of booming demand in ground transportation across straits and channels development of long span sea crossing bridge is being pursued to connect the mainland and islands all over the world pile group foundations are widely used to support contemporary long span sea crossing bridges such as china east sea bridge liu et al 2007 san francisco oakland bay bridge frick 2008 hangzhou bay bridge ye 2010 and pingtan rail cum road sea crossing bridge ti et al 2019 due to its good applicability in deep water site and complex seabed terrain however the elevated pile cap which transits the load from bridge pylon to pile group is always close to the sea level and suffering from extreme wave loadings ti et al 2018 in recent years catastrophes like hurricanes ivan in 2004 katrina in 2005 ike in 2008 indian ocean tsunami in 2004 tohoku tsunami in 2011 and typhoon haiyan in 2013 caused extensive damage to infrastructures and led a large number of coastal bridges to be damaged or collapsed douglass et al 2004 robertson et al 2007 stearns and padgett 2011 unjoh 2006 kosa 2011 akiyama et al 2013 mas et al 2015 considering the risk of structural failure of sea crossing bridges due to extreme waves ti et al 2019 wei et al 2019 it is hence important to estimate wave loads on the elevated pile cap for assessments of structure safety and construction feasibility of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges many experiments were carried out to investigate the wave force and pressure on offshore elevated structures lan et al 2006 carried out an experiment to investigate the vertical force on a slab of sea crossing bridge piers under regular and irregular waves ding et al 2008 designed an experiment to investigate unidirectional random wave slamming on a platform structure and effects of the wave direction cuomo et al 2009 conducted large scale flume experiments to investigate the dynamics of wave loading on coastal highway bridges based on the experimental results cuomo et al 2010 introduced a prediction formula for quasi static and breaking wave induced impact forces and overturning moments at vertical seawalls and breakwaters bradner et al 2010 performed laboratory tests on 1 5 scale reinforced concrete specimen of coastal bridge superstructure to investigate wave in deck loads under regular and random waves considering the flexibility and dynamic properties of the supporting bridge substructure wei et al 2013 conducted an experiment to study the dynamic response of bridge pile foundations submerged in water guo et al 2015 conducted a hydrodynamic experiment to investigate the wave force acting on the superstructures of coastal bridge and compared to douglass et al 2006 and model of aashto guidelines 2008 seiffert et al 2014 experimentally studied the horizontal and vertical forces acting on a two dimensional horizontal plate by solitary waves wave loads under different wave heights water depths as well as submergence depths and elevations above still water level were discussed in detail chuang et al 2018 investigated the effect of aeration and air compressibility on the wave slamming forces of offshore platform experimentally however these studies paid little attention to the elevated pile cap of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges moreover ti et al 2018 conducted a field measurement of random wave pressure on a real cofferdam for sea crossing bridge during typhoon and observed the secondary peaks in the pressure spectrums although the first order diffraction theory is commonly used to assess the wave force on the large scale marine structures such as elevated pile cap it is not sufficient to deal with waves with nonlinear kinematics and caps locates above the mean sea level molin 2002 the blocking and shading effect of pile group on the wave force of the pile cap has yet been well understood this study investigates the wave forces acting on the elevated cap of pile foundation for sea crossing bridges experimentally the 5th order stokes regular waves with five different heights and the associated lower bound of periods according to testing breaking limits were used to simulate the extreme waves two configurations of the specimen including isolated cap and cap with pile group were set up considering five clearance heights the following two objectives are set 1 to discern the characteristics of the time history of wave forces under different clearance and wave height conditions and 2 to understand effects of clearance height wave height and pile group on the wave loads acting on the pile cap 2 experimental setup 2 1 wave testing facilities the experiments of this study were conducted in the wave flume at southwest jiaotong university the flume is equipped with a piston type wave generating system the flume is 60 m in length 2 m in width and 1 8 m in height with side walls comprised of steel frames and toughened glass which provides a clear and wide visual range during the testing as shown in fig 1 the piston type wave maker designed by dalian university of technology is installed at the right end of the flume and able to generate various one dimensional wave environments such as linear and nonlinear regular wave irregular wave focused wave breaking wave etc in the process of making waves the motion file of the wave maker could be updated automatically according to the feedback from actual wave condition obtained by the data acquisition system installed in the flume until the expected waves are made the wave absorbing beach which is made of porous polymer material is positioned at the left end of the flume to absorb the wave energy and to reduce the wave reflection the testing bridge locates and operates on the stainless steel tracks placed at the top of the side walls in the following testing we define the cartesian coordinate of the flume as illustrated in fig 1 a x direction is the longitudinal direction from the wave maker to the wave absorbing beach y direction is the transverse direction pointing from in plane to out of plane against the flume and z direction is the vertical direction with positive direction upward four wave gauges were installed in the flume to measure the water surface elevations as illustrated in fig 1 b wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg 4 were installed at 10 cm left 10 cm right and 10 cm rear of the tested cap specimen respectively wg1 was installed at 2 m front of the wg4 to measure the wave conditions in the empty wave flume after the testing specimen was mounted in the flume wg1 was relocated at 40 cm front of the cap in order to measure the reflection of the wave induced by the specimen the sampling frequency of wave gauges was set to 100 hz that is sufficient to record the fluctuation of water surface through a subsequent comparison for validity the f t force and torque transducer was used to measure both force and torque acting on the specimen along x y and z directions although the sampling frequency of the transducer can be set as high as 7000 hz it was found in previous experiments tomiczek et al 2017 guo et al 2015 that a sampling frequency of 200 hz is sufficient to capture the impulsive forces and structural responses signals in this study a sampling frequency of 1000 hz which is higher than 200 hz was chosen here to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the measurements during wave impacts on the cap all experimental processes were recorded visually through hd camera with a sampling speed of 60 fps 2 2 configuration of tested specimen the design of the reduced scale specimens tested in this study was inspired by a pile cap of the group pile foundation for a sea crossing bridge that crosses pingtan strait in the southeast coast of china as shown in fig 2 a the prototype foundation is composed of twelve concrete piles and one concrete pile cap the pile cap is 36 m in length 24 m in width and 13 5 m in height elevated on the piles with diameter of 4 5 m fig 2 b shows a photo of the wave acting on an elevated pile cap under construction the reduced scale tested specimen shown in fig 3 a with dimensions inspired from the prototype foundation was composed of a group of 12 circular piles and a rectangular pile cap considering the flume dimensions and abilities of experimental facilities the tested specimen was designed according to the froude similarity using a 1 90 geometric scaling the tested specimen was made of acrylic material which has light weight and high rigidity the pile was manufactured with external diameter of 5 cm and thickness of 5 mm to ensure its strength the dimension of the cap specimen was a rigid box with length of 40 cm width of 26 67 cm and height of 15 cm in order to study the effect of the pile group on the wave force of the pile cap two configurations of tested specimen 1 the isolated pile cap and 2 the pile cap with pile group were set up for the isolated pile cap configuration the f t transducer was fastened firmly on the testing bridge through the lifting rod the tested cap specimen was suspended on the bottom of the f t transducer by the rigid alloy frame as illustrated in fig 3 b for the pile cap with pile group configuration the piles were fully fixed on the floor of the wave flume considering the major objective of this study is to address the wave force acting on the pile cap a tiny gap approximately 1 mm was kept between the bottom of the cap and the top of the pile group to exclude the wave force on the pile group from the force measured by the f t transducer 2 3 clearance height setting in the actual practice of the pile group foundation one important design parameter is the clearance height between the bottom of the cap and still water level swl five different clearance heights s were investigated experimentally for both configurations of tested specimen as shown in fig 4 s 2 and 4 cm were two cases that the cap bottom was above the swl s 0 cm referred to the case that the cap bottom coincided with the swl and the latter two cases s 7 5 cm and 15 cm related to the cases that the cap was partially and fully submerged in the water respectively in the experiment the depth of the water d in the flume was fixed at 0 9 m during the whole experimental study which was conducive to comparison among the cases with different clearance heights and wave conditions therefore the clearance height s was increased or decreased by changing the length of the lifting rod the pile consists of five segments to meet five different clearance height requirements upper segment was connected to the lower segment by acylic when the clearance height was changed the height of the pile group was changed accordingly by adding or removing the segments to keep the air gap between cap and pile group constant 2 4 experimental wave conditions in this study the water depth in the flume was set to be 0 9 m the wave parameters of ten regular extreme wave trains with wave height h from 0 04 m to 0 5 m were extracted through wave conditions calibration tests in the flume the period of the calibrated extreme wave train is close to the lower bound of period which keeps the wave as steep as possible and exactly unbroken in the flume table 1 lists the wave parameters of the calibrated extreme wave trains in the flume five extreme wave trains with wave height h from 0 09 m to 0 21 m with increments of 0 03 m in table 1 were selected as the experimental wave conditions for the following study 3 experimental procedure 3 1 validation of regular wave train in the flume according to the wave parameters listed in tables 1 and i e h gt 2 and d gt 2 all five selected extreme wave conditions were found in the range of the 5th order stokes wave theory le mehaute 1976 to verify the quality of the generated regular waves water surface elevations measured by wave gauge wg2 in the flume and the theoretical elevations calculated by the 5th order stokes wave theory were compared in fig 5 good agreements can be found between the measured and theoretical water elevation for all five experimental wave conditions which demonstrates that the wave maker generates satisfactory regular wave trains in the flume moreover water surface elevations measured by wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg4 are compared as well to verify the stability of the wave along the flume because wg2 and wg3 locate in the same section only wg2 is used it is clear from fig 6 that there are few deviations among them in terms of wave heights and periods neglecting the phase difference caused by the position it can be concluded from the results that the wave train was stable while it was propagating in the flume 3 2 natural vibration testing although the support system of the cap specimen is expected to be designed as rigid as possible the natural vibration of the tested specimens is still difficult to be eliminated especially when it vibrates along x direction under wave impact moreover the extending length of the lifting rod changes with the clearance height and causes the change of natural vibration frequency of the specimen it is hence necessary to obtain the first order natural vibration frequency f 1 of the specimen installed on the testing bridge with different clearance heights the free vibration testing was conducted as soon as the specimen was installed in the flume an impact hammer was used to excite the specimen along the x axis free vibration testing of the specimen was repeated three times to guarantee the accuracy of the testing results fig 7 shows time domain and frequency domain results of x direction reaction force record from the f t transducer for the cap specimen with s 4 cm natural frequencies of cap specimens with five different clearance heights are listed in table 2 with range from 10 32 to 15 71 hz it should be noted that the smaller natural frequency is associated to smaller clearance height it is because 1 smaller clearance height relates to longer free length of the lifting rod and 2 when s becomes negative the cap specimen is submerged in water which reduces the natural frequency of the specimen zhang et al 2019 3 3 post processing of measured data figs 8 and 9 present a sample of horizontal and vertical force on the isolated cap specimen with s 2 cm under wave conditions with h 0 15 m and t 1 15s slamming force can be clearly found in the time histories of both horizontal and vertical force according to the fourier spectrum the first peak has the highest power and its frequency equals to the frequency of the regular wave except the first peak there are still many higher order peaks of which the frequencies are integer n times the first peak frequency similar phenomenon was also observed and reported by guo et al 2015 in their study the nonlinear waves and higher order velocity potentials induced by incident and diffracted waves are the reasons for the n times frequency wave forces it is interesting to notice that the amplitude of the fourier spectrum of the horizontal wave force fx increases in the range from 12 44 hz to 15 48 hz that equals the average value of the natural frequency of the tested specimen highlighted by the dashed black frame in fig 8b this is mainly caused by the disturbance from structural natural vibration however the lower bound of the range is smaller than natural frequency of the tested specimen fig 10 presents the inundation of the cap during wave propagation by images the frequency we tested in table 2 is structural frequency under still water fig 10a however the extent of inundation changes significantly due to the fluctuation of water surface during the propagation of a wave train previous experiment carried out by wei et al 2013 has shown that structural natural frequency of the cap varies with the inundation volume of the cap the larger the inundation volume is the lower the structural frequency is it can explain why the lower bound of the frequency range for the structural vibration becomes smaller the low pass 3rd order butterworth filter is used to filter the raw data the comparison of filtered data and raw data of horizontal force is illustrated in fig 11 when the cutoff frequency is set to be the exact natural frequency of specimen given in table 2 significant noise still exists in the curve however most of the noise can be filtered when the lower bound of structural vibration range e g 12 44 hz according to fig 8 is used as the cutoff frequency therefore the lower bound of structural vibration range is used as the cutoff frequency to filter the raw data of the horizontal force in the following sections for the vertical force since the natural frequency of the specimen in z direction is pretty high and no obvious contribution of the high frequency component is observed the raw data is directly used for the following analysis 4 results and discussions in this section the horizontal and vertical wave forces on the cap specimen are analyzed to obtain more insight into the characteristics of wave forces and the effects of pile group clearance height and wave height on the wave loads acting on the cap are investigated based on the experimental data five incident wave trains times five clearance heights constitute 25 experimental working conditions for each configuration of tested specimen e g the isolated pile cap and the pile cap with pile group 4 1 horizontal wave forces on the cap in order to show and compare all clearance height conditions in one figure the time axis of the time history of the wave force was normalized by the wave period corresponding to the given wave height the time histories for all working conditions use the same phase the duration of the time history is four times wave period fig 12 shows the normalized time series of the horizontal wave forces fx on the isolated cap and the cap with pile group the positive and negative value refer to forward and backward force along x direction respectively compared with the horizontal wave forces on the isolated cap the force on the pile cap with pile group does not show obvious dissimilarity in the shape of the curve for s 0 the horizontal wave force arises abruptly reaching to the crest in a short time then diminishes below zero and finally returns to zero with increase of submerged depth of the cap for s 0 the slamming nature of the horizontal wave force disappears gradually and the peak value of the force become more stable compared with the former cases with s 0 fig 13 shows the process of the wave acting on the cap with pile group obtained by images for case with s 2 cm and under wave condition with h 0 18 m and t 1 25 s the front of incoming wave breaks due to the reflection of last wave wave breaking combined with wave run up before the front of the cap occurs when horizontal wave force climbs to the peak finally the wave passes away with the wave force settling down and the slamming process is over the horizontal backward wave force in this case is small because the cap is hung above swl so that it is the wave crest that mainly acts on the cap and the wave trough gets through below the cap without any contact 4 2 vertical wave forces on the cap fig 14 shows the normalized time series of vertical wave forces fz on the isolated cap and the cap with pile group positive and negative value in the figure mean the uplift and downward force along z direction respectively it can be seen that vertical wave forces on the cap with pile group varies more intensely than those of isolated cap specifically when the bottom of the cap locates at or above swl the shading and blocking of pile group aggravates the movement of water particles below the cap specimen provokes more complex state of trapped air and leads to the larger vertical force compared with the case without pile group the vertical wave forces on the cap with s 0 generally go through three phases initially slamming force occurs with considerable magnitude but exceptionally short duration followed by quasi static uplift force dwindling down in a relatively long duration secondary peak appears sometimes and depends on the clearance height of the cap finally the vertical downward force occurs and turns to zero when the waves depart from the cap this three phase mode of vertical wave in deck force has been presented in the previous experiments reported by ren and wang 2003 cuomo et al 2007 and ren et al 2016 the vertical uplift force is significantly larger than the downward force when the bottom of the cap locates at or above swl however the vertical downward forces increase with the increase of the submerged depth and become larger than uplift forces when s 7 5 and 15 cm fig 15 shows the process of the wave acting on the cap for case with s 2 cm and s 15 cm compared fig 15 a with fig 13 b it can be found that the vertical wave force reaches its crest earlier than the horizontal wave force according to fig 15 b the crest of the wave has been higher than the top of the cap and the wave crest climbed over the top of the cap with a lot of water overtopping it which caused larger vertical downward force it can be found from figs 12 and 14 show that the vertical uplift force is larger than the horizontal forward force for elevated conditions while the vertical uplift force turns smaller than the horizontal forward force for submerged conditions 4 3 effect of pile group the horizontal vertical forces and moment on the pile cap under regular wave trains were measured in time domain by f t transducer simultaneously because the time history of wave force includes several crest and trough values in order to investigate different effects on the wave force acting on the cap the following representative values of the wave forces are defined for each working condition horizontal forward force positive horizontal backward force negative vertical uplift force positive and vertical downward force negative the representative value of horizontal forward force and backward force is equal to the mean value of the crest and trough values in the time history of horizontal wave force respectively likewise the representative value of vertical uplift force and vertical downward force is equal to the mean value of the crest and trough values in the time history of vertical wave force respectively comparison of four representative values of horizontal and vertical wave forces between the two configurations of specimens is illustrated in fig 16 because the wave used in the test is nonlinear the positive and the negative representative values are not equal therefore there are four points for each working condition and a total of 100 points for 25 working conditions without repeatability testing data it can be seen from fig 16 that the horizontal force of both specimens has negligible inequalities while the vertical uplift force of the cap with pile group is slightly larger than that of the isolated cap it is because pile group blocks the water particles passing under the cap and makes some of the forward moving particles turn into upward moving and slam on the bottom of the cap in order to understand the contribution of horizontal and vertical force to the moment as illustrated in fig 17 a the moment my is described as a function of horizontal force fx and vertical force fz by eq 1 considering the absolute value of the peak moment positive is much greater than that of the trough moment negative only the largest peak moment was selected for one working condition the horizontal and vertical wave force components which occur simultaneously with the largest moment were then extracted fig 17 b depicts three components of force on the isolated cap and the cap with pile group in the three dimensional 3d coordinates there are 25 points for each configuration of the specimen space plane was used to fit the data by least square method it is clear that the horizontal wave force contributes far more to the moment than the vertical wave force regardless of the specimen configuration the difference in the three components of force between two configurations of specimen are inconspicuous 1 m y f z x 0 f x l 0 z 0 4 4 effect of clearance height the standard deviation of the representative values of wave forces are calculated according to the experimental data to provide information about the repeatability of the data fig 18 illustrates the representative values and error bar of the wave forces on the cap with pile group varying with clearance heights because the incident wave in the study is regular and stable the deviation of the data is small for most of the working conditions it is clear from fig 18 a that both horizontal forward and backward wave forces decrease with increase of clearance height and the forward forces under all wave conditions occur when the cap is fully submerged in water it is because larger inundation area of the cap receives more pulling force during the propagation of wave while the vertical uplift force firstly increases until the case with the bottom of the cap located at swl then decreases with increasing clearance height according to fig 18 b in other words the largest vertical uplift force occurs when the clearance height is zero this phenomenon has also been found in previous studies park et al 2017 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 seiffert et al 2015 the vertical downward force is almost constant under either s 0 or s 0 the absolute value of the force for s 0 is larger than that for s 0 contrary to the uplift force the absolute value of downward force is small for the clearance height of s 0 it should be noted that the tiny air gap in this study fig 3 influences the vertical wave force especially for setup of s 0 cm two cfd models were established to evaluate the effect of air gap on the wave forces of the pile cap one is that the pile group is firmly attached to the cap without any air gap and the other one includes a tiny air gap of 0 001 m between cap and pile refined grid size k ω turbulent model and the volume of fluid method vof are adopted according to the cfd simulations the air gap increases the peak value and causes a 15 positive mean shift of the vertical wave force on the cap with s 0 this is because the water particles entrapped inside the air gap when the wave crest passed through the cap with s 0 the water inside the gap increases not only the bottom wetted area of the cap but also the distribution of uplift pressure and hence gives birth to the increase and mean shift of vertical wave forces therefore the value of vertical uplift force for s 0 could be overestimated due to the existence of air gap 4 5 effect of wave height fig 19 presents the representative values and error bar of the wave forces on the cap with pile group as a function of wave heights fig 19 a indicates that the horizontal forward force increases nearly linearly with increasing wave height when the bottom of the cap locates at or above water while the horizontal backward force varies slowly as the wave height increases from 0 09 m to 0 15 m and increases distinctly as wave height increases from 0 15 m to 0 21 m in this study larger wave has longer wave length and can diffract around the cap much easier the movement of water particle in the opposite direction induces apparent horizontal backward force nevertheless both absolute values of horizontal forward and backward wave forces firstly increase then decrease with the increase of wave height for clearance height of 15 cm with the largest value occurring under wave height of 0 15 m it is because the water particle of larger wave is much easier to pass above the cap than that of smaller wave fig 19 b shows that the vertical uplift force increases with an increment in wave height from 0 09 m to 0 18 m but decreases when the wave height is up to 0 21 m because large wave would overtop the top of the cap and diminish the vertical uplift force as s 0 the variation of vertical downward force is not obvious under various wave heights however when the cap is submerged in water the vertical downward force is significantly affected by the wave height and the wave with large height would induce large vertical downward force 5 conclusions this paper presents an experimental program of extreme wave forces on the elevated pile cap of pile group foundation for sea crossing bridge the reduced scale pile cap specimens including the isolated cap and pile cap with pile group were set up in the wave flume the results are presented and discussed as a function of clearance height wave height and pile group the wave force on the cap is a function of both clearance height and wave height the largest horizontal wave force occurs when the cap is fully submerged while the largest vertical uplift force occurs when the bottom of the cap locates at swl higher clearance height reduces the horizontal wave force but induces larger vertical wave force on the cap wave slamming force occurs when the bottom of the cap locates above swl compared with horizontal slamming force the vertical slamming force has more than two times magnitude and shorter rising time therefore the clearance height of the cap should be given considerable attention to balance the horizontal and vertical components of wave forces the increase of wave height induces a growth in horizontal wave force except for the fully submerged case the vertical wave force increases firstly but exhibits a decreasing tendency when the wave height exceeds 0 18 m due to overtopping waves the horizontal wave force contributes more to the moment than the vertical force on the cap pile group increases the vertical uplift force slightly when the bottom of the cap locates above swl it should be noted that the conclusions are drawn based on some assumptions firstly the waves used in this experiment are merely unidirectional waves and the incident direction of the wave is perpendicular to the front of the specimen the directionality of the specimen installation is worthy to be investigated experimentally to attain some more generalizable results secondly irregular waves which are more paralleled to the reality should also be considered and it is interesting to compare the results of regular waves with that of irregular waves furthermore the tiny air gap which was originally set up between pile and cap to exclude the force on the pile group from the measured force is found to influence the vertical wave forces significantly when s 0 some waterproof countermeasure such as the rubber socket scheme lan et al 2010 should be applied in the future to keep the water out of the gap and eliminate the experimental error acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of national natural science foundation of china grants no 51708455 and the

22153,it is widely suggested that step gains in wave energy converter power capture performance must be realized to achieve economic viability one method of fulfilling power capture gains is to invoke resonant conditions between the device and the incoming ocean wave however a general method that can establish the prerequisites for achieving resonant conditions in an arbitrarily complex wave energy converter architecture is nonexistent in this work we present an analytical procedure built on the mechanical circuit framework for identifying the resonant conditions of an arbitrarily complex wave energy converter architecture to demonstrate the procedure we select three complex two body point absorber devices as a case study each with a geometry controllable feature set through invoking resonant conditions in each architecture we illustrate how the choice of topology has significant influence on the power capture characteristics of the wec device selecting the highest performing

compelling case as a potential renewable energy resource however wave energy converter wec devices have yet to display commercial viability as compared to alternative renewable energy sources astariz and iglesias 2015 at present wec devices do not capture sufficient power from the wave resource to offset the costs of operating offshore and thus are not economically viable babarit 2017 as expressed by weber the power capture capacity of a wec device is influenced by choices largely made early in the conceptual design stage of a development program weber 2012 the traditional conceptual development process involves 1 choosing a device class based on operating principle falcão 2010 cruz 2008 2 defining the geometry and inertial characteristics of the floating body based on heuristics and logistical constraints and 3 coupling this body to a power take off pto unit used to convert the kinetic energy of the wave induced body into a useful form in this process the hydrodynamics and inertial properties of the body are adopted as constraints whereas the pto is considered a configurable unit in this traditional view power capture maximization by the pto requires implementing the complex conjugate nebel 1992 pto force control conditions based on a set mechanical impedance of the wec implementation of complex conjugate control requires a multi functional resistive reactive pto capable of optimally setting the 1 pto reactance x f s 1 in fig 1 a to inject reactive power back into the body altering its relative phase with respect to the incoming wave excitation force to achieve optimal phase control and 2 pto resistance r p t o to achieve optimal amplitude control and maximize power capture through modulating the body motion falnes 2002 for the specific case of a single body point absorber sbpa wec architecture the optimal settings for these sub functions to maximize power capture are well understood falnes 2002 however an sbpa with a resistive reactive pto represented by fig 1a is only one possible sbpa architecture for realizing maximum power for example consider the mechanical schematics in fig 1b and fig 1c for which the pto is represented as a solely resistive mechanical damper element clearly neither pto contains a reactive element in these architectures and thus cannot implement complex conjugate pto force control however both wec architectures contain feature sets external to the pto represented as reactive force sources which can inject the necessary reactive power to enable optimal phase control and hence achieve the same power capture performance this distinction between the point absorber architectures in fig 1 may appear as mere semantics in the sbpa as the differences originate from the choice to separate the reactive element from the pto while all three architectures remain topologically equivalent with more complex wec architectures such as the two body self reacting point absorber srpa there are a variety of locations where the reactive element may be placed leading to significant topological differences between architectures fig 2 pictorially represents three different srpa architectures 1 fig 2a labelled arch1 is the conventional srpa containing a traditional resistive reactive pto 2 fig 2b labelled arch2 contains a resistive pto with an independent but parallel reactive force source and 3 fig 2c labelled arch3 contains a resistive pto with a reactively controlled spar there is a strong motivation to determine the optimal power capture performance of complex wec architectures such as arch2 and arch3 and to define the optimal conditions on the force sources x f s 2 o p t x f s 3 o p t leading to optimal performance with the emergence of new technologies based on these architectures for example srpas interfaced with 1 liang s liang et al 2017 mechanical motion rectifier mmr technology and 2 gradowski s gradowski et al 2017 hydrodynamic negative spring are generically represented by arch2 and arch3 respectively we believe that such contemporary wec devices are only the tip of the iceberg as the wec design space evolves to consider greater topological complexity in pursuit of step increases in power capture capacity to determine the performance merits of these complex alternative wec architectures at the conceptual stage of development we need a means to establish equations outlining both the conditions on the reactive force source required to implement optimal phase control and the subsequent power capture potential the traditional view of a pto with a reactive feature set we believe emerged as the result of the perception that a wec device possessed unchangeable hydrodynamic and inertial parameters i e no geometry control feature implemented within the wec this view promotes the proposition of implementing the optimal phase control function as an internal feature of the pto allowing for the determination of the optimal force source reactance x f s 1 o p t in arch1 to determine the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t in more complex wec architectures such as arch3 we must move beyond this traditional resistive reactive pto paradigm to accomplish this a more generalized view of phase control is required for which we choose to revert to the original works of mei 1976 evans 1976 and falnes 2002 in their works the phase control condition was originally identified as simply the state of achieving system resonance with this generalized interpretation of phase control the equations sought above can be determined analytically if the complex wec architectures are first transformed into the wec canonical form bubbar et al 2018 once in canonical form constraints enforcing system resonance are imposed on the canonical form leading to the optimal force source reactance once the device is in resonance one can apply optimal pto damping and thus determine maximum power capture although the importance of enforcing resonant conditions with the incoming waves is clear analytical expressions guiding wec developers in their technology development processes do not exist except for very simple wec architectures e g sbpas in this work we demonstrate through a case study the transformation of the three srpa architectures in fig 2 arch1 arch2 and arch3 into the canonical form and then apply analytical constraints to invoke system resonance in doing so we will show that the choice of injecting reactance into arch3 delivers superior performance both in terms of level of power capture and in the minimization of the relative travel between the float and spar the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 we briefly review how a complex wec architecture is transformed into canonical form through applying the process outlined by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 followed by examining the definition of wec resonance in this context in section 3 we transform arch1 arch2 and arch3 into the canonical form enforce the resonant condition and extract the optimal force source reactances x f s 1 o p t x f s 2 o p t and x f s 3 o p t in doing so we generate analytical constraints used to guide technology design that apply across all configurations in the architectures considered in section 4 we perform a numerical analysis to compare the power capture performance and system dynamic responses of five specific configurations config1 5 generated based on arch1 arch2 and arch3 using experimentally validated device parameters from a 1 25th scale model published by beatty et al 2015 finally in section 5 having selected a single configuration for further analysis we demonstrate how the development process introduced in this work enables technology innovation by substituting the reactive force source with a sub circuit of mechanical machinery components incorporating a unique technology the inerter encased within the confines of the spar we explore the potential of inerter technology for enabling resonant control of our configuration under realistic physical design constraints we conclude our case study by illustrating a hierarchy describing how incremental levels of wec control complexity relate to improving the resulting power capture performance our motivation is to present wec developers with choices and the associated trade offs to consider during the conceptual design phase of an srpa project leading to improved power capture potential 2 theory 2 1 frequency domain modelling of wecs using mechanical circuits restricting oneself to a linear hydrodynamics regime wec devices are initially considered as linear underdamped mechanical vibration systems comprised of masses springs and dampers falnes 2002 specific arrangements of these mechanical elements define a wec architecture bubbar et al 2018 as described by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 all wec architectures may be represented in topological form as a mechanical circuit with mechanical impedance elements interfaced at common nodes harris et al 1962 these linear vibration systems are energized via a periodic sinusoidal external wave excitation force represented as a force source resulting in body motion the pto represented as a configurable impedance block captures energy when the wave induced bodies do work against a reaction force within that block characterized as a resistive element once a wec architecture is represented as a mechanical circuit the system topology may be simplified by substituting the mechanical impedance constitutive equations for each mechanical element and applying network synthesis methods harris et al 1962 to determine the canonical form bubbar et al 2018 the canonical form is an equivalent mechanical circuit representing the simplest wec architecture the sbpa once in canonical form system kinematic and dynamic variables such as eq 3 eq 5 can be calculated for any given monochromatic incident wave since a wave elevation time series can be approximated by a polychromatic sea state decomposed into monochromatic components the frequency domain underpins the analysis of wec performance we note any single mechanical impedance block is a complex quantity generically represented as the sum of resistive r and reactive x parameters as in eq 1 1 z r i x 2 2 resonance of the sbpa architecture for a heaving sbpa architecture the power capture is maximized when both system resonance is achieved and the pto resistance is optimally set to enforce system resonance through an analytical means a mathematical definition of the resonant condition consistent with the mechanical impedance formulation must be determined falnes 2002 proposed an equation inspired from electronic circuit theory in his proposition a functional boundary was defined to separate the pto impedance z p t o from the remaining lumped sbpa impedance or intrinsic impedance z i illustrated by the mechanical circuit in fig 3 b from this functional separation falnes identified that the natural frequency of the remaining sbpa wec architecture is determined by evaluating eq 2 cf 5 324 falnes 2002 2 ℑ m z i 0 for a heaving sbpa with constant geometry and inertia and with an amplitude controlled pto resonance only occurs when the incoming wave excitation frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the floating body albeit off resonance conditions may demonstrate similar performance for all other wave excitation frequencies resonance is not achieved without intervention clearly invoking resonance across a bandwidth of operating frequencies is desired to maximize power capture thus a feature set independent from the pto i e within the definition of z i capable of injecting the appropriate reactance into the remaining system to satisfy eq 2 would achieve the desired result in choosing to represent the sbpa architecture using a resistive pto and a reactive force source external to the pto the resonance control problem may be classified as a subset of geometry control first introduced by price price et al 2009 in fig 3a we observe a mechanical circuit of the sbpa architecture schematically represented in fig 1b with a reactive force source f ˆ f s 2 external to the pto once system resonance is invoked maximizing the power captured by the resistive pto requires applying the impedance matching criteria falnes 2002 to set r p t o according to eq 3 when r p t o r p t o o p t amplitude control is invoked by the pto and the power captured is defined by eq 4 with the complex amplitude of the body velocity defined by eq 5 falnes 2002 3 r p t o o p t z i 4 p u m a x a c f ˆ p t o c l a m p 2 4 ℜ e z i z i 5 u ˆ r f ˆ p t o c l a m p z i z i in sbpas resonance is the condition in which the wave excitation force is in phase with the float velocity this description is visually intuitive and thus analytical design guidance is relatively straightforward to implement in linear monochromatic wec models as wec architecture complexity increases and more bodies and components are considered in a conceptual design e g srpas this visual intuition becomes clouded as a multi body system the motion of the complex wec architecture is described in terms of its natural modes of vibration it is unclear how the shape of each vibration mode influences power capture as such wec developers resort to specifying design parameters early in the design process this locks focus onto a specific wec configuration bubbar et al 2018 but allows for implementation of numerical optimization routines to search for the resonant conditions unfortunately the insights obtained from these numerical optimizations cannot be generalized across configurations and wec developers are left resorting to a trial and error process as configurations evolve there is therefore an acute need for extending the analytical methods for evaluating the resonant conditions available to sbpas to more complex wec architectures 2 3 sbpa as the wec canonical form the srpa budal 1985 with its pto interfaced between two wave activated bodies was a natural development on the sbpa as the two body architecture eliminated the need for an ocean floor reference however this introduced a new challenge as analytical equations describing the maximum power capture conditions were unknown falnes provided a path forward by developing an ingenious analytical interpretation of the impedance matching problem falnes applied a mechanical thévenin thévenin 1883 falnes 1999 equivalency transformation and represented the srpa wec architecture as a phenomenological equivalent sbpa the canonical form in fig 1b with an equivalent single body intrinsic impedance wave excitation force and single body velocity falnes 1999 in this formulation the equivalent wave excitation force f ˆ p t o c l a m p is the force experienced across the pto of the srpa when the pto rigidly secures the float to the spar whereas the equivalent single body velocity u ˆ r is the relative velocity measured across the pto with this formulation falnes exposed an important insight resonant conditions are invoked in the srpa architecture when f ˆ p t o c l a m p is in phase with u ˆ r which does not necessarily coincide with the resonant conditions of either of the individual bodies falnes 1999 since thévenin s theorem is invariant to topological complexity falnes impedance matching strategy in the srpa architecture has been generalized by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 for wec architectures of arbitrary complexity through the use of the mechanical circuit framework harris et al 1962 as the canonical form is simply the representation of a complex wec architecture as an equivalent sbpa architecture the resonant condition s for the complex wec architecture may be determined through substituting z i isolated from the canonical form into falnes well established analytical condition eq 2 for resonance in sbpas in this formulation both f ˆ p t o c l a m p and z i isolated from the canonical form are now functions of the physical parameters of the complex wec architecture in addition the power capture subject to optimal pto damping is determined by eq 4 and the relative complex velocity amplitude between the float and spar as measured across the pto is determined by eq 5 in this work we will demonstrate the derivation of z i and f ˆ p t o c l a m p for arch1 arch2 and arch3 enforce both the optimal resonant condition eq 2 and amplitude pto force control eq 3 and establish conditions on the generic force sources x f s 1 x f s 2 x f s 3 that ensure resonant control of our complex wec architectures 3 establishing resonant conditions in srpas in this section we consider three complex srpa wec architectures arch1 arch2 and arch3 illustrated in fig 2 all capable of implementing resonant control for simplifying the ensuing algebra we choose an srpa for which the coupled radiation forces are known to be negligible cf appendix e beatty 2015 each architecture is configured with one reactive force source represented by the complex force amplitude f ˆ f s n with n 1 2 3 signifying the indices for the architecture number considered this force source generates an unbounded monochromatic force signal at the frequency of the incoming ocean wave the force sources f ˆ f s 1 and f ˆ f s 2 are proportional to the relative complex velocity amplitude difference u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 between the float and spar in their respective architectures and described mathematically by eq 6 whereas the force source in arch3 f ˆ f s 3 is proportional to the absolute complex velocity amplitude of the spar as in eq 7 6 f ˆ f s n z f s n u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 n 1 2 7 f ˆ f s 3 z f s 3 u ˆ 2 as introduced by korde 1999 we characterize the resulting force by the impedance in eq 8 which is controlled by the force source reactance x f s n 8 z f s n i x f s n n 1 2 3 in this section we will derive x f s n o p t the force source reactance which results in resonant control of arch1 arch2 and arch3 to derive these equations we must first determine analytical expressions of z i for arch1 arch2 and arch3 we first explore arch2 and arch1 in section 3 1 and section 3 2 respectively noting that while they are topologically equivalent they are subtly distinct based on the definition of the pto boundary as discussed in section 1 for arch1 with x f s 1 defined internal to the pto we apply the complex conjugate conditions verbatim whereas for arch2 with x f s 2 defined external to the pto we apply the resonant control law in eq 2 as we will demonstrate in section 4 1 the choice of defining x f s 1 internal to the pto boundary invalidates eq 2 as a constraint equation to enforce system resonance although this result has little impact on determining x f s 1 o p t as the complex conjugate impedance matching conditions may be applied in lieu of eq 2 to solve for x f s 1 o p t the choice of defining the pto boundary does have a significant impact on how x f s 3 o p t is determined in arch3 consequently next we explore arch3 which is topologically represented by a reactive force source x f s 3 interfaced between the spar and ocean floor in arch3 the spar is seen as a variable reactance subsystem in section 3 2 we derive the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t for enacting resonant control of arch3 3 1 the arch2 canonical form to determine the canonical form of arch2 we execute the procedure outlined by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 step 1 comprises generating the mechanical circuit representing arch2 as in fig 4 a step 2 involves simplifying this mechanical circuit through the application of parallel and series circuit transformations harris et al 1962 resulting in fig 4b for which we define two new lumped impedance terms z e q 1 and z e q 2 in eq 9 eq 10 representing the equivalent float and spar impedances respectively we explicitly note that in applying our circuit simplifications z f s 2 is contained outside the definitions of either z e q 1 or z e q 2 9 z e q 1 z m 1 z a 11 z b 11 z k 1 z m 1 z a 11 z b 11 z k 1 10 z e q 2 z m 2 z a 22 z b 22 z k 2 z m 2 z a 22 z b 22 z k 2 with the simplified circuit of arch2 established in step 3 we analytically determine two parameters inherent to this architecture u ˆ r f r e e a case of the relative velocity between the float and spar when the pto resistance is eliminated and f ˆ p t o c l a m p a case of a pto clamped through force developed when the pto rigidly secures the float to the spar to determine these parameters we represent these cases by augmenting the mechanical circuit of fig 4b with the two new circuits in fig 5 upon establishing the analytical equations for u ˆ r f r e e in section 3 1 1 and f ˆ p t o c l a m p in section 3 1 2 we continue with step 4 by using these expressions to determine z i in section 3 1 3 finally in step 5 we substitute z i into eq 2 and isolate the optimal force source impedance x f s 2 o p t to enforce the system resonance condition in section 3 1 4 3 1 1 free relative velocity difference to determine u ˆ r f r e e we apply kirchhoff s node law on each node in fig 5a resulting in eq 11 eq 12 11 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 1 u ˆ 1 f r e e z f s 2 u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e n o d e 1 12 f ˆ e x 2 z e q 2 u ˆ 2 f r e e z f s 2 u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e n o d e 2 for which we can solve for u ˆ r f r e e as in eq 13 13 u ˆ r f r e e u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e f ˆ e x 2 z e q 1 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 z f s 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 3 1 2 pto clamped through force to determine f ˆ p t o c l a m p we analyze the circuit in fig 5b under the knowledge that both the float and spar are constrained to move together and hence there is no relative motion across the pto leading to eq 14 14 u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 u ˆ c l a m p we also note that all the force between nodes 1 and 2 passes through the pto and thus applying kirchhoff s node law on each node results in eq 15 eq 16 15 f ˆ e x 1 f ˆ p t o c

in 17 f ˆ p t o c l a m p f ˆ e x 1 z e q 2 f ˆ e x 2 z e q 1 z e q 1 z e q 2 3 1 3 equivalent single body intrinsic impedance the equivalent single body intrinsic impedance of the canonical form is determined to be harris et al 1962 18 z i f ˆ p t o c l a m p u ˆ r f r e e z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 z f s 2 fig 4c depicts the ensuing circuit representation of the wec canonical form the equivalent wave excitation force in parallel with both the single body intrinsic impedance and the resistive pto load we now utilize eq 18 to establish conditions on our force source for enabling resonant control on arch2 3 1 4 determining the force source reactance to enable system resonance having derived z i in eq 18 for arch2 we substitute eq 18 into eq 2 to enforce the optimal resonant condition and isolate the optimal force source reactance as in eq 19 19 x f s 2 o p t ℑ m z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 for arch2 the combination of setting the force source reactance by enforcing eq 19 while simultaneously setting the pto resistance according to eq 3 will maximize the power captured for this architecture 3 2 the arch1 canonical form in section 3 we identified arch1 and arch2 as representing the same topology with the distinction that arch1 contains a resistive reactive pto and thus the reactive force source f ˆ f s 1 is defined within the boundary of the pto as such the equivalent float and spar impedances for arch1 and arch2 are defined by eq 9 and eq 10 respectively in his seminal work on srpas falnes derived the intrinsic impedance of the canonical form of arch1 with the coupled radiation forces set to zero as in eq 20 cf 24 falnes 1999 20 z i z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 to determine the optimal force source reactance x f s 1 o p t on arch1 the complex conjugate pto force control conditions must be applied leading to the optimal settings for the pto resistance and reactance set as in eq 21 and eq 22 21 r p t o o p t ℜ e z i 22 x f s 1 o p t ℑ m z i in comparing eq 22 from arch1 with eq 19 from arch2 it is clear that x f s 1 o p t x f s 2 o p t and thus as expected both arch1 and arch2 operate under the same resonant control state further comparing eq 21 with eq 3 while eq 2 is enforced ensures that the pto resistances are also equivalent we can therefore conclude arch2 operating with x f s 2 set to eq 19 with r p t o set to eq 3 functions equivalently to arch1 operating under complex conjugate pto force control this is important as it demonstrates that as expected the resonant control conditions for both arch1 and arch2 were consistent with one another however the constraint equation applied to determine the result eq 22 or eq 2 respectively differed depending on how we defined the pto boundary this point may appear as a semantic for arch2 but is of grave importance to determining the resonant control condition in arch3 for a full derivation of the optimal pto settings for arch1 using the mechanical circuit framework please consult bubbar et al cf section 3 1 bubbar et al 2018 3 3 the arch3 canonical form bubbar et al s process is once again executed on arch3 to determine the canonical form parameters u ˆ r f r e e f ˆ p t o c l a m p and z i followed by enforcing the resonant control law in eq 2 to determine the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t in step 1 the mechanical circuit is generated in fig 6 a and simplified in step 2 resulting in fig 6b with new lumped impedance terms eq 23 and eq 24 defined for z e q 1 and z e q 2 respectively we note in this case after applying our circuit simplifications z f s 3 is contained within the definition of z e q 2 next u ˆ r f r e e f ˆ p t o c l a m p and z i are determined using the augmented mechanical circuits in fig 7 with details contained in sections 3 3 1 3 3 3 respectively finally the optimal resonant condition is determined by substituting z i into eq 2 to isolate x f s 3 o p t as described in section 3 3 4 3 3 1 free relative velocity difference to determine u ˆ r f r e e we apply kirchhoff s node law on each node in fig 7a resulting in eq 25 eq 26 25 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 1 u ˆ 1 f r e e n o d e 1 26 f ˆ e x 2 z e q 2 u ˆ 2 f r e e n o d e 2 for which we can solve for u ˆ r f r e e as 27 u ˆ r f r e e u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e f ˆ e x 2 z e q 1 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 3 3 2 pto clamped through force to determine f ˆ p t o c l a m p we analyze the circuit in fig 7b and recognize that all the force between nodes 1 and 2 pass through the pto as such f ˆ p t o c l a m p mirrors the result of eq 17 from section 3 1 2 3 3 3 equivalent single body intrinsic impedance the equivalent single body intrinsic impedance is determined as eq 28 with the canonical form depicted in fig 6c 28 z i f ˆ p t o c l a m p u ˆ r f r e e z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 we now utilize eq 28 to establish conditions on our force source for enabling resonant control in arch3 3 3 4 determining the force source reactance to enable system resonance having derived z i for arch3 we once again apply the optimal resonant condition of eq 2 to accomplish this we first substitute the generic complex form z e q n r e q n i x e q n n 1 2 into eq 28 yielding an expression for z i based on the equivalent resistances and reactances of the float n 1 and spar n 2 we then substitute this expression of z i into eq 2 yielding a quadratic polynomial expression in x e q 2 described by eq 29 29 x e q 1 x e q 2 2 r e q 1 2 x e q 1 2 x e q 2 r e q 2 2 x e q 1 r e q 1 r e q 2 2 x e q 1 x e q 2 2 0 provided r e q 1 r e q 2 and x e q 1 x e q 2 we can solve for x e q 2 o p t the spar reactance required for system resonance by applying the quadratic equation to the numerator of eq 29 yielding the two solutions in eq 30 these solutions are important as they represent design insight on how system resonance is achieved in arch3 through manipulating the spar reactance alone 30 x e q 2 o p t 1 2 r e q 1 2 x e q 1 2 r e q 1 2 x e q 1 2 2 4 x e q 1 r e q 2 2 x e q 1 2 x e q 1 we note that all variables in eq 30 can be recovered by applying the analytical real and imaginary operations outlined in eq 31 conversely if we had assumed the float has a variable reactance feature set instead of the spar the optimal float impedance could be determined by rearranging the numerator in eq 29 as a polynomial in x e q 1 and solving for x e q 1 o p t leading to a symmetrical equation to eq 30 where eq 2 is substituted for eq 1 and vise versa 31 r e q 1 ℜ e eq 23 x e q 1 ℑ m eq 23 r e q 2 ℜ e eq 24 to determine the optimal force source reactance we lump all the hydrodynamics and inertial impedances of the spar into the term z m h 2 as in eq 32 then isolate x f s 3 in eq 24 and substitute eq 30 into this expression yielding eq 33 32 z m h 2 z m 2 z a 22 z b 22 z k 2 33 x f s 3 o p t 1 2 x e q 2 o p t 1 2 ℑ m z m h 2 for arch3 enforcing eq 30 through setting x f s 3 x f s 3 o p t 1 2 in eq 33 will give rise to two different system resonance states in the canonical form as there are two system resonance states in arch3 it follows that a comparative analysis must be performed having derived the optimal force source reactances to enable system resonance the outstanding question at this point is what if any are the performance differences of arch2 and arch3 when operating under system resonant conditions with the pto resistance set optimally we answer this question in the next section 4 numerical examples of wec configurations the focus of this section is to demonstrate how the analytical constraints defining the optimal force source reactances determined in section 3 can be used to enforce the resonant conditions on each architecture considered we achieve this through performing a comparative numerical analysis using physical parameters from an experimentally verified srpa 1 25th froude scaled model resembling a wavebob device published by beatty et al and detailed in appendix a cf wec a beatty et al 2015 beatty 2015 we choose beatty et al s model as their experimental work has been validated through enduring an academic peer review process to perform this comparative analysis a series of configurations are defined that are built on the parameters extracted from beatty et al s single experimental model to ensure equitable comparisons are based on performance each of the configurations considered have the same 1 hydrodynamic coefficients the sizes and shapes of components do not change and 2 total mass we note at this stage of the analysis the reactive force source is represented conceptually without a physical embodiment an embodied design of the reactive force source will be specified in section 5 2 to perform this comparative analysis we first reproduce the same two srpa wec configurations originally published by beatty et al based on their experimental results we note both of these configurations are based upon arch1 with the only distinguishing difference being the pto force control mode config1 is amplitude controlled while config2 is complex conjugate controlled config1 and config2 serve as comparative baselines as neither contain a geometry control feature set external to the pto a third configuration config3 is generated based on arch2 of fig 2b while the last two configurations config4 and config5 are generated based on each of the resonant states derived for arch3 of fig 2c numerical models of all config1 5 are constructed by substituting beatty et al s model parameters verbatim into the equation sets detailed in table 1 in the subsequent sections we explore the comparative performance of these configurations section 4 1 focuses on confirming whether optimal phase control is achieved for each configuration section 4 2 presents the power capture performance of each of these configurations detailing the source of differences and establishing config5 as the superior performing configuration 4 1 was optimal phase control achieved in section 1 we made the conscious decision to revert to an earlier interpretation of the optimal phase control problem as enforcing the state of system resonance allowing for the derivation of the generalized resonant conditions for the complex srpa wec architectures considered in this work in this section we demonstrate using our numerical examples that optimal phase control is achieved when the resonant conditions are enforced in equation form this requires that eq 34 falnes 1999 is satisfied at each excitation frequency considered 34 γ ω f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω u ˆ r ω 0 we perform a comparative analysis by evaluating the left hand side of eq 34 for each of the configurations detailed in table 1 and plot the results versus wave excitation frequency in fig 8 a in observing fig 8a all the configurations except config1 adhere to the constraint outlined in eq 34 and are thus operating under optimal phase control as anticipated config1 cannot satisfy eq 34 at all wave excitation frequencies as the pto is purely resistive and there is no reactive feature set present to enable system resonance across the frequency band to expose the relationship between the optimal phase control condition in eq 34 and the resonant control law presented in eq 2 we plot the intrinsic reactance of the canonical form x i ω as a function of wave excitation frequency in fig 8b using the corresponding form of z i specified in table 1 in fig 8b we note config3 5 all with geometry control feature sets external to the pto adhere to eq 2 while config1 2 do not the peculiar observation of config2 not adhering to the resonant control law of eq 2 yet clearly enacting optimal phase control requires further elaboration and an explanation follows in specifying the topological layout of config2 based on arch1 the pto boundary is defined as observed in table 1 for which z p t o contains both r p t o and x f s 1 upon constructing the canonical form thévenin s theorem is applied across the nodes of z p t o resulting in x f s 1 the quantity responsible for enforcing eq 34 residing outside the definition of z i in contrast in arch2 and arch3 for which config3 5 are based on the pto boundary as observed in the schematics of table 1 contains r p t o only whereby thévenin s theorem is applied across necessitating that z i in eq 18 contains x f s 2 in this sense x f s 2 is separate from the pto while still being responsible for satisfying eq 2 i e ℑ m z i 0 via implementing eq 19 as demonstrated in section 3 2 arch1 and arch2 are topologically equivalent requiring the same conditions on the pto resistance and force source reactance for enabling system resonance however in arch1 the choice of defining the boundary of the pto to include the reactive force source has the effect of invalidating eq 2 as a measure of system resonance this occurs as eq 2 defines the natural frequency of the canonical form and only represents the condition of system resonance if the feature set enforcing eq 2 resides within the definition of z i as in config3 of arch2 this semantic of defining the pto boundary to include the reactive force source has the unintended consequence of invalidating eq 2 as a means to enforce optimal phase control the significance of this choice is wec developers are unaware that alternative wec architectures exist which do not implement the traditional complex conjugate pto force control method but contain the capacity for much greater power capture potential we therefore recommend that within linear monochromatic wec models the reactive force source should always be defined outside the pto boundary with the role to satisfy eq 2 to summarize this discussion to invoke optimal phase control in the wec canonical form bubbar et al 2018 eq 35 must hold 35 ℑ m z p t o ℑ m z i x p t o x i 0 to achieve eq 35 using a single reactive force source i e x f s 2 two cases exist represented by eq 36 case1 the reactive force source is defined within the boundary of the pto i e arch1 and eq 37 case 2 the reactive force source is defined outside the boundary of the pto i e arch2 and arch3 36 x p t o x f s 2 x i 0 where x p t o x f s 2 37 x p t o x i x f s 2 0 for case 1 satisfying eq 36 requires that x p t o x i and the pto reactance is set according to the complex conjugate law expressed by eq 22 via x f s 2 the downside of case 1 is implementing eq 36 limits the wec to a single architecture for case 2 if the pto is defined as a purely resistive device then x p t o 0 and the device can only operate in an optimal phase control state if x i x f s 2 0 i e the wec contains a reactive force source outside the boundary of the pto that is capable of implementing the constraint in eq 2 in case 2 the wec system is not limited to a single wec architecture this discussion on case1 and case2 is summarized in fig 9 4 2 power capture analysis the following section explores the power capture performance of config1 5 in the context of the canonical form parameters via eq 38 originally derived by falnes cf 28 30 falnes 1999 38 p u 1 2 f ˆ p t o c l a m p u ˆ r cos γ 1 2 ℜ e z i u ˆ r 2 to perform this comparison we generate data for 1 p u ω monochromatic power capture 2 f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω amplitude of the equivalent excitation force and 3 u ˆ r ω amplitude of the relative body velocity between the float and spar all as a function of wave excitation frequency resulting in the three individual plots of fig 10 respectively we begin by reviewing fig 10a which exhibits the power capture frequency response of config1 5 with config1 and config2 coincident with the results published by beatty et al cf fig 15 beatty et al 2015 although config2 5 are all operating under resonant control their power capture responses vary widely this behaviour confirms that multiple resonant conditions exist that are not equal when it comes to the power capture of complex wec architectures solely enforcing system resonance should not be the end goal of wec geometry control in the srpa architecture rather the specific topology of the wec architecture and the resonant control scheme greatly influences the power capture potential to comprehend this result we must explore the corresponding frequency responses of f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω and u ˆ r ω of fig 10b and c respectively first in reviewing fig 10b we note that f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is coincident for config1 3 and differs for config4 5 the reason for this observation is traced back to the form of f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω in eq 17 and its dependency on z e q 2 since neither x f s 1 or x f s 2 are contained within the definition of z e q 2 in eq 10 for arch1 or arch2 f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is the same for config1 3 this same reasoning also explains why config4 5 exhibit vastly different responses for f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω as x f s 3 is contained within z e q 2 in eq 24 this dependency between f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω and x f s 3 has the effect of both lowering as in config4 and increasing as in config5 the frequency response of f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω relative to config1 3 the benefit to increasing power capture via increasing f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is clear in eq 38 with config5 displaying the superior response another important parameter to review is u ˆ r ω as it not only influences the power capture in eq 38 but informs a wec designer of predicted end stop collisions falnes 1999 in comparing config1 with config2 as noted above f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is the same but the power capture response of config2 is larger based on eq 38 this necessitates that u ˆ r ω cos γ must compensate with cos γ 1 and u ˆ r ω increasing which is what we observe in fig 10c hence the effect of transitioning an srpa between an amplitude control pto as in config1 to a complex conjugate controlled pto as in config2 or config3 is to realize larger device motions resulting in increased power capture falnes 2002 this choice incurs additional risk to the wec developer as there is a higher probability of end stop collisions due to float spar oscillations the conclusion here is that config1 3 based on arch1 and arch2 are innately challenged as increases in power capture are only based on increasing the oscillation amplitude across the pto proceeding on we compare config3 based on arch2 with config4 and config5 based on arch3 in exploring fig 10a we note config4 is only larger in p u ω relative to config3 in the frequency range ω 2 r a d s as a result of both larger f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω and u ˆ r ω in contrast config5 exhibits the largest p u ω response over the entire frequency range of 1 5 ω 4 r a d s which is clearly attributed to a significantly larger force response f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω with the added benefit of a small velocity response u ˆ r ω clearly the power capture response of config5 based on arch3 is superior to all the alternatives in this analysis and it remains to discuss how the reactance x f s 3 o p t 2 can be realized using machinery 5 subsystem architecture design and technology innovation up to this point we have identified a high performing configuration in config5 of arch3 however we have yet to specify how the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t 2 will be physically realized section 5 1 will focus on a brief review of a promising technology inerters as applied to wave energy conversion section 5 2 will follow by presenting a subsystem circuit that is systematically substituted for the optimal force source element in this substitution we will apply realistic physical constraints on the design and generate a feasible power capture response based on approximating the optimal force source frequency response in section 5 3 we will compare these power capture results against config1 2 5 in fig 10a experimental data previously published by beatty et al 2015 and the srpa power capture limit p u m a x o p t previously published by bubbar and buckham 2018 finally we conclude by presenting an explanation of how these power capture responses relate to the complexity of a wec control regime 5 1 review of inerter technology developed by smith 2002 and formally introduced into the wave energy community by bubbar and buckham 2018 inerters are mechanical devices capable of temporarily storing and delivering mechanical reactive power during an oscillation cycle inerters achieve this through converting relative translational mechanical motion into rotational motion of a flywheel which exerts an opposing reaction force proportional to the relative acceleration as measured at the device nodes this proportionality constant is known as the inertance has si units of kilograms and is denoted as m e f f in this work in general the inertance is calculated as the product of the transmission ratio squared β 2 with the moment of inertia of the flywheel j as in eq 39 hu et al 2017 and semi active inerters are devices for which online adjustments of the inertance are permitted chen et al 2014 39 m e f f β 2 j similar to mass elements inerters induce a phase delay between the reaction force and the relative translational velocity as measured between its terminals at present three types of inerters exist 1 rack and pinion smith 2002 2 reverse driven ball screw chen et al 2009 and 3 hydraulic wang et al 2011 for which the definition of β varies with each type inerters are signified as a flywheel in the mechanical circuit framework with the frequency domain constitutive equation described in table 2 5 2 substitution of force sources for invoking technology innovation for config5 to operate under resonant control the force source reactance x f s 3 is scheduled across the operating frequency range to ensure x e q 2 o p t 2 in eq 30 is satisfied the force source at this point is still conceptual a physical embodiment has not been defined the utility of establishing the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t 2 in eq 33 prior to defining the physical embodiment is it provides wec designers with a tangible design constraint prior to specifying how this constraint must be satisfied thereby opening up the possibility for innovative designs in reviewing the schematic of arch3 in fig 2c we note the conspicuous proposal of interfacing the spar to the ocean floor via x f s 3 such a conceptual design although predicted to increase device performance is highly impractical in deep water operation in reality our choice of specifying the topology in arch3 was to allow for a complete generalization of the ensuing conceptual design space with an expectation that we would replace x f s 3 with a feasible topology of linear mechanical components for example we present a series of subsystems formed from linear mechanical components which can satisfy this lone requirement in fig 11 a semi active inerter interfaced between the spar and ocean floor b variable spring interfaced between the spar and ocean floor c variable hydrodynamic added mass via deformable spar hull d variable physical mass via water ballasting and e reaction mass internal to the spar interfaced with a parallel combination of a semi active inerter and constant spring although we have presented five potential subsystem circuits in fig 11a e this list is by no means comprehensive in this work we select the subsystem circuit of fig 11e to perform our substitution and provide a physical embodiment of x f s 3 in the corresponding subsystem the geometry control variable is the inertance m e f f ω whereas the reaction mass m 3 and coupled spring k 3 are constant and require specification as a first step to maintain an equitable comparison we must ensure the total mass of the spar and the reaction mass subsystem in this configuration is the same as the mass of the original spar used in beatty et al s experimental work as such we choose to set the sum of the masses m 2 and m 3 in config5 equal to the mass of beatty et al s original spar following m 2 m 3 57 5 kg next to offset the gravitational force from m 3 and place it at the centre of travel inside the spar we specify a constant spring stiffness of k 3 2000 n m to determine the inertance m e f f ω frequency response required to enforce x f s 3 o p t 2 we develop an equation describing the equivalent reactance of this subsystem circuit by applying circuit simplification transformations to the subsystem circuit of fig 11e we then equate this expression to x f s 3 o p t 2 required to enforce optimal phase control yielding eq 40 finally we substitute the impedance relationships cf table 1 bubbar et al 2018 for each term in eq 40 and solve for the optimal inertance m e f f o p t ω to give eq 41 40 x f s 3 o p t ω ℑ m z m e f f z k 3 z m 3 x m e f f x k 3 x m 3 x m e f f x k 3 x m 3 41 m e f f o p t ω k 3 m 3 x f s 3 o p t 2 ω ω m 3 k 3 ω ω ω m 3 x f s 3 o p t 2 ω we note in calculating m e f f o p t ω using eq 41 we must supply the updated value for m 2 57 5 k g into eq 32 to calculate x f s 3 o p t 2 the frequency response of m e f f o p t ω is plotted in fig 12 with two key observations first m e f f o p t ω becomes negative at ω 3 5 r a d s which is impossible to satisfy with the chosen subsystem design second a vertical asymptote is observed at ω 3 85 r a d s where the denominator of eq 41 tends to zero drastically extending the range of m e f f o p t ω to circumvent these challenges we select a feasible inertance operating range of m e f f m e f f min m e f f max 100 830 k g we choose m e f f min 100 k g as extreme low values of inertance are challenging to achieve due to the quadratic relationship of the moment of inertia with the radius of gyration as inferred in eq 39 this feasible inertance range allows for m e f f o p t ω to be satisfied for the frequency range of ω 1 5 3 16 r a d s with the compromise of setting m e f f 100 k g for all frequencies in the range 3 16 ω 4 r a d s in specifying these realistic design constraints we have in essence created a new configuration we label as config6 for which we will present a comparative power capture response in fig 13 of section 5 3 to outline the consequence of this trade off the combination of the wec model parameters and the chosen subsystem circuit created a scenario in which the full range of x e q 2 o p t 2 could not be satisfied across the frequency spectrum trade offs were required to allow for a feasible configuration that implemented resonant control for a majority of the frequency range to further broaden the bandwidth of operation a wec designer may consider 1 redesigning the device to alter the wec model parameters to allow for a more suitable frequency response of x e q 2 o p t 2 to be satisfied by a feasible range of m e f f o p t and or 2 replacing x f s 3 with a different subsystem circuit which theoretically can satisfy x e q 2 o p t 2 through supplying the required negative reactance values of x f s 3 o p t 5 3 comparison of numerical results with experimental data in this final section we quantify the power capture performance of config1 2 5 6 proposed in this work in relation to data obtained from experimental trials performed by beatty et al 2015 for which these configurations are based to begin we define the datasets observed in fig 13 six overlaid datasets of power capture as a function of excitation frequency are noted the first three are config1 2 5 originally presented in fig 10a and described in detail in section 4 2 next we observe p e x p based on the experimental trails conducted by beatty et al 2015 performed in a monochromatic wave regime using a pto simulator beatty et al 2017 that generates an amplitude controlled pto force response falnes 2002 as originally presented by beatty et al 2015 there is good alignment of config1 with p e x p and thus confidence in the linearized hydrodynamic and inertial parameters used in all the configurations presented the next dataset is config6 defined using the subsystem circuit of fig 11e in section 5 and based on a feasible operating range of m e f f ω for best approximating x f s 3 o p t 2 clearly the power capture response of config6 is coincident with config5 until ω 3 16 r a d s the frequency at which the inerter of config6 can no longer supply the required inertance to maintain resonant control above ω 3 16 r a d s we observe a steep decline in power capture the final dataset is p u m a x o p t represents the upper bound in power capture by a srpa with a complex conjugate controlled pto and an optimally set inertial modulated spar as originally introduced by bubbar and buckham 2018 to understand how a wec designer leaps up on the configuration chart of fig 13 we explore the relationship between the complexity of the wec control regimes to the resulting power capture performance when the wec is represented in canonical form we first qualitatively describe the complexity of the wec control regime as a combination of both the 1 number of simultaneous control parameters and 2 the dependencies of these control parameters upon one another a summary of these attributes are pictorially represented in fig 14 for the configurations considered clearly config1 with the lowest power capture performance enacts the simplest control regime an amplitude controlled pto with r p t o set optimally to eq 3 as the single control variable with no geometry control feature set present to influence the system dynamics next config2 enacts a more complicated control regime with improved power capture utilizing a complex conjugate pto with two controlled parameters r p t o set optimally to eq 21 and x p t o set optimally to eq 22 but again without a geometry control feature set present the subsequent configuration is config5 with again two controlled parameters however there is an additional dependency between these parameters manifesting in a master slave relationship bubbar et al 2018 for which the value set in the master parameter z f s n influences the optimal value set in the slave parameter r p t o optimal power capture is achieved when the spar dynamics are set through z f s n to induce system resonance with r p t o being subsequently set based on z f s n to maximize the power capture finally the most complex and highest performing regime is the p u max o p t configuration containing three controllable parameters one master parameter z f s n which influences the spar dynamics and two slave parameters x p t o and r p t o which set the resonant state and maximize power capture respectively in reviewing fig 13 we note the gap between config2 and config5 is substantial justifying the added complexity of introducing a master slave relationship however the gap between config5 and p u m a x o p t is smaller and requires an additional dependent control parameter introducing a further complex technological design challenge clearly this relationship between wec control complexity and power capture is non linear and thus a wec developer must cautiously consider the appropriate control complexity to power capture ratio applicable for their development program 6 conclusions for wave energy to become an economically viable form of renewable energy the power capture performance of wec devices must continue to improve to succeed with this challenge wec developers must be encouraged to focus on devices with more promising power capture potential early on in the conceptual design phase of a development program to support the identification of wec architectures with a promising power capture performance we proposed an analytical method previously unavailable to wec developers based on transforming an arbitrarily complex wec architecture into a simplified canonical form to extract analytical expressions on how to achieve system resonance we followed this proposal with a case study implementing the method to extract design insights to compare five wec configurations based upon three complex srpa wec architectures the last two of which incorporated an embedded geometry control feature set we then demonstrated using numerical models that although the wec architectures are similar in topology power capture performance can vary greatly necessitating important considerations on wec topology and its influence on the equivalent single body excitation force early in the conceptual phase of development we followed by demonstrating how the generality of the analytical method offered a performance target for the design of a subsystem without constraining the design to a specific technology we revealed how multiple potential subsystems could be simultaneously considered to satisfy the analytical performance requirements leading to the selection of a subsystem circuit implementing inertial modulation using inerter technology finally we presented an explanation of a power capture hierarchy of the wec configurations under study in the context of the ensuing complexity of the control regime revealed through our numerical analysis although this work has offered a new viewpoint on the utility of monochromatic linear frequency domain wec models in the conceptual design stage of a development program our future outlook will focus on the following areas 1 exploration of alternative subsystem circuits capable of satisfying the optimal spar reactance 2 sensitivity analysis of the presented control parameters in the context of power capture 3 methods for developing time domain wec models operating under the control regimes presented 4 fabricating a scaled model using an inerter and performing experimental trails in a wave tank and 5 developing this procedure for application to multi degrees of freedom wec architectures

22153,it is widely suggested that step gains in wave energy converter power capture performance must be realized to achieve economic viability one method of fulfilling power capture gains is to invoke resonant conditions between the device and the incoming ocean wave however a general method that can establish the prerequisites for achieving resonant conditions in an arbitrarily complex wave energy converter architecture is nonexistent in this work we present an analytical procedure built on the mechanical circuit framework for identifying the resonant conditions of an arbitrarily complex wave energy converter architecture to demonstrate the procedure we select three complex two body point absorber devices as a case study each with a geometry controllable feature set through invoking resonant conditions in each architecture we illustrate how the choice of topology has significant influence on the power capture characteristics of the wec device selecting the highest performing architecture we then reveal how the analytical equations can be applied to promote technology innovation by supplying design criterion prior to locking down the wec design finally we apply the

compelling case as a potential renewable energy resource however wave energy converter wec devices have yet to display commercial viability as compared to alternative renewable energy sources astariz and iglesias 2015 at present wec devices do not capture sufficient power from the wave resource to offset the costs of operating offshore and thus are not economically viable babarit 2017 as expressed by weber the power capture capacity of a wec device is influenced by choices largely made early in the conceptual design stage of a development program weber 2012 the traditional conceptual development process involves 1 choosing a device class based on operating principle falcão 2010 cruz 2008 2 defining the geometry and inertial characteristics of the floating body based on heuristics and logistical constraints and 3 coupling this body to a power take off pto unit used to convert the kinetic energy of the wave induced body into a useful form in this process the hydrodynamics and inertial properties of the body are adopted as constraints whereas the pto is considered a configurable unit in this traditional view power capture maximization by the pto requires implementing the complex conjugate nebel 1992 pto force control conditions based on a set mechanical impedance of the wec implementation of complex conjugate control requires a multi functional resistive reactive pto capable of optimally setting the 1 pto reactance x f s 1 in fig 1 a to inject reactive power back into the body altering its relative phase with respect to the incoming wave excitation force to achieve optimal phase control and 2 pto resistance r p t o to achieve optimal amplitude control and maximize power capture through modulating the body motion falnes 2002 for the specific case of a single body point absorber sbpa wec architecture the optimal settings for these sub functions to maximize power capture are well understood falnes 2002 however an sbpa with a resistive reactive pto represented by fig 1a is only one possible sbpa architecture for realizing maximum power for example consider the mechanical schematics in fig 1b and fig 1c for which the pto is represented as a solely resistive mechanical damper element clearly neither pto contains a reactive element in these architectures and thus cannot implement complex conjugate pto force control however both wec architectures contain feature sets external to the pto represented as reactive force sources which can inject the necessary reactive power to enable optimal phase control and hence achieve the same power capture performance this distinction between the point absorber architectures in fig 1 may appear as mere semantics in the sbpa as the differences originate from the choice to separate the reactive element from the pto while all three architectures remain topologically equivalent with more complex wec architectures such as the two body self reacting point absorber srpa there are a variety of locations where the reactive element may be placed leading to significant topological differences between architectures fig 2 pictorially represents three different srpa architectures 1 fig 2a labelled arch1 is the conventional srpa containing a traditional resistive reactive pto 2 fig 2b labelled arch2 contains a resistive pto with an independent but parallel reactive force source and 3 fig 2c labelled arch3 contains a resistive pto with a reactively controlled spar there is a strong motivation to determine the optimal power capture performance of complex wec architectures such as arch2 and arch3 and to define the optimal conditions on the force sources x f s 2 o p t x f s 3 o p t leading to optimal performance with the emergence of new technologies based on these architectures for example srpas interfaced with 1 liang s liang et al 2017 mechanical motion rectifier mmr technology and 2 gradowski s gradowski et al 2017 hydrodynamic negative spring are generically represented by arch2 and arch3 respectively we believe that such contemporary wec devices are only the tip of the iceberg as the wec design space evolves to consider greater topological complexity in pursuit of step increases in power capture capacity to determine the performance merits of these complex alternative wec architectures at the conceptual stage of development we need a means to establish equations outlining both the conditions on the reactive force source required to implement optimal phase control and the subsequent power capture potential the traditional view of a pto with a reactive feature set we believe emerged as the result of the perception that a wec device possessed unchangeable hydrodynamic and inertial parameters i e no geometry control feature implemented within the wec this view promotes the proposition of implementing the optimal phase control function as an internal feature of the pto allowing for the determination of the optimal force source reactance x f s 1 o p t in arch1 to determine the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t in more complex wec architectures such as arch3 we must move beyond this traditional resistive reactive pto paradigm to accomplish this a more generalized view of phase control is required for which we choose to revert to the original works of mei 1976 evans 1976 and falnes 2002 in their works the phase control condition was originally identified as simply the state of achieving system resonance with this generalized interpretation of phase control the equations sought above can be determined analytically if the complex wec architectures are first transformed into the wec canonical form bubbar et al 2018 once in canonical form constraints enforcing system resonance are imposed on the canonical form leading to the optimal force source reactance once the device is in resonance one can apply optimal pto damping and thus determine maximum power capture although the importance of enforcing resonant conditions with the incoming waves is clear analytical expressions guiding wec developers in their technology development processes do not exist except for very simple wec architectures e g sbpas in this work we demonstrate through a case study the transformation of the three srpa architectures in fig 2 arch1 arch2 and arch3 into the canonical form and then apply analytical constraints to invoke system resonance in doing so we will show that the choice of injecting reactance into arch3 delivers superior performance both in terms of level of power capture and in the minimization of the relative travel between the float and spar the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 we briefly review how a complex wec architecture is transformed into canonical form through applying the process outlined by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 followed by examining the definition of wec resonance in this context in section 3 we transform arch1 arch2 and arch3 into the canonical form enforce the resonant condition and extract the optimal force source reactances x f s 1 o p t x f s 2 o p t and x f s 3 o p t in doing so we generate analytical constraints used to guide technology design that apply across all configurations in the architectures considered in section 4 we perform a numerical analysis to compare the power capture performance and system dynamic responses of five specific configurations config1 5 generated based on arch1 arch2 and arch3 using experimentally validated device parameters from a 1 25th scale model published by beatty et al 2015 finally in section 5 having selected a single configuration for further analysis we demonstrate how the development process introduced in this work enables technology innovation by substituting the reactive force source with a sub circuit of mechanical machinery components incorporating a unique technology the inerter encased within the confines of the spar we explore the potential of inerter technology for enabling resonant control of our configuration under realistic physical design constraints we conclude our case study by illustrating a hierarchy describing how incremental levels of wec control complexity relate to improving the resulting power capture performance our motivation is to present wec developers with choices and the associated trade offs to consider during the conceptual design phase of an srpa project leading to improved power capture potential 2 theory 2 1 frequency domain modelling of wecs using mechanical circuits restricting oneself to a linear hydrodynamics regime wec devices are initially considered as linear underdamped mechanical vibration systems comprised of masses springs and dampers falnes 2002 specific arrangements of these mechanical elements define a wec architecture bubbar et al 2018 as described by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 all wec architectures may be represented in topological form as a mechanical circuit with mechanical impedance elements interfaced at common nodes harris et al 1962 these linear vibration systems are energized via a periodic sinusoidal external wave excitation force represented as a force source resulting in body motion the pto represented as a configurable impedance block captures energy when the wave induced bodies do work against a reaction force within that block characterized as a resistive element once a wec architecture is represented as a mechanical circuit the system topology may be simplified by substituting the mechanical impedance constitutive equations for each mechanical element and applying network synthesis methods harris et al 1962 to determine the canonical form bubbar et al 2018 the canonical form is an equivalent mechanical circuit representing the simplest wec architecture the sbpa once in canonical form system kinematic and dynamic variables such as eq 3 eq 5 can be calculated for any given monochromatic incident wave since a wave elevation time series can be approximated by a polychromatic sea state decomposed into monochromatic components the frequency domain underpins the analysis of wec performance we note any single mechanical impedance block is a complex quantity generically represented as the sum of resistive r and reactive x parameters as in eq 1 1 z r i x 2 2 resonance of the sbpa architecture for a heaving sbpa architecture the power capture is maximized when both system resonance is achieved and the pto resistance is optimally set to enforce system resonance through an analytical means a mathematical definition of the resonant condition consistent with the mechanical impedance formulation must be determined falnes 2002 proposed an equation inspired from electronic circuit theory in his proposition a functional boundary was defined to separate the pto impedance z p t o from the remaining lumped sbpa impedance or intrinsic impedance z i illustrated by the mechanical circuit in fig 3 b from this functional separation falnes identified that the natural frequency of the remaining sbpa wec architecture is determined by evaluating eq 2 cf 5 324 falnes 2002 2 ℑ m z i 0 for a heaving sbpa with constant geometry and inertia and with an amplitude controlled pto resonance only occurs when the incoming wave excitation frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the floating body albeit off resonance conditions may demonstrate similar performance for all other wave excitation frequencies resonance is not achieved without intervention clearly invoking resonance across a bandwidth of operating frequencies is desired to maximize power capture thus a feature set independent from the pto i e within the definition of z i capable of injecting the appropriate reactance into the remaining system to satisfy eq 2 would achieve the desired result in choosing to represent the sbpa architecture using a resistive pto and a reactive force source external to the pto the resonance control problem may be classified as a subset of geometry control first introduced by price price et al 2009 in fig 3a we observe a mechanical circuit of the sbpa architecture schematically represented in fig 1b with a reactive force source f ˆ f s 2 external to the pto once system resonance is invoked maximizing the power captured by the resistive pto requires applying the impedance matching criteria falnes 2002 to set r p t o according to eq 3 when r p t o r p t o o p t amplitude control is invoked by the pto and the power captured is defined by eq 4 with the complex amplitude of the body velocity defined by eq 5 falnes 2002 3 r p t o o p t z i 4 p u m a x a c f ˆ p t o c l a m p 2 4 ℜ e z i z i 5 u ˆ r f ˆ p t o c l a m p z i z i in sbpas resonance is the condition in which the wave excitation force is in phase with the float velocity this description is visually intuitive and thus analytical design guidance is relatively straightforward to implement in linear monochromatic wec models as wec architecture complexity increases and more bodies and components are considered in a conceptual design e g srpas this visual intuition becomes clouded as a multi body system the motion of the complex wec architecture is described in terms of its natural modes of vibration it is unclear how the shape of each vibration mode influences power capture as such wec developers resort to specifying design parameters early in the design process this locks focus onto a specific wec configuration bubbar et al 2018 but allows for implementation of numerical optimization routines to search for the resonant conditions unfortunately the insights obtained from these numerical optimizations cannot be generalized across configurations and wec developers are left resorting to a trial and error process as configurations evolve there is therefore an acute need for extending the analytical methods for evaluating the resonant conditions available to sbpas to more complex wec architectures 2 3 sbpa as the wec canonical form the srpa budal 1985 with its pto interfaced between two wave activated bodies was a natural development on the sbpa as the two body architecture eliminated the need for an ocean floor reference however this introduced a new challenge as analytical equations describing the maximum power capture conditions were unknown falnes provided a path forward by developing an ingenious analytical interpretation of the impedance matching problem falnes applied a mechanical thévenin thévenin 1883 falnes 1999 equivalency transformation and represented the srpa wec architecture as a phenomenological equivalent sbpa the canonical form in fig 1b with an equivalent single body intrinsic impedance wave excitation force and single body velocity falnes 1999 in this formulation the equivalent wave excitation force f ˆ p t o c l a m p is the force experienced across the pto of the srpa when the pto rigidly secures the float to the spar whereas the equivalent single body velocity u ˆ r is the relative velocity measured across the pto with this formulation falnes exposed an important insight resonant conditions are invoked in the srpa architecture when f ˆ p t o c l a m p is in phase with u ˆ r which does not necessarily coincide with the resonant conditions of either of the individual bodies falnes 1999 since thévenin s theorem is invariant to topological complexity falnes impedance matching strategy in the srpa architecture has been generalized by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 for wec architectures of arbitrary complexity through the use of the mechanical circuit framework harris et al 1962 as the canonical form is simply the representation of a complex wec architecture as an equivalent sbpa architecture the resonant condition s for the complex wec architecture may be determined through substituting z i isolated from the canonical form into falnes well established analytical condition eq 2 for resonance in sbpas in this formulation both f ˆ p t o c l a m p and z i isolated from the canonical form are now functions of the physical parameters of the complex wec architecture in addition the power capture subject to optimal pto damping is determined by eq 4 and the relative complex velocity amplitude between the float and spar as measured across the pto is determined by eq 5 in this work we will demonstrate the derivation of z i and f ˆ p t o c l a m p for arch1 arch2 and arch3 enforce both the optimal resonant condition eq 2 and amplitude pto force control eq 3 and establish conditions on the generic force sources x f s 1 x f s 2 x f s 3 that ensure resonant control of our complex wec architectures 3 establishing resonant conditions in srpas in this section we consider three complex srpa wec architectures arch1 arch2 and arch3 illustrated in fig 2 all capable of implementing resonant control for simplifying the ensuing algebra we choose an srpa for which the coupled radiation forces are known to be negligible cf appendix e beatty 2015 each architecture is configured with one reactive force source represented by the complex force amplitude f ˆ f s n with n 1 2 3 signifying the indices for the architecture number considered this force source generates an unbounded monochromatic force signal at the frequency of the incoming ocean wave the force sources f ˆ f s 1 and f ˆ f s 2 are proportional to the relative complex velocity amplitude difference u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 between the float and spar in their respective architectures and described mathematically by eq 6 whereas the force source in arch3 f ˆ f s 3 is proportional to the absolute complex velocity amplitude of the spar as in eq 7 6 f ˆ f s n z f s n u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 n 1 2 7 f ˆ f s 3 z f s 3 u ˆ 2 as introduced by korde 1999 we characterize the resulting force by the impedance in eq 8 which is controlled by the force source reactance x f s n 8 z f s n i x f s n n 1 2 3 in this section we will derive x f s n o p t the force source reactance which results in resonant control of arch1 arch2 and arch3 to derive these equations we must first determine analytical expressions of z i for arch1 arch2 and arch3 we first explore arch2 and arch1 in section 3 1 and section 3 2 respectively noting that while they are topologically equivalent they are subtly distinct based on the definition of the pto boundary as discussed in section 1 for arch1 with x f s 1 defined internal to the pto we apply the complex conjugate conditions verbatim whereas for arch2 with x f s 2 defined external to the pto we apply the resonant control law in eq 2 as we will demonstrate in section 4 1 the choice of defining x f s 1 internal to the pto boundary invalidates eq 2 as a constraint equation to enforce system resonance although this result has little impact on determining x f s 1 o p t as the complex conjugate impedance matching conditions may be applied in lieu of eq 2 to solve for x f s 1 o p t the choice of defining the pto boundary does have a significant impact on how x f s 3 o p t is determined in arch3 consequently next we explore arch3 which is topologically represented by a reactive force source x f s 3 interfaced between the spar and ocean floor in arch3 the spar is seen as a variable reactance subsystem in section 3 2 we derive the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t for enacting resonant control of arch3 3 1 the arch2 canonical form to determine the canonical form of arch2 we execute the procedure outlined by bubbar et al bubbar et al 2018 step 1 comprises generating the mechanical circuit representing arch2 as in fig 4 a step 2 involves simplifying this mechanical circuit through the application of parallel and series circuit transformations harris et al 1962 resulting in fig 4b for which we define two new lumped impedance terms z e q 1 and z e q 2 in eq 9 eq 10 representing the equivalent float and spar impedances respectively we explicitly note that in applying our circuit simplifications z f s 2 is contained outside the definitions of either z e q 1 or z e q 2 9 z e q 1 z m 1 z a 11 z b 11 z k 1 z m 1 z a 11 z b 11 z k 1 10 z e q 2 z m 2 z a 22 z b 22 z k 2 z m 2 z a 22 z b 22 z k 2 with the simplified circuit of arch2 established in step 3 we analytically determine two parameters inherent to this architecture u ˆ r f r e e a case of the relative velocity between the float and spar when the pto resistance is eliminated and f ˆ p t o c l a m p a case of a pto clamped through force developed when the pto rigidly secures the float to the spar to determine these parameters we represent these cases by augmenting the mechanical circuit of fig 4b with the two new circuits in fig 5 upon establishing the analytical equations for u ˆ r f r e e in section 3 1 1 and f ˆ p t o c l a m p in section 3 1 2 we continue with step 4 by using these expressions to determine z i in section 3 1 3 finally in step 5 we substitute z i into eq 2 and isolate the optimal force source impedance x f s 2 o p t to enforce the system resonance condition in section 3 1 4 3 1 1 free relative velocity difference to determine u ˆ r f r e e we apply kirchhoff s node law on each node in fig 5a resulting in eq 11 eq 12 11 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 1 u ˆ 1 f r e e z f s 2 u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e n o d e 1 12 f ˆ e x 2 z e q 2 u ˆ 2 f r e e z f s 2 u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e n o d e 2 for which we can solve for u ˆ r f r e e as in eq 13 13 u ˆ r f r e e u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e f ˆ e x 2 z e q 1 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 z f s 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 3 1 2 pto clamped through force to determine f ˆ p t o c l a m p we analyze the circuit in fig 5b under the knowledge that both the float and spar are constrained to move together and hence there is no relative motion across the pto leading to eq 14 14 u ˆ 1 u ˆ 2 u ˆ c l a m p we also note that all the force between nodes 1 and 2 passes through the pto and thus applying kirchhoff s node law on each node results in eq 15 eq 16 15 f ˆ e x 1 f ˆ p t o c

in 17 f ˆ p t o c l a m p f ˆ e x 1 z e q 2 f ˆ e x 2 z e q 1 z e q 1 z e q 2 3 1 3 equivalent single body intrinsic impedance the equivalent single body intrinsic impedance of the canonical form is determined to be harris et al 1962 18 z i f ˆ p t o c l a m p u ˆ r f r e e z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 z f s 2 fig 4c depicts the ensuing circuit representation of the wec canonical form the equivalent wave excitation force in parallel with both the single body intrinsic impedance and the resistive pto load we now utilize eq 18 to establish conditions on our force source for enabling resonant control on arch2 3 1 4 determining the force source reactance to enable system resonance having derived z i in eq 18 for arch2 we substitute eq 18 into eq 2 to enforce the optimal resonant condition and isolate the optimal force source reactance as in eq 19 19 x f s 2 o p t ℑ m z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 for arch2 the combination of setting the force source reactance by enforcing eq 19 while simultaneously setting the pto resistance according to eq 3 will maximize the power captured for this architecture 3 2 the arch1 canonical form in section 3 we identified arch1 and arch2 as representing the same topology with the distinction that arch1 contains a resistive reactive pto and thus the reactive force source f ˆ f s 1 is defined within the boundary of the pto as such the equivalent float and spar impedances for arch1 and arch2 are defined by eq 9 and eq 10 respectively in his seminal work on srpas falnes derived the intrinsic impedance of the canonical form of arch1 with the coupled radiation forces set to zero as in eq 20 cf 24 falnes 1999 20 z i z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 to determine the optimal force source reactance x f s 1 o p t on arch1 the complex conjugate pto force control conditions must be applied leading to the optimal settings for the pto resistance and reactance set as in eq 21 and eq 22 21 r p t o o p t ℜ e z i 22 x f s 1 o p t ℑ m z i in comparing eq 22 from arch1 with eq 19 from arch2 it is clear that x f s 1 o p t x f s 2 o p t and thus as expected both arch1 and arch2 operate under the same resonant control state further comparing eq 21 with eq 3 while eq 2 is enforced ensures that the pto resistances are also equivalent we can therefore conclude arch2 operating with x f s 2 set to eq 19 with r p t o set to eq 3 functions equivalently to arch1 operating under complex conjugate pto force control this is important as it demonstrates that as expected the resonant control conditions for both arch1 and arch2 were consistent with one another however the constraint equation applied to determine the result eq 22 or eq 2 respectively differed depending on how we defined the pto boundary this point may appear as a semantic for arch2 but is of grave importance to determining the resonant control condition in arch3 for a full derivation of the optimal pto settings for arch1 using the mechanical circuit framework please consult bubbar et al cf section 3 1 bubbar et al 2018 3 3 the arch3 canonical form bubbar et al s process is once again executed on arch3 to determine the canonical form parameters u ˆ r f r e e f ˆ p t o c l a m p and z i followed by enforcing the resonant control law in eq 2 to determine the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t in step 1 the mechanical circuit is generated in fig 6 a and simplified in step 2 resulting in fig 6b with new lumped impedance terms eq 23 and eq 24 defined for z e q 1 and z e q 2 respectively we note in this case after applying our circuit simplifications z f s 3 is contained within the definition of z e q 2 next u ˆ r f r e e f ˆ p t o c l a m p and z i are determined using the augmented mechanical circuits in fig 7 with details contained in sections 3 3 1 3 3 3 respectively finally the optimal resonant condition is determined by substituting z i into eq 2 to isolate x f s 3 o p t as described in section 3 3 4 3 3 1 free relative velocity difference to determine u ˆ r f r e e we apply kirchhoff s node law on each node in fig 7a resulting in eq 25 eq 26 25 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 1 u ˆ 1 f r e e n o d e 1 26 f ˆ e x 2 z e q 2 u ˆ 2 f r e e n o d e 2 for which we can solve for u ˆ r f r e e as 27 u ˆ r f r e e u ˆ 1 f r e e u ˆ 2 f r e e f ˆ e x 2 z e q 1 f ˆ e x 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 3 3 2 pto clamped through force to determine f ˆ p t o c l a m p we analyze the circuit in fig 7b and recognize that all the force between nodes 1 and 2 pass through the pto as such f ˆ p t o c l a m p mirrors the result of eq 17 from section 3 1 2 3 3 3 equivalent single body intrinsic impedance the equivalent single body intrinsic impedance is determined as eq 28 with the canonical form depicted in fig 6c 28 z i f ˆ p t o c l a m p u ˆ r f r e e z e q 1 z e q 2 z e q 1 z e q 2 we now utilize eq 28 to establish conditions on our force source for enabling resonant control in arch3 3 3 4 determining the force source reactance to enable system resonance having derived z i for arch3 we once again apply the optimal resonant condition of eq 2 to accomplish this we first substitute the generic complex form z e q n r e q n i x e q n n 1 2 into eq 28 yielding an expression for z i based on the equivalent resistances and reactances of the float n 1 and spar n 2 we then substitute this expression of z i into eq 2 yielding a quadratic polynomial expression in x e q 2 described by eq 29 29 x e q 1 x e q 2 2 r e q 1 2 x e q 1 2 x e q 2 r e q 2 2 x e q 1 r e q 1 r e q 2 2 x e q 1 x e q 2 2 0 provided r e q 1 r e q 2 and x e q 1 x e q 2 we can solve for x e q 2 o p t the spar reactance required for system resonance by applying the quadratic equation to the numerator of eq 29 yielding the two solutions in eq 30 these solutions are important as they represent design insight on how system resonance is achieved in arch3 through manipulating the spar reactance alone 30 x e q 2 o p t 1 2 r e q 1 2 x e q 1 2 r e q 1 2 x e q 1 2 2 4 x e q 1 r e q 2 2 x e q 1 2 x e q 1 we note that all variables in eq 30 can be recovered by applying the analytical real and imaginary operations outlined in eq 31 conversely if we had assumed the float has a variable reactance feature set instead of the spar the optimal float impedance could be determined by rearranging the numerator in eq 29 as a polynomial in x e q 1 and solving for x e q 1 o p t leading to a symmetrical equation to eq 30 where eq 2 is substituted for eq 1 and vise versa 31 r e q 1 ℜ e eq 23 x e q 1 ℑ m eq 23 r e q 2 ℜ e eq 24 to determine the optimal force source reactance we lump all the hydrodynamics and inertial impedances of the spar into the term z m h 2 as in eq 32 then isolate x f s 3 in eq 24 and substitute eq 30 into this expression yielding eq 33 32 z m h 2 z m 2 z a 22 z b 22 z k 2 33 x f s 3 o p t 1 2 x e q 2 o p t 1 2 ℑ m z m h 2 for arch3 enforcing eq 30 through setting x f s 3 x f s 3 o p t 1 2 in eq 33 will give rise to two different system resonance states in the canonical form as there are two system resonance states in arch3 it follows that a comparative analysis must be performed having derived the optimal force source reactances to enable system resonance the outstanding question at this point is what if any are the performance differences of arch2 and arch3 when operating under system resonant conditions with the pto resistance set optimally we answer this question in the next section 4 numerical examples of wec configurations the focus of this section is to demonstrate how the analytical constraints defining the optimal force source reactances determined in section 3 can be used to enforce the resonant conditions on each architecture considered we achieve this through performing a comparative numerical analysis using physical parameters from an experimentally verified srpa 1 25th froude scaled model resembling a wavebob device published by beatty et al and detailed in appendix a cf wec a beatty et al 2015 beatty 2015 we choose beatty et al s model as their experimental work has been validated through enduring an academic peer review process to perform this comparative analysis a series of configurations are defined that are built on the parameters extracted from beatty et al s single experimental model to ensure equitable comparisons are based on performance each of the configurations considered have the same 1 hydrodynamic coefficients the sizes and shapes of components do not change and 2 total mass we note at this stage of the analysis the reactive force source is represented conceptually without a physical embodiment an embodied design of the reactive force source will be specified in section 5 2 to perform this comparative analysis we first reproduce the same two srpa wec configurations originally published by beatty et al based on their experimental results we note both of these configurations are based upon arch1 with the only distinguishing difference being the pto force control mode config1 is amplitude controlled while config2 is complex conjugate controlled config1 and config2 serve as comparative baselines as neither contain a geometry control feature set external to the pto a third configuration config3 is generated based on arch2 of fig 2b while the last two configurations config4 and config5 are generated based on each of the resonant states derived for arch3 of fig 2c numerical models of all config1 5 are constructed by substituting beatty et al s model parameters verbatim into the equation sets detailed in table 1 in the subsequent sections we explore the comparative performance of these configurations section 4 1 focuses on confirming whether optimal phase control is achieved for each configuration section 4 2 presents the power capture performance of each of these configurations detailing the source of differences and establishing config5 as the superior performing configuration 4 1 was optimal phase control achieved in section 1 we made the conscious decision to revert to an earlier interpretation of the optimal phase control problem as enforcing the state of system resonance allowing for the derivation of the generalized resonant conditions for the complex srpa wec architectures considered in this work in this section we demonstrate using our numerical examples that optimal phase control is achieved when the resonant conditions are enforced in equation form this requires that eq 34 falnes 1999 is satisfied at each excitation frequency considered 34 γ ω f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω u ˆ r ω 0 we perform a comparative analysis by evaluating the left hand side of eq 34 for each of the configurations detailed in table 1 and plot the results versus wave excitation frequency in fig 8 a in observing fig 8a all the configurations except config1 adhere to the constraint outlined in eq 34 and are thus operating under optimal phase control as anticipated config1 cannot satisfy eq 34 at all wave excitation frequencies as the pto is purely resistive and there is no reactive feature set present to enable system resonance across the frequency band to expose the relationship between the optimal phase control condition in eq 34 and the resonant control law presented in eq 2 we plot the intrinsic reactance of the canonical form x i ω as a function of wave excitation frequency in fig 8b using the corresponding form of z i specified in table 1 in fig 8b we note config3 5 all with geometry control feature sets external to the pto adhere to eq 2 while config1 2 do not the peculiar observation of config2 not adhering to the resonant control law of eq 2 yet clearly enacting optimal phase control requires further elaboration and an explanation follows in specifying the topological layout of config2 based on arch1 the pto boundary is defined as observed in table 1 for which z p t o contains both r p t o and x f s 1 upon constructing the canonical form thévenin s theorem is applied across the nodes of z p t o resulting in x f s 1 the quantity responsible for enforcing eq 34 residing outside the definition of z i in contrast in arch2 and arch3 for which config3 5 are based on the pto boundary as observed in the schematics of table 1 contains r p t o only whereby thévenin s theorem is applied across necessitating that z i in eq 18 contains x f s 2 in this sense x f s 2 is separate from the pto while still being responsible for satisfying eq 2 i e ℑ m z i 0 via implementing eq 19 as demonstrated in section 3 2 arch1 and arch2 are topologically equivalent requiring the same conditions on the pto resistance and force source reactance for enabling system resonance however in arch1 the choice of defining the boundary of the pto to include the reactive force source has the effect of invalidating eq 2 as a measure of system resonance this occurs as eq 2 defines the natural frequency of the canonical form and only represents the condition of system resonance if the feature set enforcing eq 2 resides within the definition of z i as in config3 of arch2 this semantic of defining the pto boundary to include the reactive force source has the unintended consequence of invalidating eq 2 as a means to enforce optimal phase control the significance of this choice is wec developers are unaware that alternative wec architectures exist which do not implement the traditional complex conjugate pto force control method but contain the capacity for much greater power capture potential we therefore recommend that within linear monochromatic wec models the reactive force source should always be defined outside the pto boundary with the role to satisfy eq 2 to summarize this discussion to invoke optimal phase control in the wec canonical form bubbar et al 2018 eq 35 must hold 35 ℑ m z p t o ℑ m z i x p t o x i 0 to achieve eq 35 using a single reactive force source i e x f s 2 two cases exist represented by eq 36 case1 the reactive force source is defined within the boundary of the pto i e arch1 and eq 37 case 2 the reactive force source is defined outside the boundary of the pto i e arch2 and arch3 36 x p t o x f s 2 x i 0 where x p t o x f s 2 37 x p t o x i x f s 2 0 for case 1 satisfying eq 36 requires that x p t o x i and the pto reactance is set according to the complex conjugate law expressed by eq 22 via x f s 2 the downside of case 1 is implementing eq 36 limits the wec to a single architecture for case 2 if the pto is defined as a purely resistive device then x p t o 0 and the device can only operate in an optimal phase control state if x i x f s 2 0 i e the wec contains a reactive force source outside the boundary of the pto that is capable of implementing the constraint in eq 2 in case 2 the wec system is not limited to a single wec architecture this discussion on case1 and case2 is summarized in fig 9 4 2 power capture analysis the following section explores the power capture performance of config1 5 in the context of the canonical form parameters via eq 38 originally derived by falnes cf 28 30 falnes 1999 38 p u 1 2 f ˆ p t o c l a m p u ˆ r cos γ 1 2 ℜ e z i u ˆ r 2 to perform this comparison we generate data for 1 p u ω monochromatic power capture 2 f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω amplitude of the equivalent excitation force and 3 u ˆ r ω amplitude of the relative body velocity between the float and spar all as a function of wave excitation frequency resulting in the three individual plots of fig 10 respectively we begin by reviewing fig 10a which exhibits the power capture frequency response of config1 5 with config1 and config2 coincident with the results published by beatty et al cf fig 15 beatty et al 2015 although config2 5 are all operating under resonant control their power capture responses vary widely this behaviour confirms that multiple resonant conditions exist that are not equal when it comes to the power capture of complex wec architectures solely enforcing system resonance should not be the end goal of wec geometry control in the srpa architecture rather the specific topology of the wec architecture and the resonant control scheme greatly influences the power capture potential to comprehend this result we must explore the corresponding frequency responses of f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω and u ˆ r ω of fig 10b and c respectively first in reviewing fig 10b we note that f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is coincident for config1 3 and differs for config4 5 the reason for this observation is traced back to the form of f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω in eq 17 and its dependency on z e q 2 since neither x f s 1 or x f s 2 are contained within the definition of z e q 2 in eq 10 for arch1 or arch2 f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is the same for config1 3 this same reasoning also explains why config4 5 exhibit vastly different responses for f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω as x f s 3 is contained within z e q 2 in eq 24 this dependency between f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω and x f s 3 has the effect of both lowering as in config4 and increasing as in config5 the frequency response of f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω relative to config1 3 the benefit to increasing power capture via increasing f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is clear in eq 38 with config5 displaying the superior response another important parameter to review is u ˆ r ω as it not only influences the power capture in eq 38 but informs a wec designer of predicted end stop collisions falnes 1999 in comparing config1 with config2 as noted above f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω is the same but the power capture response of config2 is larger based on eq 38 this necessitates that u ˆ r ω cos γ must compensate with cos γ 1 and u ˆ r ω increasing which is what we observe in fig 10c hence the effect of transitioning an srpa between an amplitude control pto as in config1 to a complex conjugate controlled pto as in config2 or config3 is to realize larger device motions resulting in increased power capture falnes 2002 this choice incurs additional risk to the wec developer as there is a higher probability of end stop collisions due to float spar oscillations the conclusion here is that config1 3 based on arch1 and arch2 are innately challenged as increases in power capture are only based on increasing the oscillation amplitude across the pto proceeding on we compare config3 based on arch2 with config4 and config5 based on arch3 in exploring fig 10a we note config4 is only larger in p u ω relative to config3 in the frequency range ω 2 r a d s as a result of both larger f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω and u ˆ r ω in contrast config5 exhibits the largest p u ω response over the entire frequency range of 1 5 ω 4 r a d s which is clearly attributed to a significantly larger force response f ˆ p t o c l a m p ω with the added benefit of a small velocity response u ˆ r ω clearly the power capture response of config5 based on arch3 is superior to all the alternatives in this analysis and it remains to discuss how the reactance x f s 3 o p t 2 can be realized using machinery 5 subsystem architecture design and technology innovation up to this point we have identified a high performing configuration in config5 of arch3 however we have yet to specify how the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t 2 will be physically realized section 5 1 will focus on a brief review of a promising technology inerters as applied to wave energy conversion section 5 2 will follow by presenting a subsystem circuit that is systematically substituted for the optimal force source element in this substitution we will apply realistic physical constraints on the design and generate a feasible power capture response based on approximating the optimal force source frequency response in section 5 3 we will compare these power capture results against config1 2 5 in fig 10a experimental data previously published by beatty et al 2015 and the srpa power capture limit p u m a x o p t previously published by bubbar and buckham 2018 finally we conclude by presenting an explanation of how these power capture responses relate to the complexity of a wec control regime 5 1 review of inerter technology developed by smith 2002 and formally introduced into the wave energy community by bubbar and buckham 2018 inerters are mechanical devices capable of temporarily storing and delivering mechanical reactive power during an oscillation cycle inerters achieve this through converting relative translational mechanical motion into rotational motion of a flywheel which exerts an opposing reaction force proportional to the relative acceleration as measured at the device nodes this proportionality constant is known as the inertance has si units of kilograms and is denoted as m e f f in this work in general the inertance is calculated as the product of the transmission ratio squared β 2 with the moment of inertia of the flywheel j as in eq 39 hu et al 2017 and semi active inerters are devices for which online adjustments of the inertance are permitted chen et al 2014 39 m e f f β 2 j similar to mass elements inerters induce a phase delay between the reaction force and the relative translational velocity as measured between its terminals at present three types of inerters exist 1 rack and pinion smith 2002 2 reverse driven ball screw chen et al 2009 and 3 hydraulic wang et al 2011 for which the definition of β varies with each type inerters are signified as a flywheel in the mechanical circuit framework with the frequency domain constitutive equation described in table 2 5 2 substitution of force sources for invoking technology innovation for config5 to operate under resonant control the force source reactance x f s 3 is scheduled across the operating frequency range to ensure x e q 2 o p t 2 in eq 30 is satisfied the force source at this point is still conceptual a physical embodiment has not been defined the utility of establishing the optimal force source reactance x f s 3 o p t 2 in eq 33 prior to defining the physical embodiment is it provides wec designers with a tangible design constraint prior to specifying how this constraint must be satisfied thereby opening up the possibility for innovative designs in reviewing the schematic of arch3 in fig 2c we note the conspicuous proposal of interfacing the spar to the ocean floor via x f s 3 such a conceptual design although predicted to increase device performance is highly impractical in deep water operation in reality our choice of specifying the topology in arch3 was to allow for a complete generalization of the ensuing conceptual design space with an expectation that we would replace x f s 3 with a feasible topology of linear mechanical components for example we present a series of subsystems formed from linear mechanical components which can satisfy this lone requirement in fig 11 a semi active inerter interfaced between the spar and ocean floor b variable spring interfaced between the spar and ocean floor c variable hydrodynamic added mass via deformable spar hull d variable physical mass via water ballasting and e reaction mass internal to the spar interfaced with a parallel combination of a semi active inerter and constant spring although we have presented five potential subsystem circuits in fig 11a e this list is by no means comprehensive in this work we select the subsystem circuit of fig 11e to perform our substitution and provide a physical embodiment of x f s 3 in the corresponding subsystem the geometry control variable is the inertance m e f f ω whereas the reaction mass m 3 and coupled spring k 3 are constant and require specification as a first step to maintain an equitable comparison we must ensure the total mass of the spar and the reaction mass subsystem in this configuration is the same as the mass of the original spar used in beatty et al s experimental work as such we choose to set the sum of the masses m 2 and m 3 in config5 equal to the mass of beatty et al s original spar following m 2 m 3 57 5 kg next to offset the gravitational force from m 3 and place it at the centre of travel inside the spar we specify a constant spring stiffness of k 3 2000 n m to determine the inertance m e f f ω frequency response required to enforce x f s 3 o p t 2 we develop an equation describing the equivalent reactance of this subsystem circuit by applying circuit simplification transformations to the subsystem circuit of fig 11e we then equate this expression to x f s 3 o p t 2 required to enforce optimal phase control yielding eq 40 finally we substitute the impedance relationships cf table 1 bubbar et al 2018 for each term in eq 40 and solve for the optimal inertance m e f f o p t ω to give eq 41 40 x f s 3 o p t ω ℑ m z m e f f z k 3 z m 3 x m e f f x k 3 x m 3 x m e f f x k 3 x m 3 41 m e f f o p t ω k 3 m 3 x f s 3 o p t 2 ω ω m 3 k 3 ω ω ω m 3 x f s 3 o p t 2 ω we note in calculating m e f f o p t ω using eq 41 we must supply the updated value for m 2 57 5 k g into eq 32 to calculate x f s 3 o p t 2 the frequency response of m e f f o p t ω is plotted in fig 12 with two key observations first m e f f o p t ω becomes negative at ω 3 5 r a d s which is impossible to satisfy with the chosen subsystem design second a vertical asymptote is observed at ω 3 85 r a d s where the denominator of eq 41 tends to zero drastically extending the range of m e f f o p t ω to circumvent these challenges we select a feasible inertance operating range of m e f f m e f f min m e f f max 100 830 k g we choose m e f f min 100 k g as extreme low values of inertance are challenging to achieve due to the quadratic relationship of the moment of inertia with the radius of gyration as inferred in eq 39 this feasible inertance range allows for m e f f o p t ω to be satisfied for the frequency range of ω 1 5 3 16 r a d s with the compromise of setting m e f f 100 k g for all frequencies in the range 3 16 ω 4 r a d s in specifying these realistic design constraints we have in essence created a new configuration we label as config6 for which we will present a comparative power capture response in fig 13 of section 5 3 to outline the consequence of this trade off the combination of the wec model parameters and the chosen subsystem circuit created a scenario in which the full range of x e q 2 o p t 2 could not be satisfied across the frequency spectrum trade offs were required to allow for a feasible configuration that implemented resonant control for a majority of the frequency range to further broaden the bandwidth of operation a wec designer may consider 1 redesigning the device to alter the wec model parameters to allow for a more suitable frequency response of x e q 2 o p t 2 to be satisfied by a feasible range of m e f f o p t and or 2 replacing x f s 3 with a different subsystem circuit which theoretically can satisfy x e q 2 o p t 2 through supplying the required negative reactance values of x f s 3 o p t 5 3 comparison of numerical results with experimental data in this final section we quantify the power capture performance of config1 2 5 6 proposed in this work in relation to data obtained from experimental trials performed by beatty et al 2015 for which these configurations are based to begin we define the datasets observed in fig 13 six overlaid datasets of power capture as a function of excitation frequency are noted the first three are config1 2 5 originally presented in fig 10a and described in detail in section 4 2 next we observe p e x p based on the experimental trails conducted by beatty et al 2015 performed in a monochromatic wave regime using a pto simulator beatty et al 2017 that generates an amplitude controlled pto force response falnes 2002 as originally presented by beatty et al 2015 there is good alignment of config1 with p e x p and thus confidence in the linearized hydrodynamic and inertial parameters used in all the configurations presented the next dataset is config6 defined using the subsystem circuit of fig 11e in section 5 and based on a feasible operating range of m e f f ω for best approximating x f s 3 o p t 2 clearly the power capture response of config6 is coincident with config5 until ω 3 16 r a d s the frequency at which the inerter of config6 can no longer supply the required inertance to maintain resonant control above ω 3 16 r a d s we observe a steep decline in power capture the final dataset is p u m a x o p t represents the upper bound in power capture by a srpa with a complex conjugate controlled pto and an optimally set inertial modulated spar as originally introduced by bubbar and buckham 2018 to understand how a wec designer leaps up on the configuration chart of fig 13 we explore the relationship between the complexity of the wec control regimes to the resulting power capture performance when the wec is represented in canonical form we first qualitatively describe the complexity of the wec control regime as a combination of both the 1 number of simultaneous control parameters and 2 the dependencies of these control parameters upon one another a summary of these attributes are pictorially represented in fig 14 for the configurations considered clearly config1 with the lowest power capture performance enacts the simplest control regime an amplitude controlled pto with r p t o set optimally to eq 3 as the single control variable with no geometry control feature set present to influence the system dynamics next config2 enacts a more complicated control regime with improved power capture utilizing a complex conjugate pto with two controlled parameters r p t o set optimally to eq 21 and x p t o set optimally to eq 22 but again without a geometry control feature set present the subsequent configuration is config5 with again two controlled parameters however there is an additional dependency between these parameters manifesting in a master slave relationship bubbar et al 2018 for which the value set in the master parameter z f s n influences the optimal value set in the slave parameter r p t o optimal power capture is achieved when the spar dynamics are set through z f s n to induce system resonance with r p t o being subsequently set based on z f s n to maximize the power capture finally the most complex and highest performing regime is the p u max o p t configuration containing three controllable parameters one master parameter z f s n which influences the spar dynamics and two slave parameters x p t o and r p t o which set the resonant state and maximize power capture respectively in reviewing fig 13 we note the gap between config2 and config5 is substantial justifying the added complexity of introducing a master slave relationship however the gap between config5 and p u m a x o p t is smaller and requires an additional dependent control parameter introducing a further complex technological design challenge clearly this relationship between wec control complexity and power capture is non linear and thus a wec developer must cautiously consider the appropriate control complexity to power capture ratio applicable for their development program 6 conclusions for wave energy to become an economically viable form of renewable energy the power capture performance of wec devices must continue to improve to succeed with this challenge wec developers must be encouraged to focus on devices with more promising power capture potential early on in the conceptual design phase of a development program to support the identification of wec architectures with a promising power capture performance we proposed an analytical method previously unavailable to wec developers based on transforming an arbitrarily complex wec architecture into a simplified canonical form to extract analytical expressions on how to achieve system resonance we followed this proposal with a case study implementing the method to extract design insights to compare five wec configurations based upon three complex srpa wec architectures the last two of which incorporated an embedded geometry control feature set we then demonstrated using numerical models that although the wec architectures are similar in topology power capture performance can vary greatly necessitating important considerations on wec topology and its influence on the equivalent single body excitation force early in the conceptual phase of development we followed by demonstrating how the generality of the analytical method offered a performance target for the design of a subsystem without constraining the design to a specific technology we revealed how multiple potential subsystems could be simultaneously considered to satisfy the analytical performance requirements leading to the selection of a subsystem circuit implementing inertial modulation using inerter technology finally we presented an explanation of a power capture hierarchy of the wec configurations under study in the context of the ensuing complexity of the control regime revealed through our numerical analysis although this work has offered a new viewpoint on the utility of monochromatic linear frequency domain wec models in the conceptual design stage of a development program our future outlook will focus on the following areas 1 exploration of alternative subsystem circuits capable of satisfying the optimal spar reactance 2 sensitivity analysis of the presented control parameters in the context of power capture 3 methods for developing time domain wec models operating under the control regimes presented 4 fabricating a scaled model using an inerter and performing experimental trails in a wave tank and 5 developing this procedure for application to multi degrees of freedom wec architectures

22154,results are presented of a benchmark and uncertainty assessment study organised by the marstruct virtual institute on global linear wave loads on damaged ship the study has two aims to acquire valuable information regarding damage modelling in seakeeping analysis of damaged ships and to contribute to a rational approach for definition of the model uncertainty of linear seakeeping tools eight institutes participated in the benchmark with six codes representative of important linear seakeeping theories in use nowadays the benchmark ship is the dtmb 5415 hull with well documented and accessible data to perform seakeeping analysis and experimental results for motion and global wave loads the uncertainty analysis is performed using the frequency independent model error as the uncertainty measure the analysis is performed for vertical motions vertical and horizontal global wave load components and for torsional moments uncertainty measures of individual motion and load predictions are presented and compared in addition a comparative analysis of linear seakeeping theories is performed and the accuracy of the simplified methods used for the prediction of seakeeping of a damaged ship is assessed finally recommendations are provided for efforts to improve modelling uncertainties in transfer functions of wave loads on damaged ships keywords benchmark study seakeeping model experiments damaged ship wave loads uncertainty assessment 1 introduction wave induced ship motions and the associated loads have been the topic of research for several decades because of their crucial importance for ship operational and structural safety analytical and numerical seakeeping analysis methods have been developed based on mathematical models that have different degrees of accuracy depending on the assumptions on which they are based this implies that different degrees of uncertainty will be present when predicting a ship seakeeping performance by different types of theories knowledge of the accuracy of the methods for predicting wave induced loads is especially important when using direct computational methods in ship structural design in particular direct methods based on first principles are used within a structural reliability framework when dealing with new ship types being outside of the scope of the rules of ship classification societies parunov et al 2007 another important area of application of ship structural reliability methods is the development of decision support systems that may be useful for navigation guidance papanikolaou et al 2014 reliability formulations e g guedes soares et al 1996 require the inclusion of the accuracy or variability of the predictions of computational methods which are normally represented by random variables representing the model uncertainty ostergaard et al 1996 guedes soares 1997 the hierarchy of methods for prediction of wave induced ship motions and loads is regularly reviewed and updated by the committee i 2 loads of the international ship and offshore structures congress issc hirdaris et al 2014 temarel et al 2016 seakeeping methods may roughly be divided into linear methods and nonlinear methods of different level of complexity linear methods used nowadays are those based on strip theory st and those based on 3d boundary element method 3d bem commercially available or open linear strip theory codes are waveship det norske veritas 1993 napa napa oy 2017 scores ssc 1972 and pdstrip söding et al 2006 among others 3d bem uses either a wave green s function wgf or a rankine source rs as a source potential to satisfy boundary conditions 3d bem codes using wgf are usually formulated in the frequency domain as exemplified by well known codes wamit newman et al 1995 wadam det norske veritas 1994 hydrostar bureau veritas 2011 newdrift papanikolaou and schellin 1992 and waveload fd lloyd s register 2011 for example 3d bem codes using a rankine source are preferred in a time domain typical example being code wasim det norske veritas 2004 nonlinear methods are outside of the scope of the present paper although a review of methods dealing also with nonlinearities is covered in detail by hirdaris et al 2014 nonlinear seakeeping methods are divided in level 2 to level 6 methods with increasing complexity and computational efforts level 2 methods also known as froude krylov nonlinear methods are the most popular since they capture many important nonlinear effects with reasonable computational time level 6 methods comprise different types of computational fluid dynamics methods that include viscous effects handling breaking waves spray and water flowing on to and off the ship s deck more detailed taxonomy for hydrodynamic methods and comparisons between different methods and experiments is provided in hirdaris et al 2016 the vast majority of published works studied ship motions and dynamic wave loads acting on a ship in the intact condition in fact benchmark studies involving linear responses of intact ships have been considered in the past guedes soares 1990a have used published results of the response amplitude operators of wave induced responses of different ship types calculated by various codes mainly based on the strip theory to derive the numerical values of the model uncertainty formulated in guedes soares 1991 the results of the uncertainty in the transfer functions were combined with the uncertainty of the wave spectral shape guedes soares 1990b so as to produce the uncertainty in short term sea states schellin et al 1996 which was then used as a basis for the uncertainty in long term predictions guedes soares 1996 1999 this last study was a benchmark made within the issc committee i 2 loads involving several classification societies using their standard codes for wave induced responses this approach was also extended to deal with non linear wave induced load predictions which were represented by the bias of a model uncertainty factor that was applied to the linear predictions guedes soares 1993 guedes soares and schellin 1998 in the last decade the study on wave induced loads in damaged ships have also been accomplished although still in a fairly limited manner damage of ships may occur due to collision with another ship grounding or some other type of accident one of the main driving forces for studying damaged ships are the requirements imposed by the international maritime organisation imo in the goal based standards gbs imo 2004 stating explicitly that ships should be designed to have sufficient strength to withstand the wave and internal loads in specified damaged conditions this requirement is motivated by the fact that a large number of ship accidents continue to occur despite the advances with the navigation systems and that these accidents can cause the loss of cargos pollution of environment and even loss of human lives so it is very important to ensure an acceptable safety level for damaged ships unfortunately adequate structural strength in an intact condition does not necessarily guarantee an acceptable safety margin in damaged conditions for that reason the loading changes due to damage should be considered in the design phase similarly as for the intact ship structural reliability methods are used for the structural safety assessment of damaged ship requiring model uncertainty of wave induced loads iacs 2014 benchmark studies have an important role to assess model uncertainties of wave induced loads codes usually in benchmark studies several participants perform their own hydrodynamic study of the benchmark ship and then compare results mutually as well as with experimental results in this approach there is experimental uncertainty making it very difficult to ensure that experimental results are a perfect representation of the physical reality kim and hermansky 2014 in addition there are additional uncertainties when using experimental results measured in towing tank to represent ship in a full scale and in confused seas nevertheless model test experimental results obtained in towing tanks are conveniently used as reference values to validate the output of numerical methods in past decades several benchmark studies were undertaken to determine model uncertainty of wave induced loads on ships papanikolaou and schellin 1995 and schellin et al 1996 2003 compared linear responses of various types of ships to regular waves obtained by using the strip theory and a 3d panel method with model test measurements the purpose was to assess the uncertainty of these methods to analytically predict first order wave induced load effects they concluded that there was no clear tendency indicating more accurate results obtained from strip theories or from the panel method it was also found that even computer codes based on the same theoretical background strip theory may lead to quite different results the same conclusion was obtained in the benchmark study promoted by issc i 2 loads committee in which various classification societies contributed with the results of their strip theory codes showing some spread of results guedes soares 1999 in addition to differences in the theoretical formulation of the codes this could also be the consequence of numerical errors incompleteness of background theory or user s mistake a benchmark worth referring was done within the work of issc loads committee addressing the non linear wave induced loads watanabe and guedes soares 1999 as determined by codes that included mainly the non linear froude krylov component i e level 2 codes according to the classification of hirdaris et al 2014 a benchmark study on ship motions and loads for a 6750 teu containership was recently carried out in connection with the 2nd ittc issc joint workshop in 2014 kim and kim 2016 regarding linear results which are of interest to the present study it was found that predictions of heave and pitch motion in head waves is more accurate compared to the experiments than prediction of vertical wave bending moment vwbm which is a well known result also obtained by guedes soares 1990a and 1991 among others statistical dispersion of results around the mean value is lowest for heave and highest for vwbm while dispersion of pitch results is in between the dispersion of results was actually surprisingly large taking into account that calculations are performed for zero speed and head waves it should be pointed out that this benchmark study was blind i e the participants were not aware of the experimental results before they submitted results of their own computations blind benchmark studies are particularly valuable as any additional adjustment of results based on experimental values is avoided but they are rare as they are difficult to organize however it must be noted that this ship had a hydroelastic response that was analysed in rajendran and guedes soares 2016 and thus linear codes for rigid bodies would be expected to have worse results than in cases that ships are not prone to significant hydroelastic response the present paper follows up from the earlier work expanding it by reporting the first benchmark study on numerical prediction of loads on damaged ship the paper includes valuable information regarding damage modelling and accuracy of the seakeeping tools for damaged ships the benchmark study should also provide a basis for definition of the model uncertainty to be used in structural reliability assessment of damaged ships the subject of the benchmark study is a damaged warship with model scale experimental results published originally by lee et al 2012 the model is suitable for this study as all necessary data to perform seakeeping computations are well documented including the geometry of the vessel in igs format mass properties hydrostatic data damage description and experimental transfer functions of motions and global wave loads for intact and damaged ship the present paper is organised in the following way in section 2 a literature review and description of the methods for computation of wave loads on damaged ships is given in section 3 existing methods for uncertainty assessment of transfer functions of motions and wave induced loads are presented the target ship used in the present benchmark study test conditions participants and verification of hydrodynamic models are described in section 4 in section 5 results of the benchmark are provided and discussed conclusions of the study and recommendations for future research are presented in the last section of the paper 2 seakeeping studies of damaged ships in serious marine accidents as collision or grounding a ship may sustain large damages on the outside shell and the internal structure so that her watertight integrity would be compromised and flooding of some compartments would occur consequently the floating condition and stability of a damaged ship would be changed dramatically her draught will increase and she may significantly heel and trim although the methodology used for the seakeeping of a ship in intact condition is generally applicable to the ship in a damaged condition it must not be blindly applied to damaged ships since this could lead to wrong results one of the differences of damaged vs intact ship behaviour in waves is that the damaged ship could have a varying average floating position if progressive flooding of internal spaces is present this implies the necessity of using nonlinear time domain seakeeping approaches even in the case of waves with small steepness that otherwise could be studied by linear frequency domain methods numerical computations for the prediction of large amplitude motions and global loads of a ro ro ship in intact and damaged conditions were conducted by chan et al 2002 2003 the time domain approach to the coupled problems of damaged ship in waves and motion of water inside flooded compartment is described by santos and guedes soares 2008 the numerical efficiency of the method was recently improved by introducing adaptive meshing by rodrigues and guedes soares 2017 although time domain nonlinear methods are promising as a result of a more detailed modelling of some features they do not necessarily compare to the experiments better than much simpler linear frequency domain methods even those based on linear strip theory lee et al 2012 there is a tendency in past years to use frequency domain methods by assuming that the ship has already reached a stable equilibrium position around which it oscillates in waves two practical methods for modelling wave induced motions and the resulting structural loads of damaged ships are proposed by downes et al 2007 the first method is the added weight method in which it is assumed that the mass of the flooded seawater becomes integral part of the ship mass and moves with the ship the second approach is the lost buoyancy method where the structure of the damaged tanks and all of their contents are removed from the vessel the added weight method is more suitable for cases where the breach is small even if the amount of floodwater is large e g due to progressive flooding the lost buoyancy method is suitable for cases where the damaged compartments have large breaches and there is free flow of floodwater between the damaged compartments and the sea the hydrodynamic interaction between the waves and the structure of the opening remains after removing the tank from the ship hull which needs to be modelled in the lost buoyancy method the added weight method is simpler for practical applications as it requires only the modification of the ship masses and equilibrium condition while the method of lost buoyancy requires a significant change of the intact ship model for hydrodynamic simulation both methods originates from ship hydrostatics damage stability calculations and result in identical final equilibrium floating condition in calm water while the metacentric height and righting lever curve are different thus the assumptions about the method introduce variation in the wave load prediction because of its simplicity the added weight method is often used in seakeeping assessment of damaged ship thus downes et al 2007 by using the added weight method showed that there is no significant difference between the transfer functions of vwbm between intact and damaged ship nevertheless they showed that the peak value of transfer function of vwbm increases with increasing damage size and heel angle that study indicated also that the change in global hull loading may be much smaller for tankers than for ro ro ferries and cruise ships folsø et al 2008 have performed seakeeping computations on a damaged oil tanker by the linear 3d bem the damage scenarios corresponded to water ingress into the forepeak or the double hull ballast tanks of the ship sailing in full load for the case of the flooded ballast tank in the midship area they obtained transfer functions of the vwbm larger than those evaluated for the intact condition an interesting conclusion from the paper was that keeping a bow quartering encounter angle with the higher freeboard on the weather side minimizes vwbm lee et al 2012 applied a computational tool based on a two dimensional linear method to predict the hydrodynamic loads of a damaged warship they obtained larger vwbm for the damaged ship compared to the intact one the global dynamic wave induced loads calculated using 2d linear methods were also compared to measurements in head and stern quartering waves differences between computations and measurements of global dynamic wave induced load response amplitudes were reasonable in general however linear strip theory overestimated measurements for both intact and damaged ship results of damaged ship seakeeping assessment using the lost buoyancy method are scarce from the literature parunov et al 2015 compared the two methods of added weight and lost buoyancy for assessment of vertical bending moment of a damaged oil tanker in head waves using the 3d bem code hydrostar bureau veritas 2011 the predicted result showed a larger value for added weight and lower values for lost buoyancy method in comparison with the intact ship evaluation more extensive comparison was performed by jafaryeganeh and guedes soares 2018 using wamit they provisionally concluded that the performance of the lost buoyancy method is better for horizontal load components while the added weight method provides more accurate agreement with experiments for vertical shear forces and bending moments a specific issue appearing in the seakeeping analysis of a damaged vessel with heel and trim is that a cross section defined in the global coordinate system is different from that defined in the local ship coordinate system consequently sectional forces and moments are also different computations are normally performed with reference to a system including the vertical axis normal to the water plane to compare and analyse forces and moments at different heel angles loads need to be described in the ship reference system where the local vertical axis is contained in the plane of symmetry of the ship for some of the output responses a post processing is therefore necessary based on a simple vector combination but also taking into account phase angles folsø et al 2008 in the present study however heel and trim angles are fairly low about 1 for such low angles differences between global and local coordinate systems are negligible and are therefore not considered it should be noted that folsø et al 2008 used heeling angles up to 22 5 and therefore transformation of coordinate systems was necessary in that case another important topic is the influence of sloshing of the liquid in damaged compartments there is much uncertainty and lack of research in this field jia and moan 2012 concluded that the effect of sloshing on vertical bending moment is small except in beam seas while the effect of sloshing on horizontal bending moment is large especially in beam seas although the problem could be solved by bem the multimodal approach shows clear advantages especially in terms of computational speed compared to bem jia and moan 2012 another interesting example of simplified application for combined sloshing and seakeeping analysis is the fairly good comparison against experiments presented by hirdaris et al 2010 using lr waveload rigid body programme experiments with damaged ships are important for the validation of numerical methods korkut et al 2004 presented experimental results for motions of an intact and damaged ro ro ship in regular waves at zero speed while the experimental results are extended in korkut et al 2005 for the global loads of intact and damaged ship lee et al 2012 conducted an experimental campaign on a 1 100 scale model of the dtmb 5415 frigate hull and presented results for the motion and loads of the intact and damaged ship damage scenarios included symmetrical and unsymmetrical flooding the same experimental results are described in ssc 459 but with more details provided regarding model and measured responses ssc 2011 while original and full details are provided by lee et al 2006 begovic et al 2011 presented results for motion and global loads obtained from an experimental test program in which the ship model used was the same 1 100 scale model of the frigate begovic et al 2013 studied the motion response characteristics of the same dtmb model 5415 in intact and damaged conditions but measurements are carried out with a 1 51 scale model the effect of model scale is discussed according to the results of two test campaigns carried out in different scales domeh et al 2015 presented an experimental study on a segmented model in waves the novelty of that experimental research was systematic investigation of the influence of permeability and damage size on the vertical motions of damaged hull the recent study by begovic et al 2017 focused on the measurement of hull girder loads on the segmented model of dtmb 5415 at zero speed in intact and damaged conditions using a 1 51 scale model although the damage opening was on the side two compartments at midship were flooded along the whole breadth of the model particular emphasis of the study was on nonlinear effects due to the wave height variation the experimental results of heave roll and pitch motion were presented together with the results from begovic et al 2013 to highlight the repeatability and uncertainty of the measured raos comparison of measured loads showed that the structural response values of the damaged model are noticeably larger than those of the intact model an investigation of the nonlinear effects due to the wave height variation on the shear force and bending moment values for the intact and damaged warship is carried out by begovic et al 2017 in general it was concluded that the vertical shear force and the vertical bending moment values both for the intact and damaged ships exhibit a strong dependency on wave amplitude variations at the wave frequencies around the natural frequencies of the vessel similar research presented previously by lee at al 2012 showed that the measurements under large waves and small waves are not significantly different 3 model uncertainty in transfer functions the transfer functions represent the amplitude of the motions or of the load effects induced by waves of unit amplitude on a ship the prediction of the transfer functions of the load effects is one of the most important factors that affect the calculation of the extreme values of wave induced load effects in both short and long term conditions guedes soares 1991 the model uncertainty in transfer functions may be evaluated by comparisons of the experimental results with the theoretical predictions very often such comparisons have been done only visually with the subjective conclusion about general engineering accuracy of linear seakeeping theories to eliminate subjective judgements about accuracy quantitative methods for model uncertainty of linear transfer functions have been proposed by guedes soares 1991 he suggested the simplest formulation of the model uncertainty of transfer functions in the form of the frequency independent model error fime denoted herein with greek letter ϕ thus if the theoretical results were all multiplied by a constant fit factor ϕ it would be possible to have the transfer function adjusted so as to coincide with the mean experimental values the variability of the experimental values about this adjusted transfer function would represent the experimental error with a mean value close to zero thus the model error ϕ represents a systematic error or the bias of the theory if the model error is known the theory can still be used and its predictions can be improved by compensating for the effect of the model error as fime is used for uncertainty quantification in the present study it is described in the following paragraphs guedes soares 1991 the measurements h ˆ i of the transfer function can be represented by 1 h ˆ i ϕ h i ε i where h i is the calculated value of the transfer function at the frequency ω i and ε i is a random error in the measurement made at frequency ω i this representation assumes that the measurement errors are independent of wave frequency the value of ϕ can be estimated by minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors which is expressed by 2 q i h ˆ i ϕ h i 2 i ε i 2 the value of ϕ that minimizes that sum is obtained by differentiating q with respect to ϕ and equating it to zero this results in the following expression for the estimate of ϕ 3 ϕ i h ˆ i h i i h i 2 this expression has been applied to the published data that compare theoretically determined and measured transfer functions of vwbm guedes soares 1991 theoretical calculations were done by different versions of linear strip theory which differ in the detailed way in which the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated these differences lead to significantly different predictions of transfer functions guedes soares 1991 the conclusion of the study was that the theories underestimate the measurements by an amount that varies between 10 and 22 however it should be noted that these numbers are average values obtained for different heading angles speeds and block coefficients fime ϕ varies considerably for different combinations of these parameters mathematical interpretation of fime as given by equation 3 is that it represents the slope of the regression line forced to pass through the origin it is a convenient uncertainty measure as it gives immediate information if the theory overestimates or underestimates measurements fime larger than 1 indicates that theory underestimates measurements while fime lower than 1 means that theory overestimates experimental values to illustrate a practical application of fime consider the transfer functions presented in fig 1 left in addition to experimentally obtained transfer function two other transfer functions obtained by two different theories theory 1 and theory 2 are shown in fig 1 left visually it can be seen that theory 1 agrees very well with the experiments while theory 2 obviously overestimates experimental values a plot of measured vs experimental transfer functions for both theories is presented in fig 1 right regression lines forced to pass through origin are presented in fig 1 right for both theories together with their equations it may be seen that fime read 1 06 and 0 65 for theory 1 and 2 respectively therefore in average across all frequencies theory 1 underestimates experimental values so that it should be multiplied by factor ϕ 1 06 while theory 2 overestimates experiments so that it should be multiplied by ϕ 0 65 in order to get best average agreement to the experiments the fime represents the systematic difference also known as bias between experiments and predictions from a given source in addition to bias there is a dispersion of experimental values around regression line represented by fime such dispersion may be measured by the variance of individual data points around regression line if the model error at each frequency is determined as ϕ i h ˆ i h i then the variance σ ϕ 2 may be calculated as 4 σ ϕ 2 i 1 n ϕ i ϕ 2 n where ϕ is the mean value or the fime given by equation 3 square root of the variance represents standard deviation σ ϕ of the model error while the coefficient of variation cov may be calculated as 5 cov ϕ σ ϕ ϕ one drawback of equations 4 and 5 is that ϕ i can take very large values for small and hence unimportant predicted transfer functions h i if h i is close to zero then even very small value of h ˆ i results in extremely large ϕ i which can have decisive influence on the total variance in addition to the variance the dispersion of points around the regression line may be expressed by the coefficient of determination r 2 presented in fig 1 right large coefficient of determination above 0 8 indicates high confidence of the approximation of points by the regression line obviously from fig 1 right confidence in fime is much better for theory 1 than for theory 2 the major disadvantage of the fime is that it gives equal importance to all frequencies although some frequency ranges are more important than others when a response spectrum is calculated one way to improve fime is by calculating the variance of the short term response which is the integral under the area of the response spectrum and reflects the shape of the transfer function and the wave spectrum as well as the relative position between their peaks as originally proposed by guedes soares 1991 the report ssc 363 ssc 1991 expanded the proposed approach in the following way to quantify the uncertainty in short term vwbm due to errors in transfer functions a postulate a linear model for the root mean square rms bending moment b transform the data on transfer function into data on the rms bending moment by using some sea spectrum for example the issc spectrum and by integrating over frequency c calculate the ratio of measured over predicted rms bending moments this procedure removes the individual frequency sensitivity by integrating over frequency in step b following the proposed approach the ratio of rms or standard deviations χ may be approximated as 7 χ 1 1 n h ˆ ω i 2 s ω i 1 1 n h ω i 2 s ω i where s ω i is the wave energy spectrum at frequency ω i while h ˆ ω i and h ω i represent measured experimental and predicted calculated transfer function at the same frequency respectively since the most probable extreme value in the short term sea state is proportional to the rms the ratio χ approximates the ratio between the most probable extreme values resulting from experimental and predicted transfer functions a factor χ larger than one means that the most probable extreme value in the short term sea state based on experimental ship response is larger than that of the predicted ship response while χ lower than one indicates that the extreme response based on the experimental transfer functions is lower than that based on the calculated transfer functions the total factored error tfe introduced by ando 1998 is another method to quantify the relation between measured and calculated transfer functions the tfe is defined as the ratio expressed in percentage of the sum of weighted squares of the difference between the magnitudes gain factors of predicted and measured transfer functions to the sum of the weighted squares of the measured values the wave spectrum of the given sea state is used as the weighting factor thus the error of the predicted transfer function at a particular wave frequency is weighted by a measure of its importance for example 100 error in the predicted transfer functions can be insignificant if it occurs at very high or very low frequency ranges where the energy content of the waves is relatively small tfe as proposed by ando is denoted as ε and given by the square root of the following expression 8 ε 2 1 1 n h ˆ ω i h ω i 2 s ω i i 1 n h ˆ ω i 2 s ω i where s ω is the wave energy spectrum obviously tfe is 0 in the case of the perfect agreement between theory and experiments and increases with increasing discrepancies between theory and experiment since ε is usually a small number it is convenient to multiply it by 100 and express ε as percentage one drawback of the equation 8 is that it does not provide information whether the theory underestimates or overestimates measurements as all types of errors increase tfe another way to deal with uncertainties is to assess the effect of uncertainty on transfer functions by calculating long term distributions as proposed by schellin et al 1996 the uncertainty was quantified by obtaining characteristic values of ship responses while a relatively large degree of uncertainty was associated with predicted midship wave induced sectional loads in that study linear response to regular waves obtained from three two dimensional strip theories and one three dimensional panel method was compared with model test measurements for a fast container ship one of the important conclusions from the study was that there was no clear tendency indicating more accurate results obtained from strip theories or from the panel method although the procedure proposed in schellin et al 1996 is appropriate for intact ships the wave induced bending moment of damaged ships should be determined based on the wave condition e g significant wave height and wave length etc at the moment of accident in sea together with the vessel speed in association with a short term response such as several hours or a couple of days or a couple of weeks during the rescue operation class rule formula for estimating the wave bending moments in association with a long term spectrum should not be used for this purpose as well for that reason long term distributions are not considered in the present study the issue of wave load uncertainties requires closer cooperation between hydrodynamic and structural groups and led to the initiation of series of workshops on uncertainty modelling for ships and offshore structures umsos organised by issc international ships and offshore structure congress i 1 environment and i 2 load committees and the ittc international towing tank conference sea keeping and ocean engineering committees the 1st umsos workshop was held in rostock germany in 2012 hirdaris 2014 the 2nd joint ittc issc workshop organised by ittc sea keeping committee which took place on 30 august 2014 in copenhagen focused on the wave induced motions and structural loads on ships and offshore structures including a computational benchmark test for a large container ship kim and kim 2016 a total of seventeen codes participated in the benchmark test from eleven institutes sixty per cent of the participants are based on a 3d bem while remaining codes are based on strip theory and one based on computational fluid dynamic cfd uncertainty measures of linear transfer functions were defined as total differences of the i th participant with respect to the mean value as 9 total difference i j 1 r i j mean j j 1 mean j 100 where r i j is the computational result of the j th frequency component of the i th participant and mean j is the average of the j th component the total difference is used to compare linear tfs the total differences of heave were smaller than 4 with the exception of one participant in the result of pitch the total differences were within 8 it can be considered that all the computational results showed good agreement in heave and pitch tfs however the total differences of vbm were larger than those of heave and pitch motions six participants showed differences larger than 10 and two participants showed differences larger than 20 it is of interest to compare results of benchmark studies on large containerships published in schellin et al 1996 and the recent one published in kim and kim 2016 in order to observe if there is obvious improvement of accuracy of computational tools in the period of last 20 years results of benchmark studies of vwbm at midship for head seas are presented in fig 2 where results from schellin et al 1996 are presented in fig 2 left while results from kim and kim 2016 are shown in fig 2 right by comparing the two benchmark studies it seems that the recent one fig 2 right shows relatively good agreement of mean transfer function with measured values however dispersion of results is still very large it is very important to mention that the benchmark from schellin et al 1996 was performed for high ship speed corresponding to froude number of 0 245 while the benchmark study from kim and kim 2016 was performed for zero ship speed as it is known that accuracy of seakeeping computations is decreasing with increasing speed maron et al 2004 it was expected that the uncertainty of computations of vwbm from schellin et al 1996 would be more reduced it should also be pointed out that the benchmark from schellin et al 1996 is based on experiments originally published in flokstra 1974 and that accuracy of measurements should be improved nowadays and that consequently measurement uncertainty is reduced in the recent benchmark however there is also strong argument in favour of the benchmark from kim and kim 2016 which is a rare blind benchmark study as participants didn t have opportunity to compare their results with experiments and to repair possible gross errors in their hydrodynamic models ittc is concerned by the uncertainty of measurements as an essential element for evaluating the accuracy of experiments or measurements including seakeeping experiments kim and hermansky 2014 following the approach proposed by the iso guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements iso gum ittc recommends grouping of uncertainty components in two categories namely type a and type b based on the method by which they are evaluated type a uncertainty is based on repeated measurements and is characterized by the randomness of the process that is expressed as experimental variance the type b components are estimated by a means other than repeated observations there are currently joint efforts by ittc and issc to find overlaps between different uncertainty measures and to eventually propose unified uncertainty measure for computational and experimental uncertainties 4 outline of the present benchmark study the present benchmark study was carried out to assess the performance and trends of seakeeping codes for the analysis of damaged ships as part of the marstruct virtual institute activities which at the same time contributes to the work of the issc ittc joint committee on uncertainty modelling in waves and wave induced responses eight institutes participated in the benchmark study namely university of zagreb instituto superior tecnico lloyd s register national technical university of athens national technical university of athens hsva university of rijeka university of dubrovnik and napa the ship data and the test matrix were offered to the participants the participants were requested to perform the analysis of intact and damaged ship and to submit their best results for comparison the test matrix was composed of one condition for intact ship linear transfer functions and two conditions for damaged ship linear transfer functions transfer functions were requested for heave and pitch motion as well as for five global load components at strain gauge location horizontal and vertical shear forces horizontal and vertical bending moments as well as torsional moment the ship was exposed to head regular waves beam waves and stern quartering waves for all the conditions while the ship speed was equal to zero in all cases 4 1 target ship the ship used in this benchmark study is the notional us navy destroyer hull 5415 dtmb 5415 the experiments have been carried out at the newcastle university towing tank using a model with a scale of 1 100 details of the facility and equipment used as well as other testing conditions are provided by lee et al 2012 and also by ssc 459 ssc 2011 the tests measured six degree of freedom motion responses of the stationary model without forward speed as well as global loads in intact and damaged conditions for different headings in regular waves the main particulars of the ship and the model are provided in table 1 the same ship has been experimentally tested in other towing tank by begovic et al 2011 and also in 1 51 scale by begovic et al 2017 body lines are provided in fig 3 for this ship the 3d geometry of ship hull in the form of iges file is also available as shown in fig 4 simman 2008 mass distribution in the intact condition is shown in fig 5 the six degrees of freedom motions of the model were measured using qualisys motion capture system lee et al 2012 the forces and moments were obtained from a five component force gauge f y f z m x m y and m z type 206 5c manufactured by danish hydraulic institute dhi the gauge was located at 545 43 mm from ap longitudinally and at the centre of the depth to public spaces deck which is 62 83 mm from the base line that is the location where raos for global forces and moments are calculated by participants 4 2 test conditions the condition for linear tfs of the intact ship is named intact and the two damaged conditions for linear tfs of the damaged ship are named damage scenario 2 ds2 and damage scenario 3 ds3 the details of the conditions are given in table 2 these conditions are selected from the test matrix of the experiment as given in lee et al 2012 thus the experimental results of the conditions are available to be compared with computational results all test conditions are without forward speed for each condition the participants are required to provide tfs of heave pitch and five global load components at section with strain gauge 545 43 mm from ap the still water load is not included in results detailed description including drawings of damaged conditions are provided in lee et al 2012 and ssc 2011 while an overview of ship 3d geometry with two damage scenarios is presented in fig 6 the damage scenario ds2 represents a transversally unsymmetrical flooding condition caused by a 12 m long by 9 m high opening in the starboard side shell the opening extends equally into machine rooms 2 and 3 located amidships and penetrates into the double bottom causing water ingress in four fuel tanks on the starboard side therefore heel is introduced on the starboard side in this damaged condition damage scenario ds3 represents transversally symmetrical flooding condition simulating a raking damage in the bow region experiments were performed for 9 wave frequencies as shown in table 3 also experiments were performed for small and large wave heights as linear responses are the subject of the present investigation only small wave heights are considered in the uncertainty assessment experimental data from lee et al 2012 which includes the asymmetric damage not easily found in the literature are used in the present study the same ship model has been tested in begovic et al 2011 in different towing tank and also the same hull but in scale 1 51 has been tested and published in begovic et al 2017 in the last there is very detailed comparison of different experimental data with the diagrams of nondimensional responses there is also an issue in the effect of the weight of load cell in the mass distribution in the experiments of begovic et al 2017 the weight of the load cell is 1 03 kg and total model weight is 63 5 kg so the considered mass distribution in fig 5 is realistic in the lee et al 2012 the model has overall weight of 8 5 kg so the load cell represents very concentrated weight as was shown in begovic et al 2011 among these three works data presented by begovic et al 2017 are expected to have the best accuracy as they are relative to bigger model 10 ft where the scale effect is playing towards better accuracy comparative analysis of experimental results presented in all three studies showed that the vertical bending moment and vertical shear force values in head seas were generally in fair agreement between the three studies however the overall agreement of some of global load components was poor in beam seas since the agreement in many cases between three studies is fair and since the study of lee et al 2012 includes more heading angles and asymmetric damage cases only the results from lee et al 2012 are considered herein for consistency of the uncertainty analysis 4 3 participants a total of eight institutions participated in the benchmark test with six codes the details of the participants are given in table 4 four codes are based on a wave green function s wgf 3d bem formulated in frequency domain wgf 3d bem is currently considered one of the most common method for seakeeping analysis one code is time domain 3d bem based on rankine sources while one code is based on strip theory all participants submitted results for intact ship and also for ds3 which causes symmetrical flooding in transversal direction two participants haven t submitted results for ds2 with unsymmetrical damage the reason is that one of codes does not support unsymmetrical mass distribution while another one of participants could not spend substantial amount of time required for modelling of heeled ship although it was left to participants to choose their own method for modelling the damaged ship all participants used the added weight method the probable reason is that participants found the added weight method simpler for application compared to the method of lost buoyancy the ship is assumed to be undamaged in the added weight method but flooded tanks are assumed to be filled up to water line level of damaged ship in calm water the permeability of 1 0 has been used here which is realistic for the model but not for real ships although most of 3d bem codes are able to account for sloshing the dynamic effect of free surface is not accounted for in the added weight method thus liquid in damaged compartments is assumed to be frozen which is equivalent to adding a rigid mass for shifting the ship centre of gravity and displacement the location of the added weight is specified with the centre of volume of the induced water in the damaged compartment the new draft trim and heel in the damaged ship are employed in the added weight method additionally the added mass assumption causes a change of metacentric height buoyancy and mass distribution and mass moment of inertia relative to the intact ship for each damage scenario all the mentioned properties should be updated for providing the seakeeping model and predicting the still water and wave loads regarding meshing of the wetted surface no particular requirements or instructions are given to the participants it is left to their own expertise and experience to decide about appropriate panel size for the analysis the number of panels or stripes used in discretization of the wetted surface by participants is presented in table 5 some hydrodynamic panel models of wetted surfaces are presented in fig 7 linearized viscous damping correction is particularly important for torsional moment calculation however this value was not provided to participants but left to their own judgement most of participants reported that they used the non dimensional linearized viscous roll damping as 5 of critical roll damping 4 4 hydrostatic component the participants were required to submit hydrostatic components of their numerical models the submerged volume of the intact ship in still water and longitudinal centres of buoyancy are compared in table 6 the reference value of submerged volume reads 8812 m3 while longitudinal centre of gravity reads 71 0 m from ap all results show acceptable differences for the submerged volume and the maximum difference is 5 9 for strip model the participants showing lower submerged volume than the reference value were not able to increase the volume despite efforts to do so this could be the consequence of very fine form of the studied warship it is noted from table 5 that two participants used much lower number of elements for modelling the wetted surface the centres of buoyancy of the participants are located between 1 7 toward ap and 1 towards fp of lbp from lcg compared to the benchmark performed by kim and kim 2016 the results are slightly worse for the submerged volume but better for lcb comparison of hydrostatic particulars for two damage scenarios is presented in table 7 it may be noticed from table 7 that the hydrostatic particulars for ds2 are very close to each other however differences for ds3 are appreciable especially lcb and trim calculated by the strip theory also submerged volume modelled by one of participants is considerably larger than of others for ds3 5 comparison of results with discussion transfer functions of calculated amplitudes of ship response are plotted against the non dimensional wave frequency defined as ω sqrt l g where ω is wave circular frequency l ship length and g acceleration of gravity comparative analysis includes measurements performed by lee et al 2012 transfer functions are shown for intact ship and two damage states ds2 ds3 and for three wave headings namely head waves β 180 stern quartering waves β 45 and beam waves β 90 for unsymmetrical damage scenario ds2 two additional headings are considered namely β 315 and β 270 two participants have not submitted results for ds2 and therefore only four codes are compared with experiments for unsymmetrical damage case since it is rather difficult to draw conclusions about uncertainties of predictions just from comparison of transfer function quantification of uncertainties using frequency independent model error fime as described in section 3 is performed fimes for intact ship and two damage scenarios are plotted in same graphs in order to observe the differences also a red horizontal line is drawn through unity indicating perfect correlation between computations and measurements if some value of comparison is placed below the red line that means that in average experiments are overestimated by calculations for that particular transfer function if a value in the graph is over the red line computations underestimate measurements so transfer functions should be multiplied by the value larger than one in order to have best average agreement between computations and measurements in addition the coefficient of variation cov of the model error is also calculated by equations 4 and 5 for each transfer function very large range of covs is found creating difficulties in the presentation of results 5 1 comparison of transfer functions for heave and pitch motion fig 8 and fig 9 present heave amplitude z normalized by the wave amplitude a and pitch amplitude in degrees divided by the wave amplitude a respectively fimes as given by eq 3 for heave and pitch motion are presented in fig 10 covs of model error are presented in fig 11 good agreement of heave transfer functions is noticed for all heading angles and all damage scenarios pitch tfs are also consistent except for beam waves β 90 it can be seen in fig 10 that for the intact ship in beam waves all codes underestimate measured pitch tfs fime higher than 1 pitch motion calculations in ds3 for beam waves consistently overestimate measurements although results seem to be closer to measurements than for intact ship fime for pitch in ds2 for beam waves shows the largest discrepancies compared to the experiments however as may be seen in fig 9 the pitch motion response amplitudes in beam waves are much less than those in head and stern quartering waves so these discrepancies with measured tfs are insignificant for practical purposes results for intact ship are in agreement with those from the recent benchmark study by kim and kim 2016 where the maximum error calculated by equation 7 reads 4 for heave and 8 for pitch of large container ship with zero speed covs of model error are fairly low for heave motion in head and beam waves and for pitch motion in stern quartering waves larger uncertainty of the model error may be observed for heave motion in stern quartering waves dispersion of predicted pitch motion is the largest resulting in cov larger than 1 in all cases this is caused by several predicted values of transfer function very close to zero these values although of insignificant practical merit have large consequences on cov 5 2 comparison of transfer functions for vertical global wave load components transfer functions of vsf and vbm are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively while the corresponding fimes are presented in fig 14 shear forces and bending and torsional moments are normalized by the terms ρagbl and ρagbl 2 respectively where ρ is density of water and b ship breadth for ds2 vsf and vbm are measured and compared for beam and stern quartering waves arriving on undamaged side β 270 and β 315 in order to observe differences with respect to waves acting on damaged side of the ship β 90 and β 45 fimes of vbm and vsf show generally larger dispersion than motion components the correlation between the computations and measurements of global dynamic wave induced load response amplitudes is reasonable for head and stern quartering waves except for strip theory which overestimates measurements fime much lower than 1 the differences of the results in beam waves are in general larger than for other headings but still acceptable except for one participant showing much higher fime of vsf than other participants fimes of vbm and vsf are not much different if incoming beam waves are on damaged β 90 or undamaged β 270 side of the ship it should be noted that the magnitude of vertical global loads in beam waves is usually very small so the difference in numerical prediction would not cause much concern however it may be seen for the lowest graphs in fig 14 that much better agreement to experimental results for vbm and vsf is obtained for stern quartering waves acting on damaged side β 45 than for waves acting on the undamaged side of the ship β 315 results for the vwbm of intact ship in head sea may be compared with those from the benchmark by kim and kim 2016 where six participants showed differences calculated by equation 9 larger than 10 and two participants showed differences larger than 20 it is to be noted that in the study by kim and kim 2016 three out of six participants with differences larger than 10 used 3d bem wgf method total error of vwbm with respect to the mean value of calculated transfer functions is presented in fig 15 differences found in the present study are similar as in the study by kim and kim 2016 maximum error in fig 15 is obtained for the strip theory while 3d methods result in the error less than 10 this may be the evidence of the credibility of the results from the present study covs of model error for vertical load components are presented in fig 16 model error of vbm in head seas shows the lowest coefficient of variation also it is not possible to conclude if there is some important difference of the prediction uncertainty between intact and damaged ship it is interesting to observe however that covs of vbm are reduced for damaged comparing to the intact ship covs of vertical loads components are very large for beam waves and fimes are therefore not very reliable 5 3 comparison of transfer functions for horizontal global wave load components transfer functions of hsf and hbm are presented in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively while the corresponding fimes are presented in fig 19 horizontal bending moments and shear forces for head waves β 180 are measured and compared only for unsymmetrical damage case ds2 since for the intact ship and symmetrical damage case ds3 these are close to zero for ds2 hsf and hbm are measured and compared for beam and stern quartering waves arriving on undamaged side β 270 and β 315 in order to observe differences with respect to waves acting on damaged side of the ship β 90 and β 45 fime of hbm and hsf show larger scatter than vertical load components hsf and hbm of intact ship are underestimated for stern quartering waves probably as the consequence of the small model scale and drifting of the model in the damaged ship sloshing in damaged compartments is an additional source of uncertainty ssc 2011 dispersion of fimes is particularly important for ds2 in beam waves thus hsf in beam waves is underestimated by all participants and for all damage scenarios while hbm for the beam waves is overestimated by all except one participant one participant calculated hsf and hbm that largely underestimated measurements for intact and damaged ship fime much higher than 1 in all three cases it is interesting to observe in fig 19 that fimes for hsf in stern quartering waves are more accurately predicted for damaged than for the intact ship hbm in stern quartering waves is more accurately predicted if waves are incoming from undamaged side β 315 for beam waves the accuracy of the prediction of hsf and hbm is not much different with respect to the direction of incoming waves one important finding is that hbm and hsf for ds2 in head waves are largely underestimated by calculations measured hbm and hsf are about one order of magnitude larger compared to predicted tfs therefore the added weight method seems not able to predict hbm and hsf of the damaged ship in head seas with reasonable accuracy although hbm and hsf are much lower compared to other headings they are potentially important because of the combination with vbm being at maximum for that heading angle covs of model error for horizontal load components are presented in fig 20 compared to the vertical load components covs of model errors for horizontal wave components are rather large this confirms the finding from the analysis of fime that scatter of model error is large and that hbm and hsf are not predicted with satisfactory accuracy 5 4 comparison of transfer functions for torsional moments transfer functions of torsional moments are presented in fig 21 while the corresponding fimes are presented in fig 22 tms for head waves β 180 are measured and compared for unsymmetrical damage case ds2 while for the intact ship and symmetrical damage case ds3 these are close to zero for ds2 tms are measured and compared for beam and stern quartering waves arriving on the undamaged side β 270 and β 315 in order to observe differences with respect to waves acting on the damaged side of the ship β 90 and β 45 the fime of torsional moments is the worst compared to all other load components and is unsatisfactory in almost all cases this poor prediction of torsion is explained in ssc 459 where experimental measurements are described ssc 2011 one of the possible reasons for such a poor performance in torsion is that the maximum measured torsion is very low because of the small scale of the ship model so its measurement is very sensitive to any imperfections calibration of the instruments or electrical noise in the records the other possible reason could be the inherent difficulty in determining the radius of gyration for roll motion and the damping coefficient for roll motion which is a very important motion component influencing the accuracy of the prediction of torsion moments these issues have been reviewed and corrected in the begovic et al 2017 fime for tm in stern quartering waves and in beam waves as may be seen fig 22 is closer to one for the intact than for the damaged ship worsening of results for damaged ship indicates that the effect of sloshing and slamming within the damaged compartments could influence the global dynamic wave load components it also may be noticed from fig 22 that cov of the model error is noticeably lower for intact than for damaged ship indicating lower uncertainty in the fime the cov of model error of damaged ship exceeds 1 in almost all cases the accuracy of predictions of tms for beam and stern quartering waves is not dependent on the side from which waves are acting on the ship 5 5 performance of the added weight method and comparison of seakeeping theories uncertainty analysis may be used to validate the added weight method for the seakeeping analysis of damaged ships as well as for the performance assessment of different seakeeping codes for that purpose different representations of fimes are presented in table 8 while covs of model error are presented in table 9 three 3d bem codes based on wgf are grouped and the average values of fime and cov are calculated in the column 3d bem wgf fime and cov of 3d bem code based on rankine source and fime of strip theory are given in columns 3d bem rs and st respectively in the last column for each damage type the average value for all codes used in the benchmark is provided although only one code used in the analysis and comparison with only one set of experimental results is not enough to validate certain theory it is nevertheless used as an indication and also to present the methodology that can be employed in other seakeeping benchmarks in order to enable analysis of results 0 9 fime 1 1 is considered to represent satisfactory agreement of theory and experiments while fime 0 8 or fime 1 2 is considered as unacceptable correlation between calculation and experiments it should be noted that these fime limits are subjective and indicative in order to simplify the analysis and the interpretation of results based on such subjective interpretation of fime for the intact ship the average theoretical prediction is satisfactory in 50 of the cases while unacceptable in 33 of the cases analysed these figures read 48 and 39 for ds2 and 39 and 44 for ds3 therefore there is a worsening trend of average theoretical prediction for damaged compared to intact ship regarding the performance of individual theories 3d bem wgf method shows unacceptable fime in 33 55 and 50 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively unacceptable prediction of 3d bem rs methods is achieved in 44 45 and 33 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively as for strip theory unacceptable prediction is achieved in 50 and 67 of cases for intact ship and ds3 respectively these percentages include all quantities given in table 8 similarly as for fime in order to enable analysis of results cov 0 5 is considered to represent satisfactory confidence of fime while cov 1 0 is considered as unacceptable dispersion of results around fime subjective cov limits are introduced in order to simplify the analysis and the interpretation of results based on such subjective interpretation of fime for the intact ship the dispersion of model errors around fime is satisfactory in 39 of the cases while unacceptable in 56 of the cases analysed these figures read 35 and 61 for ds2 and 28 and 44 for ds3 similarly as for fime there is a worsening trend of dispersion of the model error regarding performance of individual theories 3d bem wgf method shows unacceptable cov of the model error in 33 65 and 44 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively unacceptable cov of 3d bem rs methods is achieved in 39 45 and 44 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively as for strip theory unacceptable cov is achieved in 50 of cases for intact ship as well as for ds3 these percentages include all quantities given in table 9 5 6 effect of transfer function uncertainty on the short term response consequences of transfer function uncertainties on short term ship responses are determined for the vwbm which is the most important wave load component two uncertainty measures are calculated namely the ratio of standard deviations χ equation 7 and tfe ε equation 8 both ratio of standard deviations χ and tfe ε are calculated for the issc spectrum as the weighting function in equations 7 and 8 the issc spectrum is given as 10 s ω 5 ω p 4 h s 2 16 ω 5 e 1 25 ω p ω 4 where ω p is the peak angular frequency rad s ω p 2 π t p 2 π 1 408 t z t p is the modal period s t z is the mean zero up crossing period s while h s is the significant wave height m furthermore as significant wave height h s can be cancelled in equations 7 and 8 χ and ε are independent of h s and it is therefore enough to consider variation of χ and ε with t z in the present study range of credible mean zero up crossing periods from 5 to 15 s is considered in χ and ε calculation the ratio of standard deviations χ and tfe ε of vwbm for intact ship and damaged ship for ds2 and ds3 is presented in fig 23 fig 24 and fig 25 respectively from the ratios of standard deviations for head seas β 180 it may be concluded that the performance of 3d theories is much better compared to the strip theory for lower periods of sea states however as periods of sea states increase the ratio of spectral response based on experimental and predicted transfer functions for strip theory is approaching 0 9 while the same ratio for 3d theories is above 1 1 for the same heading tfe is reducing rapidly with increasing wave periods for strip theory and eventually approaching 30 tfe for 3d theories is lower and reads between 10 and 30 for all wave periods when considering all heading angles one may conclude from fig 23 that uncertainty of vwbm response is the highest for beam seas and lowest for head seas this is valid for both spectral uncertainty measures used the only exception is strip theory with tfe in head seas for low sea state periods for the damaged ship in ds2 the ratio of standard deviations for vwbm in heads seas is between 0 9 and 1 1 for all mean zero up crossing periods of sea states this ratio is not very sensitive to the wave periods tfe is almost constant and reads about 10 for all methods compared to the intact ship uncertainty of the response seems to be lower for ds2 regarding both spectral uncertainty measures similarly as for the intact ship uncertainty of vwbm response is obviously highest for beam seas and lowest for head seas for head seas the trend of χ and ε is similar for ds3 as for the intact ship for stern quartering waves spectral uncertainty measures are somewhat reduced compared to the same heading for the intact ship it is also interesting to notice that the performance of uncertainty measures for ds3 is better for stern quartering seas than for head seas this was not the case for the intact ship and for ds2 spectral uncertainty measures for ds3 are the worst for beam seas 6 conclusions this paper presented a benchmark and uncertainty assessment study on global wave induced loads in a damaged ship initiated and organised by the marstruct virtual institute and contributing to the work of the issc ittc joint committee six independent seakeeping analysis codes participated in the benchmark test for linear motions and loads on the damaged dtmb 5415 warship transfer functions are calculated using the added weight method for the intact ship and unsymmetrical and symmetrical flooding scenarios with respect to damage conditions of the ship uncertainty analysis based on frequency independent model error fime is used for the comparison of the experimental and computational results findings and conclusions are as follows satisfactory agreement of heave and pitch transfer functions is noticed for all heading angles and all damage scenarios the only exception is pitch tfs for beam waves where a large dispersion of results is noticed vbm and vsf show generally larger dispersion than vertical motion components but the correlation between the computations and measurements is still acceptable for head and stern quartering waves except for strip theory which considerably overestimate measurements hbm and hsf show larger scatter than vertical load components especially for unsymmetrical flooding scenario in beam waves the possible reason for this difference is the small model scale and sloshing in the damaged compartments prediction of torsional moments is the worst compared to all other load components and unsatisfactory in almost all cases this poor prediction of torsion may be partially explained by uncertainty in measurements accuracy of prediction of vertical and horizontal bending moments and shear forces for stern quartering waves depends whether incoming waves act on the damaged or the intact side of the ship for beam waves and torsional moments there is no such differences in the accuracy with respect to the side of incoming waves there is a worsening trend of average theoretical prediction for damaged compared to the intact ship the added weight method is not able to predict hbm and hsf with reasonable accuracy in head seas for unsymmetrical flooding scenario performance of 3d bem wgf theory is the best for intact ship while 3d bem rs shows smallest differences for damaged ship in both damage scenarios strip theory has the weakest indicators of the accuracy for intact and damaged ship in addition uncertainty in vwbm is assessed using two spectral based uncertainty assessment methods it was shown that for this the most important wave load component prediction accuracy for damaged ship using added weight method is comparable or even better for damaged than for intact ship the presented results might point out needs for following future research topics and directions improvement is required for the prediction of horizontal global wave load components and torsional moments one way to progress could be to include sloshing effects in damaged compartments there were some differences already in the basic hydrostatics between the codes this is also a potential cause for accumulated differences in the results also the applied panel sizes or number of strips can have a big effect this could be better synchronised and coordinated in the future studies finally there is an inherent uncertainty in the experimental measurements that has been herein not accounted for thus another direction of future research could be to improve measurement accuracy for the wave induced loads on intact and damaged ships these conclusions and recommendations may be useful for the regulatory work of classification societies and of the international maritime organisation with respect to solas safe return to port provisions and also for navies and salvage operators regarding the survivability and salvage of damaged ships finally as there is a tendency nowadays to use accidental limit states in ship structural design the present results may be useful for uncertainty quantification when applying reliability based methods for that purpose credit authorship contribution statement joško parunov writing original

22154,results are presented of a benchmark and uncertainty assessment study organised by the marstruct virtual institute on global linear wave loads on damaged ship the study has two aims to acquire valuable information regarding damage modelling in seakeeping analysis of damaged ships and to contribute to a rational approach for definition of the model uncertainty of linear seakeeping tools eight institutes participated in the benchmark with six codes representative of important linear seakeeping theories in use nowadays the benchmark ship is the dtmb 5415 hull with well documented and accessible data to perform seakeeping analysis and experimental results for motion and global wave loads the uncertainty analysis is performed using the frequency independent model error as the uncertainty measure the analysis is performed for vertical motions vertical and horizontal global wave load components and for torsional moments uncertainty measures of individual motion and load predictions are presented and compared in addition a comparative analysis of linear seakeeping theories is performed and the accuracy of the simplified methods used for the prediction of seakeeping of a damaged ship is assessed finally recommendations are provided for efforts to improve modelling uncertainties in transfer functions of wave loads on damaged ships keywords benchmark study seakeeping model experiments damaged ship wave loads uncertainty assessment 1 introduction wave induced ship motions and the associated loads have been the topic of research for several decades because of their crucial importance for ship operational and structural safety analytical and numerical seakeeping analysis methods have been developed based on mathematical models that have different degrees of accuracy depending on the assumptions on which they are based this implies that different degrees of uncertainty will be present when predicting a ship seakeeping performance by different types of theories knowledge of the accuracy of the methods for predicting wave induced loads is especially important when using direct computational methods in ship structural design in particular direct methods based on first principles are used within a structural reliability framework when dealing with new ship types being outside of the scope of the rules of ship classification societies parunov et al 2007 another important area of application of ship structural reliability methods is the development of decision support systems that may be useful for navigation guidance papanikolaou et al 2014 reliability formulations e g guedes soares et al 1996 require the inclusion of the accuracy or variability of the predictions of computational methods which are normally represented by random variables representing the model uncertainty ostergaard et al 1996 guedes soares 1997 the hierarchy of methods for prediction of wave induced ship motions and loads is regularly reviewed and updated by the committee i 2 loads of the international ship and offshore structures congress issc hirdaris et al 2014 temarel et al 2016 seakeeping methods may roughly be divided into linear methods and nonlinear methods of different level of complexity linear methods used nowadays are those based on strip theory st and those based on 3d boundary element method 3d bem commercially available or open linear strip theory codes are waveship det norske veritas 1993 napa napa oy 2017 scores ssc 1972 and pdstrip söding et al 2006 among others 3d bem uses either a wave green s function wgf or a rankine source rs as a source potential to satisfy boundary conditions 3d bem codes using wgf are usually formulated in the frequency domain as exemplified by well known codes wamit newman et al 1995 wadam det norske veritas 1994 hydrostar bureau veritas 2011 newdrift papanikolaou and schellin 1992 and waveload fd lloyd s register 2011 for example 3d bem codes using a rankine source are preferred in a time domain typical example being code wasim det norske veritas 2004 nonlinear methods are outside of the scope of the present paper although a review of methods dealing also with nonlinearities is covered in detail by hirdaris et al 2014 nonlinear seakeeping methods are divided in level 2 to level 6 methods with increasing complexity and computational efforts level 2 methods also known as froude krylov nonlinear methods are the most popular since they capture many important nonlinear effects with reasonable computational time level 6 methods comprise different types of computational fluid dynamics methods that include viscous effects handling breaking waves spray and water flowing on to and off the ship s deck more detailed taxonomy for hydrodynamic methods and comparisons between different methods and experiments is provided in hirdaris et al 2016 the vast majority of published works studied ship motions and dynamic wave loads acting on a ship in the intact condition in fact benchmark studies involving linear responses of intact ships have been considered in the past guedes soares 1990a have used published results of the response amplitude operators of wave induced responses of different ship types calculated by various codes mainly based on the strip theory to derive the numerical values of the model uncertainty formulated in guedes soares 1991 the results of the uncertainty in the transfer functions were combined with the uncertainty of the wave spectral shape guedes soares 1990b so as to produce the uncertainty in short term sea states schellin et al 1996 which was then used as a basis for the uncertainty in long term predictions guedes soares 1996 1999 this last study was a benchmark made within the issc committee i 2 loads involving several classification societies using their standard codes for wave induced responses this approach was also extended to deal with non linear wave induced load predictions which were represented by the bias of a model uncertainty factor that was applied to the linear predictions guedes soares 1993 guedes soares and schellin 1998 in the last decade the study on wave induced loads in damaged ships have also been accomplished although still in a fairly limited manner damage of ships may occur due to collision with another ship grounding or some other type of accident one of the main driving forces for studying damaged ships are the requirements imposed by the international maritime organisation imo in the goal based standards gbs imo 2004 stating explicitly that ships should be designed to have sufficient strength to withstand the wave and internal loads in specified damaged conditions this requirement is motivated by the fact that a large number of ship accidents continue to occur despite the advances with the navigation systems and that these accidents can cause the loss of cargos pollution of environment and even loss of human lives so it is very important to ensure an acceptable safety level for damaged ships unfortunately adequate structural strength in an intact condition does not necessarily guarantee an acceptable safety margin in damaged conditions for that reason the loading changes due to damage should be considered in the design phase similarly as for the intact ship structural reliability methods are used for the structural safety assessment of damaged ship requiring model uncertainty of wave induced loads iacs 2014 benchmark studies have an important role to assess model uncertainties of wave induced loads codes usually in benchmark studies several participants perform their own hydrodynamic study of the benchmark ship and then compare results mutually as well as with experimental results in this approach there is experimental uncertainty making it very difficult to ensure that experimental results are a perfect representation of the physical reality kim and hermansky 2014 in addition there are additional uncertainties when using experimental results measured in towing tank to represent ship in a full scale and in confused seas nevertheless model test experimental results obtained in towing tanks are conveniently used as reference values to validate the output of numerical methods in past decades several benchmark studies were undertaken to determine model uncertainty of wave induced loads on ships papanikolaou and schellin 1995 and schellin et al 1996 2003 compared linear responses of various types of ships to regular waves obtained by using the strip theory and a 3d panel method with model test measurements the purpose was to assess the uncertainty of these methods to analytically predict first order wave induced load effects they concluded that there was no clear tendency indicating more accurate results obtained from strip theories or from the panel method it was also found that even computer codes based on the same theoretical background strip theory may lead to quite different results the same conclusion was obtained in the benchmark study promoted by issc i 2 loads committee in which various classification societies contributed with the results of their strip theory codes showing some spread of results guedes soares 1999 in addition to differences in the theoretical formulation of the codes this could also be the consequence of numerical errors incompleteness of background theory or user s mistake a benchmark worth referring was done within the work of issc loads committee addressing the non linear wave induced loads watanabe and guedes soares 1999 as determined by codes that included mainly the non linear froude krylov component i e level 2 codes according to the classification of hirdaris et al 2014 a benchmark study on ship motions and loads for a 6750 teu containership was recently carried out in connection with the 2nd ittc issc joint workshop in 2014 kim and kim 2016 regarding linear results which are of interest to the present study it was found that predictions of heave and pitch motion in head waves is more accurate compared to the experiments than prediction of vertical wave bending moment vwbm which is a well known result also obtained by guedes soares 1990a and 1991 among others statistical dispersion of results around the mean value is lowest for heave and highest for vwbm while dispersion of pitch results is in between the dispersion of results was actually surprisingly large taking into account that calculations are performed for zero speed and head waves it should be pointed out that this benchmark study was blind i e the participants were not aware of the experimental results before they submitted results of their own computations blind benchmark studies are particularly valuable as any additional adjustment of results based on experimental values is avoided but they are rare as they are difficult to organize however it must be noted that this ship had a hydroelastic response that was analysed in rajendran and guedes soares 2016 and thus linear codes for rigid bodies would be expected to have worse results than in cases that ships are not prone to significant hydroelastic response the present paper follows up from the earlier work expanding it by reporting the first benchmark study on numerical prediction of loads on damaged ship the paper includes valuable information regarding damage modelling and accuracy of the seakeeping tools for damaged ships the benchmark study should also provide a basis for definition of the model uncertainty to be used in structural reliability assessment of damaged ships the subject of the benchmark study is a damaged warship with model scale experimental results published originally by lee et al 2012 the model is suitable for this study as all necessary data to perform seakeeping computations are well documented including the geometry of the vessel in igs format mass properties hydrostatic data damage description and experimental transfer functions of motions and global wave loads for intact and damaged ship the present paper is organised in the following way in section 2 a literature review and description of the methods for computation of wave loads on damaged ships is given in section 3 existing methods for uncertainty assessment of transfer functions of motions and wave induced loads are presented the target ship used in the present benchmark study test conditions participants and verification of hydrodynamic models are described in section 4 in section 5 results of the benchmark are provided and discussed conclusions of the study and recommendations for future research are presented in the last section of the paper 2 seakeeping studies of damaged ships in serious marine accidents as collision or grounding a ship may sustain large damages on the outside shell and the internal structure so that her watertight integrity would be compromised and flooding of some compartments would occur consequently the floating condition and stability of a damaged ship would be changed dramatically her draught will increase and she may significantly heel and trim although the methodology used for the seakeeping of a ship in intact condition is generally applicable to the ship in a damaged condition it must not be blindly applied to damaged ships since this could lead to wrong results one of the differences of damaged vs intact ship behaviour in waves is that the damaged ship could have a varying average floating position if progressive flooding of internal spaces is present this implies the necessity of using nonlinear time domain seakeeping approaches even in the case of waves with small steepness that otherwise could be studied by linear frequency domain methods numerical computations for the prediction of large amplitude motions and global loads of a ro ro ship in intact and damaged conditions were conducted by chan et al 2002 2003 the time domain approach to the coupled problems of damaged ship in waves and motion of water inside flooded compartment is described by santos and guedes soares 2008 the numerical efficiency of the method was recently improved by introducing adaptive meshing by rodrigues and guedes soares 2017 although time domain nonlinear methods are promising as a result of a more detailed modelling of some features they do not necessarily compare to the experiments better than much simpler linear frequency domain methods even those based on linear strip theory lee et al 2012 there is a tendency in past years to use frequency domain methods by assuming that the ship has already reached a stable equilibrium position around which it oscillates in waves two practical methods for modelling wave induced motions and the resulting structural loads of damaged ships are proposed by downes et al 2007 the first method is the added weight method in which it is assumed that the mass of the flooded seawater becomes integral part of the ship mass and moves with the ship the second approach is the lost buoyancy method where the structure of the damaged tanks and all of their contents are removed from the vessel the added weight method is more suitable for cases where the breach is small even if the amount of floodwater is large e g due to progressive flooding the lost buoyancy method is suitable for cases where the damaged compartments have large breaches and there is free flow of floodwater between the damaged compartments and the sea the hydrodynamic interaction between the waves and the structure of the opening remains after removing the tank from the ship hull which needs to be modelled in the lost buoyancy method the added weight method is simpler for practical applications as it requires only the modification of the ship masses and equilibrium condition while the method of lost buoyancy requires a significant change of the intact ship model for hydrodynamic simulation both methods originates from ship hydrostatics damage stability calculations and result in identical final equilibrium floating condition in calm water while the metacentric height and righting lever curve are different thus the assumptions about the method introduce variation in the wave load prediction because of its simplicity the added weight method is often used in seakeeping assessment of damaged ship thus downes et al 2007 by using the added weight method showed that there is no significant difference between the transfer functions of vwbm between intact and damaged ship nevertheless they showed that the peak value of transfer function of vwbm increases with increasing damage size and heel angle that study indicated also that the change in global hull loading may be much smaller for tankers than for ro ro ferries and cruise ships folsø et al 2008 have performed seakeeping computations on a damaged oil tanker by the linear 3d bem the damage scenarios corresponded to water ingress into the forepeak or the double hull ballast tanks of the ship sailing in full load for the case of the flooded ballast tank in the midship area they obtained transfer functions of the vwbm larger than those evaluated for the intact condition an interesting conclusion from the paper was that keeping a bow quartering encounter angle with the higher freeboard on the weather side minimizes vwbm lee et al 2012 applied a computational tool based on a two dimensional linear method to predict the hydrodynamic loads of a damaged warship they obtained larger vwbm for the damaged ship compared to the intact one the global dynamic wave induced loads calculated using 2d linear methods were also compared to measurements in head and stern quartering waves differences between computations and measurements of global dynamic wave induced load response amplitudes were reasonable in general however linear strip theory overestimated measurements for both intact and damaged ship results of damaged ship seakeeping assessment using the lost buoyancy method are scarce from the literature parunov et al 2015 compared the two methods of added weight and lost buoyancy for assessment of vertical bending moment of a damaged oil tanker in head waves using the 3d bem code hydrostar bureau veritas 2011 the predicted result showed a larger value for added weight and lower values for lost buoyancy method in comparison with the intact ship evaluation more extensive comparison was performed by jafaryeganeh and guedes soares 2018 using wamit they provisionally concluded that the performance of the lost buoyancy method is better for horizontal load components while the added weight method provides more accurate agreement with experiments for vertical shear forces and bending moments a specific issue appearing in the seakeeping analysis of a damaged vessel with heel and trim is that a cross section defined in the global coordinate system is different from that defined in the local ship coordinate system consequently sectional forces and moments are also different computations are normally performed with reference to a system including the vertical axis normal to the water plane to compare and analyse forces and moments at different heel angles loads need to be described in the ship reference system where the local vertical axis is contained in the plane of symmetry of the ship for some of the output responses a post processing is therefore necessary based on a simple vector combination but also taking into account phase angles folsø et al 2008 in the present study however heel and trim angles are fairly low about 1 for such low angles differences between global and local coordinate systems are negligible and are therefore not considered it should be noted that folsø et al 2008 used heeling angles up to 22 5 and therefore transformation of coordinate systems was necessary in that case another important topic is the influence of sloshing of the liquid in damaged compartments there is much uncertainty and lack of research in this field jia and moan 2012 concluded that the effect of sloshing on vertical bending moment is small except in beam seas while the effect of sloshing on horizontal bending moment is large especially in beam seas although the problem could be solved by bem the multimodal approach shows clear advantages especially in terms of computational speed compared to bem jia and moan 2012 another interesting example of simplified application for combined sloshing and seakeeping analysis is the fairly good comparison against experiments presented by hirdaris et al 2010 using lr waveload rigid body programme experiments with damaged ships are important for the validation of numerical methods korkut et al 2004 presented experimental results for motions of an intact and damaged ro ro ship in regular waves at zero speed while the experimental results are extended in korkut et al 2005 for the global loads of intact and damaged ship lee et al 2012 conducted an experimental campaign on a 1 100 scale model of the dtmb 5415 frigate hull and presented results for the motion and loads of the intact and damaged ship damage scenarios included symmetrical and unsymmetrical flooding the same experimental results are described in ssc 459 but with more details provided regarding model and measured responses ssc 2011 while original and full details are provided by lee et al 2006 begovic et al 2011 presented results for motion and global loads obtained from an experimental test program in which the ship model used was the same 1 100 scale model of the frigate begovic et al 2013 studied the motion response characteristics of the same dtmb model 5415 in intact and damaged conditions but measurements are carried out with a 1 51 scale model the effect of model scale is discussed according to the results of two test campaigns carried out in different scales domeh et al 2015 presented an experimental study on a segmented model in waves the novelty of that experimental research was systematic investigation of the influence of permeability and damage size on the vertical motions of damaged hull the recent study by begovic et al 2017 focused on the measurement of hull girder loads on the segmented model of dtmb 5415 at zero speed in intact and damaged conditions using a 1 51 scale model although the damage opening was on the side two compartments at midship were flooded along the whole breadth of the model particular emphasis of the study was on nonlinear effects due to the wave height variation the experimental results of heave roll and pitch motion were presented together with the results from begovic et al 2013 to highlight the repeatability and uncertainty of the measured raos comparison of measured loads showed that the structural response values of the damaged model are noticeably larger than those of the intact model an investigation of the nonlinear effects due to the wave height variation on the shear force and bending moment values for the intact and damaged warship is carried out by begovic et al 2017 in general it was concluded that the vertical shear force and the vertical bending moment values both for the intact and damaged ships exhibit a strong dependency on wave amplitude variations at the wave frequencies around the natural frequencies of the vessel similar research presented previously by lee at al 2012 showed that the measurements under large waves and small waves are not significantly different 3 model uncertainty in transfer functions the transfer functions represent the amplitude of the motions or of the load effects induced by waves of unit amplitude on a ship the prediction of the transfer functions of the load effects is one of the most important factors that affect the calculation of the extreme values of wave induced load effects in both short and long term conditions guedes soares 1991 the model uncertainty in transfer functions may be evaluated by comparisons of the experimental results with the theoretical predictions very often such comparisons have been done only visually with the subjective conclusion about general engineering accuracy of linear seakeeping theories to eliminate subjective judgements about accuracy quantitative methods for model uncertainty of linear transfer functions have been proposed by guedes soares 1991 he suggested the simplest formulation of the model uncertainty of transfer functions in the form of the frequency independent model error fime denoted herein with greek letter ϕ thus if the theoretical results were all multiplied by a constant fit factor ϕ it would be possible to have the transfer function adjusted so as to coincide with the mean experimental values the variability of the experimental values about this adjusted transfer function would represent the experimental error with a mean value close to zero thus the model error ϕ represents a systematic error or the bias of the theory if the model error is known the theory can still be used and its predictions can be improved by compensating for the effect of the model error as fime is used for uncertainty quantification in the present study it is described in the following paragraphs guedes soares 1991 the measurements h ˆ i of the transfer function can be represented by 1 h ˆ i ϕ h i ε i where h i is the calculated value of the transfer function at the frequency ω i and ε i is a random error in the measurement made at frequency ω i this representation assumes that the measurement errors are independent of wave frequency the value of ϕ can be estimated by minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors which is expressed by 2 q i h ˆ i ϕ h i 2 i ε i 2 the value of ϕ that minimizes that sum is obtained by differentiating q with respect to ϕ and equating it to zero this results in the following expression for the estimate of ϕ 3 ϕ i h ˆ i h i i h i 2 this expression has been applied to the published data that compare theoretically determined and measured transfer functions of vwbm guedes soares 1991 theoretical calculations were done by different versions of linear strip theory which differ in the detailed way in which the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated these differences lead to significantly different predictions of transfer functions guedes soares 1991 the conclusion of the study was that the theories underestimate the measurements by an amount that varies between 10 and 22 however it should be noted that these numbers are average values obtained for different heading angles speeds and block coefficients fime ϕ varies considerably for different combinations of these parameters mathematical interpretation of fime as given by equation 3 is that it represents the slope of the regression line forced to pass through the origin it is a convenient uncertainty measure as it gives immediate information if the theory overestimates or underestimates measurements fime larger than 1 indicates that theory underestimates measurements while fime lower than 1 means that theory overestimates experimental values to illustrate a practical application of fime consider the transfer functions presented in fig 1 left in addition to experimentally obtained transfer function two other transfer functions obtained by two different theories theory 1 and theory 2 are shown in fig 1 left visually it can be seen that theory 1 agrees very well with the experiments while theory 2 obviously overestimates experimental values a plot of measured vs experimental transfer functions for both theories is presented in fig 1 right regression lines forced to pass through origin are presented in fig 1 right for both theories together with their equations it may be seen that fime read 1 06 and 0 65 for theory 1 and 2 respectively therefore in average across all frequencies theory 1 underestimates experimental values so that it should be multiplied by factor ϕ 1 06 while theory 2 overestimates experiments so that it should be multiplied by ϕ 0 65 in order to get best average agreement to the experiments the fime represents the systematic difference also known as bias between experiments and predictions from a given source in addition to bias there is a dispersion of experimental values around regression line represented by fime such dispersion may be measured by the variance of individual data points around regression line if the model error at each frequency is determined as ϕ i h ˆ i h i then the variance σ ϕ 2 may be calculated as 4 σ ϕ 2 i 1 n ϕ i ϕ 2 n where ϕ is the mean value or the fime given by equation 3 square root of the variance represents standard deviation σ ϕ of the model error while the coefficient of variation cov may be calculated as 5 cov ϕ σ ϕ ϕ one drawback of equations 4 and 5 is that ϕ i can take very large values for small and hence unimportant predicted transfer functions h i if h i is close to zero then even very small value of h ˆ i results in extremely large ϕ i which can have decisive influence on the total variance in addition to the variance the dispersion of points around the regression line may be expressed by the coefficient of determination r 2 presented in fig 1 right large coefficient of determination above 0 8 indicates high confidence of the approximation of points by the regression line obviously from fig 1 right confidence in fime is much better for theory 1 than for theory 2 the major disadvantage of the fime is that it gives equal importance to all frequencies although some frequency ranges are more important than others when a response spectrum is calculated one way to improve fime is by calculating the variance of the short term response which is the integral under the area of the response spectrum and reflects the shape of the transfer function and the wave spectrum as well as the relative position between their peaks as originally proposed by guedes soares 1991 the report ssc 363 ssc 1991 expanded the proposed approach in the following way to quantify the uncertainty in short term vwbm due to errors in transfer functions a postulate a linear model for the root mean square rms bending moment b transform the data on transfer function into data on the rms bending moment by using some sea spectrum for example the issc spectrum and by integrating over frequency c calculate the ratio of measured over predicted rms bending moments this procedure removes the individual frequency sensitivity by integrating over frequency in step b following the proposed approach the ratio of rms or standard deviations χ may be approximated as 7 χ 1 1 n h ˆ ω i 2 s ω i 1 1 n h ω i 2 s ω i where s ω i is the wave energy spectrum at frequency ω i while h ˆ ω i and h ω i represent measured experimental and predicted calculated transfer function at the same frequency respectively since the most probable extreme value in the short term sea state is proportional to the rms the ratio χ approximates the ratio between the most probable extreme values resulting from experimental and predicted transfer functions a factor χ larger than one means that the most probable extreme value in the short term sea state based on experimental ship response is larger than that of the predicted ship response while χ lower than one indicates that the extreme response based on the experimental transfer functions is lower than that based on the calculated transfer functions the total factored error tfe introduced by ando 1998 is another method to quantify the relation between measured and calculated transfer functions the tfe is defined as the ratio expressed in percentage of the sum of weighted squares of the difference between the magnitudes gain factors of predicted and measured transfer functions to the sum of the weighted squares of the measured values the wave spectrum of the given sea state is used as the weighting factor thus the error of the predicted transfer function at a particular wave frequency is weighted by a measure of its importance for example 100 error in the predicted transfer functions can be insignificant if it occurs at very high or very low frequency ranges where the energy content of the waves is relatively small tfe as proposed by ando is denoted as ε and given by the square root of the following expression 8 ε 2 1 1 n h ˆ ω i h ω i 2 s ω i i 1 n h ˆ ω i 2 s ω i where s ω is the wave energy spectrum obviously tfe is 0 in the case of the perfect agreement between theory and experiments and increases with increasing discrepancies between theory and experiment since ε is usually a small number it is convenient to multiply it by 100 and express ε as percentage one drawback of the equation 8 is that it does not provide information whether the theory underestimates or overestimates measurements as all types of errors increase tfe another way to deal with uncertainties is to assess the effect of uncertainty on transfer functions by calculating long term distributions as proposed by schellin et al 1996 the uncertainty was quantified by obtaining characteristic values of ship responses while a relatively large degree of uncertainty was associated with predicted midship wave induced sectional loads in that study linear response to regular waves obtained from three two dimensional strip theories and one three dimensional panel method was compared with model test measurements for a fast container ship one of the important conclusions from the study was that there was no clear tendency indicating more accurate results obtained from strip theories or from the panel method although the procedure proposed in schellin et al 1996 is appropriate for intact ships the wave induced bending moment of damaged ships should be determined based on the wave condition e g significant wave height and wave length etc at the moment of accident in sea together with the vessel speed in association with a short term response such as several hours or a couple of days or a couple of weeks during the rescue operation class rule formula for estimating the wave bending moments in association with a long term spectrum should not be used for this purpose as well for that reason long term distributions are not considered in the present study the issue of wave load uncertainties requires closer cooperation between hydrodynamic and structural groups and led to the initiation of series of workshops on uncertainty modelling for ships and offshore structures umsos organised by issc international ships and offshore structure congress i 1 environment and i 2 load committees and the ittc international towing tank conference sea keeping and ocean engineering committees the 1st umsos workshop was held in rostock germany in 2012 hirdaris 2014 the 2nd joint ittc issc workshop organised by ittc sea keeping committee which took place on 30 august 2014 in copenhagen focused on the wave induced motions and structural loads on ships and offshore structures including a computational benchmark test for a large container ship kim and kim 2016 a total of seventeen codes participated in the benchmark test from eleven institutes sixty per cent of the participants are based on a 3d bem while remaining codes are based on strip theory and one based on computational fluid dynamic cfd uncertainty measures of linear transfer functions were defined as total differences of the i th participant with respect to the mean value as 9 total difference i j 1 r i j mean j j 1 mean j 100 where r i j is the computational result of the j th frequency component of the i th participant and mean j is the average of the j th component the total difference is used to compare linear tfs the total differences of heave were smaller than 4 with the exception of one participant in the result of pitch the total differences were within 8 it can be considered that all the computational results showed good agreement in heave and pitch tfs however the total differences of vbm were larger than those of heave and pitch motions six participants showed differences larger than 10 and two participants showed differences larger than 20 it is of interest to compare results of benchmark studies on large containerships published in schellin et al 1996 and the recent one published in kim and kim 2016 in order to observe if there is obvious improvement of accuracy of computational tools in the period of last 20 years results of benchmark studies of vwbm at midship for head seas are presented in fig 2 where results from schellin et al 1996 are presented in fig 2 left while results from kim and kim 2016 are shown in fig 2 right by comparing the two benchmark studies it seems that the recent one fig 2 right shows relatively good agreement of mean transfer function with measured values however dispersion of results is still very large it is very important to mention that the benchmark from schellin et al 1996 was performed for high ship speed corresponding to froude number of 0 245 while the benchmark study from kim and kim 2016 was performed for zero ship speed as it is known that accuracy of seakeeping computations is decreasing with increasing speed maron et al 2004 it was expected that the uncertainty of computations of vwbm from schellin et al 1996 would be more reduced it should also be pointed out that the benchmark from schellin et al 1996 is based on experiments originally published in flokstra 1974 and that accuracy of measurements should be improved nowadays and that consequently measurement uncertainty is reduced in the recent benchmark however there is also strong argument in favour of the benchmark from kim and kim 2016 which is a rare blind benchmark study as participants didn t have opportunity to compare their results with experiments and to repair possible gross errors in their hydrodynamic models ittc is concerned by the uncertainty of measurements as an essential element for evaluating the accuracy of experiments or measurements including seakeeping experiments kim and hermansky 2014 following the approach proposed by the iso guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements iso gum ittc recommends grouping of uncertainty components in two categories namely type a and type b based on the method by which they are evaluated type a uncertainty is based on repeated measurements and is characterized by the randomness of the process that is expressed as experimental variance the type b components are estimated by a means other than repeated observations there are currently joint efforts by ittc and issc to find overlaps between different uncertainty measures and to eventually propose unified uncertainty measure for computational and experimental uncertainties 4 outline of the present benchmark study the present benchmark study was carried out to assess the performance and trends of seakeeping codes for the analysis of damaged ships as part of the marstruct virtual institute activities which at the same time contributes to the work of the issc ittc joint committee on uncertainty modelling in waves and wave induced responses eight institutes participated in the benchmark study namely university of zagreb instituto superior tecnico lloyd s register national technical university of athens national technical university of athens hsva university of rijeka university of dubrovnik and napa the ship data and the test matrix were offered to the participants the participants were requested to perform the analysis of intact and damaged ship and to submit their best results for comparison the test matrix was composed of one condition for intact ship linear transfer functions and two conditions for damaged ship linear transfer functions transfer functions were requested for heave and pitch motion as well as for five global load components at strain gauge location horizontal and vertical shear forces horizontal and vertical bending moments as well as torsional moment the ship was exposed to head regular waves beam waves and stern quartering waves for all the conditions while the ship speed was equal to zero in all cases 4 1 target ship the ship used in this benchmark study is the notional us navy destroyer hull 5415 dtmb 5415 the experiments have been carried out at the newcastle university towing tank using a model with a scale of 1 100 details of the facility and equipment used as well as other testing conditions are provided by lee et al 2012 and also by ssc 459 ssc 2011 the tests measured six degree of freedom motion responses of the stationary model without forward speed as well as global loads in intact and damaged conditions for different headings in regular waves the main particulars of the ship and the model are provided in table 1 the same ship has been experimentally tested in other towing tank by begovic et al 2011 and also in 1 51 scale by begovic et al 2017 body lines are provided in fig 3 for this ship the 3d geometry of ship hull in the form of iges file is also available as shown in fig 4 simman 2008 mass distribution in the intact condition is shown in fig 5 the six degrees of freedom motions of the model were measured using qualisys motion capture system lee et al 2012 the forces and moments were obtained from a five component force gauge f y f z m x m y and m z type 206 5c manufactured by danish hydraulic institute dhi the gauge was located at 545 43 mm from ap longitudinally and at the centre of the depth to public spaces deck which is 62 83 mm from the base line that is the location where raos for global forces and moments are calculated by participants 4 2 test conditions the condition for linear tfs of the intact ship is named intact and the two damaged conditions for linear tfs of the damaged ship are named damage scenario 2 ds2 and damage scenario 3 ds3 the details of the conditions are given in table 2 these conditions are selected from the test matrix of the experiment as given in lee et al 2012 thus the experimental results of the conditions are available to be compared with computational results all test conditions are without forward speed for each condition the participants are required to provide tfs of heave pitch and five global load components at section with strain gauge 545 43 mm from ap the still water load is not included in results detailed description including drawings of damaged conditions are provided in lee et al 2012 and ssc 2011 while an overview of ship 3d geometry with two damage scenarios is presented in fig 6 the damage scenario ds2 represents a transversally unsymmetrical flooding condition caused by a 12 m long by 9 m high opening in the starboard side shell the opening extends equally into machine rooms 2 and 3 located amidships and penetrates into the double bottom causing water ingress in four fuel tanks on the starboard side therefore heel is introduced on the starboard side in this damaged condition damage scenario ds3 represents transversally symmetrical flooding condition simulating a raking damage in the bow region experiments were performed for 9 wave frequencies as shown in table 3 also experiments were performed for small and large wave heights as linear responses are the subject of the present investigation only small wave heights are considered in the uncertainty assessment experimental data from lee et al 2012 which includes the asymmetric damage not easily found in the literature are used in the present study the same ship model has been tested in begovic et al 2011 in different towing tank and also the same hull but in scale 1 51 has been tested and published in begovic et al 2017 in the last there is very detailed comparison of different experimental data with the diagrams of nondimensional responses there is also an issue in the effect of the weight of load cell in the mass distribution in the experiments of begovic et al 2017 the weight of the load cell is 1 03 kg and total model weight is 63 5 kg so the considered mass distribution in fig 5 is realistic in the lee et al 2012 the model has overall weight of 8 5 kg so the load cell represents very concentrated weight as was shown in begovic et al 2011 among these three works data presented by begovic et al 2017 are expected to have the best accuracy as they are relative to bigger model 10 ft where the scale effect is playing towards better accuracy comparative analysis of experimental results presented in all three studies showed that the vertical bending moment and vertical shear force values in head seas were generally in fair agreement between the three studies however the overall agreement of some of global load components was poor in beam seas since the agreement in many cases between three studies is fair and since the study of lee et al 2012 includes more heading angles and asymmetric damage cases only the results from lee et al 2012 are considered herein for consistency of the uncertainty analysis 4 3 participants a total of eight institutions participated in the benchmark test with six codes the details of the participants are given in table 4 four codes are based on a wave green function s wgf 3d bem formulated in frequency domain wgf 3d bem is currently considered one of the most common method for seakeeping analysis one code is time domain 3d bem based on rankine sources while one code is based on strip theory all participants submitted results for intact ship and also for ds3 which causes symmetrical flooding in transversal direction two participants haven t submitted results for ds2 with unsymmetrical damage the reason is that one of codes does not support unsymmetrical mass distribution while another one of participants could not spend substantial amount of time required for modelling of heeled ship although it was left to participants to choose their own method for modelling the damaged ship all participants used the added weight method the probable reason is that participants found the added weight method simpler for application compared to the method of lost buoyancy the ship is assumed to be undamaged in the added weight method but flooded tanks are assumed to be filled up to water line level of damaged ship in calm water the permeability of 1 0 has been used here which is realistic for the model but not for real ships although most of 3d bem codes are able to account for sloshing the dynamic effect of free surface is not accounted for in the added weight method thus liquid in damaged compartments is assumed to be frozen which is equivalent to adding a rigid mass for shifting the ship centre of gravity and displacement the location of the added weight is specified with the centre of volume of the induced water in the damaged compartment the new draft trim and heel in the damaged ship are employed in the added weight method additionally the added mass assumption causes a change of metacentric height buoyancy and mass distribution and mass moment of inertia relative to the intact ship for each damage scenario all the mentioned properties should be updated for providing the seakeeping model and predicting the still water and wave loads regarding meshing of the wetted surface no particular requirements or instructions are given to the participants it is left to their own expertise and experience to decide about appropriate panel size for the analysis the number of panels or stripes used in discretization of the wetted surface by participants is presented in table 5 some hydrodynamic panel models of wetted surfaces are presented in fig 7 linearized viscous damping correction is particularly important for torsional moment calculation however this value was not provided to participants but left to their own judgement most of participants reported that they used the non dimensional linearized viscous roll damping as 5 of critical roll damping 4 4 hydrostatic component the participants were required to submit hydrostatic components of their numerical models the submerged volume of the intact ship in still water and longitudinal centres of buoyancy are compared in table 6 the reference value of submerged volume reads 8812 m3 while longitudinal centre of gravity reads 71 0 m from ap all results show acceptable differences for the submerged volume and the maximum difference is 5 9 for strip model the participants showing lower submerged volume than the reference value were not able to increase the volume despite efforts to do so this could be the consequence of very fine form of the studied warship it is noted from table 5 that two participants used much lower number of elements for modelling the wetted surface the centres of buoyancy of the participants are located between 1 7 toward ap and 1 towards fp of lbp from lcg compared to the benchmark performed by kim and kim 2016 the results are slightly worse for the submerged volume but better for lcb comparison of hydrostatic particulars for two damage scenarios is presented in table 7 it may be noticed from table 7 that the hydrostatic particulars for ds2 are very close to each other however differences for ds3 are appreciable especially lcb and trim calculated by the strip theory also submerged volume modelled by one of participants is considerably larger than of others for ds3 5 comparison of results with discussion transfer functions of calculated amplitudes of ship response are plotted against the non dimensional wave frequency defined as ω sqrt l g where ω is wave circular frequency l ship length and g acceleration of gravity comparative analysis includes measurements performed by lee et al 2012 transfer functions are shown for intact ship and two damage states ds2 ds3 and for three wave headings namely head waves β 180 stern quartering waves β 45 and beam waves β 90 for unsymmetrical damage scenario ds2 two additional headings are considered namely β 315 and β 270 two participants have not submitted results for ds2 and therefore only four codes are compared with experiments for unsymmetrical damage case since it is rather difficult to draw conclusions about uncertainties of predictions just from comparison of transfer function quantification of uncertainties using frequency independent model error fime as described in section 3 is performed fimes for intact ship and two damage scenarios are plotted in same graphs in order to observe the differences also a red horizontal line is drawn through unity indicating perfect correlation between computations and measurements if some value of comparison is placed below the red line that means that in average experiments are overestimated by calculations for that particular transfer function if a value in the graph is over the red line computations underestimate measurements so transfer functions should be multiplied by the value larger than one in order to have best average agreement between computations and measurements in addition the coefficient of variation cov of the model error is also calculated by equations 4 and 5 for each transfer function very large range of covs is found creating difficulties in the presentation of results 5 1 comparison of transfer functions for heave and pitch motion fig 8 and fig 9 present heave amplitude z normalized by the wave amplitude a and pitch amplitude in degrees divided by the wave amplitude a respectively fimes as given by eq 3 for heave and pitch motion are presented in fig 10 covs of model error are presented in fig 11 good agreement of heave transfer functions is noticed for all heading angles and all damage scenarios pitch tfs are also consistent except for beam waves β 90 it can be seen in fig 10 that for the intact ship in beam waves all codes underestimate measured pitch tfs fime higher than 1 pitch motion calculations in ds3 for beam waves consistently overestimate measurements although results seem to be closer to measurements than for intact ship fime for pitch in ds2 for beam waves shows the largest discrepancies compared to the experiments however as may be seen in fig 9 the pitch motion response amplitudes in beam waves are much less than those in head and stern quartering waves so these discrepancies with measured tfs are insignificant for practical purposes results for intact ship are in agreement with those from the recent benchmark study by kim and kim 2016 where the maximum error calculated by equation 7 reads 4 for heave and 8 for pitch of large container ship with zero speed covs of model error are fairly low for heave motion in head and beam waves and for pitch motion in stern quartering waves larger uncertainty of the model error may be observed for heave motion in stern quartering waves dispersion of predicted pitch motion is the largest resulting in cov larger than 1 in all cases this is caused by several predicted values of transfer function very close to zero these values although of insignificant practical merit have large consequences on cov 5 2 comparison of transfer functions for vertical global wave load components transfer functions of vsf and vbm are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively while the corresponding fimes are presented in fig 14 shear forces and bending and torsional moments are normalized by the terms ρagbl and ρagbl 2 respectively where ρ is density of water and b ship breadth for ds2 vsf and vbm are measured and compared for beam and stern quartering waves arriving on undamaged side β 270 and β 315 in order to observe differences with respect to waves acting on damaged side of the ship β 90 and β 45 fimes of vbm and vsf show generally larger dispersion than motion components the correlation between the computations and measurements of global dynamic wave induced load response amplitudes is reasonable for head and stern quartering waves except for strip theory which overestimates measurements fime much lower than 1 the differences of the results in beam waves are in general larger than for other headings but still acceptable except for one participant showing much higher fime of vsf than other participants fimes of vbm and vsf are not much different if incoming beam waves are on damaged β 90 or undamaged β 270 side of the ship it should be noted that the magnitude of vertical global loads in beam waves is usually very small so the difference in numerical prediction would not cause much concern however it may be seen for the lowest graphs in fig 14 that much better agreement to experimental results for vbm and vsf is obtained for stern quartering waves acting on damaged side β 45 than for waves acting on the undamaged side of the ship β 315 results for the vwbm of intact ship in head sea may be compared with those from the benchmark by kim and kim 2016 where six participants showed differences calculated by equation 9 larger than 10 and two participants showed differences larger than 20 it is to be noted that in the study by kim and kim 2016 three out of six participants with differences larger than 10 used 3d bem wgf method total error of vwbm with respect to the mean value of calculated transfer functions is presented in fig 15 differences found in the present study are similar as in the study by kim and kim 2016 maximum error in fig 15 is obtained for the strip theory while 3d methods result in the error less than 10 this may be the evidence of the credibility of the results from the present study covs of model error for vertical load components are presented in fig 16 model error of vbm in head seas shows the lowest coefficient of variation also it is not possible to conclude if there is some important difference of the prediction uncertainty between intact and damaged ship it is interesting to observe however that covs of vbm are reduced for damaged comparing to the intact ship covs of vertical loads components are very large for beam waves and fimes are therefore not very reliable 5 3 comparison of transfer functions for horizontal global wave load components transfer functions of hsf and hbm are presented in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively while the corresponding fimes are presented in fig 19 horizontal bending moments and shear forces for head waves β 180 are measured and compared only for unsymmetrical damage case ds2 since for the intact ship and symmetrical damage case ds3 these are close to zero for ds2 hsf and hbm are measured and compared for beam and stern quartering waves arriving on undamaged side β 270 and β 315 in order to observe differences with respect to waves acting on damaged side of the ship β 90 and β 45 fime of hbm and hsf show larger scatter than vertical load components hsf and hbm of intact ship are underestimated for stern quartering waves probably as the consequence of the small model scale and drifting of the model in the damaged ship sloshing in damaged compartments is an additional source of uncertainty ssc 2011 dispersion of fimes is particularly important for ds2 in beam waves thus hsf in beam waves is underestimated by all participants and for all damage scenarios while hbm for the beam waves is overestimated by all except one participant one participant calculated hsf and hbm that largely underestimated measurements for intact and damaged ship fime much higher than 1 in all three cases it is interesting to observe in fig 19 that fimes for hsf in stern quartering waves are more accurately predicted for damaged than for the intact ship hbm in stern quartering waves is more accurately predicted if waves are incoming from undamaged side β 315 for beam waves the accuracy of the prediction of hsf and hbm is not much different with respect to the direction of incoming waves one important finding is that hbm and hsf for ds2 in head waves are largely underestimated by calculations measured hbm and hsf are about one order of magnitude larger compared to predicted tfs therefore the added weight method seems not able to predict hbm and hsf of the damaged ship in head seas with reasonable accuracy although hbm and hsf are much lower compared to other headings they are potentially important because of the combination with vbm being at maximum for that heading angle covs of model error for horizontal load components are presented in fig 20 compared to the vertical load components covs of model errors for horizontal wave components are rather large this confirms the finding from the analysis of fime that scatter of model error is large and that hbm and hsf are not predicted with satisfactory accuracy 5 4 comparison of transfer functions for torsional moments transfer functions of torsional moments are presented in fig 21 while the corresponding fimes are presented in fig 22 tms for head waves β 180 are measured and compared for unsymmetrical damage case ds2 while for the intact ship and symmetrical damage case ds3 these are close to zero for ds2 tms are measured and compared for beam and stern quartering waves arriving on the undamaged side β 270 and β 315 in order to observe differences with respect to waves acting on the damaged side of the ship β 90 and β 45 the fime of torsional moments is the worst compared to all other load components and is unsatisfactory in almost all cases this poor prediction of torsion is explained in ssc 459 where experimental measurements are described ssc 2011 one of the possible reasons for such a poor performance in torsion is that the maximum measured torsion is very low because of the small scale of the ship model so its measurement is very sensitive to any imperfections calibration of the instruments or electrical noise in the records the other possible reason could be the inherent difficulty in determining the radius of gyration for roll motion and the damping coefficient for roll motion which is a very important motion component influencing the accuracy of the prediction of torsion moments these issues have been reviewed and corrected in the begovic et al 2017 fime for tm in stern quartering waves and in beam waves as may be seen fig 22 is closer to one for the intact than for the damaged ship worsening of results for damaged ship indicates that the effect of sloshing and slamming within the damaged compartments could influence the global dynamic wave load components it also may be noticed from fig 22 that cov of the model error is noticeably lower for intact than for damaged ship indicating lower uncertainty in the fime the cov of model error of damaged ship exceeds 1 in almost all cases the accuracy of predictions of tms for beam and stern quartering waves is not dependent on the side from which waves are acting on the ship 5 5 performance of the added weight method and comparison of seakeeping theories uncertainty analysis may be used to validate the added weight method for the seakeeping analysis of damaged ships as well as for the performance assessment of different seakeeping codes for that purpose different representations of fimes are presented in table 8 while covs of model error are presented in table 9 three 3d bem codes based on wgf are grouped and the average values of fime and cov are calculated in the column 3d bem wgf fime and cov of 3d bem code based on rankine source and fime of strip theory are given in columns 3d bem rs and st respectively in the last column for each damage type the average value for all codes used in the benchmark is provided although only one code used in the analysis and comparison with only one set of experimental results is not enough to validate certain theory it is nevertheless used as an indication and also to present the methodology that can be employed in other seakeeping benchmarks in order to enable analysis of results 0 9 fime 1 1 is considered to represent satisfactory agreement of theory and experiments while fime 0 8 or fime 1 2 is considered as unacceptable correlation between calculation and experiments it should be noted that these fime limits are subjective and indicative in order to simplify the analysis and the interpretation of results based on such subjective interpretation of fime for the intact ship the average theoretical prediction is satisfactory in 50 of the cases while unacceptable in 33 of the cases analysed these figures read 48 and 39 for ds2 and 39 and 44 for ds3 therefore there is a worsening trend of average theoretical prediction for damaged compared to intact ship regarding the performance of individual theories 3d bem wgf method shows unacceptable fime in 33 55 and 50 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively unacceptable prediction of 3d bem rs methods is achieved in 44 45 and 33 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively as for strip theory unacceptable prediction is achieved in 50 and 67 of cases for intact ship and ds3 respectively these percentages include all quantities given in table 8 similarly as for fime in order to enable analysis of results cov 0 5 is considered to represent satisfactory confidence of fime while cov 1 0 is considered as unacceptable dispersion of results around fime subjective cov limits are introduced in order to simplify the analysis and the interpretation of results based on such subjective interpretation of fime for the intact ship the dispersion of model errors around fime is satisfactory in 39 of the cases while unacceptable in 56 of the cases analysed these figures read 35 and 61 for ds2 and 28 and 44 for ds3 similarly as for fime there is a worsening trend of dispersion of the model error regarding performance of individual theories 3d bem wgf method shows unacceptable cov of the model error in 33 65 and 44 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively unacceptable cov of 3d bem rs methods is achieved in 39 45 and 44 of cases for intact ship ds2 and ds3 respectively as for strip theory unacceptable cov is achieved in 50 of cases for intact ship as well as for ds3 these percentages include all quantities given in table 9 5 6 effect of transfer function uncertainty on the short term response consequences of transfer function uncertainties on short term ship responses are determined for the vwbm which is the most important wave load component two uncertainty measures are calculated namely the ratio of standard deviations χ equation 7 and tfe ε equation 8 both ratio of standard deviations χ and tfe ε are calculated for the issc spectrum as the weighting function in equations 7 and 8 the issc spectrum is given as 10 s ω 5 ω p 4 h s 2 16 ω 5 e 1 25 ω p ω 4 where ω p is the peak angular frequency rad s ω p 2 π t p 2 π 1 408 t z t p is the modal period s t z is the mean zero up crossing period s while h s is the significant wave height m furthermore as significant wave height h s can be cancelled in equations 7 and 8 χ and ε are independent of h s and it is therefore enough to consider variation of χ and ε with t z in the present study range of credible mean zero up crossing periods from 5 to 15 s is considered in χ and ε calculation the ratio of standard deviations χ and tfe ε of vwbm for intact ship and damaged ship for ds2 and ds3 is presented in fig 23 fig 24 and fig 25 respectively from the ratios of standard deviations for head seas β 180 it may be concluded that the performance of 3d theories is much better compared to the strip theory for lower periods of sea states however as periods of sea states increase the ratio of spectral response based on experimental and predicted transfer functions for strip theory is approaching 0 9 while the same ratio for 3d theories is above 1 1 for the same heading tfe is reducing rapidly with increasing wave periods for strip theory and eventually approaching 30 tfe for 3d theories is lower and reads between 10 and 30 for all wave periods when considering all heading angles one may conclude from fig 23 that uncertainty of vwbm response is the highest for beam seas and lowest for head seas this is valid for both spectral uncertainty measures used the only exception is strip theory with tfe in head seas for low sea state periods for the damaged ship in ds2 the ratio of standard deviations for vwbm in heads seas is between 0 9 and 1 1 for all mean zero up crossing periods of sea states this ratio is not very sensitive to the wave periods tfe is almost constant and reads about 10 for all methods compared to the intact ship uncertainty of the response seems to be lower for ds2 regarding both spectral uncertainty measures similarly as for the intact ship uncertainty of vwbm response is obviously highest for beam seas and lowest for head seas for head seas the trend of χ and ε is similar for ds3 as for the intact ship for stern quartering waves spectral uncertainty measures are somewhat reduced compared to the same heading for the intact ship it is also interesting to notice that the performance of uncertainty measures for ds3 is better for stern quartering seas than for head seas this was not the case for the intact ship and for ds2 spectral uncertainty measures for ds3 are the worst for beam seas 6 conclusions this paper presented a benchmark and uncertainty assessment study on global wave induced loads in a damaged ship initiated and organised by the marstruct virtual institute and contributing to the work of the issc ittc joint committee six independent seakeeping analysis codes participated in the benchmark test for linear motions and loads on the damaged dtmb 5415 warship transfer functions are calculated using the added weight method for the intact ship and unsymmetrical and symmetrical flooding scenarios with respect to damage conditions of the ship uncertainty analysis based on frequency independent model error fime is used for the comparison of the experimental and computational results findings and conclusions are as follows satisfactory agreement of heave and pitch transfer functions is noticed for all heading angles and all damage scenarios the only exception is pitch tfs for beam waves where a large dispersion of results is noticed vbm and vsf show generally larger dispersion than vertical motion components but the correlation between the computations and measurements is still acceptable for head and stern quartering waves except for strip theory which considerably overestimate measurements hbm and hsf show larger scatter than vertical load components especially for unsymmetrical flooding scenario in beam waves the possible reason for this difference is the small model scale and sloshing in the damaged compartments prediction of torsional moments is the worst compared to all other load components and unsatisfactory in almost all cases this poor prediction of torsion may be partially explained by uncertainty in measurements accuracy of prediction of vertical and horizontal bending moments and shear forces for stern quartering waves depends whether incoming waves act on the damaged or the intact side of the ship for beam waves and torsional moments there is no such differences in the accuracy with respect to the side of incoming waves there is a worsening trend of average theoretical prediction for damaged compared to the intact ship the added weight method is not able to predict hbm and hsf with reasonable accuracy in head seas for unsymmetrical flooding scenario performance of 3d bem wgf theory is the best for intact ship while 3d bem rs shows smallest differences for damaged ship in both damage scenarios strip theory has the weakest indicators of the accuracy for intact and damaged ship in addition uncertainty in vwbm is assessed using two spectral based uncertainty assessment methods it was shown that for this the most important wave load component prediction accuracy for damaged ship using added weight method is comparable or even better for damaged than for intact ship the presented results might point out needs for following future research topics and directions improvement is required for the prediction of horizontal global wave load components and torsional moments one way to progress could be to include sloshing effects in damaged compartments there were some differences already in the basic hydrostatics between the codes this is also a potential cause for accumulated differences in the results also the applied panel sizes or number of strips can have a big effect this could be better synchronised and coordinated in the future studies finally there is an inherent uncertainty in the experimental measurements that has been herein not accounted for thus another direction of future research could be to improve measurement accuracy for the wave induced loads on intact and damaged ships these conclusions and recommendations may be useful for the regulatory work of classification societies and of the international maritime organisation with respect to solas safe return to port provisions and also for navies and salvage operators regarding the survivability and salvage of damaged ships finally as there is a tendency nowadays to use accidental limit states in ship structural design the present results may be useful for uncertainty quantification when applying reliability based methods for that purpose credit authorship contribution statement joško parunov writing original
