6455,developing an understanding of how groundwater gw and surface water sw systems function and interact to impact water quantity water quality and ecosystem health provides a basis for management of water resources environmental protection and land management although knowledge of these complex and dynamic systems has improved in recent decades there is currently no systematic guidance for conceptualizing and evaluating gw sw interactions and identifying their potential impact on management issues for this reason a holistic framework was created to provide a comprehensive and logical approach for identifying understanding and evaluating the key factors and processes controlling gw sw interactions and understanding their relationship to environmental problems the framework identifies fundamental hydrological biogeochemical and biological processes and critical factors to consider when developing robust conceptual models of gw sw systems the framework is comprehensive and can be adapted to different problems using only the aspects necessary to address a specific issue the framework focuses on streams rivers and lakes but can be adapted for use in other gw sw settings such as ponds wetlands and coastal marine environments applicability of the framework is illustrated through evaluation of three gw sw interaction settings in southern ontario canada a groundwater contaminant plume discharging to the pine river discharge of groundwater nutrients to lake huron and a regional scale conceptualization of gw sw flow interactions in the duffins creek watershed the case studies highlight flexibility of the framework to develop conceptual models assess environmental issues identify knowledge gaps and provide a basis for designing site investigations keywords groundwater surface water interaction conceptual models great lakes water quality water quantity ecosystems 1 introduction management of water resources and the environment often requires a multidisciplinary understanding of groundwater surface water gw sw interactions because these interactions form key linkages between terrestrial activities aquatic ecosystems and water resource integrity although the potential for gw sw interactions to impact water quality water quantity and ecosystem health is well recognized winter et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 usepa 2000 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 environment agency 2009 krause et al 2017 it is not always adequately considered in management decisions smith et al 2008 managers decision makers and the scientists who support them often lack the background conceptual understanding tools and strategies to identify and address all the issues affected by gw sw interactions in a comprehensive and co ordinated manner multidisciplinary understanding of gw sw interactions including hyporheic zone processes and hydrologic exchange flows have advanced considerably in the past two decades fleckenstein et al 2010 robertson and wood 2010 krause et al 2011 2014 boano et al 2014 harvey and gooseff 2015 wondzell 2015 peralta maraver et al 2018 however despite the need for an integrated understanding of these processes in environmental management smith et al 2008 krause et al 2011 practical guidance is generally lacking regarding how to conceptualize and evaluate gw sw systems in a manner that holistically integrates knowledge of the ecological biogeochemical and physical processes and their impacts it is often challenging to determine the extent to which gw sw interactions may occur in a particular setting and assess their potential impacts on the sw gw and transition zone between them many factors influence gw sw interactions such as the type of sw body and geomorphological hydrological topographical geological chemical biological ecological and climatological factors that vary both spatially and temporally the most important factors to consider for a given system also depend on the specific management issue in question for example the biogeochemical processes that biodegrade a nitrate gw plume passing through a riverbed before it discharges to a river may be important with respect to the impact on river water quality however those same processes are essentially irrelevant for determining whether or not a sufficient amount of gw discharges to maintain river base flow during droughts due to the increased recognition of the importance of gw sw interactions for environmental management decisions there is a growing need to conceptualize gw sw systems identify the dominant gw sw interaction processes and determine their impacts conceptual site models need to be developed even in the absence of detailed field data to guide the design of studies monitoring efforts and for a variety of different management decisions existing classification schemes that conceptualize gw sw interactions provide valuable insights regarding important factors but are usually designed for relatively specific settings or purposes and are not universally applicable some classifications focus on flow processes and often include the concepts of flow direction at the gw sw interface gaining losing or flow through and gw sw connectivity connected or disconnected e g bailly comte et al 2009 reid et al 2009 ivkovic 2009 in contrast classification schemes for natural attenuation of pollutants consider factors such as sediment organic carbon content permeability and bed thickness smith et al 2009 classification schemes for groundwater dependent ecosystems consider factors such as gw levels redox conditions and ph bertrand et al 2012 gw sw interactions also often need to be conceptualized at different scales woessner 2000 boano et al 2014 conceptualizations of flow interactions have incorporated various scales of topography and geological architecture for example landscape descriptions of hydrogeological settings winter 2001 dahl et al 2007 flow system geometry and aquifer sw connections nield et al 1994 winter 1999 dahl et al 2007 streambed sediment heterogeneity conant 2004 and stream morphology such as bedforms and sediment bars packman and brooks 2001 cardenas and wilson 2006 cardenas 2008 boano et al 2014 however the principal challenge of linking fine scale causal factors with large scale consequences still remains harvey and gooseff 2015 krause et al 2017 despite the seemingly disparate nature of these studies scales and settings it was hypothesized that the observed relationships and behaviors can be distilled to a set of basic and fundamental processes and that a framework focused on these processes without categorizing specific physical settings would have the potential to be applicable to a wide variety of gw sw problems the goal of this study was to develop a framework to guide conceptualization of gw sw interactions in streams rivers and lake environments and that identifies fundamental interaction processes and their potential impacts on science informed water management decisions the intent was to design a simple flexible framework that does not impose a rigorous classification scheme or a strictly deductive or inductive approach such as those described by olden et al 2012 another key objective was to create a framework focused on identifying key gw sw processes patterns and controls so that it can be broadly applicable to a wide range of issues and sw body types this type of framework would be useful to environmental practitioners and scientists who are familiar with parts of gw and sw systems but require a guide to better understand and conceptualize system dynamics to support water management decisions and to recognize knowledge gaps the framework was applied to three gw sw sites in southern ontario canada to test the value and usefulness of the framework 2 framework for gw sw interactions a framework is defined as a conceptual structure of ideas merriam webster 2018 the framework presented herein focuses on system functions and processes associated with streams rivers and lakes and it can readily be adapted to other gw sw interaction settings such as ponds wetlands and coastal marine environments the framework consists of a series of diagrams to help guide the user through a holistic assessment of their gw sw system and develop a conceptual model which can be used to test applicable hypotheses the framework diagrams highlight the important elements of gw sw systems the framework is not a flow chart that must be rigorously followed but rather a guidance tool that can be adapted for specific user needs and gw sw settings the framework diagrams figs 1 7 and the fundamental questions they are designed to address are described in the following sections the framework is intentionally simple and represents considerable synthesis and distilling of information into a series of diagrams that are easy to understand and use four main design criteria were followed during development of the framework 1 combine and simplify concepts and questions into their most fundamental parts whenever possible 2 identify fundamental gw sw processes 3 design a comprehensive framework addressing the most relevant issues and impacts associated with gw sw systems water quality water quantity and ecosystems and 4 present the framework as a series of simple reader friendly diagrams not tables that pose key questions in order to enhance a user s conceptual understanding 2 1 definition of terms prior to discussing the framework it is appropriate to define some fundamental terms sw is defined as the water present on the surface of the earth in streams rivers ponds lakes wetlands estuaries and oceans gw is the water contained in the pore spaces fractures and other openings in subsurface materials below the water table the gw sw interface is the physical boundary between gw and sw this boundary is a surface where the bottom of the sw contacts the top of the subsurface materials the hyporheic zone is the region beneath and adjacent to streams or rivers where sw flows into the subsurface and subsequently discharges back to the streams or rivers white 1993 some definitions of the hyporheic zone may include additional criteria such as water residence time chemical concentrations or distribution of biota environmental agency 2009 smith 2005 white 1993 the transition zone is defined as a three dimensional volume beneath and adjacent to sw bodies where gw sw interactions occur and conditions transition from a gw dominated system to a sw dominated system usepa 2008 conant et al 2016 the transition zone includes the subsurface materials that can modify the flow biogeochemical and ecological conditions of water passing from gw to sw or vice versa for example the sediments adjacent to and beneath streams and lakes often differ from those of the regional gw flow system and should be considered part of the transition zone because they can significantly influence the quantity and quality of gw passing through it even though sw may never flow through these sediments in this regard the transition zone is analogous to and includes the furthest lateral extent of the hyporheic zone and what krause et al 2017 termed as the ecohydrological interface for gw sw systems they define the ecohydrological interface as dynamic transition zones that may develop at ecosystem or subsystem boundaries and control the movement and transformation of organisms water matter and energy between adjacent systems therefore the transition zone as defined in this paper is where gw sw interactions occur and it contains within it the gw sw interface the hyporheic zone and the gw sw ecohydrological interface 2 2 overview diagram the structure outlining how to evaluate a gw sw system fig 1 is divided into three main sections 1 an evaluation of the dynamics of the individual gw and sw systems and their potential to interact at the gw sw interface or in the transition zone between gw and sw 2 an assessment of the different gw sw interaction processes in the transition zone and their resulting spatial patterns and temporal variability and 3 an identification of the potential impacts that gw sw interactions may have on the water quantity water quality and ecosystems associated with the gw sw and transition zone 2 3 evaluating sw systems the evaluation of sw systems fig 2 is designed to answer two key questions 1 what are the sw levels and or flows over time and 2 what is the sw quality over time at the gw sw interface the objective is to determine the dynamics of the sw system where it interfaces with the transition zone sw quantity and quality are a function of the upstream watershed characteristics e g topography geology area soils and land use other factors include climate and hydrological characteristics e g evapotranspiration water balance and runoff flowpaths anthropogenic factors influencing water levels and flows include regulation by dams withdrawals for water supply or irrigation stormwater discharge and agricultural tile drainage changes in geomorphology and channel structures can influence stream water levels whereas lake hydraulic processes e g waves seiches and wind setup and lake geometry e g bathymetry and surface area affect local lake water level fluctuations the characterization of sw needs to consider the scale of the issue appropriately for example understanding local controls on lake water levels may be more relevant than undertaking a full watershed scale characterization if one is only examining issues along a small segment of a shoreline of a large lake sw quality is affected by natural water quality of the watershed runoff point source anthropogenic inputs from stormwater sewage water and tile drains and non point source anthropogenic inputs such as nutrient runoff from agricultural fields once in sw solutes and contaminants are subject to a variety of chemical reactions and biological transformations that can modify water quality as a result of interaction with sediment organic matter and living organisms in streams and rivers short residence times and greater variability in upstream flowpaths and processes can result in more significant spatial and temporal variability in sw quality than in lakes although lakes generally have longer residence times in lake productivity and biological uptake as well as physical processes such as sw currents stratification lake turnover and mixing all contribute to spatial and temporal variability in water quality 2 4 evaluating gw systems gw systems tend to be less temporally variable than sw systems yet they do change over time and vary spatially evaluating a gw system requires consideration of two key questions at a scale relevant to the issues of concern fig 3 1 what is the quantity of gw flowing to the transition zone over time and 2 what is the quality of the gw entering the transition zone the objective is to determine the dynamics of the gw system where it interfaces with the transition zone similar to the sw system evaluation the watershed climate and hydrogeological characteristics within the contributing area determine the flow and quality of gw entering the transition zone aquifer and aquitard characteristics such as geology geometry and hydraulic properties are factors in the gw flow system assessment differences in water levels in aquifers indicate flow directions and storage changes in the gw system natural and anthropogenic sources of recharge e g precipitation and stormwater infiltration ponds and discharge e g seeps springs and gw pumping can alter the water balance and the quantity of water reaching the transition zone the quality of gw entering the transition zone depends on the source of recharge the geochemical evolution of gw along its flowpaths and anthropogenic chemical inputs to the gw system the concentrations of chemicals in gw may be modified by abiotic and biotic reactions including aqueous phase and sediment aqueous reactions e g adsorption desorption precipitation dissolution as they flow through the subsurface 2 5 transition zone connectivity and characteristics the transition zone defined previously refers to the three dimensional volume that delineates the change from a gw system to a sw system the transition zone can vary spatially and temporally and its functional extent may differ depending whether the management issue is related to water quantity quality or ecosystem issues identifying the hydrological connectivity geology and chemical characteristics of the transition zone between sw and gw is essential to determine what gw sw interactions may be important in a specific setting fig 4 shows factors that should be considered to address three key questions related to the transition zone 1 what is the potential for water to flow through the transition zone over time 2 what is the potential for the water chemistry to be modified as it crosses the transition zone over time and 3 what is the potential for the zone to support biological species and communities the hydrological connectivity is determined by the physical extent over which the transition zone directly connects the gw and sw systems and by the physical properties of the zone e g hydraulic conductivity k some streams can be perched above an unsaturated zone and therefore be disconnected from the underlying gw system whereas other streams can be areas of constant groundwater discharge winter et al 1998 the magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradients between gw and sw are fundamental drivers for flow across the transition zone the connectivity can also change over time due to sediment erosion deposition biological activity anthropogenic alteration and changes in permafrost in cold regions resulting in enhanced or reduced connectivity dredging infilling and lining sections of channels with concrete are examples of human activities that modify connectivity natural armoring and precipitation of dissolved constituents in bed materials typically reduce connectivity by occluding pore spaces connectivity is also altered by biological processes such as bioturbation growth of aquatic vegetation colmation clogging of the bed material with fines biofilms and algal growth and local creation of fish redds spawning nests the water chemistry including parameters such as dissolved oxygen content redox conditions and nutrient and contaminant concentrations is directly affected by the chemical composition of the sediments in the transition zone organic matter content of those materials the extent of deposits adjacent to the sw body e g flood plain deposits in the riparian zone biological communities e g biofilms and human activities the factors governing the hydrologic connectivity together with the geological and chemical properties can control the viability of certain biological communities in the transition zone e g the hyporheos benthos mussels and clams algae and aquatic plants 2 6 gw sw interaction processes characterizing the processes associated with gw sw interactions is critical to determining their importance and potential impacts interactions can be divided into three types of processes flow biogeochemical and biological with the most fundamental processes for each type summarized in fig 5 determining how these processes act is needed to answer the key question what are the resulting spatial and temporal patterns of gw sw interactions fig 6 2 6 1 flow processes fig 5 shows flow processes are divided into three types ones that apply to all settings those associated only with stream and rivers and ones that are just associated with lakes numerous flow processes apply to all settings and they include gaining gw discharge into sw losing sw flowing into gw flow through gaining at one side of a sw body and losing on the other side and zero exchange no exchange of water or parallel flow of sw and gw see bear 1979 winter et al 1998 woessner 2000 stream flow and lakes also can be perennial intermittent or ephemeral which has implications for the subsurface flow processes flowpaths and gw sw exchange preferential flow across the transition zone can occur through fractures macropores such as root holes locally high k sediments karst solution features and engineered conduits which can generate high flux springs e g conant 2004 or disappearing streams bank storage is a larger scale flow process where sw flows laterally into the banks of streams and lakes as a result of the rise of sw levels above the adjacent water table e g when a flood pulse passes through an area water stored in the banks may discharge back into the sw when sw levels drop and gradients reverse where bedload transport is active rivers lakes bed turnover and entrainment can occur as migrating sediment e g bedforms entrap sw in the intra particle spaces when they are emplaced and then entrapped sw can be released as the beds migrate or are eroded packman and brooks 2001 santos et al 2012 whenever water moves through streambed or lakebed materials mixing processes within the transition zone such as mechanical dispersion and back diffusion from dead end pores can affect the function of the transition zone additionally constructed facilities such as infiltration galleries or pumping gw wells near sw bodies can induce infiltration of sw to gw flow processes that are just associated with streams and rivers are hyporheic zone flow and groundwater ridging hyporheic flow occurs where moving sw and changes in streambed geomorphology and topography in flowing streams cause sw to flow into the streambed and banks flow parallel to the stream and return back into the sw downstream white 1993 hyporheic zones can be dynamic and complex biogeochemical zones that have unique biota and flow patterns usepa 2008 environment agency 2009 hyporheic flow is not the same as bank storage because it is driven by differences in streambed geomorphology and topography whereas bank storage is driven by transient changes in sw level gw ridging occurs when precipitation infiltrates bank deposits having a thick capillary fringe and the added water causes the water in the capillary fringe to go from negative pressure to positive pressure and results in a disproportionate rise in the gw table adjacent to the sw body gillham 1984 zang et al 2018 causing a transient increase in gw flow to sw flow processes associated with lakes include hydrological exchanges driven by waves seiches tides lake bed currents and lake turnover fig 5 landward of the shoreline wave driven exchanges cause sw to infiltrate into unsaturated permeable lakeshore sediments heiss et al 2015 robinson et al 2018 wave driven exchange is also induced by wave setup onshore hydraulic gradients caused by breaking waves which can cause sw to circulate through nearshore saturated sediments to a depth of centimeters up to 10 m li and barry 2000 lee et al 2014 malott et al 2016 seiches are standing wave oscillations caused by wind setup and barometric pressure changes across an enclosed water body as salek and schwab 2004 seiches cause lake level fluctuations centimeters to meters in height and temporary reversals in local hydraulic gradients that drive water into or out of nearshore and lakebed sediments taniguchi and fukuo 1996 the process is similar to bank storage in streams in thermally stratified lakes wind setup across the lake can also cause internal seiches that are characterized by vertical oscillations in the thermocline the changing thermal density gradients across the lake bed sediments as the thermocline oscillates can drive water exchange chowdhury et al 2016 cossu et al 2017 in very large lakes gravitational forces of the moon and sun can induce small tidal oscillations in sw levels trebitz 2006 that drive water exchange back and forth across the lakebed sediments current bedform exchange occurs when sw currents flow over small scale bedforms causing sw to circulate through lakebed sediments and return to the sw body it is similar to hyporheic zone flow in streams santos et al 2012 lake turnover is a density driven process when an entire lake water column mixes as a result of the loss of thermal stratification due to seasonal heating or cooling density variations can cause considerable exchange across the gw sw interface golosov and ignatieva 1999 2 6 2 biogeochemical processes biogeochemical processes shown in fig 5 include a wide range of biotic and abiotic reaction types that can modify the water quality in the transition zone the transition zone is often a zone of high reactivity due to the mixing of different quality waters water passing through sediments of differing chemical compositions e g mcclain et al 2003 harvey et al 2013 lee et al 2014 and unique microbial communities febria et al 2010 for example streambeds and lakebed sediments typically contain organic matter decay of organic matter contributes to reducing conditions and the resulting strong chemical gradients e g redox and ph in the transition zone act as drivers for the transformation biodegradation and attenuation of chemical constituents in some cases the hyporheic zone can be more oxic than the discharging groundwater and for example low ph gw from acid mine drainage contacting a more oxic hyporheic zone can result in metal precipitation in streambed sediments before the gw reaches the sw benner et al 1995 other processes that occur when different quality waters come in contact with each other or with different sediments include acid and base reactions that can cause dissolution and precipitation of minerals e g caco3 metal complexation with dissolved organic carbon or ligands which can change metal mobility ion exchange e g dissolved ca2 and mg2 exchanging for na adsorption desorption e g po4 p sorption to metal oxide minerals and diffusion driven by concentration gradients some contaminants in water e g petroleum products chlorinated solvents polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are hydrophobic and preferentially partition onto the sediments particularly organic materials and clays thereby accumulating in the organic rich deposits of the transition zone e g conant et al 2004 gases such as methane hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide can also be created by biologically mediated reactions in transition zones and released to surface water volatile contaminants like petroleum products and chlorinated solvents in the water can also partition into gas bubbles that move up through sediments ebulliate and are then released to sw and into the atmosphere e g vroblesky and lorah 1991 2 6 3 biological processes transpiration colmation bioturbation biological uptake and release e g algal blooms due to eutrophication phytoremediation zebra mussels and biomodification of sw flow e g water hyacinths beaver dams are examples of biological processes that are not microbiological processes that directly influence flow and biogeochemistry in the transition zone fig 5 e g brunke 1999 lewandowski et al 2007 hölker et al 2015 other biological processes that influence biotic communities more directly are grouped under the category of ecological processes numerous factors such as habitat disturbance competition predation and decomposition can influence ecological habitat distributions population dynamics as well as cycling of energy carbon and nutrients in the sw gw and transition zone e g vervier et al 1993 boulton et al 2010 krause et al 2011 ecological processes can be an important link between gw sw interaction processes gw sw interaction patterns and specific management issues particularly those involving ecosystems and biologic controls on water quantity and quality and vice versa finally anthropogenic perturbations of habitats species or biogeochemical cycling e g forest harvesting introduction of invasive species addition of nutrients that cause algal blooms and acid mine drainage also have consequences for biological processes and gw sw interactions e g brunke and gonser 1997 2 7 resulting gw sw patterns the intensity distribution and duration of the flow biogeochemical and biological processes in the transition zone fig 5 determine the resulting spatial distributions and temporal variability of water flows water quality and biological patterns observed at the gw sw interface fig 6 characterizing e g mapping these patterns can be very valuable and can provide insight into dominant processes however sufficient data are rarely available to fully define gw sw interactions therefore a combination of observed patterns fig 6 and known or inferred processes fig 5 form the basis for assessing and predicting overall impacts fig 7 2 7 1 flow patterns characterization of the flux and direction of flow between gw and sw fig 6 is critical to assessing gw sw interaction processes and impacts the scale of the assessment must be relevant to the physical setting the processes and the management issue at hand for example it is reasonable to quantify gw contributions to stream flow at the sub watershed and watershed scales for water supply evaluations whereas evaluating a gw contaminant plume discharging to a stream may require characterization at the local reach or sub meter scales see case studies although important by itself for determining the transport of water and dissolved constituents the subsurface extent and exact flowpaths of gw sw exchange and mixing of gw and sw in the transition zone can also influence patterns of biogeochemical and biological processes at the gw sw interface 2 7 2 biogeochemical patterns biogeochemical processes in the transition zone can significantly modify water quality but not necessarily uniformly in space or time e g hendricks and white 1991 1995 conant et al 2004 biogeochemical activity can be high locally hot spots or during short time periods hot moments mcclain et al 2003 vidon et al 2010 robinson et al 2016 krause et al 2017 although some biogeochemical processes occur on a small scale within bed deposits or in the riparian zone e g in a thin layer of organic rich sediment they may nonetheless disproportionately influence chemical fluxes at a larger scale mcclain et al 2003 patterns of microbiological communities or biologically important chemical species along flowpaths and in sediment profiles e g nutrients toxins acidity and oxygen can provide insight into the nature and progression of biogeochemical reactions in fig 5 and gw sw interaction processes e g storey et al 2004 2 7 3 biological patterns biological patterns relevant to gw sw interactions can be diverse and include variables such as habitat or population distributions species richness energy cycling or biogeochemical cycling and these patterns can be characterized by measuring habitat fragmentation diversity and biotic indexes and nutrient or chemical distributions these patterns can provide some insight into biological biogeochemical and flow processes of gw sw interactions and vice versa however the biological patterns may also be of interest because they may relate closely to relevant management issues and impacts for example the delineation of aquatic and benthic species distributions and habitats are relevant to fish habitat compensation issues whilst simultaneously providing insight into gw sw interaction processes necessary to support such habitats 2 8 impacts potential impacts of gw sw interaction processes for stream river and lake environments are detailed in fig 7 they are divided by water type sw gw or the transition zone and by the main issues of water quantity water quality and ecosystems the list is succinct but not exhaustive and provides examples of common issues for different water types assessing which gw sw interactions are most important depends on the issue and the particular receptor s of concern e g receiving water bodies or ecological communities watershed scale issues are also listed e g urban and land use planning water policy development environmental impacts assessments and best management practices in fig 7 to indicate that gw sw interactions may also need to be considered cumulatively for broader issues extending beyond riparian and littoral zones 3 case studies 3 1 the pine river case study transition zone modification of water quality the pine river study is the first of three case study sites fig 8 selected to demonstrate the applicability of the framework to different management issues and different hydrological settings in southern ontario the pine river case study is a well characterized example of gw contamination flowing into a river conant 2001 conant 2004 conant et al 2004 abe et al 2009 roy and bickerton 2012 this situation occurs in many urban settings ellis and rivett 2007 rivett et al 2011 roy and bickerton 2012 the primary concern is the potential impact on sw quality and aquatic life this case study highlights the applicability of the framework to assess a complex set of gw sw processes and build a robust conceptual model the main purpose of previous investigations was to understand the processes controlling the transport and fate of a tetrachloroethylene pce plume as it migrated from the gw through the transition zone and into a 60 m reach of the pine river located in angus ontario fig 9 findings of the previous investigations have been put into the framework structure to illustrate how impacts can be assessed 3 1 1 surface water system the pine river is a perennial unregulated river fed primarily by gw neff et al 2005 with a mean monthly discharge of 2 29 m3 s conant 2001 the river was typically 0 5 m deep and 14 m wide in the summer but the stage increased by as much as 2 m during the spring melt the evaluation of sw was straightforward because the study focused on observing existing conditions for a short section of river it was not necessary to understand all the upstream factors responsible for the changes in river stage fig 2 instead it was sufficient to monitor the actual river stage perform stream flow gauging and develop a rating curve to quantify river flow at the study reach river stage and flow measurements were used for quantifying vertical flow direction across the riverbed and dilution of gw discharge respectively the sw quality was monitored to determine the background river water quality that would be either receiving the discharging gw plume or infiltrating the riverbed as hyporheic flow conant 2001 showed that sw entering the reach had no pce monthly sampling indicated oxygenated sw with low and relatively constant concentrations of nitrate and chloride moee 1996 3 1 2 groundwater system the gw system characterization focused primarily on determining gw quality characterizing the size shape and concentration of the pce plume in the fine sand confined aquifer was critical for determining the contamination entering the transition zone so that changes occurring within the zone could be determined the pce plume was about 60 m wide and 4 m thick with peak pce concentrations above 10 000 μg l conant 2001 conant et al 2004 the concentrations were higher than the us and ontario drinking water quality standards and the usepa ambient water quality criteria of 840 μg l for chronic exposure for freshwater aquatic life usepa 1986 the pce plume reaching the transition zone figs 9 and 10 contained trace to no pce degradation products natural redox conditions in the confined aquifer were essentially anaerobic but not nitrate reducing the fine sands of the confined aquifer contained little organic material fraction of organic content foc 0 02 0 03 such that sorption and retardation of pce in the aquifer was minimal as was the potential for biodegradation conant 2001 hunkeler et al 2004 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradients darcy s law and gw contaminant concentrations were used to quantify flows and contaminant mass fluxes along the flowpath within the confined aquifer traveling toward the transition zone they were also used for in stream dilution calculations 3 1 3 transition zone connectivity and properties semi confining fluvial deposits at the interface between the river and confined aquifer controlled the nature and distribution of connectivity and gw sw interaction processes the gw plume discharged from the sand aquifer through the semi confining deposits of interbedded silts peats and clays and sand layers fig 9 the discharge through the semi confining deposits varied spatially from essentially zero flow to high flux preferential pathways and flow zones over 446 l m2d higher flux was evident where the river had eroded through the semi confining deposits and replaced them with sand and gravel these served as high k geological windows through the semi confining deposits fig 10 the material properties of the semi confining deposits also had the potential to modify the water chemistry at the interface over time the deposits had very high fraction of organic carbon foc contents mean value of 4 9 conant et al 2004 recent fluvial riverbed deposits also had some lenses of high organic material the organic deposits resulted in reducing conditions including methanogenesis and the potential to both adsorb and anaerobically biodegrade pce 3 1 4 groundwater surface water interactions and processes at this site the most important gw sw processes in the framework which affected the plume were the flow and biogeochemical processes fig 11 overall the river was gaining gw with distinct areas of preferential discharge conant 2004 some small areas of the riverbed were losing e g at the upstream end of a riffle zero exchange where low k clays were present or hyporheic flow zones sampling and analysis of porewater in the transition zone revealed a wide range of redox conditions from nitrate reducing to methanogenic and extensive degradation of pce to trichloroethylene tce cis 1 2 dichloroethylene cis 1 2 dce vinyl chloride and other compounds in a relatively thin zone of active degradation fig 10 sediment sample analyses indicated significant amounts up to 81 mg kg which are higher than remediation standards of sorbed pce tce and cis 1 2 dce in the high foc deposits the contaminants also had diffused into some of these lower k deposits over time and become concentrated there processes present but of minor importance at the site included bed turnover of sediments aqueous gas phase partitioning in the sediments and colmation fig 11 mapping of riverbed porewater concentrations indicated that the size concentration and composition of the pce plume changed as it passed through the transition zone the influence of gw sw interactions on the plume fig 10 produced two main patterns 1 preferential flow through sand in the semi confining bed allowed high concentrations of pce to discharge into the river without being transformed and 2 low to moderate flow through low k organic rich highly reducing semi confining deposits resulted in biodegradation of pce and sorption of the contaminants the area of the plume in the riverbed was about twice as large as its cross sectional area in the aquifer the concentrations patterns in the riverbed did not match those in the aquifer where the gw plume consisted entirely of pce whereas large areas of the riverbed and transition zone the plume consisted entirely of degradation products conant et al 2004 although pce was extensively biodegraded mass balance calculations for the overall plume indicated very little of the total mass of the plume had been converted to non toxic daughter products e g ethane ethene or co2 3 1 5 potential impacts the primary impact of the pce gw plume in this case study was that it contaminated the porewater and sediments in the transition zone and adversely exposed the associated ecology whereas the impact on sw was minimal fig 12 porewater and sediment samples from the transition zone showed that although there was biodegradation of the pce high concentrations of contaminants persisted in the transition zone because the plume did not undergo appreciable dilution by hyporheic mixing moreover contaminants accumulated on the high foc sediments in many instances the hyporheic benthic and other aquatic life in the transition zone were exposed to concentrations above chronic freshwater aquatic life standards because fish tend to spawn in gw discharge zones it meant eggs may have been preferentially laid where the pce plume was discharging overall the sw quality was not appreciably affected because discharging contaminants were significantly diluted by upstream sw flow very low concentrations of pce were only detected in sw near high gw discharge zones in the riverbed and no pce degradation products were detectable in sw despite high concentrations in the transition zone monitoring within the transition zone was essential because neither the sw nor the gw plume indicated the presence of biodegradation products the gw sw framework supports the development of a robust conceptual model that successfully related the relevant processes and key factors to impacts caused by the pce plume the framework highlights the significance of the transition zone connectivity in this complex scenario where multiple gw sw interactions processes were important the conceptualization findings and approach are transferable to other sites and highlight the importance of small scale variability in the transition zone on water flow and quality although most sites will likely not be as well characterized as this one recognizing the role of the transition zone on gw sw interaction patterns and their potential impacts is possible at other sites based on understanding the geological setting and dominant processes 3 2 nottawasaga bay case study nutrient discharge to a large lake the potential impacts of gw sw interactions for a particular management issue often need to be determined in the absence of detailed field data this case study in eastern nottawasaga bay lake huron fig 8 illustrates the value of applying the framework to form a conceptual model to guide hypothesis development and field monitoring approaches the study focuses on gw contributions of phosphorus and nitrogen to nearshore lake water the study is of intermediate scale focusing on a 15 km segment of sand gravel shoreline with sand gravel shorelines found along about 20 6150 km of the laurentian great lakes shoreline this represents a common physiographic setting ec and usepa 2009 although offshore gw discharge from deeper confining aquifer units can be important in some lake settings e g beversdorf et al 2007 this case study focuses on evaluating shallow nearshore gw discharge within 100 m of the shoreline 3 2 1 surface water system the water level in nottawasaga bay fluctuates seasonally over intra annual cycles lenters 2001 and in response to wind waves and seiches sw currents drive strong offshore and alongshore sw mixing in the bay while most of the shoreline is directly exposed to waves and currents natural embayments and engineered groynes create localized sheltered environments with smaller waves weaker currents and less water exchange with open water these differences in conditions may affect the intensity of gw sw interactions along the shoreline the nearshore sw is generally more oxic basic ph 8 8 3 and has higher organic matter content compared to gw in the surficial aquifer ph 6 9 8 rezanezhad et al 2014 sources of nutrients to the bay include the nottawasaga river streams surface runoff and stormwater outfalls the relative contribution of gw in delivering nutrients to the bay is unknown nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the nearshore sw generally range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l n and 3 2 to 35 µg l p respectively annually rezanezhad et al 2014 3 2 2 groundwater system while the regional hydrogeology in the study area is complex a surficial aquifer is present across most of the lowlands coastal area and outcrops along the shoreline as sand gravel beaches mndm 2016 a 2 km wide unconfined high transmissivity sand gravel tunnel valley aquifer also intersects the shoreline in the study area fig 13 piezometric mapping indicates that gw flow is towards the lake in the surficial and tunnel valley aquifers and therefore these aquifers contribute to nearshore gw discharge golder associates ltd 2013 the main sources of nitrogen nitrate ammonium and phosphorus phosphate to the surficial and tunnel valley aquifers are septic systems and land application of manure fertilizer and biosolids golder associates ltd 2013 nitrate and phosphate levels are elevated in the aquifers with concentrations up to 6 mg l n and 240 µg l p respectively observed in monitoring wells within 100 m of the shoreline these concentrations are over twice the values in the canadian water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life which are 2 95 mg l n and 35 to 100 µg l p ccme 2004 while the shallow gw is generally oxic and becomes more reducing with depth the gw chemistry is highly variable across the study area because nitrate is relatively conservative in oxic gw and phosphate is often mobile in calcareous sandy sediments robertson 2008 both nitrate and phosphorus are expected to reach the gw sw transition zone at concentrations exceeding the canadian water quality guidelines 3 2 3 transition zone connectivity and properties the transition zone between the gw and the lake in the nearshore zone is comprised of calcareous sand gravel beach deposits but differences in deposits along the shoreline result in some spatial variability in fluxes and in the potential to modify the water chemistry within the transition zone in exposed shoreline areas high energy wave action and currents re work nearshore littoral sediments e g by erosion suspension deposition resulting in high k sands and gravels at the interface with low organic matter content in sheltered shoreline areas e g groynes and embayments finer deposits e g silt can accumulate within the sand and gravel deposits leading to lower k sediment that may locally reduce the flux of water across the transition zone because the sand gravel deposits along the exposed shoreline typically have low organic matter content the geochemical conditions within the transition zone are expected to be less reducing than in the lower k sediment found in sheltered shoreline areas which have comparatively higher organic matter content 3 2 4 groundwater surface water interactions and processes on a regional scale the nearshore area is primarily a gw discharge zone with evidence of large scale geologically controlled preferential flow a radon 222 222rn survey conducted along the study shoreline indicated higher amounts of gw in the nearshore sw where the unconfined tunnel valley aquifer intersects the shoreline fig 13 ji et al 2017 this suggests that the regional geology plays an important role in controlling alongshore variability in gw discharge from applying the framework and based on field investigations in similar nearshore environments e g lee et al 2014 malott et al 2017 it can be hypothesized that fluctuations in sw levels caused by waves and seiches are the main drivers for gw sw exchange across the interface in the nearshore zone fig 14 the exchange is highest close to the shoreline i e within 10 m fig 14 dynamic sw level fluctuations near the shoreline are expected to set up a transient transition zone that also varies in size in the alongshore direction based on the intensity of sw level fluctuations i e sheltered vs exposed shoreline gw discharge flux i e beach sediments connected to tunnel valley or surficial aquifer beach morphology and k li and barry 2000 malott et al 2017 it is possible that some gw may flow beneath the transition zone near the shoreline and discharge further offshore but still within the nearshore zone fig 14 malott et al 2016 it is hypothesized that this gw may pass through a thin transition zone dominated by current bedform exchange and lakebed turnover and entrainment santos et al 2012 the transition zone has the potential to be an important zone of mixing and biogeochemical reactions redox acid base precipitation and sorption which may result in changes in water quality including modifying the flux of gw derived nutrients to the lake malott et al 2016 rakhimbekova et al 2018 because there can be high dissolved oxygen or high organic matter content in lake water relative to gw either net oxidizing or net reducing conditions may exist in the transition zone depending on availability and quality of organic matter in the exchanging sw which can vary with time beck et al 2017 where conditions in the transition zone are net reducing gw derived nitrate may be denitrified thereby decreasing the nitrate loading to the sw where conditions are net oxidizing phosphate transport may be retarded by adsorption onto iron and manganese hydr oxides that can precipitate along redox boundaries in the transition zone charette and sholkovitz 2002 lee et al 2014 the processes occurring in the transition zone may also differ at sheltered compared to exposed shoreline locations at sheltered areas the higher availability of organic matter within the transition zone and longer residence times due to the lower k deposits may promote greater denitrification by being more reducing in addition hydr oxide minerals may not form and so gw derived phosphate may be more mobile and likely to discharge to the sw in exposed locations gw that mixes within the transition zone near the shoreline may discharge to the sw with limited to no attenuation of nitrate phosphate may be attenuated if hydr oxide minerals form along redox boundaries set up where gw and sw mix due to the seasonal variations in the sw derived organic matter content as well as temporal variations in sw level fluctuations e g varying wave conditions and water exchange within the transition zone the transition zone and associated geochemical gradients will shift over time rakhimbekova et al 2018 this may lead to periods of higher or lower nutrient flux to the sw as changing redox conditions in the transition zone modify the extent of denitrification or cause desorption and release of phosphate from sediments e g beck et al 2007 the conceptual model formed from applying the framework indicates that complex time varying and spatially variable flow and reaction processes fig 15 may occur in the gw sw transition zone these processes ultimately control the flux of gw derived nutrients to the nearshore sw field approaches designed to evaluate gw derived nutrient loading to nearshore waters need to consider processes in the transition zone rather than only measuring nutrient concentrations in landward monitoring wells as is commonly the practice when choosing investigation sites and analyzing field data it is also important to consider the settings along the shoreline e g sheltered versus exposed and tunnel valley versus shallow aquifers the temporal dynamics of the gw sw flow interactions and the extent of possible biogeochemical transformations in the transition zone 3 2 5 impacts the main potential impacts of the gw sw interactions in this case study concern the water quality nutrient concentrations in the transition zone and in the sw close to the lakebed fig 16 it is possible discharge of nutrient rich gw may promote localized macrophyte and algal growth on lakebed sediments roy et al 2009 naranjo et al 2019 phosphate and nitrate concentrations in the transition zone and water discharging across the lakebed are not expected to be toxic to aquatic life because exchange with sw dilutes gw concentrations in the transition zone although gw discharge has the potential to degrade the sw quality and aquatic ecosystems in nottawasaga bay including promoting eutrophication and algal blooms the relative importance of nutrient loading from gw discharge needs to be evaluated relative to the loading from sw tributaries unfortunately tributary loadings and sw mixing processes in the lake are currently not well constrained although gw discharge may be higher in shoreline areas where tunnel valley aquifers intersect the shoreline this does not necessarily translate to higher nutrient loading to the lake rather both the gw nutrient fluxes and the geochemical processes in the gw sw transition zone need to be taken into account to properly identify settings with high gw derived nutrient loading to the lake this case study illustrates the complexity of measuring and quantifying gw derived nutrient discharge to large lakes and the value of conceptualization for planning field investigations loading estimates based on concentrations measured in landward gw monitoring wells will likely provide maximum nutrient loading rates because they fail to take into account nutrient transformations in the transition zone nutrient loading that occurs in sheltered shoreline areas will differ compared to exposed areas and the design of field investigations should consider this difference furthermore when assessing sw concentrations there may be less dilution of gw derived nutrients in the sw column in sheltered areas due to reduced currents and waves therefore for a given gw nutrient loading rate the impact on the nearshore sw ecosystem may be greater in these areas 3 3 duffins creek case study regional scale conceptualization this case study uses the framework to develop a regional scale conceptual understanding of gw sw flow interactions in the duffins creek watershed fig 9 because watersheds often include several different physiographic or geological settings conceptualization of gw sw interactions may need to not only assess the differences between settings but also consider their cumulative influence at downstream locations the duffins creek watershed provides a pertinent example because it straddles three geological settings they include the hummocky uplands of the oak ridges moraine orm including where it is overlain by halton till an intermediate till plain mostly newmarket till and the former glacial lake iroquois shoreline and lake plain in the downstream portion of the watershed figs 17 and 18 the duffins creek watershed 283 km2 is well characterized e g sibul et al 1977 trca 2002 and has undergone extensive field studies in several disciplines sw models aquafor beech limited 2002 gw models gerber and howard 2000 2002 integrated gw sw models li et al 2008 and sw quality models booty et al 2005 have been developed for the watershed there have been a few local scale gw sw interaction investigations hill and lymburner 1998 duval and hill 2006 2007 hill and duval 2009 as well as other related types of surveys of the watershed e g water quality bowen and hinton 1998 stream baseflow hinton 1995 and fish and benthic communities trca 2004 wallace et al 2013 this case study compares gw sw interactions and their impacts for two types of streams that flow through the different geological settings type i streams with their headwaters in the orm and type ii streams with their headwaters in the till plain fig 17 3 3 1 surface water system stream flow hydrographs constructed from water survey of canada wsc gauging station data show streams respond differently depending on the geological settings streams with headwaters in the orm are perennial with sustained baseflow and respond to snowmelt and most rainfall events e g station 02hc041 in fig 19 a these upstream contributions to flow sustain type i streams downstream through the till and lake iroquois plains e g station 02hc019 in fig 19b in contrast most streams with headwaters in the till plain are intermittent within the till plain and typically have flashy flows dominated by spring snowmelt and a few large rainfall events e g station 02hc044 in fig 19a additional baseflow contributions within the lake iroquois plain ensure that both types of streams are perennial within the former lake plain although type i streams e g station 02hc019 have higher baseflow than type ii streams e g station 02hc114 fig 19b 3 3 2 groundwater system in the area of the orm high k sediments result in high gw recharge and high gw flow toward the transition zones of streams the southward pinching out of orm sediments and the decrease in slope from the orm to the till plain causes most gw to discharge to streams within or near the edge of the orm hinton 1995 gerber and howard 2002 fig 18 large gw storage and relatively small seasonal gw level fluctuations also maintain consistent gw discharge to streams in the orm in contrast the low k newmarket till aquitard in the till plain limits both gw recharge and gw flow to the transition zone of streams furthermore hydraulic gradients in the newmarket till are primarily oriented vertically downward away from the streams and towards the underlying aquifer gerber and howard 1996 however where the streams have eroded through the newmarket till regional gw discharge from aquifers beneath the till can occur gerber and howard 2002 the sand and gravel along the lake iroquois paleo shoreline allow for gw recharge and the development of localized gw flow from the raised shoreline towards the lower relief thinning sediments in the offshore portion of the former lake basin 3 3 3 transition zone connectivity and properties fluvial deposits along streams often determine the connectivity of the transition zone between the gw and sw systems for type i streams within the orm connectivity is generally good because the fluvial deposits of the transition zone and the underlying orm aquifer both have high ks where the orm is overlain by lower k halton till connectivity may decrease locally although there are several areas where larger streams have incised through the halton till into the underlying orm aquifer and result in good connectivity within the till plain the presence of the underlying newmarket till limits the connectivity between streams and the underlying regional aquifers except where the streams fully incise the till localized connectivity leading to hyporheic flow can occur within the till plain where streams are in contact with higher k fluvially deposited materials however their extent differs between type i and ii streams type i streams tend to have wider valleys and floodplains such that fluvial deposits along type i streams are of sufficient extent to be mapped sharpe and barnett 1997 in contrast transition zone connectivity is likely lowest for type ii streams within the till plain because the valleys are narrower and the availability of coarse deposits is limited type i streams in the lake iroquois plain are in larger incised valleys with coarse grained fluvial deposits providing good connectivity and the potential for hyporheic flow within the lake iroquois plain the transition zone connectivity for type ii streams is also likely good because these streams derive some of their sediment from the sand and gravel portion of the former shoreline 3 3 4 groundwater surface water interactions stream type underlying geology and topography control the dominant gw sw flow processes in the watershed fig 20 most stream reaches in the orm are perennial and gaining with many areas of moderate to high gw discharge fluxes gw discharge zones are extensive and fluxes vary only moderately in time hyporheic flow may occur in high k deposits as a result of localized changes in topography e g riffles and debris dams but produces transition zones that are small and shallow hill and lymburner 1998 where type i streams cross the till plain the combination of perennial streamflow and the high k fluvial deposits of the riparian zones overlying the low k till creates conditions conducive to hyporheic flow within the fluvial deposits along stream valleys for example duval and hill 2006 observed hyporheic flow along a short reach of a tributary of west duffins creek where fluvial sand and gravel overlie till they found that a small proportion of streamflow was lost to the riparian zone in all seasons and during storm events however it was the dominant source of water in the riparian zone during low flow conditions because the adjacent till hillslope only contributed water to the riparian zone during the spring type i streams that become more incised as they flow through the till plain may change to gaining streams although floodplain scale hyporheic flow may still occur within the stream valley in contrast gw sw exchanges are expected to be more limited in area and variable in time along type ii streams on the till plain due to the smaller extent of fluvial sediments and the intermittent nature of the streamflow in the area of the lake iroquois plain conditions conducive to losing streams and hyporheic flow exist where type ii streams descend over the sandy shoreline where they can lose sw into shoreline sediments due to high connectivity and steepening shoreline slopes the subsurface hyporheic flow re emerges farther downstream because the subsurface capacity to transmit the flow decreases as topography flattens or the aquifer thins the re emerging hyporheic flow may be supplemented by local gw discharge originating from precipitation recharge within the lake iroquois plain type i streams are too incised i e at a lower elevation to produce hyporheic flow through the lake iroquois shoreline sediments but floodplain scale hyporheic flow likely continues through fluvial sediments a survey of stream baseflow in the duffins creek watershed shows the spatial distribution of incremental changes in baseflow as the net discharge of water per length of stream fig 17 and is generally consistent with the spatial pattern of gw fluxes implied by these conceptualizations increases to stream baseflow are generally highest in the orm and lowest in the till plain with some smaller increases near the lake iroquois shoreline 3 3 5 potential impacts the primary impacts of the geological settings and their associated gw sw flow interactions in this case study are on the quantity and distribution of stream baseflow on the availability of water in the riparian zone and their roles in maintaining sw ecosystems fig 21 recharge storage and discharge of gw within the orm setting sustain stream baseflow and support important stream functions throughout the watershed not only does the discharge provide cool and cold water habitats for aquatic species but also expands suitable aquatic habitat downstream to the till plain that would not otherwise maintain baseflow furthermore type i streams from the orm also supply water to riparian zones in the till plain that would otherwise dry up in summer as occurs in many of the intermittent type ii streams within the till plain and provide the water that enters the fluvial deposits as hyporheic flow the framework supports the development of conceptual models which illustrates that key gw sw flow interactions depend not only on the surficial geology k and topography in each setting but also on their cumulative role across settings the conceptualization could also be extended to consider the biogeochemical and ecological processes resulting from the juxtaposition of geological settings and their potential impacts on watershed issues fig 7 4 discussion one of the main contributions of this framework is that it is both comprehensive and flexible which are not typical features of classification schemes classification schemes tend to be either deductive top down approaches that set a priori the boundaries between classes based on system characteristics or inductive bottom up approaches that establish classes based on direct measurements e g stream flow characteristics olden et al 2012 the type and availability of data determine to a large extent whether an inductive or a deductive approach is suitable often a mixed approach is needed because an incomplete understanding of the gw sw system or insufficient data renders the classification scheme unusable a more flexible framework would be preferred in that instance another limitation of rigorous classification systems is that considerable effort can be made to collect the input required to use the system i e fill in all the boxes yet the data may ultimately be unimportant for the particular gw sw management issue being addressed the presented framework allows the user to focus on the relevant questions and elements required for example characterization of the sw system in the pine river case study did not require the determination of hydrological inputs climate and the physical characteristics for the entire watershed upstream of the site instead direct measurements over the short river reach directly addressed the two key questions at the bottom of fig 2 what are the sw levels and flows and sw quality over time at the site the framework suggests factors to take into account but does not require every factor be fully described and documented only relevant parts of the framework need be used as long as the key questions can be answered furthermore the framework is flexible in that factors processes and impacts can be added removed or investigated in greater detail as required specific step by step guidance on how to use the framework has not been provided only by example in the case studies because each problem and gw sw system is unique the core of the framework lies in the assessment of gw sw processes fig 5 and patterns fig 6 beyond this requirement one can enter the framework at any location and progress through the framework upward and or downward depending on the need in some cases a potential change to a gw sw system is being evaluated e g a proposed dam for a stream discharge of treated sewage to a lake or an invasive plant species is starting to take over a waterbody so one may start at fig 5 and evaluate the relevant gw sw interaction processes and work down to the potential impacts fig 7 however it may also be necessary to go back up the framework to obtain the sw gw and transition zone data figs 2 4 necessary to fully evaluate the processes in cases when one may be concerned about a particular kind of impact one can enter the framework at the bottom fig 7 and work one s way through figs 5 and 6 to identify relevant gw sw processes to evaluate if one is interested in maintaining stream base flow then it would be a sw quantity issue if threats to fish spawning areas are of concern then it would be a transition zone ecosystem problem for gw under the direct influence gudi of sw it would be a gw quality issue once the problem is identified as primarily a water quality water quantity or ecosystem issue and the type of water it affects is also determined sw gw or transition zone the strategy would be to focus on and assess those types of waters and issues in the above framework in each case the framework will 1 guide one to acknowledge and evaluate important processes spatial and temporal variability and controlling factors 2 help identify knowledge gaps and 3 provide a rationale for designing investigations and aid in selecting characterization methods and tools to answer the key questions because the framework presented is process based it can be easily adapted to address all types of sw settings including other types of sw bodies i e ponds wetlands and coastal marine settings by evaluating more than one kind of sw system this framework was able to identify common processes applicable to all sw bodies versus those processes associated only with a particular sw type fig 5 this feature allows for the transferring of scientific understanding of gw sw interactions to evaluate different types of sw and settings for example for marine coastal settings the gw sw flow processes for all settings and lakes would be applicable but it would be necessary to include other processes such as density driven flow likewise flow biochemical and biological processes for all settings are applicable to wetlands and hydraulic exchanges caused by moving sw is likely less important the framework also provides an inclusive structure with respect to potential impacts to our knowledge no other framework or classification scheme has included a link to all three types of impacts i e water quantity water quality and ecosystems for gw sw and the transition zone as part of their evaluations further no other framework or classification scheme has explicitly included the transition zone which is surprizing given the importance of the gw sw interaction processes and the need to understand the transition zone as part of assessing gw sw systems this framework does have some limitations it requires and assumes some basic knowledge of gw sw systems and it also suggests the user consider other factors outside their areas of expertise hydrogeologists are generally not ecologists and vice versa the framework highlights the need to acknowledge and evaluate the importance and potential influence of factors and processes that may be outside the user s area of specialization this framework fills important gaps regarding the evaluation of gw sw systems in a review of the development of gw sw interaction science over the past two decades wondzell 2015 indicated a critical need for more holistic understanding of how gw sw interactions vary among streams types and sizes and with changes in discharge and for testing of broader conceptual models an important benefit of the current framework is its value for conceptualization of gw sw interactions in broader terms and including settings beyond just streams a lack of gw sw interaction data is often the main problem at a study site particularly for larger areas the framework allows users to combine available data with deductions based on commonly available watershed data to identify dominant gw sw interaction processes across larger areas some of the impacts and issues identified in fig 7 require consideration of the cumulative impacts of gw sw interactions over entire watersheds which can be challenging but the framework s strategy of identifying processes fig 5 and scaling up to larger patterns of behavior fig 6 breaks the problem down into more manageable pieces the framework also incorporates a mechanism for identifying potential hot spots and hot moments within watersheds i e critical locations or times of large changes in water or chemical fluxes or loadings which can be essential for understanding the potential role of gw sw interactions within broader management issues at larger scales the framework was also able to incorporate different geological settings on a larger scale for the duffins creek watershed to provide the kind of conceptual model of flow that can be used to support further gw sw investigations regarding other management issues involving water quality and ecosystems likewise the nottawasaga bay case study provides an example where the framework is being used to identify knowledge gaps test hypotheses and select locations sampling times and instrumentation to support ongoing field monitoring of the potential impacts of nutrient discharges the development of comprehensive conceptual site models is imperative to understanding and addressing problems that involve gw sw interactions this framework is a tool to aid conceptual model development for a wide range of conditions 5 conclusions a comprehensive framework for characterizing and evaluating gw sw interactions for streams rivers and lakes was developed it provides a logical and flexible approach to evaluate a wide range of possible factors that influence gw sw interactions and potential impacts they can have on water quantity quality and ecosystems unlike prior classification systems the framework focuses on identifying fundamental and critical gw sw processes and therefore is widely applicable to stream river and lake environments in a variety of different physiographic and geomorphological settings the flexibility of the framework allows for tailoring it to a particular setting location or management issue in this way the framework can be streamlined to address just the main characteristics and dominant processes for the issue of interest a key feature of the framework is that it can be used to build robust conceptual site models help identify knowledge gaps and focus and guide future investigations the three distinctly different case studies illustrate the application and flexibility of the framework the case studies address different sw settings river and lake cover a range of spatial scales local intermediate regional explore different management issues and have different amounts of field data available the pine river case study illustrates the benefit of applying the framework in a data rich study area to consider the gw sw system holistically and ensure all gw sw interaction processes with potential effects on contaminant transport to a river have been considered alternatively the nottawasaga bay and duffins creek case studies apply the framework over larger areas to test hypotheses and develop conceptual models that provide insight into potentially important gw sw interaction processes that guide additional investigations and monitoring overall this framework has proven to be a valuable tool for assessing these gw sw systems and should be particularly useful when evaluating other environments and management issues declaration of interests none declaration acknowledgements we would like to thank s alpay at

6455,developing an understanding of how groundwater gw and surface water sw systems function and interact to impact water quantity water quality and ecosystem health provides a basis for management of water resources environmental protection and land management although knowledge of these complex and dynamic systems has improved in recent decades there is currently no systematic guidance for conceptualizing and evaluating gw sw interactions and identifying their potential impact on management issues for this reason a holistic framework was created to provide a comprehensive and logical approach for identifying understanding and evaluating the key factors and processes controlling gw sw interactions and understanding their relationship to environmental problems the framework identifies fundamental hydrological biogeochemical and biological processes and critical factors to consider when developing robust conceptual models of gw sw systems the framework is comprehensive and can be adapted to different problems using only the aspects necessary to address a specific issue the framework focuses on streams rivers and lakes but can be adapted for use in other gw sw settings such as ponds wetlands and coastal marine environments applicability of the framework is illustrated through evaluation of three gw sw interaction settings in southern ontario canada a groundwater contaminant plume discharging to the pine river discharge of groundwater nutrients to lake huron and a regional scale conceptualization of gw sw flow interactions in the duffins creek watershed the case studies highlight flexibility of the framework to develop conceptual models assess environmental issues identify knowledge gaps and provide a basis for designing site investigations keywords groundwater surface water interaction conceptual models great lakes water quality water quantity ecosystems 1 introduction management of water resources and the environment often requires a multidisciplinary understanding of groundwater surface water gw sw interactions because these interactions form key linkages between terrestrial activities aquatic ecosystems and water resource integrity although the potential for gw sw interactions to impact water quality water quantity and ecosystem health is well recognized winter et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 usepa 2000 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 environment agency 2009 krause et al 2017 it is not always adequately considered in management decisions smith et al 2008 managers decision makers and the scientists who support them often lack the background conceptual understanding tools and strategies to identify and address all the issues affected by gw sw interactions in a comprehensive and co ordinated manner multidisciplinary understanding of gw sw interactions including hyporheic zone processes and hydrologic exchange flows have advanced considerably in the past two decades fleckenstein et al 2010 robertson and wood 2010 krause et al 2011 2014 boano et al 2014 harvey and gooseff 2015 wondzell 2015 peralta maraver et al 2018 however despite the need for an integrated understanding of these processes in environmental management smith et al 2008 krause et al 2011 practical guidance is generally lacking regarding how to conceptualize and evaluate gw sw systems in a manner that holistically integrates knowledge of the ecological biogeochemical and physical processes and their impacts it is often challenging to determine the extent to which gw sw interactions may occur in a particular setting and assess their potential impacts on the sw gw and transition zone between them many factors influence gw sw interactions such as the type of sw body and geomorphological hydrological topographical geological chemical biological ecological and climatological factors that vary both spatially and temporally the most important factors to consider for a given system also depend on the specific management issue in question for example the biogeochemical processes that biodegrade a nitrate gw plume passing through a riverbed before it discharges to a river may be important with respect to the impact on river water quality however those same processes are essentially irrelevant for determining whether or not a sufficient amount of gw discharges to maintain river base flow during droughts due to the increased recognition of the importance of gw sw interactions for environmental management decisions there is a growing need to conceptualize gw sw systems identify the dominant gw sw interaction processes and determine their impacts conceptual site models need to be developed even in the absence of detailed field data to guide the design of studies monitoring efforts and for a variety of different management decisions existing classification schemes that conceptualize gw sw interactions provide valuable insights regarding important factors but are usually designed for relatively specific settings or purposes and are not universally applicable some classifications focus on flow processes and often include the concepts of flow direction at the gw sw interface gaining losing or flow through and gw sw connectivity connected or disconnected e g bailly comte et al 2009 reid et al 2009 ivkovic 2009 in contrast classification schemes for natural attenuation of pollutants consider factors such as sediment organic carbon content permeability and bed thickness smith et al 2009 classification schemes for groundwater dependent ecosystems consider factors such as gw levels redox conditions and ph bertrand et al 2012 gw sw interactions also often need to be conceptualized at different scales woessner 2000 boano et al 2014 conceptualizations of flow interactions have incorporated various scales of topography and geological architecture for example landscape descriptions of hydrogeological settings winter 2001 dahl et al 2007 flow system geometry and aquifer sw connections nield et al 1994 winter 1999 dahl et al 2007 streambed sediment heterogeneity conant 2004 and stream morphology such as bedforms and sediment bars packman and brooks 2001 cardenas and wilson 2006 cardenas 2008 boano et al 2014 however the principal challenge of linking fine scale causal factors with large scale consequences still remains harvey and gooseff 2015 krause et al 2017 despite the seemingly disparate nature of these studies scales and settings it was hypothesized that the observed relationships and behaviors can be distilled to a set of basic and fundamental processes and that a framework focused on these processes without categorizing specific physical settings would have the potential to be applicable to a wide variety of gw sw problems the goal of this study was to develop a framework to guide conceptualization of gw sw interactions in streams rivers and lake environments and that identifies fundamental interaction processes and their potential impacts on science informed water management decisions the intent was to design a simple flexible framework that does not impose a rigorous classification scheme or a strictly deductive or inductive approach such as those described by olden et al 2012 another key objective was to create a framework focused on identifying key gw sw processes patterns and controls so that it can be broadly applicable to a wide range of issues and sw body types this type of framework would be useful to environmental practitioners and scientists who are familiar with parts of gw and sw systems but require a guide to better understand and conceptualize system dynamics to support water management decisions and to recognize knowledge gaps the framework was applied to three gw sw sites in southern ontario canada to test the value and usefulness of the framework 2 framework for gw sw interactions a framework is defined as a conceptual structure of ideas merriam webster 2018 the framework presented herein focuses on system functions and processes associated with streams rivers and lakes and it can readily be adapted to other gw sw interaction settings such as ponds wetlands and coastal marine environments the framework consists of a series of diagrams to help guide the user through a holistic assessment of their gw sw system and develop a conceptual model which can be used to test applicable hypotheses the framework diagrams highlight the important elements of gw sw systems the framework is not a flow chart that must be rigorously followed but rather a guidance tool that can be adapted for specific user needs and gw sw settings the framework diagrams figs 1 7 and the fundamental questions they are designed to address are described in the following sections the framework is intentionally simple and represents considerable synthesis and distilling of information into a series of diagrams that are easy to understand and use four main design criteria were followed during development of the framework 1 combine and simplify concepts and questions into their most fundamental parts whenever possible 2 identify fundamental gw sw processes 3 design a comprehensive framework addressing the most relevant issues and impacts associated with gw sw systems water quality water quantity and ecosystems and 4 present the framework as a series of simple reader friendly diagrams not tables that pose key questions in order to enhance a user s conceptual understanding 2 1 definition of terms prior to discussing the framework it is appropriate to define some fundamental terms sw is defined as the water present on the surface of the earth in streams rivers ponds lakes wetlands estuaries and oceans gw is the water contained in the pore spaces fractures and other openings in subsurface materials below the water table the gw sw interface is the physical boundary between gw and sw this boundary is a surface where the bottom of the sw contacts the top of the subsurface materials the hyporheic zone is the region beneath and adjacent to streams or rivers where sw flows into the subsurface and subsequently discharges back to the streams or rivers white 1993 some definitions of the hyporheic zone may include additional criteria such as water residence time chemical concentrations or distribution of biota environmental agency 2009 smith 2005 white 1993 the transition zone is defined as a three dimensional volume beneath and adjacent to sw bodies where gw sw interactions occur and conditions transition from a gw dominated system to a sw dominated system usepa 2008 conant et al 2016 the transition zone includes the subsurface materials that can modify the flow biogeochemical and ecological conditions of water passing from gw to sw or vice versa for example the sediments adjacent to and beneath streams and lakes often differ from those of the regional gw flow system and should be considered part of the transition zone because they can significantly influence the quantity and quality of gw passing through it even though sw may never flow through these sediments in this regard the transition zone is analogous to and includes the furthest lateral extent of the hyporheic zone and what krause et al 2017 termed as the ecohydrological interface for gw sw systems they define the ecohydrological interface as dynamic transition zones that may develop at ecosystem or subsystem boundaries and control the movement and transformation of organisms water matter and energy between adjacent systems therefore the transition zone as defined in this paper is where gw sw interactions occur and it contains within it the gw sw interface the hyporheic zone and the gw sw ecohydrological interface 2 2 overview diagram the structure outlining how to evaluate a gw sw system fig 1 is divided into three main sections 1 an evaluation of the dynamics of the individual gw and sw systems and their potential to interact at the gw sw interface or in the transition zone between gw and sw 2 an assessment of the different gw sw interaction processes in the transition zone and their resulting spatial patterns and temporal variability and 3 an identification of the potential impacts that gw sw interactions may have on the water quantity water quality and ecosystems associated with the gw sw and transition zone 2 3 evaluating sw systems the evaluation of sw systems fig 2 is designed to answer two key questions 1 what are the sw levels and or flows over time and 2 what is the sw quality over time at the gw sw interface the objective is to determine the dynamics of the sw system where it interfaces with the transition zone sw quantity and quality are a function of the upstream watershed characteristics e g topography geology area soils and land use other factors include climate and hydrological characteristics e g evapotranspiration water balance and runoff flowpaths anthropogenic factors influencing water levels and flows include regulation by dams withdrawals for water supply or irrigation stormwater discharge and agricultural tile drainage changes in geomorphology and channel structures can influence stream water levels whereas lake hydraulic processes e g waves seiches and wind setup and lake geometry e g bathymetry and surface area affect local lake water level fluctuations the characterization of sw needs to consider the scale of the issue appropriately for example understanding local controls on lake water levels may be more relevant than undertaking a full watershed scale characterization if one is only examining issues along a small segment of a shoreline of a large lake sw quality is affected by natural water quality of the watershed runoff point source anthropogenic inputs from stormwater sewage water and tile drains and non point source anthropogenic inputs such as nutrient runoff from agricultural fields once in sw solutes and contaminants are subject to a variety of chemical reactions and biological transformations that can modify water quality as a result of interaction with sediment organic matter and living organisms in streams and rivers short residence times and greater variability in upstream flowpaths and processes can result in more significant spatial and temporal variability in sw quality than in lakes although lakes generally have longer residence times in lake productivity and biological uptake as well as physical processes such as sw currents stratification lake turnover and mixing all contribute to spatial and temporal variability in water quality 2 4 evaluating gw systems gw systems tend to be less temporally variable than sw systems yet they do change over time and vary spatially evaluating a gw system requires consideration of two key questions at a scale relevant to the issues of concern fig 3 1 what is the quantity of gw flowing to the transition zone over time and 2 what is the quality of the gw entering the transition zone the objective is to determine the dynamics of the gw system where it interfaces with the transition zone similar to the sw system evaluation the watershed climate and hydrogeological characteristics within the contributing area determine the flow and quality of gw entering the transition zone aquifer and aquitard characteristics such as geology geometry and hydraulic properties are factors in the gw flow system assessment differences in water levels in aquifers indicate flow directions and storage changes in the gw system natural and anthropogenic sources of recharge e g precipitation and stormwater infiltration ponds and discharge e g seeps springs and gw pumping can alter the water balance and the quantity of water reaching the transition zone the quality of gw entering the transition zone depends on the source of recharge the geochemical evolution of gw along its flowpaths and anthropogenic chemical inputs to the gw system the concentrations of chemicals in gw may be modified by abiotic and biotic reactions including aqueous phase and sediment aqueous reactions e g adsorption desorption precipitation dissolution as they flow through the subsurface 2 5 transition zone connectivity and characteristics the transition zone defined previously refers to the three dimensional volume that delineates the change from a gw system to a sw system the transition zone can vary spatially and temporally and its functional extent may differ depending whether the management issue is related to water quantity quality or ecosystem issues identifying the hydrological connectivity geology and chemical characteristics of the transition zone between sw and gw is essential to determine what gw sw interactions may be important in a specific setting fig 4 shows factors that should be considered to address three key questions related to the transition zone 1 what is the potential for water to flow through the transition zone over time 2 what is the potential for the water chemistry to be modified as it crosses the transition zone over time and 3 what is the potential for the zone to support biological species and communities the hydrological connectivity is determined by the physical extent over which the transition zone directly connects the gw and sw systems and by the physical properties of the zone e g hydraulic conductivity k some streams can be perched above an unsaturated zone and therefore be disconnected from the underlying gw system whereas other streams can be areas of constant groundwater discharge winter et al 1998 the magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradients between gw and sw are fundamental drivers for flow across the transition zone the connectivity can also change over time due to sediment erosion deposition biological activity anthropogenic alteration and changes in permafrost in cold regions resulting in enhanced or reduced connectivity dredging infilling and lining sections of channels with concrete are examples of human activities that modify connectivity natural armoring and precipitation of dissolved constituents in bed materials typically reduce connectivity by occluding pore spaces connectivity is also altered by biological processes such as bioturbation growth of aquatic vegetation colmation clogging of the bed material with fines biofilms and algal growth and local creation of fish redds spawning nests the water chemistry including parameters such as dissolved oxygen content redox conditions and nutrient and contaminant concentrations is directly affected by the chemical composition of the sediments in the transition zone organic matter content of those materials the extent of deposits adjacent to the sw body e g flood plain deposits in the riparian zone biological communities e g biofilms and human activities the factors governing the hydrologic connectivity together with the geological and chemical properties can control the viability of certain biological communities in the transition zone e g the hyporheos benthos mussels and clams algae and aquatic plants 2 6 gw sw interaction processes characterizing the processes associated with gw sw interactions is critical to determining their importance and potential impacts interactions can be divided into three types of processes flow biogeochemical and biological with the most fundamental processes for each type summarized in fig 5 determining how these processes act is needed to answer the key question what are the resulting spatial and temporal patterns of gw sw interactions fig 6 2 6 1 flow processes fig 5 shows flow processes are divided into three types ones that apply to all settings those associated only with stream and rivers and ones that are just associated with lakes numerous flow processes apply to all settings and they include gaining gw discharge into sw losing sw flowing into gw flow through gaining at one side of a sw body and losing on the other side and zero exchange no exchange of water or parallel flow of sw and gw see bear 1979 winter et al 1998 woessner 2000 stream flow and lakes also can be perennial intermittent or ephemeral which has implications for the subsurface flow processes flowpaths and gw sw exchange preferential flow across the transition zone can occur through fractures macropores such as root holes locally high k sediments karst solution features and engineered conduits which can generate high flux springs e g conant 2004 or disappearing streams bank storage is a larger scale flow process where sw flows laterally into the banks of streams and lakes as a result of the rise of sw levels above the adjacent water table e g when a flood pulse passes through an area water stored in the banks may discharge back into the sw when sw levels drop and gradients reverse where bedload transport is active rivers lakes bed turnover and entrainment can occur as migrating sediment e g bedforms entrap sw in the intra particle spaces when they are emplaced and then entrapped sw can be released as the beds migrate or are eroded packman and brooks 2001 santos et al 2012 whenever water moves through streambed or lakebed materials mixing processes within the transition zone such as mechanical dispersion and back diffusion from dead end pores can affect the function of the transition zone additionally constructed facilities such as infiltration galleries or pumping gw wells near sw bodies can induce infiltration of sw to gw flow processes that are just associated with streams and rivers are hyporheic zone flow and groundwater ridging hyporheic flow occurs where moving sw and changes in streambed geomorphology and topography in flowing streams cause sw to flow into the streambed and banks flow parallel to the stream and return back into the sw downstream white 1993 hyporheic zones can be dynamic and complex biogeochemical zones that have unique biota and flow patterns usepa 2008 environment agency 2009 hyporheic flow is not the same as bank storage because it is driven by differences in streambed geomorphology and topography whereas bank storage is driven by transient changes in sw level gw ridging occurs when precipitation infiltrates bank deposits having a thick capillary fringe and the added water causes the water in the capillary fringe to go from negative pressure to positive pressure and results in a disproportionate rise in the gw table adjacent to the sw body gillham 1984 zang et al 2018 causing a transient increase in gw flow to sw flow processes associated with lakes include hydrological exchanges driven by waves seiches tides lake bed currents and lake turnover fig 5 landward of the shoreline wave driven exchanges cause sw to infiltrate into unsaturated permeable lakeshore sediments heiss et al 2015 robinson et al 2018 wave driven exchange is also induced by wave setup onshore hydraulic gradients caused by breaking waves which can cause sw to circulate through nearshore saturated sediments to a depth of centimeters up to 10 m li and barry 2000 lee et al 2014 malott et al 2016 seiches are standing wave oscillations caused by wind setup and barometric pressure changes across an enclosed water body as salek and schwab 2004 seiches cause lake level fluctuations centimeters to meters in height and temporary reversals in local hydraulic gradients that drive water into or out of nearshore and lakebed sediments taniguchi and fukuo 1996 the process is similar to bank storage in streams in thermally stratified lakes wind setup across the lake can also cause internal seiches that are characterized by vertical oscillations in the thermocline the changing thermal density gradients across the lake bed sediments as the thermocline oscillates can drive water exchange chowdhury et al 2016 cossu et al 2017 in very large lakes gravitational forces of the moon and sun can induce small tidal oscillations in sw levels trebitz 2006 that drive water exchange back and forth across the lakebed sediments current bedform exchange occurs when sw currents flow over small scale bedforms causing sw to circulate through lakebed sediments and return to the sw body it is similar to hyporheic zone flow in streams santos et al 2012 lake turnover is a density driven process when an entire lake water column mixes as a result of the loss of thermal stratification due to seasonal heating or cooling density variations can cause considerable exchange across the gw sw interface golosov and ignatieva 1999 2 6 2 biogeochemical processes biogeochemical processes shown in fig 5 include a wide range of biotic and abiotic reaction types that can modify the water quality in the transition zone the transition zone is often a zone of high reactivity due to the mixing of different quality waters water passing through sediments of differing chemical compositions e g mcclain et al 2003 harvey et al 2013 lee et al 2014 and unique microbial communities febria et al 2010 for example streambeds and lakebed sediments typically contain organic matter decay of organic matter contributes to reducing conditions and the resulting strong chemical gradients e g redox and ph in the transition zone act as drivers for the transformation biodegradation and attenuation of chemical constituents in some cases the hyporheic zone can be more oxic than the discharging groundwater and for example low ph gw from acid mine drainage contacting a more oxic hyporheic zone can result in metal precipitation in streambed sediments before the gw reaches the sw benner et al 1995 other processes that occur when different quality waters come in contact with each other or with different sediments include acid and base reactions that can cause dissolution and precipitation of minerals e g caco3 metal complexation with dissolved organic carbon or ligands which can change metal mobility ion exchange e g dissolved ca2 and mg2 exchanging for na adsorption desorption e g po4 p sorption to metal oxide minerals and diffusion driven by concentration gradients some contaminants in water e g petroleum products chlorinated solvents polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are hydrophobic and preferentially partition onto the sediments particularly organic materials and clays thereby accumulating in the organic rich deposits of the transition zone e g conant et al 2004 gases such as methane hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide can also be created by biologically mediated reactions in transition zones and released to surface water volatile contaminants like petroleum products and chlorinated solvents in the water can also partition into gas bubbles that move up through sediments ebulliate and are then released to sw and into the atmosphere e g vroblesky and lorah 1991 2 6 3 biological processes transpiration colmation bioturbation biological uptake and release e g algal blooms due to eutrophication phytoremediation zebra mussels and biomodification of sw flow e g water hyacinths beaver dams are examples of biological processes that are not microbiological processes that directly influence flow and biogeochemistry in the transition zone fig 5 e g brunke 1999 lewandowski et al 2007 hölker et al 2015 other biological processes that influence biotic communities more directly are grouped under the category of ecological processes numerous factors such as habitat disturbance competition predation and decomposition can influence ecological habitat distributions population dynamics as well as cycling of energy carbon and nutrients in the sw gw and transition zone e g vervier et al 1993 boulton et al 2010 krause et al 2011 ecological processes can be an important link between gw sw interaction processes gw sw interaction patterns and specific management issues particularly those involving ecosystems and biologic controls on water quantity and quality and vice versa finally anthropogenic perturbations of habitats species or biogeochemical cycling e g forest harvesting introduction of invasive species addition of nutrients that cause algal blooms and acid mine drainage also have consequences for biological processes and gw sw interactions e g brunke and gonser 1997 2 7 resulting gw sw patterns the intensity distribution and duration of the flow biogeochemical and biological processes in the transition zone fig 5 determine the resulting spatial distributions and temporal variability of water flows water quality and biological patterns observed at the gw sw interface fig 6 characterizing e g mapping these patterns can be very valuable and can provide insight into dominant processes however sufficient data are rarely available to fully define gw sw interactions therefore a combination of observed patterns fig 6 and known or inferred processes fig 5 form the basis for assessing and predicting overall impacts fig 7 2 7 1 flow patterns characterization of the flux and direction of flow between gw and sw fig 6 is critical to assessing gw sw interaction processes and impacts the scale of the assessment must be relevant to the physical setting the processes and the management issue at hand for example it is reasonable to quantify gw contributions to stream flow at the sub watershed and watershed scales for water supply evaluations whereas evaluating a gw contaminant plume discharging to a stream may require characterization at the local reach or sub meter scales see case studies although important by itself for determining the transport of water and dissolved constituents the subsurface extent and exact flowpaths of gw sw exchange and mixing of gw and sw in the transition zone can also influence patterns of biogeochemical and biological processes at the gw sw interface 2 7 2 biogeochemical patterns biogeochemical processes in the transition zone can significantly modify water quality but not necessarily uniformly in space or time e g hendricks and white 1991 1995 conant et al 2004 biogeochemical activity can be high locally hot spots or during short time periods hot moments mcclain et al 2003 vidon et al 2010 robinson et al 2016 krause et al 2017 although some biogeochemical processes occur on a small scale within bed deposits or in the riparian zone e g in a thin layer of organic rich sediment they may nonetheless disproportionately influence chemical fluxes at a larger scale mcclain et al 2003 patterns of microbiological communities or biologically important chemical species along flowpaths and in sediment profiles e g nutrients toxins acidity and oxygen can provide insight into the nature and progression of biogeochemical reactions in fig 5 and gw sw interaction processes e g storey et al 2004 2 7 3 biological patterns biological patterns relevant to gw sw interactions can be diverse and include variables such as habitat or population distributions species richness energy cycling or biogeochemical cycling and these patterns can be characterized by measuring habitat fragmentation diversity and biotic indexes and nutrient or chemical distributions these patterns can provide some insight into biological biogeochemical and flow processes of gw sw interactions and vice versa however the biological patterns may also be of interest because they may relate closely to relevant management issues and impacts for example the delineation of aquatic and benthic species distributions and habitats are relevant to fish habitat compensation issues whilst simultaneously providing insight into gw sw interaction processes necessary to support such habitats 2 8 impacts potential impacts of gw sw interaction processes for stream river and lake environments are detailed in fig 7 they are divided by water type sw gw or the transition zone and by the main issues of water quantity water quality and ecosystems the list is succinct but not exhaustive and provides examples of common issues for different water types assessing which gw sw interactions are most important depends on the issue and the particular receptor s of concern e g receiving water bodies or ecological communities watershed scale issues are also listed e g urban and land use planning water policy development environmental impacts assessments and best management practices in fig 7 to indicate that gw sw interactions may also need to be considered cumulatively for broader issues extending beyond riparian and littoral zones 3 case studies 3 1 the pine river case study transition zone modification of water quality the pine river study is the first of three case study sites fig 8 selected to demonstrate the applicability of the framework to different management issues and different hydrological settings in southern ontario the pine river case study is a well characterized example of gw contamination flowing into a river conant 2001 conant 2004 conant et al 2004 abe et al 2009 roy and bickerton 2012 this situation occurs in many urban settings ellis and rivett 2007 rivett et al 2011 roy and bickerton 2012 the primary concern is the potential impact on sw quality and aquatic life this case study highlights the applicability of the framework to assess a complex set of gw sw processes and build a robust conceptual model the main purpose of previous investigations was to understand the processes controlling the transport and fate of a tetrachloroethylene pce plume as it migrated from the gw through the transition zone and into a 60 m reach of the pine river located in angus ontario fig 9 findings of the previous investigations have been put into the framework structure to illustrate how impacts can be assessed 3 1 1 surface water system the pine river is a perennial unregulated river fed primarily by gw neff et al 2005 with a mean monthly discharge of 2 29 m3 s conant 2001 the river was typically 0 5 m deep and 14 m wide in the summer but the stage increased by as much as 2 m during the spring melt the evaluation of sw was straightforward because the study focused on observing existing conditions for a short section of river it was not necessary to understand all the upstream factors responsible for the changes in river stage fig 2 instead it was sufficient to monitor the actual river stage perform stream flow gauging and develop a rating curve to quantify river flow at the study reach river stage and flow measurements were used for quantifying vertical flow direction across the riverbed and dilution of gw discharge respectively the sw quality was monitored to determine the background river water quality that would be either receiving the discharging gw plume or infiltrating the riverbed as hyporheic flow conant 2001 showed that sw entering the reach had no pce monthly sampling indicated oxygenated sw with low and relatively constant concentrations of nitrate and chloride moee 1996 3 1 2 groundwater system the gw system characterization focused primarily on determining gw quality characterizing the size shape and concentration of the pce plume in the fine sand confined aquifer was critical for determining the contamination entering the transition zone so that changes occurring within the zone could be determined the pce plume was about 60 m wide and 4 m thick with peak pce concentrations above 10 000 μg l conant 2001 conant et al 2004 the concentrations were higher than the us and ontario drinking water quality standards and the usepa ambient water quality criteria of 840 μg l for chronic exposure for freshwater aquatic life usepa 1986 the pce plume reaching the transition zone figs 9 and 10 contained trace to no pce degradation products natural redox conditions in the confined aquifer were essentially anaerobic but not nitrate reducing the fine sands of the confined aquifer contained little organic material fraction of organic content foc 0 02 0 03 such that sorption and retardation of pce in the aquifer was minimal as was the potential for biodegradation conant 2001 hunkeler et al 2004 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradients darcy s law and gw contaminant concentrations were used to quantify flows and contaminant mass fluxes along the flowpath within the confined aquifer traveling toward the transition zone they were also used for in stream dilution calculations 3 1 3 transition zone connectivity and properties semi confining fluvial deposits at the interface between the river and confined aquifer controlled the nature and distribution of connectivity and gw sw interaction processes the gw plume discharged from the sand aquifer through the semi confining deposits of interbedded silts peats and clays and sand layers fig 9 the discharge through the semi confining deposits varied spatially from essentially zero flow to high flux preferential pathways and flow zones over 446 l m2d higher flux was evident where the river had eroded through the semi confining deposits and replaced them with sand and gravel these served as high k geological windows through the semi confining deposits fig 10 the material properties of the semi confining deposits also had the potential to modify the water chemistry at the interface over time the deposits had very high fraction of organic carbon foc contents mean value of 4 9 conant et al 2004 recent fluvial riverbed deposits also had some lenses of high organic material the organic deposits resulted in reducing conditions including methanogenesis and the potential to both adsorb and anaerobically biodegrade pce 3 1 4 groundwater surface water interactions and processes at this site the most important gw sw processes in the framework which affected the plume were the flow and biogeochemical processes fig 11 overall the river was gaining gw with distinct areas of preferential discharge conant 2004 some small areas of the riverbed were losing e g at the upstream end of a riffle zero exchange where low k clays were present or hyporheic flow zones sampling and analysis of porewater in the transition zone revealed a wide range of redox conditions from nitrate reducing to methanogenic and extensive degradation of pce to trichloroethylene tce cis 1 2 dichloroethylene cis 1 2 dce vinyl chloride and other compounds in a relatively thin zone of active degradation fig 10 sediment sample analyses indicated significant amounts up to 81 mg kg which are higher than remediation standards of sorbed pce tce and cis 1 2 dce in the high foc deposits the contaminants also had diffused into some of these lower k deposits over time and become concentrated there processes present but of minor importance at the site included bed turnover of sediments aqueous gas phase partitioning in the sediments and colmation fig 11 mapping of riverbed porewater concentrations indicated that the size concentration and composition of the pce plume changed as it passed through the transition zone the influence of gw sw interactions on the plume fig 10 produced two main patterns 1 preferential flow through sand in the semi confining bed allowed high concentrations of pce to discharge into the river without being transformed and 2 low to moderate flow through low k organic rich highly reducing semi confining deposits resulted in biodegradation of pce and sorption of the contaminants the area of the plume in the riverbed was about twice as large as its cross sectional area in the aquifer the concentrations patterns in the riverbed did not match those in the aquifer where the gw plume consisted entirely of pce whereas large areas of the riverbed and transition zone the plume consisted entirely of degradation products conant et al 2004 although pce was extensively biodegraded mass balance calculations for the overall plume indicated very little of the total mass of the plume had been converted to non toxic daughter products e g ethane ethene or co2 3 1 5 potential impacts the primary impact of the pce gw plume in this case study was that it contaminated the porewater and sediments in the transition zone and adversely exposed the associated ecology whereas the impact on sw was minimal fig 12 porewater and sediment samples from the transition zone showed that although there was biodegradation of the pce high concentrations of contaminants persisted in the transition zone because the plume did not undergo appreciable dilution by hyporheic mixing moreover contaminants accumulated on the high foc sediments in many instances the hyporheic benthic and other aquatic life in the transition zone were exposed to concentrations above chronic freshwater aquatic life standards because fish tend to spawn in gw discharge zones it meant eggs may have been preferentially laid where the pce plume was discharging overall the sw quality was not appreciably affected because discharging contaminants were significantly diluted by upstream sw flow very low concentrations of pce were only detected in sw near high gw discharge zones in the riverbed and no pce degradation products were detectable in sw despite high concentrations in the transition zone monitoring within the transition zone was essential because neither the sw nor the gw plume indicated the presence of biodegradation products the gw sw framework supports the development of a robust conceptual model that successfully related the relevant processes and key factors to impacts caused by the pce plume the framework highlights the significance of the transition zone connectivity in this complex scenario where multiple gw sw interactions processes were important the conceptualization findings and approach are transferable to other sites and highlight the importance of small scale variability in the transition zone on water flow and quality although most sites will likely not be as well characterized as this one recognizing the role of the transition zone on gw sw interaction patterns and their potential impacts is possible at other sites based on understanding the geological setting and dominant processes 3 2 nottawasaga bay case study nutrient discharge to a large lake the potential impacts of gw sw interactions for a particular management issue often need to be determined in the absence of detailed field data this case study in eastern nottawasaga bay lake huron fig 8 illustrates the value of applying the framework to form a conceptual model to guide hypothesis development and field monitoring approaches the study focuses on gw contributions of phosphorus and nitrogen to nearshore lake water the study is of intermediate scale focusing on a 15 km segment of sand gravel shoreline with sand gravel shorelines found along about 20 6150 km of the laurentian great lakes shoreline this represents a common physiographic setting ec and usepa 2009 although offshore gw discharge from deeper confining aquifer units can be important in some lake settings e g beversdorf et al 2007 this case study focuses on evaluating shallow nearshore gw discharge within 100 m of the shoreline 3 2 1 surface water system the water level in nottawasaga bay fluctuates seasonally over intra annual cycles lenters 2001 and in response to wind waves and seiches sw currents drive strong offshore and alongshore sw mixing in the bay while most of the shoreline is directly exposed to waves and currents natural embayments and engineered groynes create localized sheltered environments with smaller waves weaker currents and less water exchange with open water these differences in conditions may affect the intensity of gw sw interactions along the shoreline the nearshore sw is generally more oxic basic ph 8 8 3 and has higher organic matter content compared to gw in the surficial aquifer ph 6 9 8 rezanezhad et al 2014 sources of nutrients to the bay include the nottawasaga river streams surface runoff and stormwater outfalls the relative contribution of gw in delivering nutrients to the bay is unknown nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the nearshore sw generally range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l n and 3 2 to 35 µg l p respectively annually rezanezhad et al 2014 3 2 2 groundwater system while the regional hydrogeology in the study area is complex a surficial aquifer is present across most of the lowlands coastal area and outcrops along the shoreline as sand gravel beaches mndm 2016 a 2 km wide unconfined high transmissivity sand gravel tunnel valley aquifer also intersects the shoreline in the study area fig 13 piezometric mapping indicates that gw flow is towards the lake in the surficial and tunnel valley aquifers and therefore these aquifers contribute to nearshore gw discharge golder associates ltd 2013 the main sources of nitrogen nitrate ammonium and phosphorus phosphate to the surficial and tunnel valley aquifers are septic systems and land application of manure fertilizer and biosolids golder associates ltd 2013 nitrate and phosphate levels are elevated in the aquifers with concentrations up to 6 mg l n and 240 µg l p respectively observed in monitoring wells within 100 m of the shoreline these concentrations are over twice the values in the canadian water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life which are 2 95 mg l n and 35 to 100 µg l p ccme 2004 while the shallow gw is generally oxic and becomes more reducing with depth the gw chemistry is highly variable across the study area because nitrate is relatively conservative in oxic gw and phosphate is often mobile in calcareous sandy sediments robertson 2008 both nitrate and phosphorus are expected to reach the gw sw transition zone at concentrations exceeding the canadian water quality guidelines 3 2 3 transition zone connectivity and properties the transition zone between the gw and the lake in the nearshore zone is comprised of calcareous sand gravel beach deposits but differences in deposits along the shoreline result in some spatial variability in fluxes and in the potential to modify the water chemistry within the transition zone in exposed shoreline areas high energy wave action and currents re work nearshore littoral sediments e g by erosion suspension deposition resulting in high k sands and gravels at the interface with low organic matter content in sheltered shoreline areas e g groynes and embayments finer deposits e g silt can accumulate within the sand and gravel deposits leading to lower k sediment that may locally reduce the flux of water across the transition zone because the sand gravel deposits along the exposed shoreline typically have low organic matter content the geochemical conditions within the transition zone are expected to be less reducing than in the lower k sediment found in sheltered shoreline areas which have comparatively higher organic matter content 3 2 4 groundwater surface water interactions and processes on a regional scale the nearshore area is primarily a gw discharge zone with evidence of large scale geologically controlled preferential flow a radon 222 222rn survey conducted along the study shoreline indicated higher amounts of gw in the nearshore sw where the unconfined tunnel valley aquifer intersects the shoreline fig 13 ji et al 2017 this suggests that the regional geology plays an important role in controlling alongshore variability in gw discharge from applying the framework and based on field investigations in similar nearshore environments e g lee et al 2014 malott et al 2017 it can be hypothesized that fluctuations in sw levels caused by waves and seiches are the main drivers for gw sw exchange across the interface in the nearshore zone fig 14 the exchange is highest close to the shoreline i e within 10 m fig 14 dynamic sw level fluctuations near the shoreline are expected to set up a transient transition zone that also varies in size in the alongshore direction based on the intensity of sw level fluctuations i e sheltered vs exposed shoreline gw discharge flux i e beach sediments connected to tunnel valley or surficial aquifer beach morphology and k li and barry 2000 malott et al 2017 it is possible that some gw may flow beneath the transition zone near the shoreline and discharge further offshore but still within the nearshore zone fig 14 malott et al 2016 it is hypothesized that this gw may pass through a thin transition zone dominated by current bedform exchange and lakebed turnover and entrainment santos et al 2012 the transition zone has the potential to be an important zone of mixing and biogeochemical reactions redox acid base precipitation and sorption which may result in changes in water quality including modifying the flux of gw derived nutrients to the lake malott et al 2016 rakhimbekova et al 2018 because there can be high dissolved oxygen or high organic matter content in lake water relative to gw either net oxidizing or net reducing conditions may exist in the transition zone depending on availability and quality of organic matter in the exchanging sw which can vary with time beck et al 2017 where conditions in the transition zone are net reducing gw derived nitrate may be denitrified thereby decreasing the nitrate loading to the sw where conditions are net oxidizing phosphate transport may be retarded by adsorption onto iron and manganese hydr oxides that can precipitate along redox boundaries in the transition zone charette and sholkovitz 2002 lee et al 2014 the processes occurring in the transition zone may also differ at sheltered compared to exposed shoreline locations at sheltered areas the higher availability of organic matter within the transition zone and longer residence times due to the lower k deposits may promote greater denitrification by being more reducing in addition hydr oxide minerals may not form and so gw derived phosphate may be more mobile and likely to discharge to the sw in exposed locations gw that mixes within the transition zone near the shoreline may discharge to the sw with limited to no attenuation of nitrate phosphate may be attenuated if hydr oxide minerals form along redox boundaries set up where gw and sw mix due to the seasonal variations in the sw derived organic matter content as well as temporal variations in sw level fluctuations e g varying wave conditions and water exchange within the transition zone the transition zone and associated geochemical gradients will shift over time rakhimbekova et al 2018 this may lead to periods of higher or lower nutrient flux to the sw as changing redox conditions in the transition zone modify the extent of denitrification or cause desorption and release of phosphate from sediments e g beck et al 2007 the conceptual model formed from applying the framework indicates that complex time varying and spatially variable flow and reaction processes fig 15 may occur in the gw sw transition zone these processes ultimately control the flux of gw derived nutrients to the nearshore sw field approaches designed to evaluate gw derived nutrient loading to nearshore waters need to consider processes in the transition zone rather than only measuring nutrient concentrations in landward monitoring wells as is commonly the practice when choosing investigation sites and analyzing field data it is also important to consider the settings along the shoreline e g sheltered versus exposed and tunnel valley versus shallow aquifers the temporal dynamics of the gw sw flow interactions and the extent of possible biogeochemical transformations in the transition zone 3 2 5 impacts the main potential impacts of the gw sw interactions in this case study concern the water quality nutrient concentrations in the transition zone and in the sw close to the lakebed fig 16 it is possible discharge of nutrient rich gw may promote localized macrophyte and algal growth on lakebed sediments roy et al 2009 naranjo et al 2019 phosphate and nitrate concentrations in the transition zone and water discharging across the lakebed are not expected to be toxic to aquatic life because exchange with sw dilutes gw concentrations in the transition zone although gw discharge has the potential to degrade the sw quality and aquatic ecosystems in nottawasaga bay including promoting eutrophication and algal blooms the relative importance of nutrient loading from gw discharge needs to be evaluated relative to the loading from sw tributaries unfortunately tributary loadings and sw mixing processes in the lake are currently not well constrained although gw discharge may be higher in shoreline areas where tunnel valley aquifers intersect the shoreline this does not necessarily translate to higher nutrient loading to the lake rather both the gw nutrient fluxes and the geochemical processes in the gw sw transition zone need to be taken into account to properly identify settings with high gw derived nutrient loading to the lake this case study illustrates the complexity of measuring and quantifying gw derived nutrient discharge to large lakes and the value of conceptualization for planning field investigations loading estimates based on concentrations measured in landward gw monitoring wells will likely provide maximum nutrient loading rates because they fail to take into account nutrient transformations in the transition zone nutrient loading that occurs in sheltered shoreline areas will differ compared to exposed areas and the design of field investigations should consider this difference furthermore when assessing sw concentrations there may be less dilution of gw derived nutrients in the sw column in sheltered areas due to reduced currents and waves therefore for a given gw nutrient loading rate the impact on the nearshore sw ecosystem may be greater in these areas 3 3 duffins creek case study regional scale conceptualization this case study uses the framework to develop a regional scale conceptual understanding of gw sw flow interactions in the duffins creek watershed fig 9 because watersheds often include several different physiographic or geological settings conceptualization of gw sw interactions may need to not only assess the differences between settings but also consider their cumulative influence at downstream locations the duffins creek watershed provides a pertinent example because it straddles three geological settings they include the hummocky uplands of the oak ridges moraine orm including where it is overlain by halton till an intermediate till plain mostly newmarket till and the former glacial lake iroquois shoreline and lake plain in the downstream portion of the watershed figs 17 and 18 the duffins creek watershed 283 km2 is well characterized e g sibul et al 1977 trca 2002 and has undergone extensive field studies in several disciplines sw models aquafor beech limited 2002 gw models gerber and howard 2000 2002 integrated gw sw models li et al 2008 and sw quality models booty et al 2005 have been developed for the watershed there have been a few local scale gw sw interaction investigations hill and lymburner 1998 duval and hill 2006 2007 hill and duval 2009 as well as other related types of surveys of the watershed e g water quality bowen and hinton 1998 stream baseflow hinton 1995 and fish and benthic communities trca 2004 wallace et al 2013 this case study compares gw sw interactions and their impacts for two types of streams that flow through the different geological settings type i streams with their headwaters in the orm and type ii streams with their headwaters in the till plain fig 17 3 3 1 surface water system stream flow hydrographs constructed from water survey of canada wsc gauging station data show streams respond differently depending on the geological settings streams with headwaters in the orm are perennial with sustained baseflow and respond to snowmelt and most rainfall events e g station 02hc041 in fig 19 a these upstream contributions to flow sustain type i streams downstream through the till and lake iroquois plains e g station 02hc019 in fig 19b in contrast most streams with headwaters in the till plain are intermittent within the till plain and typically have flashy flows dominated by spring snowmelt and a few large rainfall events e g station 02hc044 in fig 19a additional baseflow contributions within the lake iroquois plain ensure that both types of streams are perennial within the former lake plain although type i streams e g station 02hc019 have higher baseflow than type ii streams e g station 02hc114 fig 19b 3 3 2 groundwater system in the area of the orm high k sediments result in high gw recharge and high gw flow toward the transition zones of streams the southward pinching out of orm sediments and the decrease in slope from the orm to the till plain causes most gw to discharge to streams within or near the edge of the orm hinton 1995 gerber and howard 2002 fig 18 large gw storage and relatively small seasonal gw level fluctuations also maintain consistent gw discharge to streams in the orm in contrast the low k newmarket till aquitard in the till plain limits both gw recharge and gw flow to the transition zone of streams furthermore hydraulic gradients in the newmarket till are primarily oriented vertically downward away from the streams and towards the underlying aquifer gerber and howard 1996 however where the streams have eroded through the newmarket till regional gw discharge from aquifers beneath the till can occur gerber and howard 2002 the sand and gravel along the lake iroquois paleo shoreline allow for gw recharge and the development of localized gw flow from the raised shoreline towards the lower relief thinning sediments in the offshore portion of the former lake basin 3 3 3 transition zone connectivity and properties fluvial deposits along streams often determine the connectivity of the transition zone between the gw and sw systems for type i streams within the orm connectivity is generally good because the fluvial deposits of the transition zone and the underlying orm aquifer both have high ks where the orm is overlain by lower k halton till connectivity may decrease locally although there are several areas where larger streams have incised through the halton till into the underlying orm aquifer and result in good connectivity within the till plain the presence of the underlying newmarket till limits the connectivity between streams and the underlying regional aquifers except where the streams fully incise the till localized connectivity leading to hyporheic flow can occur within the till plain where streams are in contact with higher k fluvially deposited materials however their extent differs between type i and ii streams type i streams tend to have wider valleys and floodplains such that fluvial deposits along type i streams are of sufficient extent to be mapped sharpe and barnett 1997 in contrast transition zone connectivity is likely lowest for type ii streams within the till plain because the valleys are narrower and the availability of coarse deposits is limited type i streams in the lake iroquois plain are in larger incised valleys with coarse grained fluvial deposits providing good connectivity and the potential for hyporheic flow within the lake iroquois plain the transition zone connectivity for type ii streams is also likely good because these streams derive some of their sediment from the sand and gravel portion of the former shoreline 3 3 4 groundwater surface water interactions stream type underlying geology and topography control the dominant gw sw flow processes in the watershed fig 20 most stream reaches in the orm are perennial and gaining with many areas of moderate to high gw discharge fluxes gw discharge zones are extensive and fluxes vary only moderately in time hyporheic flow may occur in high k deposits as a result of localized changes in topography e g riffles and debris dams but produces transition zones that are small and shallow hill and lymburner 1998 where type i streams cross the till plain the combination of perennial streamflow and the high k fluvial deposits of the riparian zones overlying the low k till creates conditions conducive to hyporheic flow within the fluvial deposits along stream valleys for example duval and hill 2006 observed hyporheic flow along a short reach of a tributary of west duffins creek where fluvial sand and gravel overlie till they found that a small proportion of streamflow was lost to the riparian zone in all seasons and during storm events however it was the dominant source of water in the riparian zone during low flow conditions because the adjacent till hillslope only contributed water to the riparian zone during the spring type i streams that become more incised as they flow through the till plain may change to gaining streams although floodplain scale hyporheic flow may still occur within the stream valley in contrast gw sw exchanges are expected to be more limited in area and variable in time along type ii streams on the till plain due to the smaller extent of fluvial sediments and the intermittent nature of the streamflow in the area of the lake iroquois plain conditions conducive to losing streams and hyporheic flow exist where type ii streams descend over the sandy shoreline where they can lose sw into shoreline sediments due to high connectivity and steepening shoreline slopes the subsurface hyporheic flow re emerges farther downstream because the subsurface capacity to transmit the flow decreases as topography flattens or the aquifer thins the re emerging hyporheic flow may be supplemented by local gw discharge originating from precipitation recharge within the lake iroquois plain type i streams are too incised i e at a lower elevation to produce hyporheic flow through the lake iroquois shoreline sediments but floodplain scale hyporheic flow likely continues through fluvial sediments a survey of stream baseflow in the duffins creek watershed shows the spatial distribution of incremental changes in baseflow as the net discharge of water per length of stream fig 17 and is generally consistent with the spatial pattern of gw fluxes implied by these conceptualizations increases to stream baseflow are generally highest in the orm and lowest in the till plain with some smaller increases near the lake iroquois shoreline 3 3 5 potential impacts the primary impacts of the geological settings and their associated gw sw flow interactions in this case study are on the quantity and distribution of stream baseflow on the availability of water in the riparian zone and their roles in maintaining sw ecosystems fig 21 recharge storage and discharge of gw within the orm setting sustain stream baseflow and support important stream functions throughout the watershed not only does the discharge provide cool and cold water habitats for aquatic species but also expands suitable aquatic habitat downstream to the till plain that would not otherwise maintain baseflow furthermore type i streams from the orm also supply water to riparian zones in the till plain that would otherwise dry up in summer as occurs in many of the intermittent type ii streams within the till plain and provide the water that enters the fluvial deposits as hyporheic flow the framework supports the development of conceptual models which illustrates that key gw sw flow interactions depend not only on the surficial geology k and topography in each setting but also on their cumulative role across settings the conceptualization could also be extended to consider the biogeochemical and ecological processes resulting from the juxtaposition of geological settings and their potential impacts on watershed issues fig 7 4 discussion one of the main contributions of this framework is that it is both comprehensive and flexible which are not typical features of classification schemes classification schemes tend to be either deductive top down approaches that set a priori the boundaries between classes based on system characteristics or inductive bottom up approaches that establish classes based on direct measurements e g stream flow characteristics olden et al 2012 the type and availability of data determine to a large extent whether an inductive or a deductive approach is suitable often a mixed approach is needed because an incomplete understanding of the gw sw system or insufficient data renders the classification scheme unusable a more flexible framework would be preferred in that instance another limitation of rigorous classification systems is that considerable effort can be made to collect the input required to use the system i e fill in all the boxes yet the data may ultimately be unimportant for the particular gw sw management issue being addressed the presented framework allows the user to focus on the relevant questions and elements required for example characterization of the sw system in the pine river case study did not require the determination of hydrological inputs climate and the physical characteristics for the entire watershed upstream of the site instead direct measurements over the short river reach directly addressed the two key questions at the bottom of fig 2 what are the sw levels and flows and sw quality over time at the site the framework suggests factors to take into account but does not require every factor be fully described and documented only relevant parts of the framework need be used as long as the key questions can be answered furthermore the framework is flexible in that factors processes and impacts can be added removed or investigated in greater detail as required specific step by step guidance on how to use the framework has not been provided only by example in the case studies because each problem and gw sw system is unique the core of the framework lies in the assessment of gw sw processes fig 5 and patterns fig 6 beyond this requirement one can enter the framework at any location and progress through the framework upward and or downward depending on the need in some cases a potential change to a gw sw system is being evaluated e g a proposed dam for a stream discharge of treated sewage to a lake or an invasive plant species is starting to take over a waterbody so one may start at fig 5 and evaluate the relevant gw sw interaction processes and work down to the potential impacts fig 7 however it may also be necessary to go back up the framework to obtain the sw gw and transition zone data figs 2 4 necessary to fully evaluate the processes in cases when one may be concerned about a particular kind of impact one can enter the framework at the bottom fig 7 and work one s way through figs 5 and 6 to identify relevant gw sw processes to evaluate if one is interested in maintaining stream base flow then it would be a sw quantity issue if threats to fish spawning areas are of concern then it would be a transition zone ecosystem problem for gw under the direct influence gudi of sw it would be a gw quality issue once the problem is identified as primarily a water quality water quantity or ecosystem issue and the type of water it affects is also determined sw gw or transition zone the strategy would be to focus on and assess those types of waters and issues in the above framework in each case the framework will 1 guide one to acknowledge and evaluate important processes spatial and temporal variability and controlling factors 2 help identify knowledge gaps and 3 provide a rationale for designing investigations and aid in selecting characterization methods and tools to answer the key questions because the framework presented is process based it can be easily adapted to address all types of sw settings including other types of sw bodies i e ponds wetlands and coastal marine settings by evaluating more than one kind of sw system this framework was able to identify common processes applicable to all sw bodies versus those processes associated only with a particular sw type fig 5 this feature allows for the transferring of scientific understanding of gw sw interactions to evaluate different types of sw and settings for example for marine coastal settings the gw sw flow processes for all settings and lakes would be applicable but it would be necessary to include other processes such as density driven flow likewise flow biochemical and biological processes for all settings are applicable to wetlands and hydraulic exchanges caused by moving sw is likely less important the framework also provides an inclusive structure with respect to potential impacts to our knowledge no other framework or classification scheme has included a link to all three types of impacts i e water quantity water quality and ecosystems for gw sw and the transition zone as part of their evaluations further no other framework or classification scheme has explicitly included the transition zone which is surprizing given the importance of the gw sw interaction processes and the need to understand the transition zone as part of assessing gw sw systems this framework does have some limitations it requires and assumes some basic knowledge of gw sw systems and it also suggests the user consider other factors outside their areas of expertise hydrogeologists are generally not ecologists and vice versa the framework highlights the need to acknowledge and evaluate the importance and potential influence of factors and processes that may be outside the user s area of specialization this framework fills important gaps regarding the evaluation of gw sw systems in a review of the development of gw sw interaction science over the past two decades wondzell 2015 indicated a critical need for more holistic understanding of how gw sw interactions vary among streams types and sizes and with changes in discharge and for testing of broader conceptual models an important benefit of the current framework is its value for conceptualization of gw sw interactions in broader terms and including settings beyond just streams a lack of gw sw interaction data is often the main problem at a study site particularly for larger areas the framework allows users to combine available data with deductions based on commonly available watershed data to identify dominant gw sw interaction processes across larger areas some of the impacts and issues identified in fig 7 require consideration of the cumulative impacts of gw sw interactions over entire watersheds which can be challenging but the framework s strategy of identifying processes fig 5 and scaling up to larger patterns of behavior fig 6 breaks the problem down into more manageable pieces the framework also incorporates a mechanism for identifying potential hot spots and hot moments within watersheds i e critical locations or times of large changes in water or chemical fluxes or loadings which can be essential for understanding the potential role of gw sw interactions within broader management issues at larger scales the framework was also able to incorporate different geological settings on a larger scale for the duffins creek watershed to provide the kind of conceptual model of flow that can be used to support further gw sw investigations regarding other management issues involving water quality and ecosystems likewise the nottawasaga bay case study provides an example where the framework is being used to identify knowledge gaps test hypotheses and select locations sampling times and instrumentation to support ongoing field monitoring of the potential impacts of nutrient discharges the development of comprehensive conceptual site models is imperative to understanding and addressing problems that involve gw sw interactions this framework is a tool to aid conceptual model development for a wide range of conditions 5 conclusions a comprehensive framework for characterizing and evaluating gw sw interactions for streams rivers and lakes was developed it provides a logical and flexible approach to evaluate a wide range of possible factors that influence gw sw interactions and potential impacts they can have on water quantity quality and ecosystems unlike prior classification systems the framework focuses on identifying fundamental and critical gw sw processes and therefore is widely applicable to stream river and lake environments in a variety of different physiographic and geomorphological settings the flexibility of the framework allows for tailoring it to a particular setting location or management issue in this way the framework can be streamlined to address just the main characteristics and dominant processes for the issue of interest a key feature of the framework is that it can be used to build robust conceptual site models help identify knowledge gaps and focus and guide future investigations the three distinctly different case studies illustrate the application and flexibility of the framework the case studies address different sw settings river and lake cover a range of spatial scales local intermediate regional explore different management issues and have different amounts of field data available the pine river case study illustrates the benefit of applying the framework in a data rich study area to consider the gw sw system holistically and ensure all gw sw interaction processes with potential effects on contaminant transport to a river have been considered alternatively the nottawasaga bay and duffins creek case studies apply the framework over larger areas to test hypotheses and develop conceptual models that provide insight into potentially important gw sw interaction processes that guide additional investigations and monitoring overall this framework has proven to be a valuable tool for assessing these gw sw systems and should be particularly useful when evaluating other environments and management issues declaration of interests none declaration acknowledgements we would like to thank s alpay at

6456,polarimetric synthetic aperture radar polsar as an advanced active sensor can penetrate vegetation to detect ground information the multimode observation data can provide more information to interpret different scattering mechanisms and have great application potential in soil moisture estimation sme in this paper a modified method of soil moisture inversion from polsar data based on a two component polarimetric decomposition model is introduced the proposed method neglects the dihedral scattering component in the case of sparse vegetation cover and no building areas compensates the orientation angle by considering the influence of surface roughness and terrain slope and calculates the dielectric constant with the hybrid x bragg fresnel model gaofen 3 c band data from ordos inner mongolia and soil moisture experiment 2003 smex03 airborne synthetic aperture radar airsar c and l band data from southern oklahoma were applied in the experimental research furthermore the performance and validity limits were assessed by comparing the retrieval results with in situ measurements and soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture products the results reveal a root mean square error rmse of 8 66 with an inversion rate of up to 61 when using the gaofen 3 data from ordos for the southern oklahoma study area the inversion rmse of the airsar c and l band data is 8 57 and 8 95 respectively the tendency of the inversion results is also consistent with the change trend of the site observations in the bare soil and sparse vegetation covered areas the retrieval error is relatively small while in dense vegetation covered areas soil moisture is underestimated in both the c and l band data and the former is more underestimated than the latter keywords soil moisture estimation sme polsar polarimetric decomposition gaofen 3 airsar 1 introduction as an important surface parameter soil moisture plays a critical role in hydrological modeling ecological process description and climate change monitoring and it supports the applications of flood forecasting and precision farming techniques for intra field irrigation karthikeyan et al 2017a b kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 wagner et al 2007 from the perspective of hydrology studies and climate science soil moisture influences the energy cycle between the atmosphere and the ground surface and controls the partitioning between infiltration and runoff soil moisture is in fact considered an indispensable climate variable by the global climate observing system gcos huang et al 2016b wang et al 2017 large scale multi temporal soil moisture observations are widely used in global environmental change detection synthetic aperture radar sar sensors can generate a source of microwave radiation and measure the returned signal from the illuminated surface and can thus monitor surface parameters at a spatial resolution of meters to tens of meters ulaby 1981 van zyl 2011 furthermore polarimetric synthetic aperture radar polsar sensors expand the amount of information and offer more observations than single polarization sar leading to potential enhancement of soil moisture inversion cloude 2010 lee and pottier 2009 what is more multi angle multi polarization and multi frequency airborne and spaceborne sar observations have advantages in interpreting different scattering mechanisms and thus have great application potential for soil moisture inversion ballester berman et al 2013 di martino et al 2016 el hajj et al 2016 hajnsek et al 2009 jagdhuber et al 2013 jagdhuber 2012 liu et al 2017 zribi et al 2016 for soil moisture estimation sme bare soil and vegetation covered areas are points of focus over bare soil empirical and theoretical model based techniques have been successfully used to estimate soil moisture however for vegetation areas such as crops grassland and forest soil moisture retrieval still faces problems and challenges this is mainly because the backscattering coefficients of polsar data are synthesized information about the land cover type terrain slope surface roughness local incidence angle dielectric constant etc therefore extracting solely the information of the dielectric constant from multiple parameters is a complicated issue much effort has been devoted to solving this problem in past decades including establishing different volume ground scattering models hajnsek et al 2003 jagdhuber 2016 jagdhuber et al 2015 developing various polarimetric decomposition algorithms arii et al 2011 cui et al 2012 freeman and durden 1998 huang and wang 2014 mott et al 1993 si wei et al 2014 van zyl et al 2011 yamaguchi et al 2005 yi et al 2014 and incorporating multi angle polsar data jagdhuber et al 2013 for volume scattering modeling randomly horizontally and vertically distributed dipoles can be used to describe the volume component scattering mechanism and are generally applied in polarimetric decomposition methods such as freeman durden three component decomposition yamaguchi four component decomposition and the nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition model arii et al 2011 freeman and durden 1998 van zyl et al 2011 yamaguchi et al 2005 in order to describe the volume scattering accurately the dipole shape parameters of particle anisotropy ap and distribution width of the orientation angles δ ψ have been induced into the model jagdhuber et al 2015 2011 for ground scattering components based on certain electromagnetic em models the small perturbation model spm or the bragg fresnel model can establish the relationship between the soil dielectric constant and the polarimetric parameters however the surface roughness and vegetation layer still cannot be decoupled accurately considering the surface and dihedral scattering depolarization a surface with roughness disturbance can be modeled as a depolarizer by rotating the coherency t matrix about an angle in a plane which is perpendicular to the scattering plane hajnsek et al 2003 jagdhuber 2016 lee et al 2000 in addition to considering the depolarization effect the modification also includes the correction of the scattered power attenuation due to surface roughness which induces more parameters in contrast the more complex models such as the highly parameterized volume scattering models can make the soil moisture retrieval an ill posed problem which is unfavorable for inversion purposes polarimetric decomposition methods provide us with an effective way to separate the volume component from the ground scattering part for vegetation scattering decoupling most of these decomposition techniques can be divided into three categories the first category is the complete model based decomposition method proposed by freeman and durden 1998 under the reflection symmetry condition yamaguchi et al 2005 added a helix scattering term into the model and induced a choice of volume scattering matrices by modifying the probability density of the dipole scatters van zyl et al 2011 combined nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition with eigenvector decomposition and showed that the freeman and yamaguchi algorithms typically overestimate the canopy scattering contribution by 10 20 wentao et al 2010 applied a de orientation process and used a pure volume scattering model instead of the original one adopted in freeman decomposition considering that polarimetric orientation compensation cannot obtain a zero orientation angle and zero cross polarization power for the ground component si wei et al 2013 2014 proposed a general decomposition framework which uses a residual minimization criterion and all the elements of the coherency matrix the second category is the complete eigenvector based decomposition method introduced by cloude and pottier 1996 using this approach the dominant scattering mechanism and the scattered power can be determined by the maximum eigenvalue and eigenvector mott et al 1993 made approximations to interpret the eigenvector based decomposition results in terms of known scattering mechanisms the third category is hybrid model and eigenvector based decomposition which incorporates distributed particles for the volume scattering model and eigenvalues eigenvectors for the surface and dihedral mechanism description the generalized freeman durden decomposition method postulates that the surface and dihedral mechanisms are orthogonal cloude 2010 jagdhuber et al 2014 proposed an iterative and generalized volume scattering model for a hybrid decomposition technique with full polsar data cui et al 2012 proposed a model fitting algorithm to resolve the surface and double bounce scattering ambiguity and employed a minimum eigenvalue as the volume scattering power to overcome the negative power problem however these decomposition methods only estimate the contribution of the different scattering mechanisms approximately and are difficult to evaluate quantitatively moreover changes in terrain and vegetation types often make them inapplicable especially in surface parameter inversion and quantitative applications therefore a more accurate and efficient decomposition model should be investigated in this paper a modified method based on two component decomposition and a hybrid x bragg fresnel scattering model for sme using fully polarimetric sar data is proposed we assume that the dihedral component can be neglected when the vegetation cover does not contain trees or other high plants hence the surface can be described as a fresnel bragg or x bragg scattering model in different conditions it can then be reasonably taken that the surface and volume components are independent hence with radiometric correction speckle filtering and de orientation and decomposition processing the surface dielectric constant can be estimated and converted to volumetric soil moisture mv topp et al 1980 the sme results are compared against soil moisture active passive smap mission products and in situ measurements and error statistics are calculated for evaluating the method 2 materials and methods the model based decompositions for soil moisture retrieval have physical interpretation of each scattering components in this context the innovating of the methodology is to employ the poa compensation to reduce the effect of terrain factors based on model based polarimetric decompositions and adopt the modified fresnel scattering model to solve the problem of low soil moisture inversion rate considering that few dihedral components present in the bare and sparse vegetation area two component decomposition model is more applicable to separate the surface scattering component from the volume hence the separated accurate surface backscattering information combined with modified fresnel scattering model can be used to improve the inversion rate and accuracy in this section the modified fresnel function is introduced following model based polarimetric decomposition theory and poa composition method where the processing scheme for retrieving soil moisture by use of the proposed two component polarimetric decomposition model and hybrid modified fresnel x bragg scattering model is illustrated at the end of this part 2 1 coherency matrix and polarization orientation angle compensation 2 1 1 polsar coherency matrix in this paper polarimetric coherency matrix data are used for the sme for full polsar data both the covariance and coherency matrices can describe the second order statistics of the polarimetric information where the latter has the advantage in representing a physical explanation it also renders a simpler formula for orientation angle compensation cui et al 2012 si wei et al 2013 defined under reciprocity theory the coherency matrix is given by 1 t t 11 t 12 t 13 t 12 t 22 t 23 t 13 t 23 t 33 k k h where superscript stands for the complex conjugate superscript h represents the conjugate transpose denotes the sample average and k is a three dimensional pauli eigenvector defined as 2 k 1 2 s hh s vv s hh s vv 2 s hv s hh s vv and s hv are the polarimetric scattering matrix elements where subscript h and v denote the horizontal and vertical polarizations of the transmitting or receiving electromagnetic wave in the case of reflection symmetry t 13 t 23 t 13 are explicitly set to zero cloude 2010 lee and pottier 2009 van zyl 2011 2 1 2 polarization orientation angle compensation the polarization orientation angle poa is the angle of rotation of a ground object around the line of sight los which is analogous to rotating the antenna basis about an angle θ in general each pixel of the observational data has their own orientation angle when sar imaging a rugged terrain area lee et al 2000 as mentioned in lee et al 2000 the poa is a function of the terrain slope azimuth and range direction and radar look angle which can be expressed as 3 tan θ tan ω tan γ cos ϕ sin ϕ where θ represents the poa shift ω and γ denote the azimuth slope and range slope respectively and ϕ is the look angle the poa has two main effects on the sar image response i e it changes the radar cross section rcs per unit area and the polarization state which results in the same features having different backscattering coefficients and polarization characteristics for instance in a tilted surface or oriented building area volume scattering is often overestimated which causes interpretation ambiguity for quantitative remote sensing applications such as inversion of biomass and soil moisture it is essential to remove this bias and ensure accurate estimation thus to eliminate the poa effect the orientation angle can be derived from a digital elevation model dem and the polsar data in the case of no dem data being available other methods can be used to calculate the poa such as the polarization signature method schuler et al 1996 the circular polarization method lee et al 2000 cloude s target decomposition method cloude and pottier 1996 and huynen s decomposition method huynen 1990 among these methods the circular polarization method which is used in this paper produces the most accurate poa in view of the fact that polarization azimuth estimation is not the focus of this paper the implementation of this method is not described in detail in this paper poa compensation is aimed at minimizing the cross polarization term by rotating the coherency matrix the rotation of the coherency by orthogonal transformation is defined as 4 t θ r θ t r θ t t 11 θ t 12 θ t 13 θ t 12 θ t 22 θ t 23 θ t 13 θ t 23 θ t 33 θ where θ is the poa superscript t denotes transposition and r θ is the orthogonal rotation matrix which is given by 5 r θ 1 0 0 0 cos 2 θ sin 2 θ 0 sin 2 θ cos 2 θ 2 2 the model based polarimetric decomposition scheme based on the coherency matrix as mentioned in section 1 the model based decomposition method expands the coherency matrix t as a linear combination of three parts corresponding to volume scattering dihedral scattering and surface scattering in the case of the reflection symmetry assumption for natural media the freeman durden algorithm describes the surface as bragg scattering the dihedral scattering as a coupling of the forward fresnel scattering and the volume scattering as a randomly distributed cloud dipole model the model of three component decomposition can be described as 6 t 3 f s 1 β 0 β β 2 0 0 0 0 f d α 2 α 0 α 1 0 0 0 0 f v v 11 v 12 0 v 12 v 22 0 0 0 v 33 in eq 6 the first term corresponds to the surface scattering component modeled as a first order bragg scattering model fs is the surface scattering contribution and β is the bragg coefficient note that the rank of the first part the coherency matrix of the bragg scattering model is equal to 1 7 b hh cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l b vv ε soil 1 sin 2 θ l ε soil 1 sin 2 θ l ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l 2 8 β b hh b vv b hh b vv 1 β 0 in eq 7 θ 1 is the local incidence angle b hh and b vv are the horizontal and vertical bragg scattering coefficients respectively considering surface depolarization hajnsek et al 2003 extended the bragg scattering model by incorporating the surface roughness angle the way to introduce roughness disturbance is to rotate the bragg coherency matrix about an angle ψ and perform configurational averaging over a given width of a uniform probability density function pdf the extended bragg x bragg model is described as 9 t x b ragg f s 1 β sinc 2 ψ 0 β sinc 2 ψ 1 2 β 2 1 sinc 4 ψ 0 0 0 1 2 β 2 1 sinc 4 ψ from eq 9 unlike the bragg model the x bragg model is reflection symmetric and the rank of the coherency matrix is 3 the second term is the dihedral scattering component which is expressed as a coupling of the forward fresnel scattering at each of the smooth and orthogonal planes we assume that in vegetation areas the dihedral scattering component is mainly induced by soil trunk or soil stalk reflection the dihedral scattering mechanism α and the real backscattering amplitude fd can be described as 10 α r hs r ht r vs r vt e i φ r hs r ht r vs r vt e i φ f d 1 2 r hs r ht r vs r vt e i φ 2 where e i φ accounts for the phase difference between the horizontal and vertical polarizations r hs and r vs are respectively the horizontal and vertical fresnel scattering coefficients of the soil and r ht and r vt are respectively the horizontal and vertical fresnel scattering coefficients of the trunk or stalk hajnsek et al 2009 jagdhuber 2016 wang et al 2017 11 r hs cos θ l ε soil sin 2

trunk sin 2 π 2 θ l ε trunk cos π 2 θ l ε trunk sin 2 π 2 θ l as with the bragg scattering model the rank of the dihedral scattering coherency matrix is also equal to 1 note that the canonical dihedral component expresses the double reflection as two smooth and orthogonal planes and ignores the surface roughness of the soil therefore jagdhuber 2016 considered the depolarization to be induced by soil roughness and introduced it as a los rotation of θ solely around the soil plane even though the it accounts for the soil roughness factor in the dihedral scattering component it is not applicable for the solution of many unknown parameters with one observation mode the volume scattering component represented by the third term in eq 6 is usually described as three types randomly oriented dipoles horizontally oriented dipoles and vertically oriented dipoles arii et al 2011 freeman and durden 1998 si wei et al 2014 wang et al 2017 yamaguchi et al 2005 13 t v ran fv 4 2 0 0 0 1

such generalized volume scattering models induce more unknown parameters to be calculated and make the decomposition method proposed in this paper more complex and impracticable 2 3 the two component polarimetric decomposition method for sme we assume that the dihedral component can be neglected in the case of no trees or other high plants we thus propose a two component polarimetric decomposition method for sme fig 1 shows the conceptual visualization of the two component scattering mechanism section 3 discusses the rationality of the assumption by determining the ratio of the surface dihedral and volume scattering mechanisms in the research area considering the depolarization and cross polarization induced by surface roughness the surface scattering component can be rationally modeled as the x bragg model as mentioned in section 2 eq 8 the x bragg coefficient β is negative 1 β 0 which means that the coherence element of t 12 is a negative value however the observed real part of t 12 can adopt both negative and positive values in other words the coefficient β of the observation data may be positive and the x bragg model is not fully applicable to describe the surface scattering mechanism ballester berman et al 2013 as the fresnel scattering model is normally exploited in forward scattering process and the fresnel function predicts a null backscattering for a perfectly smooth surface we can modify it to account for surface roughness and hence obtain a non zero backscattered power the modification to the fresnel function is to allow for the finite size of rough surface element of a facet by employing the physical optics current approximation involving evaluation of an integral over the surface to account for the finite extent of the scatter as well as bsa convention the modified fresnel equations for an infinite scatter plan can be derive in this case the modified fresnel model is employed to describe the surface backscattering and solve the problem of low soil moisture inversion rate when only use the bragg scattering model as described in cloude 2010 the scattering matrix derived from the modified fresnel model is given by 14 s s hh 0 0 s vv 2 π l λ cos θ sin k l sin θ kl sin θ fresne l hh 0 0 fresne l vv 15 fresne l hh cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l 16 fresne l vv ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l where fresnelhh and fresnelvv denote the horizontal and vertical fresnel scattering coefficients and l is the dimension of the scattering facet similar to the x bragg model the modified fresnel coefficient β fresnel is also a function of the soil dielectric constant and the local incidence angle as shown in eq 17 17 β fresnel fresne l hh f r e s n e l vv fresne l hh f r e s n e l vv sin 2 θ l cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l generally speaking in eq 17 the local incidence angle 0 θl 90 and the soil dielectric constant 2 εsoil 44 which makes β fresnel always positive fig 2 shows the relationship between the dielectric constant and the local incidence angle for the bragg coefficient and the modified fresnel coefficient we also suggest that the poa has a large impact on the backscattering coefficient and that de orientation processing is necessary for sme as a data preprocessing step especially in rugged terrain areas in fig 3 before the two component decomposition we employ the h α decomposition method to characterize the backscattering mechanism in terms of two parameters i e the entropy h and polarization angle α cloude and pottier 1997 in terms of bare soil areas most of their pixels are dominated by surface scattering mechanism with the development of vegetation phenological state the volume scattering will be mixed with the surface scattering in this case it is difficult to distinguish the surface scattering dominated area one of the possible solutions is to determine the h and α threshold empirically by using the statistical analysis of priori knowledge huang et al 2016a analyzed the h and α distribution of wheat corn and soybean fields in different phenological phases and found that h from 0 55 to 0 6 can be used to distinguish the scattering in bare soil and in vegetated fields according to their normal distribution curves considering the influence of surface roughness factor the h will increase to 0 6 when the scattering of bare soils is dominated by a surface cover their experimental results also show that when 0 6 is determined as the h threshold most of the bare soil fields can be distinguished however the bare soils with withered vegetation residues may be misclassified as a field mixed with surface and volume scattering when only use the h criteria so the α threshold is also explored by their normal distribution curves of different crop land finally the α threshold of less than 40 is employed as the threshold to distinguish the surface scattering from the volume scattering therefore in this study we directly refer the previous findings and determine h 0 6 α 40 as the threshold to separate the dominant surface scattering from bare soil for a surface scattering dominant area the x bragg model is used to calculate the bragg coefficient β and soil dielectric constant εsoil we then convert εsoil to volumetric soil moisture by a commonly used inversion formula topp et al 1980 the polynomial expression is shown in eq 18 18 mv 5 3 2 92 ε soil 0 055 ε soil 2 0 0004 ε soil 3 for other areas with a mixed volume and surface scattering mechanism the two component decomposition method is used to separate surface scattering from volume scattering and to calculate parameters fs and β the x bragg real t 12 0 or modified fresnel real t 12 0 model is then used to construct the relationship between εsoil and β finally eq 18 is used to convert εsoil to volumetric soil moisture fig 3 depicts the processing scheme of retrieving soil moisture content by the use of the proposed two component polarimetric decomposition model 3 experiments in sar data inversion 3 1 study areas and fully polarimetric sar data the two study areas selected for the experimentation analysis and validation are located in ordos inner mongolia of china and southern oklahoma of the usa respectively the ordos study area features mostly plains and is mainly covered with grassland and bare soil so there was no need to consider the influence of mountains urban areas and forest areas the soil moisture experiment 2003 smex03 was conducted between 2 july 2003 and 17 july 2003 in the little washita watershed of southern oklahoma jackson et al 2009 parameters measured by smex03 included bulk density land cover type volumetric soil moisture and surface soil temperature jackson and cosh 2006 nasa s airborne synthetic aperture radar airsar instrument also mapped the southern oklahoma area on six different days the 3rd 5th 7th 10th and 12th of july 2003 in this study gaofen 3 and airsar fully polarimetric sar data from ordos and southern oklahoma were used in the soil moisture retrieval experiments see table 1 3 1 1 the ordos gaofen 3 data for the ordos study area gaofen 3 data are available for 18 july 2017 gaofen 3 which was launched on 10 august 2016 is china s first multi polarization sar imaging satellite before sme radiometric correction geometric correction and refined lee speckle filtering 7 7 window were conducted as the data preprocessing fig 4 a shows the pauli rgb image composed of gaofen 3 fully polarimetric data it can be seen from figs 4 b and 5 a that in most of this study area the value of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is less than 0 2 and the most of the terrain slope angle is larger than 0 in some parts of research area the slope value is larger than 10 besides the histogram graph in fig 5 b can also illustrate the distribution of terrain slope in the whole research area for that matter we can conclude that there is sparse vegetation cover and a low terrain slope in the ordos study area according to the h α plane as shown in fig 6 the entropy of most of the study area is less than 0 6 and the polarization alpha angle is less than 40 based on the h α threshold of bare soil in huang et al 2016a h 0 6 α 40 was used to distinguish the predominant surface scattering areas and bare soil the smap mission was one of the first earth observation satellites developed by nasa to make global measurements of the soil moisture present at the earth s land surface the product contains calibrated and geolocated brightness temperature data soil moisture data sigma naught data etc the smap enhanced passive soil moisture products have been reported to have a greater reliability than the passive and active passive products chen et al 2018 therefore in this paper the spl3smp e data product at a medium scale of 9 km is used to validate the inversion accuracy and analyze the potential of gaofen 3 data in sme in the absence of ground observational data the global volumetric soil moisture map for 18 july 2017 synchronous with the gaofen 3 data is shown in fig 7 3 1 2 the southern oklahoma airsar data for the southern oklahoma study area we employed the smex03 measurement campaign data acquired on 12 july 2003 in the little washita basin the framework of the smex03 measurement campaign involved collecting the airsar data of the research area together with ground soil moisture data and ancillary data made up of site photographs cosh et al 2013 the airsar instrument mounted on a dc 8 aircraft was operated and managed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory jpl in airsar s polsar mode the radar instrument collects backscattering coefficients at full polarization hh vv hv in the c l and p band frequencies apart from the sar data the ground observation and site photos were used to verify the retrieval accuracy from the polsar data fig 8 shows the southern oklahoma study area with the airsar data coverage area marked by the red rectangle land use classification data are also available for this area the different land cover types including bare soil pasture grass winter wheat sorghum and corn were recorded together with ground site soil moisture measurements 3 2 two component decomposition assuming that the dihedral component can be neglected in the case of no trees or other high plants we propose a two component polarimetric decomposition method for sme before the two component decomposition the ratios of the surface dihedral and volume scattering components obtained by the freeman durden decomposition model were analyzed freeman durden three component decomposition without de orientation processing was applied to the gaofen 3 data from the ordos area fig 9 a represents the ratios of the surface dihedral and volume scattering mechanisms of the whole study area in the results the predominantly surface scattering reaches 79 8 the volume scattering holds a subordinate position of between 15 and 37 4 while the dihedral scattering component is the lowest with less than 11 4 this is in accordance with our hypothesis that there are few dihedral scattering components in the ordos area which does not feature high plants or tree cover the two component decomposition with de orientation processing was also implemented on the whole ordos area of the gaofen 3 image and the ratios of the surface and volume scattering components are shown in fig 9 b comparing the results of the two component decomposition and the freeman durden three component decomposition the surface scattering component is increased by 11 with the de orientation processing while the volume component is decreased by 15 for the two component decomposition the predominantly surface scattering reaches up to 91 however the volume scattering component reduces to about 15 the conclusion can be drawn that poa compensation can maximize the co polarization component and reduce the cross polarization component which is induced by the topography undulation accordingly de orientation processing is necessary for scattering mechanism decomposition to reduce the influence of topography and correct the backscattering of the different features to a normal poa 3 3 soil moisture estimation in the second step the computed entropy h and polarization angle α are used to separate single surface scattering areas from mixed surface and volume scattering mechanism areas for single surface scattering areas the x bragg model is used to calculate the soil dielectric constant whereas for areas with a mixed surface and volume scattering mechanism the modified fresnel model or the x bragg model is used to calculate the soil dielectric constant according to the real part of t 12 the proposed two component decomposition and hybrid x bragg fresnel scattering model inversion algorithm were applied to the gaofen 3 data of the ordos area and the airsar c and l band for southern oklahoma 3 3 1 gaofen 3 inversion results for the ordos area gaofen 3 fully polarimetric sar data in strip map mode were used for the sme experiment and the results were compared with the spl3smp e soil moisture product data as the swath width of the gaofen 3 strip map mode data is 25 km 25 km and the spatial resolution of the spl3smp e data is 9 km only four pixels of the spl3smp e data cover the entire gaofen 3 data therefore the four pixels of the spl3smp e data in the research area were taken as the reference measurements in the accuracy evaluation fig 10 shows the volumetric soil moisture content retrieval results for two different areas in ordos the average of the volumetric soil moisture retrieval results is 6 86 by counting the effective number of pixels with an inversion result about 24 400 of the 40 000 pixels have an inversion value between 0 32 ε soil 2 and 50 77 ε soil 44 and the inversion rate reaches 61 the validation with the spl3smp e soil moisture product data reveals a promising accuracy of 8 66 in root mean square error rmse see fig 11 a over the whole ordos study area the volumetric soil moisture of spl3smp e is 2 which is 4 86 lower than the result of the inversion using gaofen 3 data from the boxplot of the gaofen 3 sme result see fig 11 b the volumetric soil moisture values of most pixels are larger than 9 46 and some other pixels are larger than 19 37 this is because the spl3smp e product with a coarse special resolution obtains the average backscatter information over a wide range while the gaofen 3 data with a fine resolution reflect more detailed information of the imaging area therefore in the same area the soil moisture content retrieval from the fine resolution data is greatly influenced by terrain surface features soil water content etc 3 3 2 airsar inversion results in order to study the performance of the proposed method in different bands airsar c and l band data of southern oklahoma together with in situ measurements were used in this experiment there are two airsar images obtained on 12 july 2003 for this area in fig 12 a the red rectangle area corresponds to the airsar cm6709 image and the blue rectangle area corresponds to the airsar cm6710 image their c band pauli rgb images are shown in fig 12 b and c respectively the locations of the regional ground soil moisture observation sites in southern oklahoma are marked on the google earth image twenty one in situ observation sites were selected for the inversion accuracy verification and 400 20 20 pixels around each site were used to count the average and variance fortunately site photos are available to analyze the performance of the soil moisture inversion with different land cover types the sme results from the airsar c and l band data are shown in fig 14 a and b comparing the average of the inversion results for the 21 sites denoted by the red dotted line with the in situ soil moisture measurements denoted by the cyan dotted line the variation trends are similar for both the airsar c and l band data the inversion results for the airsar full polarization data can reflect the change of soil water content in different regions to a certain extent compared with the in situ measurements the airsar c and l band inversion results reveal promising accuracies of 8 57 and 8 95 respectively according to the site photos of the different sites os27 os29 os40 os41 and os42 are bare soil areas and the error of the inversion results is low in both the c and l band data in contrast in the grassland areas such as os28 os30 35 os37 os38 os43 os44 os46 os50 and os52 the inversion results for the c and l band data show different levels of underestimation and the denser the grass growth the more serious the underestimation specifically the inversion of the volumetric soil moisture is 26 lower than the in situ observation for the os33 site which has the densest vegetation coverage comparing the c and l band data inversion results it can be seen from fig 14 that the variance of the c band data inversion results is larger than that of the l band data this is due to the fact that the short wavelength is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the region and the l band data with strong penetrability is sensitive to the soil water content in addition from the site photos of the smex03 ancillary data the os27 os29 os40 and os42 sites are located on bare soil areas the os31 os35 os43 os44 os37 and os38 sites feature relatively sparse grassland and the os28 os30 os32 os33 os34 os46 os50 and os52 sites feature much denser and higher grass than the other sites see fig 13 therefore the in situ sites can be divided into three categories bare soil sparse grassland and dense grassland as mentioned previously the inversion results for the c and l band data have different degrees of underestimation thus we also analyzed the sme results for the airsar c and l band data with different vegetation densities fig 15 a c show the sme results for the airsar c and l band data in the bare soil sparse grassland and dense grassland areas together with the in situ measurements table 2 lists the rmse maximum error and minimum error of the statistical information for the three areas it can be clearly seen that in the bare soil areas the retrieval results for the airsar c and l band data are similar to the in situ measurements the rmse is 4 44 for the airsar c band data and 2 88 for the l band data both the maximum and minimum error for the airsar l band data are smaller than for the airsar c band data in the sparse grassland areas the rmse for the airsar c and l band data increases to 7 57 and 8 16 respectively and the maximum and minimum error for the airsar l band data are still smaller than for the airsar c band data more importantly four out of the six sites show the problem of underestimation however the dense grassland areas have nearly double the rmse of the sparse grassland areas and there are more points with underestimated soil moisture contents in several sites the underestimation is more than 28 for the airsar c band data and 25 for the l band data in the dense grassland areas overall it can be concluded that the sme method proposed in this paper is effective for airsar fully polarimetric data and its performance in the l band is better than in the c band 4 discussion and conclusion the model based polarimetric decomposition method can separate the ground scattering component from the volume scattering of the underlying surface and can subsequently be used to extract the dielectric constant or soil moisture information in polsar scattering mechanism modeling a relatively smooth surface is modeled as the bragg scattering model and a rough surface is represented by the x bragg model when considering the depolarization and cross polarization induced by the surface roughness practically the x bragg model is not fully applicable to model surface scattering dominant areas due to the positive t 12 of the observation coherency matrix however the modified fresnel scattering model holding a positive bragg coefficient can conquer the disadvantage of the x bragg model if we assume that the dihedral component can be neglected in the case of no trees or other high plants a two component polarimetric decomposition method together with a hybrid x bragg fresnel scattering model is proposed for sme in comparison with three component four component and other multi parameterized decomposition methods the proposed model with fewer parameters is both effective and efficient the proposed method was assessed in a feasibility study using fully polarimetric gaofen 3 data from ordos inner mongolia and airsar c and l band data from southern oklahoma for the gaofen 3 data from the ordos area considering the influence of the poa a comparison with and without de orientation processing was implemented the results showed that de orientation processing is necessary for scattering mechanism decomposition and can reduce the influence of topography moreover it is effective in correcting the backscattering of different features to a normal polarization angle the results of the comparison with smap spl3smp e soil moisture products showed that the inversion rate reached 61 with a promising accuracy of 8 66 in rmse when using the gaofen 3 data of the ordos area to study the performance of the proposed method in different bands airsar c and l band data from southern oklahoma together with in situ measurements were used in our research the sme results revealed an accuracy of 8 57 for the c band data and 8 95 for the l band data the tendency of the inversion results was also consistent with the variation of the site observations furthermore using site photos the sme results with different vegetation coverages were also analyzed in the bare soil areas the rmse and the maximum and minimum error of the inversion results for the c and l band data were relatively small in the sparse vegetation areas the rmse and inversion error were larger than in the bare soil areas in the dense vegetation covered areas the soil moisture was underestimated and the sme results obtained using the c band data were more underestimated than for the l band data although the accuracies of the c band and l band retrieval results showed only small differences the variance and underestimation extent of the inversion results in the vegetation covered areas revealed that sme with l band data is more representative however sme based on the model based polarimetric decomposition method still has some limitations for the two component decomposition model the dihedral component is neglected with the assumption of no high plants or dense vegetation coverage whereas in the moderate vegetation covered areas this decomposition model is not applicable the results obtained in this study also suggest that de orientation processing can reduce the influence of topography and surface depolarization and is essential for sme in sar data preprocessing which is often neglected when using a model based polarimetric decomposition method in addition the surface dihedral and volume components are only approximate values and the accuracy of the sme result is greatly affected by the performance of the model based decomposition method unfortunately few approaches have been developed to quantitatively assess polarimetric decomposition algorithms an adaptive and accurate polarization decomposition model and the sme underestimation problem in dense vegetation areas will be the focus of our future research declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

6456,polarimetric synthetic aperture radar polsar as an advanced active sensor can penetrate vegetation to detect ground information the multimode observation data can provide more information to interpret different scattering mechanisms and have great application potential in soil moisture estimation sme in this paper a modified method of soil moisture inversion from polsar data based on a two component polarimetric decomposition model is introduced the proposed method neglects the dihedral scattering component in the case of sparse vegetation cover and no building areas compensates the orientation angle by considering the influence of surface roughness and terrain slope and calculates the dielectric constant with the hybrid x bragg fresnel model gaofen 3 c band data from ordos inner mongolia and soil moisture experiment 2003 smex03 airborne synthetic aperture radar airsar c and l band data from southern oklahoma were applied in the experimental research furthermore the performance and validity limits were assessed by comparing the retrieval results with in situ measurements and soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture products the results reveal a root mean square error rmse of 8 66 with an inversion rate of up to 61 when using the gaofen 3 data from ordos for the southern oklahoma study area the inversion rmse of the airsar c and l band data is 8 57 and 8 95 respectively the tendency of the inversion results is also consistent with the change trend of the site observations in the bare soil and sparse vegetation covered areas the retrieval error is relatively small while in dense vegetation covered areas soil moisture is underestimated in both the c and l band data and the former is more underestimated than the latter keywords soil moisture estimation sme polsar polarimetric decomposition gaofen 3 airsar 1 introduction as an important surface parameter soil moisture plays a critical role in hydrological modeling ecological process description and climate change monitoring and it supports the applications of flood forecasting and precision farming techniques for intra field irrigation karthikeyan et al 2017a b kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 wagner et al 2007 from the perspective of hydrology studies and climate science soil moisture influences the energy cycle between the atmosphere and the ground surface and controls the partitioning between infiltration and runoff soil moisture is in fact considered an indispensable climate variable by the global climate observing system gcos huang et al 2016b wang et al 2017 large scale multi temporal soil moisture observations are widely used in global environmental change detection synthetic aperture radar sar sensors can generate a source of microwave radiation and measure the returned signal from the illuminated surface and can thus monitor surface parameters at a spatial resolution of meters to tens of meters ulaby 1981 van zyl 2011 furthermore polarimetric synthetic aperture radar polsar sensors expand the amount of information and offer more observations than single polarization sar leading to potential enhancement of soil moisture inversion cloude 2010 lee and pottier 2009 what is more multi angle multi polarization and multi frequency airborne and spaceborne sar observations have advantages in interpreting different scattering mechanisms and thus have great application potential for soil moisture inversion ballester berman et al 2013 di martino et al 2016 el hajj et al 2016 hajnsek et al 2009 jagdhuber et al 2013 jagdhuber 2012 liu et al 2017 zribi et al 2016 for soil moisture estimation sme bare soil and vegetation covered areas are points of focus over bare soil empirical and theoretical model based techniques have been successfully used to estimate soil moisture however for vegetation areas such as crops grassland and forest soil moisture retrieval still faces problems and challenges this is mainly because the backscattering coefficients of polsar data are synthesized information about the land cover type terrain slope surface roughness local incidence angle dielectric constant etc therefore extracting solely the information of the dielectric constant from multiple parameters is a complicated issue much effort has been devoted to solving this problem in past decades including establishing different volume ground scattering models hajnsek et al 2003 jagdhuber 2016 jagdhuber et al 2015 developing various polarimetric decomposition algorithms arii et al 2011 cui et al 2012 freeman and durden 1998 huang and wang 2014 mott et al 1993 si wei et al 2014 van zyl et al 2011 yamaguchi et al 2005 yi et al 2014 and incorporating multi angle polsar data jagdhuber et al 2013 for volume scattering modeling randomly horizontally and vertically distributed dipoles can be used to describe the volume component scattering mechanism and are generally applied in polarimetric decomposition methods such as freeman durden three component decomposition yamaguchi four component decomposition and the nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition model arii et al 2011 freeman and durden 1998 van zyl et al 2011 yamaguchi et al 2005 in order to describe the volume scattering accurately the dipole shape parameters of particle anisotropy ap and distribution width of the orientation angles δ ψ have been induced into the model jagdhuber et al 2015 2011 for ground scattering components based on certain electromagnetic em models the small perturbation model spm or the bragg fresnel model can establish the relationship between the soil dielectric constant and the polarimetric parameters however the surface roughness and vegetation layer still cannot be decoupled accurately considering the surface and dihedral scattering depolarization a surface with roughness disturbance can be modeled as a depolarizer by rotating the coherency t matrix about an angle in a plane which is perpendicular to the scattering plane hajnsek et al 2003 jagdhuber 2016 lee et al 2000 in addition to considering the depolarization effect the modification also includes the correction of the scattered power attenuation due to surface roughness which induces more parameters in contrast the more complex models such as the highly parameterized volume scattering models can make the soil moisture retrieval an ill posed problem which is unfavorable for inversion purposes polarimetric decomposition methods provide us with an effective way to separate the volume component from the ground scattering part for vegetation scattering decoupling most of these decomposition techniques can be divided into three categories the first category is the complete model based decomposition method proposed by freeman and durden 1998 under the reflection symmetry condition yamaguchi et al 2005 added a helix scattering term into the model and induced a choice of volume scattering matrices by modifying the probability density of the dipole scatters van zyl et al 2011 combined nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition with eigenvector decomposition and showed that the freeman and yamaguchi algorithms typically overestimate the canopy scattering contribution by 10 20 wentao et al 2010 applied a de orientation process and used a pure volume scattering model instead of the original one adopted in freeman decomposition considering that polarimetric orientation compensation cannot obtain a zero orientation angle and zero cross polarization power for the ground component si wei et al 2013 2014 proposed a general decomposition framework which uses a residual minimization criterion and all the elements of the coherency matrix the second category is the complete eigenvector based decomposition method introduced by cloude and pottier 1996 using this approach the dominant scattering mechanism and the scattered power can be determined by the maximum eigenvalue and eigenvector mott et al 1993 made approximations to interpret the eigenvector based decomposition results in terms of known scattering mechanisms the third category is hybrid model and eigenvector based decomposition which incorporates distributed particles for the volume scattering model and eigenvalues eigenvectors for the surface and dihedral mechanism description the generalized freeman durden decomposition method postulates that the surface and dihedral mechanisms are orthogonal cloude 2010 jagdhuber et al 2014 proposed an iterative and generalized volume scattering model for a hybrid decomposition technique with full polsar data cui et al 2012 proposed a model fitting algorithm to resolve the surface and double bounce scattering ambiguity and employed a minimum eigenvalue as the volume scattering power to overcome the negative power problem however these decomposition methods only estimate the contribution of the different scattering mechanisms approximately and are difficult to evaluate quantitatively moreover changes in terrain and vegetation types often make them inapplicable especially in surface parameter inversion and quantitative applications therefore a more accurate and efficient decomposition model should be investigated in this paper a modified method based on two component decomposition and a hybrid x bragg fresnel scattering model for sme using fully polarimetric sar data is proposed we assume that the dihedral component can be neglected when the vegetation cover does not contain trees or other high plants hence the surface can be described as a fresnel bragg or x bragg scattering model in different conditions it can then be reasonably taken that the surface and volume components are independent hence with radiometric correction speckle filtering and de orientation and decomposition processing the surface dielectric constant can be estimated and converted to volumetric soil moisture mv topp et al 1980 the sme results are compared against soil moisture active passive smap mission products and in situ measurements and error statistics are calculated for evaluating the method 2 materials and methods the model based decompositions for soil moisture retrieval have physical interpretation of each scattering components in this context the innovating of the methodology is to employ the poa compensation to reduce the effect of terrain factors based on model based polarimetric decompositions and adopt the modified fresnel scattering model to solve the problem of low soil moisture inversion rate considering that few dihedral components present in the bare and sparse vegetation area two component decomposition model is more applicable to separate the surface scattering component from the volume hence the separated accurate surface backscattering information combined with modified fresnel scattering model can be used to improve the inversion rate and accuracy in this section the modified fresnel function is introduced following model based polarimetric decomposition theory and poa composition method where the processing scheme for retrieving soil moisture by use of the proposed two component polarimetric decomposition model and hybrid modified fresnel x bragg scattering model is illustrated at the end of this part 2 1 coherency matrix and polarization orientation angle compensation 2 1 1 polsar coherency matrix in this paper polarimetric coherency matrix data are used for the sme for full polsar data both the covariance and coherency matrices can describe the second order statistics of the polarimetric information where the latter has the advantage in representing a physical explanation it also renders a simpler formula for orientation angle compensation cui et al 2012 si wei et al 2013 defined under reciprocity theory the coherency matrix is given by 1 t t 11 t 12 t 13 t 12 t 22 t 23 t 13 t 23 t 33 k k h where superscript stands for the complex conjugate superscript h represents the conjugate transpose denotes the sample average and k is a three dimensional pauli eigenvector defined as 2 k 1 2 s hh s vv s hh s vv 2 s hv s hh s vv and s hv are the polarimetric scattering matrix elements where subscript h and v denote the horizontal and vertical polarizations of the transmitting or receiving electromagnetic wave in the case of reflection symmetry t 13 t 23 t 13 are explicitly set to zero cloude 2010 lee and pottier 2009 van zyl 2011 2 1 2 polarization orientation angle compensation the polarization orientation angle poa is the angle of rotation of a ground object around the line of sight los which is analogous to rotating the antenna basis about an angle θ in general each pixel of the observational data has their own orientation angle when sar imaging a rugged terrain area lee et al 2000 as mentioned in lee et al 2000 the poa is a function of the terrain slope azimuth and range direction and radar look angle which can be expressed as 3 tan θ tan ω tan γ cos ϕ sin ϕ where θ represents the poa shift ω and γ denote the azimuth slope and range slope respectively and ϕ is the look angle the poa has two main effects on the sar image response i e it changes the radar cross section rcs per unit area and the polarization state which results in the same features having different backscattering coefficients and polarization characteristics for instance in a tilted surface or oriented building area volume scattering is often overestimated which causes interpretation ambiguity for quantitative remote sensing applications such as inversion of biomass and soil moisture it is essential to remove this bias and ensure accurate estimation thus to eliminate the poa effect the orientation angle can be derived from a digital elevation model dem and the polsar data in the case of no dem data being available other methods can be used to calculate the poa such as the polarization signature method schuler et al 1996 the circular polarization method lee et al 2000 cloude s target decomposition method cloude and pottier 1996 and huynen s decomposition method huynen 1990 among these methods the circular polarization method which is used in this paper produces the most accurate poa in view of the fact that polarization azimuth estimation is not the focus of this paper the implementation of this method is not described in detail in this paper poa compensation is aimed at minimizing the cross polarization term by rotating the coherency matrix the rotation of the coherency by orthogonal transformation is defined as 4 t θ r θ t r θ t t 11 θ t 12 θ t 13 θ t 12 θ t 22 θ t 23 θ t 13 θ t 23 θ t 33 θ where θ is the poa superscript t denotes transposition and r θ is the orthogonal rotation matrix which is given by 5 r θ 1 0 0 0 cos 2 θ sin 2 θ 0 sin 2 θ cos 2 θ 2 2 the model based polarimetric decomposition scheme based on the coherency matrix as mentioned in section 1 the model based decomposition method expands the coherency matrix t as a linear combination of three parts corresponding to volume scattering dihedral scattering and surface scattering in the case of the reflection symmetry assumption for natural media the freeman durden algorithm describes the surface as bragg scattering the dihedral scattering as a coupling of the forward fresnel scattering and the volume scattering as a randomly distributed cloud dipole model the model of three component decomposition can be described as 6 t 3 f s 1 β 0 β β 2 0 0 0 0 f d α 2 α 0 α 1 0 0 0 0 f v v 11 v 12 0 v 12 v 22 0 0 0 v 33 in eq 6 the first term corresponds to the surface scattering component modeled as a first order bragg scattering model fs is the surface scattering contribution and β is the bragg coefficient note that the rank of the first part the coherency matrix of the bragg scattering model is equal to 1 7 b hh cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l b vv ε soil 1 sin 2 θ l ε soil 1 sin 2 θ l ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l 2 8 β b hh b vv b hh b vv 1 β 0 in eq 7 θ 1 is the local incidence angle b hh and b vv are the horizontal and vertical bragg scattering coefficients respectively considering surface depolarization hajnsek et al 2003 extended the bragg scattering model by incorporating the surface roughness angle the way to introduce roughness disturbance is to rotate the bragg coherency matrix about an angle ψ and perform configurational averaging over a given width of a uniform probability density function pdf the extended bragg x bragg model is described as 9 t x b ragg f s 1 β sinc 2 ψ 0 β sinc 2 ψ 1 2 β 2 1 sinc 4 ψ 0 0 0 1 2 β 2 1 sinc 4 ψ from eq 9 unlike the bragg model the x bragg model is reflection symmetric and the rank of the coherency matrix is 3 the second term is the dihedral scattering component which is expressed as a coupling of the forward fresnel scattering at each of the smooth and orthogonal planes we assume that in vegetation areas the dihedral scattering component is mainly induced by soil trunk or soil stalk reflection the dihedral scattering mechanism α and the real backscattering amplitude fd can be described as 10 α r hs r ht r vs r vt e i φ r hs r ht r vs r vt e i φ f d 1 2 r hs r ht r vs r vt e i φ 2 where e i φ accounts for the phase difference between the horizontal and vertical polarizations r hs and r vs are respectively the horizontal and vertical fresnel scattering coefficients of the soil and r ht and r vt are respectively the horizontal and vertical fresnel scattering coefficients of the trunk or stalk hajnsek et al 2009 jagdhuber 2016 wang et al 2017 11 r hs cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l r vs ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l 12 r ht cos π 2 θ l ε trunk sin 2 π 2 θ l cos π 2 θ l ε trunk sin 2 π 2 θ l r vt ε trunk cos π 2 θ l ε trunk sin 2 π 2 θ l ε trunk cos π 2 θ l ε trunk sin 2 π 2 θ l as with the bragg scattering model the rank of the dihedral scattering coherency matrix is also equal to 1 note that the canonical dihedral component expresses the double reflection as two smooth and orthogonal planes and ignores the surface roughness of the soil therefore jagdhuber 2016 considered the depolarization to be induced by soil roughness and introduced it as a los rotation of θ solely around the soil plane even though the it accounts for the soil roughness factor in the dihedral scattering component it is not applicable for the solution of many unknown parameters with one observation mode the volume scattering component represented by the third term in eq 6 is usually described as three types randomly oriented dipoles horizontally oriented dipoles and vertically oriented dipoles arii et al 2011 freeman and durden 1998 si wei et al 2014 wang et al 2017 yamaguchi et al 2005 13 t v ran fv 4 2 0 0 0 1

such generalized volume scattering models induce more unknown parameters to be calculated and make the decomposition method proposed in this paper more complex and impracticable 2 3 the two component polarimetric decomposition method for sme we assume that the dihedral component can be neglected in the case of no trees or other high plants we thus propose a two component polarimetric decomposition method for sme fig 1 shows the conceptual visualization of the two component scattering mechanism section 3 discusses the rationality of the assumption by determining the ratio of the surface dihedral and volume scattering mechanisms in the research area considering the depolarization and cross polarization induced by surface roughness the surface scattering component can be rationally modeled as the x bragg model as mentioned in section 2 eq 8 the x bragg coefficient β is negative 1 β 0 which means that the coherence element of t 12 is a negative value however the observed real part of t 12 can adopt both negative and positive values in other words the coefficient β of the observation data may be positive and the x bragg model is not fully applicable to describe the surface scattering mechanism ballester berman et al 2013 as the fresnel scattering model is normally exploited in forward scattering process and the fresnel function predicts a null backscattering for a perfectly smooth surface we can modify it to account for surface roughness and hence obtain a non zero backscattered power the modification to the fresnel function is to allow for the finite size of rough surface element of a facet by employing the physical optics current approximation involving evaluation of an integral over the surface to account for the finite extent of the scatter as well as bsa convention the modified fresnel equations for an infinite scatter plan can be derive in this case the modified fresnel model is employed to describe the surface backscattering and solve the problem of low soil moisture inversion rate when only use the bragg scattering model as described in cloude 2010 the scattering matrix derived from the modified fresnel model is given by 14 s s hh 0 0 s vv 2 π l λ cos θ sin k l sin θ kl sin θ fresne l hh 0 0 fresne l vv 15 fresne l hh cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l 16 fresne l vv ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l ε soil cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l where fresnelhh and fresnelvv denote the horizontal and vertical fresnel scattering coefficients and l is the dimension of the scattering facet similar to the x bragg model the modified fresnel coefficient β fresnel is also a function of the soil dielectric constant and the local incidence angle as shown in eq 17 17 β fresnel fresne l hh f r e s n e l vv fresne l hh f r e s n e l vv sin 2 θ l cos θ l ε soil sin 2 θ l generally speaking in eq 17 the local incidence angle 0 θl 90 and the soil dielectric constant 2 εsoil 44 which makes β fresnel always positive fig 2 shows the relationship between the dielectric constant and the local incidence angle for the bragg coefficient and the modified fresnel coefficient we also suggest that the poa has a large impact on the backscattering coefficient and that de orientation processing is necessary for sme as a data preprocessing step especially in rugged terrain areas in fig 3 before the two component decomposition we employ the h α decomposition method to characterize the backscattering mechanism in terms of two parameters i e the entropy h and polarization angle α cloude and pottier 1997 in terms of bare soil areas most of their pixels are dominated by surface scattering mechanism with the development of vegetation phenological state the volume scattering will be mixed with the surface scattering in this case it is difficult to distinguish the surface scattering dominated area one of the possible solutions is to determine the h and α threshold empirically by using the statistical analysis of priori knowledge huang et al 2016a analyzed the h and α distribution of wheat corn and soybean fields in different phenological phases and found that h from 0 55 to 0 6 can be used to distinguish the scattering in bare soil and in vegetated fields according to their normal distribution curves considering the influence of surface roughness factor the h will increase to 0 6 when the scattering of bare soils is dominated by a surface cover their experimental results also show that when 0 6 is determined as the h threshold most of the bare soil fields can be distinguished however the bare soils with withered vegetation residues may be misclassified as a field mixed with surface and volume scattering when only use the h criteria so the α threshold is also explored by their normal distribution curves of different crop land finally the α threshold of less than 40 is employed as the threshold to distinguish the surface scattering from the volume scattering therefore in this study we directly refer the previous findings and determine h 0 6 α 40 as the threshold to separate the dominant surface scattering from bare soil for a surface scattering dominant area the x bragg model is used to calculate the bragg coefficient β and soil dielectric constant εsoil we then convert εsoil to volumetric soil moisture by a commonly used inversion formula topp et al 1980 the polynomial expression is shown in eq 18 18 mv 5 3 2 92 ε soil 0 055 ε soil 2 0 0004 ε soil 3 for other areas with a mixed volume and surface scattering mechanism the two component decomposition method is used to separate surface scattering from volume scattering and to calculate parameters fs and β the x bragg real t 12 0 or modified fresnel real t 12 0 model is then used to construct the relationship between εsoil and β finally eq 18 is used to convert εsoil to volumetric soil moisture fig 3 depicts the processing scheme of retrieving soil moisture content by the use of the proposed two component polarimetric decomposition model 3 experiments in sar data inversion 3 1 study areas and fully polarimetric sar data the two study areas selected for the experimentation analysis and validation are located in ordos inner mongolia of china and southern oklahoma of the usa respectively the ordos study area features mostly plains and is mainly covered with grassland and bare soil so there was no need to consider the influence of mountains urban areas and forest areas the soil moisture experiment 2003 smex03 was conducted between 2 july 2003 and 17 july 2003 in the little washita watershed of southern oklahoma jackson et al 2009 parameters measured by smex03 included bulk density land cover type volumetric soil moisture and surface soil temperature jackson and cosh 2006 nasa s airborne synthetic aperture radar airsar instrument also mapped the southern oklahoma area on six different days the 3rd 5th 7th 10th and 12th of july 2003 in this study gaofen 3 and airsar fully polarimetric sar data from ordos and southern oklahoma were used in the soil moisture retrieval experiments see table 1 3 1 1 the ordos gaofen 3 data for the ordos study area gaofen 3 data are available for 18 july 2017 gaofen 3 which was launched on 10 august 2016 is china s first multi polarization sar imaging satellite before sme radiometric correction geometric correction and refined lee speckle filtering 7 7 window were conducted as the data preprocessing fig 4 a shows the pauli rgb image composed of gaofen 3 fully polarimetric data it can be seen from figs 4 b and 5 a that in most of this study area the value of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is less than 0 2 and the most of the terrain slope angle is larger than 0 in some parts of research area the slope value is larger than 10 besides the histogram graph in fig 5 b can also illustrate the distribution of terrain slope in the whole research area for that matter we can conclude that there is sparse vegetation cover and a low terrain slope in the ordos study area according to the h α plane as shown in fig 6 the entropy of most of the study area is less than 0 6 and the polarization alpha angle is less than 40 based on the h α threshold of bare soil in huang et al 2016a h 0 6 α 40 was used to distinguish the predominant surface scattering areas and bare soil the smap mission was one of the first earth observation satellites developed by nasa to make global measurements of the soil moisture present at the earth s land surface the product contains calibrated and geolocated brightness temperature data soil moisture data sigma naught data etc the smap enhanced passive soil moisture products have been reported to have a greater reliability than the passive and active passive products chen et al 2018 therefore in this paper the spl3smp e data product at a medium scale of 9 km is used to validate the inversion accuracy and analyze the potential of gaofen 3 data in sme in the absence of ground observational data the global volumetric soil moisture map for 18 july 2017 synchronous with the gaofen 3 data is shown in fig 7 3 1 2 the southern oklahoma airsar data for the southern oklahoma study area we employed the smex03 measurement campaign data acquired on 12 july 2003 in the little washita basin the framework of the smex03 measurement campaign involved collecting the airsar data of the research area together with ground soil moisture data and ancillary data made up of site photographs cosh et al 2013 the airsar instrument mounted on a dc 8 aircraft was operated and managed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory jpl in airsar s polsar mode the radar instrument collects backscattering coefficients at full polarization hh vv hv in the c l and p band frequencies apart from the sar data the ground observation and site photos were used to verify the retrieval accuracy from the polsar data fig 8 shows the southern oklahoma study area with the airsar data coverage area marked by the red rectangle land use classification data are also available for this area the different land cover types including bare soil pasture grass winter wheat sorghum and corn were recorded together with ground site soil moisture measurements 3 2 two component decomposition assuming that the dihedral component can be neglected in the case of no trees or other high plants we propose a two component polarimetric decomposition method for sme before the two component decomposition the ratios of the surface dihedral and volume scattering components obtained by the freeman durden decomposition model were analyzed freeman durden three component decomposition without de orientation processing was applied to the gaofen 3 data from the ordos area fig 9 a represents the ratios of the surface dihedral and volume scattering mechanisms of the whole study area in the results the predominantly surface scattering reaches 79 8 the volume scattering holds a subordinate position of between 15 and 37 4 while the dihedral scattering component is the lowest with less than 11 4 this is in accordance with our hypothesis that there are few dihedral scattering components in the ordos area which does not feature high plants or tree cover the two component decomposition with de orientation processing was also implemented on the whole ordos area of the gaofen 3 image and the ratios of the surface and volume scattering components are shown in fig 9 b comparing the results of the two component decomposition and the freeman durden three component decomposition the surface scattering component is increased by 11 with the de orientation processing while the volume component is decreased by 15 for the two component decomposition the predominantly surface scattering reaches up to 91 however the volume scattering component reduces to about 15 the conclusion can be drawn that poa compensation can maximize the co polarization component and reduce the cross polarization component which is induced by the topography undulation accordingly de orientation processing is necessary for scattering mechanism decomposition to reduce the influence of topography and correct the backscattering of the different features to a normal poa 3 3 soil moisture estimation in the second step the computed entropy h and polarization angle α are used to separate single surface scattering areas from mixed surface and volume scattering mechanism areas for single surface scattering areas the x bragg model is used to calculate the soil dielectric constant whereas for areas with a mixed surface and volume scattering mechanism the modified fresnel model or the x bragg model is used to calculate the soil dielectric constant according to the real part of t 12 the proposed two component decomposition and hybrid x bragg fresnel scattering model inversion algorithm were applied to the gaofen 3 data of the ordos area and the airsar c and l band for southern oklahoma 3 3 1 gaofen 3 inversion results for the ordos area gaofen 3 fully polarimetric sar data in strip map mode were used for the sme experiment and the results were compared with the spl3smp e soil moisture product data as the swath width of the gaofen 3 strip map mode data is 25 km 25 km and the spatial resolution of the spl3smp e data is 9 km only four pixels of the spl3smp e data cover the entire gaofen 3 data therefore the four pixels of the spl3smp e data in the research area were taken as the reference measurements in the accuracy evaluation fig 10 shows the volumetric soil moisture content retrieval results for two different areas in ordos the average of the volumetric soil moisture retrieval results is 6 86 by counting the effective number of pixels with an inversion result about 24 400 of the 40 000 pixels have an inversion value between 0 32 ε soil 2 and 50 77 ε soil 44 and the inversion rate reaches 61 the validation with the spl3smp e soil moisture product data reveals a promising accuracy of 8 66 in root mean square error rmse see fig 11 a over the whole ordos study area the volumetric soil moisture of spl3smp e is 2 which is 4 86 lower than the result of the inversion using gaofen 3 data from the boxplot of the gaofen 3 sme result see fig 11 b the volumetric soil moisture values of most pixels are larger than 9 46 and some other pixels are larger than 19 37 this is because the spl3smp e product with a coarse special resolution obtains the average backscatter information over a wide range while the gaofen 3 data with a fine resolution reflect more detailed information of the imaging area therefore in the same area the soil moisture content retrieval from the fine resolution data is greatly influenced by terrain surface features soil water content etc 3 3 2 airsar inversion results in order to study the performance of the proposed method in different bands airsar c and l band data of southern oklahoma together with in situ measurements were used in this experiment there are two airsar images obtained on 12 july 2003 for this area in fig 12 a the red rectangle area corresponds to the airsar cm6709 image and the blue rectangle area corresponds to the airsar cm6710 image their c band pauli rgb images are shown in fig 12 b and c respectively the locations of the regional ground soil moisture observation sites in southern oklahoma are marked on the google earth image twenty one in situ observation sites were selected for the inversion accuracy verification and 400 20 20 pixels around each site were used to count the average and variance fortunately site photos are available to analyze the performance of the soil moisture inversion with different land cover types the sme results from the airsar c and l band data are shown in fig 14 a and b comparing the average of the inversion results for the 21 sites denoted by the red dotted line with the in situ soil moisture measurements denoted by the cyan dotted line the variation trends are similar for both the airsar c and l band data the inversion results for the airsar full polarization data can reflect the change of soil water content in different regions to a certain extent compared with the in situ measurements the airsar c and l band inversion results reveal promising accuracies of 8 57 and 8 95 respectively according to the site photos of the different sites os27 os29 os40 os41 and os42 are bare soil areas and the error of the inversion results is low in both the c and l band data in contrast in the grassland areas such as os28 os30 35 os37 os38 os43 os44 os46 os50 and os52 the inversion results for the c and l band data show different levels of underestimation and the denser the grass growth the more serious the underestimation specifically the inversion of the volumetric soil moisture is 26 lower than the in situ observation for the os33 site which has the densest vegetation coverage comparing the c and l band data inversion results it can be seen from fig 14 that the variance of the c band data inversion results is larger than that of the l band data this is due to the fact that the short wavelength is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the region and the l band data with strong penetrability is sensitive to the soil water content in addition from the site photos of the smex03 ancillary data the os27 os29 os40 and os42 sites are located on bare soil areas the os31 os35 os43 os44 os37 and os38 sites feature relatively sparse grassland and the os28 os30 os32 os33 os34 os46 os50 and os52 sites feature much denser and higher grass than the other sites see fig 13 therefore the in situ sites can be divided into three categories bare soil sparse grassland and dense grassland as mentioned previously the inversion results for the c and l band data have different degrees of underestimation thus we also analyzed the sme results for the airsar c and l band data with different vegetation densities fig 15 a c show the sme results for the airsar c and l band data in the bare soil sparse grassland and dense grassland areas together with the in situ measurements table 2 lists the rmse maximum error and minimum error of the statistical information for the three areas it can be clearly seen that in the bare soil areas the retrieval results for the airsar c and l band data are similar to the in situ measurements the rmse is 4 44 for the airsar c band data and 2 88 for the l band data both the maximum and minimum error for the airsar l band data are smaller than for the airsar c band data in the sparse grassland areas the rmse for the airsar c and l band data increases to 7 57 and 8 16 respectively and the maximum and minimum error for the airsar l band data are still smaller than for the airsar c band data more importantly four out of the six sites show the problem of underestimation however the dense grassland areas have nearly double the rmse of the sparse grassland areas and there are more points with underestimated soil moisture contents in several sites the underestimation is more than 28 for the airsar c band data and 25 for the l band data in the dense grassland areas overall it can be concluded that the sme method proposed in this paper is effective for airsar fully polarimetric data and its performance in the l band is better than in the c band 4 discussion and conclusion the model based polarimetric decomposition method can separate the ground scattering component from the volume scattering of the underlying surface and can subsequently be used to extract the dielectric constant or soil moisture information in polsar scattering mechanism modeling a relatively smooth surface is modeled as the bragg scattering model and a rough surface is represented by the x bragg model when considering the depolarization and cross polarization induced by the surface roughness practically the x bragg model is not fully applicable to model surface scattering dominant areas due to the positive t 12 of the observation coherency matrix however the modified fresnel scattering model holding a positive bragg coefficient can conquer the disadvantage of the x bragg model if we assume that the dihedral component can be neglected in the case of no trees or other high plants a two component polarimetric decomposition method together with a hybrid x bragg fresnel scattering model is proposed for sme in comparison with three component four component and other multi parameterized decomposition methods the proposed model with fewer parameters is both effective and efficient the proposed method was assessed in a feasibility study using fully polarimetric gaofen 3 data from ordos inner mongolia and airsar c and l band data from southern oklahoma for the gaofen 3 data from the ordos area considering the influence of the poa a comparison with and without de orientation processing was implemented the results showed that de orientation processing is necessary for scattering mechanism decomposition and can reduce the influence of topography moreover it is effective in correcting the backscattering of different features to a normal polarization angle the results of the comparison with smap spl3smp e soil moisture products showed that the inversion rate reached 61 with a promising accuracy of 8 66 in rmse when using the gaofen 3 data of the ordos area to study the performance of the proposed method in different bands airsar c and l band data from southern oklahoma together with in situ measurements were used in our research the sme results revealed an accuracy of 8 57 for the c band data and 8 95 for the l band data the tendency of the inversion results was also consistent with the variation of the site observations furthermore using site photos the sme results with different vegetation coverages were also analyzed in the bare soil areas the rmse and the maximum and minimum error of the inversion results for the c and l band data were relatively small in the sparse vegetation areas the rmse and inversion error were larger than in the bare soil areas in the dense vegetation covered areas the soil moisture was underestimated and the sme results obtained using the c band data were more underestimated than for the l band data although the accuracies of the c band and l band retrieval results showed only small differences the variance and underestimation extent of the inversion results in the vegetation covered areas revealed that sme with l band data is more representative however sme based on the model based polarimetric decomposition method still has some limitations for the two component decomposition model the dihedral component is neglected with the assumption of no high plants or dense vegetation coverage whereas in the moderate vegetation covered areas this decomposition model is not applicable the results obtained in this study also suggest that de orientation processing can reduce the influence of topography and surface depolarization and is essential for sme in sar data preprocessing which is often neglected when using a model based polarimetric decomposition method in addition the surface dihedral and volume components are only approximate values and the accuracy of the sme result is greatly affected by the performance of the model based decomposition method unfortunately few approaches have been developed to quantitatively assess polarimetric decomposition algorithms an adaptive and accurate polarization decomposition model and the sme underestimation problem in dense vegetation areas will be the focus of our future research declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

6457,flood is a major natural hazard with extremely large impact on social ecological systems therefore developing reliable and efficient tools to identify areas vulnerable to potential flooding is vital for water managers engineers and decision makers moreover being able to accurately classify the level of hazard is a step forward towards more efficient flood hazard mapping this study presents a multi criteria index approach to classify potential flood hazards at the river basin scale the presented methodology was implemented in the mashhad plain basin in north east iran where flood has been a major issue in the last few decades in the present study seven factors selected based on their greater influence towards flooding were identified and extracted from the basic thematic layers to be used to generate a five class flood hazard index fhi map the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to develop a runoff coefficient map which was found to be the most influential factor a sensitivity analysis was performed and the results incorporated to generate a modified flood hazard index mfhi map the accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated against the well documented flood records in the last 42 years at the study area the results showed that for both fhi and mfhi maps more than 97 of historical flood events have occurred in moderate to very high flood hazard areas this demonstrates that incorporating hydrological model such as swat and multi criteria analysis introduces a robust methodology to generate comprehensive potential flood hazard maps moreover the proposed modified methodology can be used to identify high potential flood hazard zones and work towards more efficient flood management and mitigation strategies keywords river basin management flood hazard

al 2008 udin et al 2018 in a case study in the southern district of kuala krai kelantan malaysia investigated the region exposed to floods through questionnaires and regional data gathering and categorized the flood zones by using gis and it was established that parameters such as flood depth water level and the amount of rainfall had a major influence on the river flood hazard maps pattern kourgialas and karatzas 2016 estimated flood hazard in the mediterranean island of crete in greece selecting several contributing factors combined through gis environment to identify the areas most at risk of flooding under current and future climate conditions in order to test the reliability of the output flood hazard map historical flood records were used kazakis et al 2015b presented an alternative of a multi criteria index calculation process in order to provide an assessment of flood risk at a regional scale by using spatial analyses to test the method for accuracy the index calculation was subject to a sensitivity analysis including a range of weight values for different scenarios the analysis showed a good correlation between historical flood event records and the output index data proving the validity of the results chen et al 2015 in a case study in the bowen basin in queensland australia developed a methodology for decision makers to use a spatial multi criteria prototype for evaluation of flood risk at a regional scale using spatial gridded data including topography land cover and soils type information hydrology and climate data according to the indices derived from time series of observations and spatial modeling a regional flooding risk map was used to illustrate possible impacts of each of the selected criterion indices related to flood analysis towards the level of risk obtained the maximum flood extent perceivable by time series of rs imagery was used to verify derived map flood hazard mapping represents a great challenge due to the subjectivity of the flood related criterion indices assumed for a basin and the proper selection of the most sensitive parameters in a basin model the validation of a flood hazard map may become a challenging process given the fact that the data may not attempt to describe the likelihood of a single real event but rather an attempt to describe areas affected by all events of a certain magnitude especially in the case of global flood models at coarse resolutions sampson et al 2015 there is a high demand of emergency services and local institutions for risk based forecasts in terms of flood prone areas which require forcing the global flood models to include large and small scale analysis dottori et al 2016 the challenges due to lack of available data over ungagged rural areas and a rather simple tool to model all the flood related parameters in a basin may also represent an obstacle for an accurate and practical flood hazard assessment at a basin scale a combination of the techniques mentioned previously in the works cited was used in the present study but also including other factors to be considered such as runoff coefficient as a flood hazard criterion as well and gis computer based software tools to develop a rainfall runoff response based on high quality terrain data instead of assessing flood hazards through mcda applied directly to spatial parameters of the basin the present methodology utilizes different tools and techniques to identify rank and validate the flood hazard assessment of a basin unit not only using its geophysical parameters but also based on the simulation of its rainfall runoff response flood hazard assessment is highly regional specific due to spatial and temporal variability of the dominant drivers e g climate hydrology topography agronomy and soil a sensitivity analysis was also performed to reduce the level of uncertainty due to the subjectivity of parameters commonly selected using judgement by expertise as well as the uncertainty due to the availability and size of the sample data in general flooding is heavily influenced by naturally high rainfall variability in iran modarres and sarhadi 2009 tabari et al 2012 this paper describes the integrated application of gis and multiple criteria decision analysis mdca techniques coupled with soil and water assessment tool swat gassman et al 2010 over the study area denominated mashhad plain basin mpb located in mashhad iran in this modified approach in addition to the thematic layers runoff coefficient maps derived from swat model have also been included the present study aimed to 1 introduce a flood hazard index based on hydrological modeling to identify flood prone areas in data scarce regions 2 develop a sensitivity analysis of each of the criteria selected and compare fhi and mfhi map results with the last 42 years recorded events to validate the accuracy of the proposed approach 2 methods and materials the proposed methodology is an innovative combination of techniques and use of data to identify flood prone areas the proposed method includes some successive steps which are presented briefly in fig 1 2 1 study area the methodology was applied to mashhad plain basin mpb located in the northeast of iran with an area of 9 762 km2 between 35 59 n to 37 03 n latitude and 60 06 to 58 22 e longitude fig 2 the study area has semi arid to arid climate with an average monthly temperature ranging from 11 6 c to 26 7 c the annual average precipitation is 262 mm ranging from 178 to 381 mm irimo 2016 there are 28 rain gauge stations available with 24 years of well documented data 1991 2015 the average land slope is 16 2 and the mean elevation of the basin is 1487 m above sea level asl with minimum and maximum elevation of 856 and 3247 m asl respectively 2 2 available data the available data from various governmental organizations and other direct sources such as field surveys and rs data satellite images were acquired as listed in table 1 data processing and analysis is detailed in sections 2 3 2 5 2 3 flood hazard index fhi in this study seven criteria as listed in table 2 were identified to determine fhi the selection of these criteria was based on their proven effectiveness as documented in the literature review dottori et al 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 in addition to the selected criteria parameters used for the fhi calculation expressed in thematic layers a hydrological model swat was used through gis tools to estimate the necessary spatial hydrological parameters and to determine the site attributes associated with the selected criteria alaghmand et al 2012a alaghmand et al 2012b to delineate flood potential zones all the thematic layers along with their normalized weights were integrated using arcgis software using the weighted linear combination wlc total normalized weights of different features were overlaid in the integrated raster layer as follows 1 fhi x i w i r i w i e i w i s i w i d i w i ri i w i er i w i l i w i the definition of the criteria used in the eq 1 can be find in table 2 it should be noted that i represents value of the criterion for each pixel 2 3 1 decision support system to produce the flood hazard map analytic hierarchy process ahp was used over a variety of mcda techniques to generate a flood model of the area saaty and vargas 2001 ahp has been widely used in different mcda frameworks due to their simple implementation and interpretation as well as the consistency of the results despite redundancy of the data chen et al 2013b chen et al 2010 dewan et al 2007 wang et al 2011 proper weights were assigned for the selected thematic layers in a scale from 1 to 9 suggested by saaty 1980 once the weights of the criteria were selected a pair wise comparison of the assigned weights matrices was constructed using saaty s analytic hierarchy process subsequently these assigned weights were normalized by the eigenvector technique saaty and vargas 2001 and finally tested for consistency by computing a consistency ratio using eq 2 saaty 1980 2 consistency r a t i o cr λ max n n 1 where λmax principal eigenvector computed by the eigenvector technique n number of criteria or factors 2 4 data processing and analysis in order to provide a realistic model that can be applied in remote regions where data availability is limited the swat model was used kundu et al 2017 using the swat model allows the combination of diverse flood generation contributing factors and reduces the likelihood of bias involved in gis based multi criteria analysis although the index is based on the specific characteristics of mpb it can be modified and applied in other regions the spatial data was used as input for the swat computer software to determine the boundaries of basins and sub basin as well as other relevant hydrological information to obtain a hydrological response unit hru the combination of both spatial data and weather data supports the main basin model setup the model was then ready for the simulation run the initial validation process consisted in comparing the observed data with the rain runoff model results since not enough data was available for the site no calibration was performed due to the high level of uncertainty with a small sample which is addressed through the sensitivity analysis explained in section 2 5 subsequently a runoff coefficient was determined from a total of 43 sub basins within the study area kundu et al 2017 shi et al 2011 additionally the elevation and slope maps were generated in arcgis using the aster dem surface and 3d analyst tool to calculate the distance from a river or stream river polyline network layers and every pixel in the site a raster map representing the study area was prepared the distance from any point to a stream or river is calculated using euclidean relation chen et al 2015 kazakis et al 2015a in order to determine the rainfall intensity r factor the monthly rainfall data of 33 rain gauge stations were collected from iran metrological organization irimo for 24 years from 1991 to 2015 irimo 2016 the spatial distribution of these stations is shown in fig 2 then the rainfall intensity r map was developed based on the modified fournier index mfi using eq 3 morgan 2005 3 mfi i 1 12 p i 2 p where pi is the monthly average amount of precipitation for month i mm and p is the average annual precipitation mm mfi can be used to evaluate the land susceptibility to erosion by calculating the erodibility of land and soil losses and also in assessing land susceptibility to sliding aghiruş 2010 costea 2012 the rainfall erosivity classes was determined by the mfi methodology for the present study previous have made use of this index successfully to provide a summary assessment of the probability of rainfall with significant erosive effects costea 2012 having calculated the mfi for each station in order to obtain mfi for the whole study area the results were then interpolated using the kriging method in arcgis environment no topographic control to manage orographic rainfall effects was performed due to the high number of weather stations in the area and the homogeneous distribution of elevations from the boundary and towards the middle of the basin soil erodibility is a factor that exerts a great impact on flood flow hydrographs as well as the damages related to it such as large sediment yields at flash floods kourgialas and karatzas 2017b since the existing land use and erosion data for the site was merely descriptive to avoid data inconsistency rs methods satellite images and the traditional geological field mapping were applied to check their validity and update them before inserting in the model having prepared thematic layers selected weights from 1 to 10 to be assigned to each factor features the final map was further classified in different categories all the above mentioned key factors were finally normalized according to the ahp and eigenvector techniques and overlaid in eq 1 for all the factors except distance from drainage network and soil erosion and land use the jenk natural breaks chen et al 2013a jenks 1967 method was applied to establish different flood hazard levels establishing the number of classes for each factor based on engineering expertise and judgement jenks 1967 the jenks natural breaks classification method may also be used which consists in clustering data to determine the best arrangement of values into classes by minimizing the average deviation from the class mean while maximizing the deviation from the means of the other groups for each class jenks 1967 however it is recommended to evaluate any statistical approach with expertise judgement and any historic flood data available given that distributions may differ from reasonable values specifically with the slope angle and distant from a cell in the model to a reach or river within the basin demek 1972 2 5 validating results measuring the reliability of the criteria and robustness of the methodology is key to obtain realistic outputs therefore it is imperative to conduct validation procedures to test the results because of the high level of uncertainty of the field data gathered for the model due to the little amount and difficulty faced during the measurements required to obtain various parameters these inputs may sometimes lead to high variability of outputs lenhart et al 2002 therefore sensitivity analyses are required to reduce the uncertainty within the model kundu et al 2017 kushwaha and jain 2013 these analyses are suitable techniques to identify the implications of each parameter towards flood hazard analysis since sensitivity analysis reduces the subjective perspective of various criteria providing numerical results and help make decisions on weighting values assigned to each criterion the single parameter analysis was introduced by napolitano et al 1996 in a different case scenario to estimate the contamination vulnerability of aquifers in several studies kazakis et al 2015a another single parameter sensitivity analysis manages the over parameterization that usually occurs in hydrological modelling box and jenkins 1976 kundu et al 2017 sensitivity analyses were conducted for each factor and were implemented to calculate the basin s risk of flood napolitano and fabbri 1996 the sensitivity analysis method replaces the indexes used for the ahp with effective weights calculated using eq 4 4 w f i f w v 100 where w the effective weight of each factor fi the factor i features value fw the factor weight v the aggregated value of the applied index the sensitivity analysis was then applied to all seven factors assumed to generate the mfhi map from the sensitivity analysis the effective weights table 3 are then applied to obtain the modified flood hazard index mfhi the mfhi index assumes the same class rating and parameters as the fhi but using different weight values the difference between mfhi and fhi lies in the sensitivity analysis applied to assign the new weights thus improving the reliability of the results finally these results were validated against 42 years of recorded flooding data 3 results and discussion 3 1 flood hazard index fhi the identification of the flood prone areas was undertaken using an ahp based multi criteria decision analysis approach which consists of determining the weights of the selected thematic layers fig 3 the procedure of weighting thematic layers was set such that the consistency ratio for all of the obtained thematic layers was less than the limited threshold 0 10 to guarantee the consistency of the analysis saaty 1980 according to the range of values obtained for these criteria relative proper weights were assigned to different layers and their associated features the methodology followed in this paper is simple and focused on those variables that would exceed the drainage system capacity due to high peak flows the selected flood criteria factors as well as the corresponding weights assigned are shown in table 3 their selection was based on assumed values by experts in the field such as hydro geologists hydro agronomists environmentalists and literature review kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a sinha et al 2008 xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 the amount of water flow and its intensity depend on the characteristics of the basin especially its land use shape size and the weather conditions preceding to a rainfall occurrence season and antecedent moisture condition controlling the amount of rainfall that can permeate into the soil these parameters vary from one site to another thus it is very important to carefully select appropriate and realistic values 3 1 1 runoff coefficient based on the initial hypothesis and the sensitivity analysis output results of table 3 the most contributing factor towards high flood hazard levels is the runoff coefficient in order to calculate the runoff coefficient a 35 year average annual runoff 1982 2016 was used which shows the amount of water flowing through the sub basins higher values of runoff coefficient indicate higher runoff and areas of concentrated flow and consequently higher potential of flood to occur the runoff coefficient values vary in a range between 0 031 and 0 18 with the highest values occurring in the northern part of study area when rainfall occurs over a catchment and runoff begins to flow through it several factors determine the amount of rainfall that will flow downhill and how fast it will travel furthermore a percentage of the rain that falls on a basin is captured by vegetation and soil and the remainder is routed through waterways as flow alaghmand et al 2014 bathrellos et al 2017 rivers and streams are also key hydrological units to convey storm water the depth of water over the reach or stream will depend upon the geometry characteristics vegetation cover and the characteristics of obstacles found on their path 3 1 2 elevation and slope due to the fact that water flows in the direction of gravity runoff and infiltration will be heavily influenced by the topography of the basin slope has a direct impact on runoff generation and transformation from rainfall to runoff as the slope angle increses the runoff generation increases and is conveyed towards areas with milder slopes areas at lower elevations downstream with flat slopes are more likely to be flooded compared to areas in higher elevation with steep slopes the study area is surrounded by mountains and high elevation areas low elevation areas are present in the central and south east portions of the basin the slope map is shown in fig 3 on average about 51 of study area has slopes angles ranging around 0 5 05 and 22 between 5 06 and 12 3 these figures for slopes range from 20 9 to 31 9 ranged around 15 and 9 while only 3 of study area is located on slope angles greater than 32 the study area is surrounded by mountain ranges at the north and south of the basin containing steep slopes while the central part has in general a mild slope which results in higher vulnerability to flood events by simple observation low slope and low elevation areas have been assigned the highest hazard weight rating as prone areas table 3 slope and elevation are not the only most flood hazard important factors but they are considered reliable criteria because they are derived from the aster dem they can finely discriminate land units to delineate areas of different hazard levels for a detailed assessment these two indices accordingly received higher weights dem they can finely discriminate land units to delineate areas of different hazard levels for a detailed assessment these two indices accordingly received higher weights 3 1 3 distance from drainage network when modeling flood river overflows play a critical role in the initiation of a flood event when the volume of water exceeds the drainage capacity of the streams in the area the water depth will increase in low lying areas leading to waterlogging often the inundation emanates from riverbeds and expands to the surroundings the farther the location of a site to a river bed the lower the risk of flood therefore distance from the drainage network has been considered as the third most influential factor in the methodology the classes of this criterion have been defined according to historical floods that took place in different parts of the world it has been found that areas near the river network 500 m are considered highly flood prone areas whereas the effect of this parameter decreases in distances 2000 m fig 3 and table 3 3 1 4 rainfall intensity the monthly data used to estimate the rainfall intensity is not always applicable for flood hazard analysis however they were considered acceptable due to the number of meteorological stations around the mpb with a 24 year record which is considered a reasonable record length compared to other nearby sites it is relevant to mention that the present method requires a classification into five categories of hazard level and therefore does not require rather accurate rainfall data the rainfall intensity was determined by using the modified fournier index costea 2012 scrinzi et al 2006 in this study monthly rainfall data of 33 rain gage stations located on mpb were collected from the iran metrological organization irimo 2016 for the 24 year period 1991 2015 for the present study mfi ranges from 24 1 to 48 5 table 3 with the higher values located in the southern part and northcentral part of the study area fig 3 the modified fournier index mfi was used to classify the erosivity index at mpb resulting in low erosion hazard class 60 costea 2012 it was observed that the index calculated presented an intermittent trend varying yearly costea 2012 despite the variations between years the mean annual erosivity index classified the site into a low erosion hazard zone fig 3 since rainfall intensity is associated both with the frequency and the amount of precipitation it is crucial to consider both values ouma and tateishi 2014 tehrany et al 2014a 3 1 5 soil erosion the geological characteristics of the study area heavily influence the flood hazard index however they were not considered directly in the calculation because they can be incorporated into the swat model indirectly the presence of high erosivity of soils increases the risk of flooding particularly during heavy rainfall intensities therefore after rainfall intensity this factor was considered the next most relevant factor the original data related to the soil erosion of mpb was obtained from the national soil and water research institute of iran ministry of agriculture nswri 2016 soil erodibility can be obtained from average annual records of soil profile reaction to processes of detachment and transport of particles as a result of runoff and raindrop impact kourgialas and karatzas 2017a panagos et al 2012 the rate of detachment of soil particles is mainly a function of the cohesivity of the soil the ability to hold water controls the amount of runoff present in cohesive soils while less cohesive soils have less capacity and thus represent a higher flood risk in addition higher sediment yields present in the runoff or flow often occur on less cohesive soils which results in higher peak flow rates and subsequently causes more damage through flash floods cazemier et al 2001 chang et al 2010 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a ni et al 2003 table 2 3 1 6 land use the behavior of the relationship between rainfall and the resulting runoff and groundwater as well as the flow of debris depends heavily on the land use characteristics of the site nswri 2016 forests and dense vegetation covered areas increase the amount of water infiltration and abstractions while urban and pasture covered areas augment the amount of overland flow the land use is considered the least important factor in the present study since the effect of land use was intrinsically considered in swat model to calculate the average runoff coefficient different classes of land use and the associated percentage are presented in table 3 and the land use map is shown in fig 3 the map analysis shows that 25 of the basin area consists of dry farming 24 of semi dense pasture 23 of low density pasture and about 19 of irrigated agriculture and gardens table 3 in the urban and rural sector some intensive human practices may increase the risk of flood resulting in the likelihood of damage and losses these changes may be reflected through land use information and thus can be taken into account for the calculation of the hazard index 3 2 flood hazard mapping the final output flood hazard map was developed by combining the defined factors and now is illustrated in fig 4 the output classes were defined based on the linear combined data derived from information provided by the model described previously the fhi ranges around 0 101 0 356 and based on these results the study area was categorized into five potential hazard zones representing a very low fhi 0 101 0 187 b low fhi 0 188 0 220 c moderate fhi 0 221 0 249 d high fhi 0 250 0 279 and e very high fhi 0 280 0 356 flood potential hazard the very high and high flood hazard sites spread almost over the central part of study area specifically in the northwestern southeastern and center portions of the basin covering an area of 1180 12 and 2696 km2 28 of total area respectively moreover 2700 km2 28 of the mpb is subject to moderate flood hazard and are mainly distributed around the central portion of the study area subsequently a surface area of 2216 km2 23 and 893 km2 9 lie within low and very low flood hazard potential areas respectively the low and very low hazard potential areas comprise a major portion of the eastern and western part of the study area the results clearly show a significant percentage 40 of areas in mbp are under very high or high flood hazard the areas labelled in the map as high flood hazard are strongly influenced by the runoff coefficient courses according to the high weight given to this factor in the model the final map shows that the mpb has the highest flood hazard over an extended area as a consequence of the combination of lowlands with slopes under 5 table 4 shows the flood hazard areas and the corresponding percentage for each of land uses according to the land use maps overlaid on the flood hazard output map 43 30 and 18 of the very high flood hazard zones are located in dry farming irrigated cropland and pasture and low density pasture areas respectively likewise the majority of high flood hazard areas are dry farming irrigated cropland and pasture and low density pastures followed by semi dense pastures and urban areas whereas irrigated cropland and pasture and dry farming represent 31 and 29 of this zone very low flood prone areas appear mainly at woodland and shrub land and in high density pasture areas breaking it down into land use classification 43 24 of high density pasture 36 29 of semi dense pasture 38 11 of woodland and shrub land 36 41 of scatter forest and finally 30 85 of semi dense forests of mpb are under low flood hazard while 42 55 of scatter forests 48 45 of semi dense forest and 33 71 of low density pasture are under moderate flood hazard the map shows very high flood hazard areas located at extended urbanization areas such as mashhad city the forests and high density pastures with the lowest percentages of very high and high flood hazard lie in the relatively safe region from which seven are found within the low hazard zone and three in the safe zone the fhi map revealed the importance of streams and tributaries in flood events fhi indicates that riverbeds in the lowland are even more prone to flood other similar studies have identified a direct relationship between agricultural land management and the behavior or flooding at the sub basin level 10 km2 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a o connell et al 2007 land use management heavily influences the impact of flood peak delay in intermediate and lower elevation areas especially during moderate rainfall events these measures are key to alleviate flooding by retaining and capturing rainfall during a storm and subsequently reducing the time of flood warnings salazar et al 2009 at mpb there is a large number of crops located primarily at the intermediate and low elevation areas these locations represent an interesting target for the implementation of appropriate land use practices and policies at the national scale to assess flooding such as the enhancement of the infiltration capacity through changes in vegetation cover and the runoff flow connectivity through the system it is recommended to accompany these types of preventive measures with a flood warning system at the river basin scale weather stations may be used to provide real time hydro meteorological information to provide early flood warnings kourgialas and karatzas 2011 salazar et al 2009 the information would also provide a measurement of the threat and the procedures to be applied accordingly by government agencies these findings provide insight towards flow mitigation plan and preventive action as well as a guide to adaptation approaches for agricultural and urban land use practices to minimize flood damage caused by human impact on the landscape and climate change blackwell et al 2006 morris et al 2010 thieken et al 2007 3 3 validation sensitivity analysis the weight factors and their associated feature classes thresholds of the model input have a crucial impact on the evaluation of the results since their determinations were significantly influenced by the interpretations of experts the selection of the flood hazard areas can be sensitive to changes in the decision weights associated with the criteria chang et al 2008 fernández and lutz 2010a based on the judgement of the experts to address this issue a sensitivity analysis was conducted where layer weights values were varied to evaluate the differences in the final result initially fhi considered the runoff coefficient as the dominant parameter elevation and slope angle respectively were considered the next significant parameter and followed by rainfall intensity soil erosion and land use surprisingly the sensitivity analysis concluded that the order of influence of these factors in the studied region is identical to the fhi this confirms the high accuracy of the proposed method however some calculated factors had slight differences table 5 the results of the sensitivity analysis also showed that the least sensitive factor was land use which was expected due to the weight factors assigned tehrany et al 2014b table 3 the mfhi map and fhi map are very similar however fhi underestimates the hazard level at the tributaries and reaches located at the center of the mbp whereas the sensitivity analysis conducted with the mfhi classified these areas as high flood hazard potential despite these differences as shown in fig 4a and b the sensitivity analysis results coincide with the fhi outcomes in general the analysis performed comparing both fhi and mfhi reveals relevant data regarding the weight of each parameter and how they affect the outcome of the flood hazard classification land use was assigned the smallest weight partly due to the almost uniform values across the region tehrany et al 2014b however the effect of land use is especially critical to urban areas where the population is high it is relevant to note that land use is also taken into account within the swat model and would heavily influence the runoff coefficient factor additionally the distance from drainage produced relatively significant impacts on the resultant hazard map which can be clearly observed particularly in the north west area in order to verify the final flood hazard map a review of historical flooding on mbp was introduced diakakis et al 2012 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 as shown in fig 4 the legend shows black dots representing the locations where historical floods occurred with green dots around each representing the number of occurrences of flood on each location the size of the green dots indicates the number of occurrences the bigger the circle the greater the number of occurrences it is noted in this diagram how most of the historic record flood points appear on the eastern portions of mpb in order to validate the final output flood hazard map in accordance to the historical flood records the extract by mask tool was applied using gis the cells of the flood hazard raster map were extracted exactly where the coordinates of the historical flood records were located through this method it is possible to identify which flood hazard index classification corresponded to each of the flood record points additionally the number of the flooded points that were located in each flood hazard area was determined based on the above procedure for the final flood hazard map almost all the recorded historical floods took place at the moderate to very high flood hazard areas with only 3 of them in areas of low flood hazard records of historical flood events support the indications of the mfhi analysis through the recurrent flooding of mpb as shown in table 6 mfhi analysis classifies as highly susceptible areas with a high number of recorded flood events in very high and high classes an additional indication of the accuracy of the proposed methodology according to table 6 for both fhi and mfhi maps more than 97 of historical flood events have occurred in moderate to very high and 27 at very high flood hazard locations which represent 12 of the total mpb total area the consistent matching between the flood hazard map and the historic flood point records not only occurs at low and semi mountainous locations but also at the mountain plateaus of mpb in fig 4 a comparison between fhi and mfhi in terms of number of events demonstrates that the fhi underestimates high and very high flood hazard areas several locations of historical records of flood with high levels of occurrence have been found to be assessed by the mfhi while fhi had underestimated with low classification indexes additionally the sensitivity analysis results revealed that very high and high flood hazard ranking zones represented 16 and 30 of the entire mbp while the fhi estimated 12 and 28 respectively it has also been observed that the fhi overestimated areas that were ranked as low and moderate flood hazard through the presented method 3 4 discussion of proposed methodology a detailed review by birkholz et al 2014 highlighted the necessity to reformulate the perception of flood hazard in research work to develop a more integrated and comprehensive approach of how risk perceptions influence the capacity resilience and vulnerability of individuals and communities against flood due to the research advances and increasing computational and data resources there is a large gap between large scale approaches and detailed reach scale hydraulic models sampson et al 2015 large scale flood modeling approaches have recently begun to include hydrological modeling components to provide more accurate flood mapping dottori et al 2016 the present study incorporates swat as an accurate approach to help forecast flood events using a rainfall runoff response that would enhance the behavior of the parameters of the basin as well as reducing the uncertainty of the parameters used for the mcda process to obtain the fhi index the main advantage of the fhi index is its ability to provide an overall assessment of flood hazard areas the limitations of the fhi methodology are usually related to the requirements of the raw data such as detailed topography accurate and complete historic hydrometeorological data as well as up to date soil land use information of the analyzed site even if all of these requirements are met it only reduces the level of uncertainty of the flood hazard assessment the proposed methodology on the other hand can be suitable where limited data is available and the framework can be used to relatively prioritize vulnerable areas the validation of the modeling results with historical flood events demonstrated the accuracy of the final results and confirmed that using hydrological modeling swat is reliable flexible and produces highly accurate results furthermore in this study developed with swat model requires minimum data that is available globally it provides a comprehensive method to facilitate decision making and offers a time efficient and cost effective method for the identification of flood prone sites the intent of the present research study is to provide a methodology that relies non only on static index based methodologies but also incorporating an framework integrating hydrological models such as swat with mdca using gis tools if the proposed mfhi methodology was to be used in other different regions other weight values for each criterion factor would need to be assumed depending on the geophysical characteristics of the target site which shows the main drawback of the method relying heavily on the subjectivity of the weight values of each criterion however the single parameter sensitivity analysis proved to be a useful to evaluate the weights assumed as table 6 shows the proposed mfhi has proven to acquire similar results compared to fhi the differences may lie in the fact that swat incorporates many of the contributing parameters in the model to obtain more accurate or realistic results previous examples of fhi work suggest different results in the ranking of the factors assumed as well as different factors that were not included in the present study chen et al 2015 fernández and lutz 2010b papaioannou et al 2015 tehrany et al 2013 tehrany et al 2014b xiao et al 2017 for instance kourgialas and karatzas 2016 and kazakis et al 2015b suggested flow accumulation had a major contribution towards hazard mapping for the present work it was preliminarily included but it had proven to develop a small sensitivity towards the flood hazard results and thus it was removed from the analysis soil water retention was a major factor included by chen et al 2015 modeled using the scs cn number method for runoff calculation which requires soil cover and land used altogether the advantage of using swat includes all these factors except that they interact independently in the rainfall runoff model providing more sensitivity to each of these factors and not relying on a single curve number parameter distance to rivers and streams as well as water table levels were important factors assumed for hazard assessment in the case of fernández and lutz 2010b since the data available for mpb had shown a decline in water table levels this criterion was also removed from the analysis nswri 2016 as shown in the previous similar works cited utilizing fhi methodology the weight of parameter assumed for any basin will vary from site mcda problems are based on the specific characteristics of case study but can be modified and applied in other regions accordingly the present study considers the runoff coefficient as a factor for first time modeled more accurately with swat and has demonstrated its relevance towards flood hazard mapping previous work using mcda have shown that land use may represent an important criterion kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2017b although land use in our case presented little influence towards determining hazard levels because of the low weight values assumed it may be misleading due to the fact that it may indirectly affect other parameters in our case the runoff coefficient the present study provides a baseline for future work to develop sensitivity analysis not only for the criteria factors assumed for the site but also the influence of the same factors towards the hydrologic model through the implementation of these models a further step for future research work involves the estimation of peak flows corresponding to different exceedance probabilities at locations where the output map has identified high and very high flood hazard levels the output information may provide local authorities and land development managers and stakeholders and farmers with a comprehensive tool to assess flooding in areas under risk of flood accordingly it is recommended other future studies may use different weight criteria assumption methods to modify the proposed methodology the applications of the fhi can be used to assess flood hazards in other locations coupled with validation methods such as the sensitivity analysis this methodology is able to provide reliable and accurate results the present mfhi approach may prove helpful to evaluate global models at a large scale to reduce the over or under estimation of the flood hazards using a rather simple gis based tool which requires a relatively less expensive method to be applied even if the available data is scarce 4 conclusion the purpose of the present study is to propose a methodology for flood hazard assessment that is transferable to different locations around the globe the proposed model can be used for basin management and for the development of flood prevention and mitigation plans that may lead to a reduction of flood impact or damage caused by intensive precipitation the method spatially analyzes seven parameters combining the information in the flood hazard index fhi the parameters are runoff coefficient r elevation e slope s distance from the drainage network d rainfall intensity ri soil erosion se and land use l the weight of each parameter was calculated by using the analytic hierarchy process that consists of a sophisticated statistical analysis the highest weight was assigned to the runoff coefficient and the lowest to land use flood hazard was classified in five categories ranging from very high to very low the output values were validated by overlaying historical flood in the basin as well as the development of a statistical sensitivity analysis on the values assigned to the different criteria to validate the accuracy and consistency of the developed methodology the proposed modified method is named mfhi the comparison of the flood hazard maps obtained with the fhi and mfhi indices indicate that both indices are reliable however it is necessary to use the historical flood records to test the consistency of the results in high and very high flood hazard areas according to the results 9 of the total area of study area is subject to very low flood hazard while about 40 is under very high or high flood hazard since flood events represent a major concern in study area the presented methodology could provide insight for the identification of potential flood hazard areas and for improved and innovative water and risk management practices additionally this study discussed and proposed a global flood hazard investigation framework for identifying very high flood risk areas it is hoped that the developed methodology will benefit water management professionals engaged in climate change and natural disaster management planning scenarios across the globe by providing sustainable development and resilience to extreme weather events conflict of interest no interests to

6457,flood is a major natural hazard with extremely large impact on social ecological systems therefore developing reliable and efficient tools to identify areas vulnerable to potential flooding is vital for water managers engineers and decision makers moreover being able to accurately classify the level of hazard is a step forward towards more efficient flood hazard mapping this study presents a multi criteria index approach to classify potential flood hazards at the river basin scale the presented methodology was implemented in the mashhad plain basin in north east iran where flood has been a major issue in the last few decades in the present study seven factors selected based on their greater influence towards flooding were identified and extracted from the basic thematic layers to be used to generate a five class flood hazard index fhi map the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to develop a runoff coefficient map which was found to be the most influential factor a sensitivity analysis was performed and the results incorporated to generate a modified flood hazard index mfhi map the accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated against the well documented flood records in the last 42 years at the study area the results showed that for both fhi and mfhi maps more than 97 of historical flood events have occurred in moderate to very high flood hazard areas this demonstrates that incorporating hydrological model such as swat and multi criteria analysis introduces a robust methodology to generate comprehensive potential flood hazard maps moreover the proposed modified methodology can be used to identify high potential flood hazard zones and work towards more efficient flood management and mitigation strategies keywords river basin management flood hazard mapping swat analytical hierarchy process gis application 1 introduction natural disasters caused by hydro meteorological events including droughts floods storms wildfires and temperature extremes are by far the most frequent in the world and result in the major cause of loss representing a significant portion of the worldwide disaster loss burden cred 2009 kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kowalzig 2008 luber and lemery 2015 mcmichael 2003 from 1900 to 2013 floods and storms associated with high precipitation events accounted for 87 of extreme weather disasters while landslides droughts extreme temperatures wildfires and heat accounted for the remainder cred 2009 accelerated climate change has been recorded in recent decades which is of particular concern as it may lead to more frequent and severe rainfall events around the world in the future particularly in arid and semi arid areas cred 2009 kain et al 2018 in order to assess this natural phenomenon it is required to quantify the consequences of flooding more comprehensively depending on the characteristics of the region including population density land use geophysical and climatic factors maggioni and massari 2018 over the past twenty years space agencies have agreed to reinforce flood monitoring from space due to the potential growth of remote sensing rs application techniques to monitor floods and its use to address limitations of field data availability grimaldi et al 2016 grimaldi et al 2018 khorrami et al 2019 li et al 2018 li et al 2016 wright et al 2018 many studies have been conducted to identify the main factors contributing to the severity of floods alaghmand et al 2010 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a udin et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 a variety of methods can be used to incorporate different criteria into an integrated tool for both flood prediction and mitigation depending on the availability of data anand et al 2018 bradford and denich 2007 dao et al 2009 jajarmizadeh et al 2016 morris et al 2010 neale and weir 2015 tehrany et al 2013 in this regard the multi criteria decision analysis mcda technique has been widely used for integrating identifying or rating controlling factors particularly in natural hazard and suitability analysis al shabeeb 2016 chowdhury et al 2010 jozaghi et al 2018 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a nefeslioglu et al 2013 sinha et al 2008 udin et al 2018 in a case study in the southern district of kuala krai kelantan malaysia investigated the region exposed to floods through questionnaires and regional data gathering and categorized the flood zones by using gis and it was established that parameters such as flood depth water level and the amount of rainfall had a major influence on the river flood hazard maps pattern kourgialas and karatzas 2016 estimated flood hazard in the mediterranean island of crete in greece selecting several contributing factors combined through gis environment to identify the areas most at risk of flooding under current and future climate conditions in order to test the reliability of the output flood hazard map historical flood records were used kazakis et al 2015b presented an alternative of a multi criteria index calculation process in order to provide an assessment of flood risk at a regional scale by using spatial analyses to test the method for accuracy the index calculation was subject to a sensitivity analysis including a range of weight values for different scenarios the analysis showed a good correlation between historical flood event records and the output index data proving the validity of the results chen et al 2015 in a case study in the bowen basin in queensland australia developed a methodology for decision makers to use a spatial multi criteria prototype for evaluation of flood risk at a regional scale using spatial gridded data including topography land cover and soils type information hydrology and climate data according to the indices derived from time series of observations and spatial modeling a regional flooding risk map was used to illustrate possible impacts of each of the selected criterion indices related to flood analysis towards the level of risk obtained the maximum flood extent perceivable by time series of rs imagery was used to verify derived map flood hazard mapping represents a great challenge due to the subjectivity of the flood related criterion indices assumed for a basin and the proper selection of the most sensitive parameters in a basin model the validation of a flood hazard map may become a challenging process given the fact that the data may not attempt to describe the likelihood of a single real event but rather an attempt to describe areas affected by all events of a certain magnitude especially in the case of global flood models at coarse resolutions sampson et al 2015 there is a high demand of emergency services and local institutions for risk based forecasts in terms of flood prone areas which require forcing the global flood models to include large and small scale analysis dottori et al 2016 the challenges due to lack of available data over ungagged rural areas and a rather simple tool to model all the flood related parameters in a basin may also represent an obstacle for an accurate and practical flood hazard assessment at a basin scale a combination of the techniques mentioned previously in the works cited was used in the present study but also including other factors to be considered such as runoff coefficient as a flood hazard criterion as well and gis computer based software tools to develop a rainfall runoff response based on high quality terrain data instead of assessing flood hazards through mcda applied directly to spatial parameters of the basin the present methodology utilizes different tools and techniques to identify rank and validate the flood hazard assessment of a basin unit not only using its geophysical parameters but also based on the simulation of its rainfall runoff response flood hazard assessment is highly regional specific due to spatial and temporal variability of the dominant drivers e g climate hydrology topography agronomy and soil a sensitivity analysis was also performed to reduce the level of uncertainty due to the subjectivity of parameters commonly selected using judgement by expertise as well as the uncertainty due to the availability and size of the sample data in general flooding is heavily influenced by naturally high rainfall variability in iran modarres and sarhadi 2009 tabari et al 2012 this paper describes the integrated application of gis and multiple criteria decision analysis mdca techniques coupled with soil and water assessment tool swat gassman et al 2010 over the study area denominated mashhad plain basin mpb located in mashhad iran in this modified approach in addition to the thematic layers runoff coefficient maps derived from swat model have also been included the present study aimed to 1 introduce a flood hazard index based on hydrological modeling to identify flood prone areas in data scarce regions 2 develop a sensitivity analysis of each of the criteria selected and compare fhi and mfhi map results with the last 42 years recorded events to validate the accuracy of the proposed approach 2 methods and materials the proposed methodology is an innovative combination of techniques and use of data to identify flood prone areas the proposed method includes some successive steps which are presented briefly in fig 1 2 1 study area the methodology was applied to mashhad plain basin mpb located in the northeast of iran with an area of 9 762 km2 between 35 59 n to 37 03 n latitude and 60 06 to 58 22 e longitude fig 2 the study area has semi arid to arid climate with an average monthly temperature ranging from 11 6 c to 26 7 c the annual average precipitation is 262 mm ranging from 178 to 381 mm irimo 2016 there are 28 rain gauge stations available with 24 years of well documented data 1991 2015 the average land slope is 16 2 and the mean elevation of the basin is 1487 m above sea level asl with minimum and maximum elevation of 856 and 3247 m asl respectively 2 2 available data the available data from various governmental organizations and other direct sources such as field surveys and rs data satellite images were acquired as listed in table 1 data processing and analysis is detailed in sections 2 3 2 5 2 3 flood hazard index fhi in this study seven criteria as listed in table 2 were identified to determine fhi the selection of these criteria was based on their proven effectiveness as documented in the literature review dottori et al 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 in addition to the selected criteria parameters used for the fhi calculation expressed in thematic layers a hydrological model swat was used through gis tools to estimate the necessary spatial hydrological parameters and to determine the site attributes associated with the selected criteria alaghmand et al 2012a alaghmand et al 2012b to delineate flood potential zones all the thematic layers along with their normalized weights were integrated using arcgis software using the weighted linear combination wlc total normalized weights of different features were overlaid in the integrated raster layer as follows 1 fhi x i w i r i w i e i w i s i w i d i w i ri i w i er i w i l i w i the definition of the criteria used in the eq 1 can be find in table 2 it should be noted that i represents value of the criterion for each pixel 2 3 1 decision support system to produce the flood hazard map analytic hierarchy process ahp was used over a variety of mcda techniques to generate a flood model of the area saaty and vargas 2001 ahp has been widely used in different mcda frameworks due to their simple implementation and interpretation as well as the consistency of the results despite redundancy of the data chen et al 2013b chen et al 2010 dewan et al 2007 wang et al 2011 proper weights were assigned for the selected thematic layers in a scale from 1 to 9 suggested by saaty 1980 once the weights of the criteria were selected a pair wise comparison of the assigned weights matrices was constructed using saaty s analytic hierarchy process subsequently these assigned weights were normalized by the eigenvector technique saaty and vargas 2001 and finally tested for consistency by computing a consistency ratio using eq 2 saaty 1980 2 consistency r a t i o cr λ max n n 1 where λmax principal eigenvector computed by the eigenvector technique n number of criteria or factors 2 4 data processing and analysis in order to provide a realistic model that can be applied in remote regions where data availability is limited the swat model was used kundu et al 2017 using the swat model allows the combination of diverse flood generation contributing factors and reduces the likelihood of bias involved in gis based multi criteria analysis although the index is based on the specific characteristics of mpb it can be modified and applied in other regions the spatial data was used as input for the swat computer software to determine the boundaries of basins and sub basin as well as other relevant hydrological information to obtain a hydrological response unit hru the combination of both spatial data and weather data supports the main basin model setup the model was then ready for the simulation run the initial validation process consisted in comparing the observed data with the rain runoff model results since not enough data was available for the site no calibration was performed due to the high level of uncertainty with a small sample which is addressed through the sensitivity analysis explained in section 2 5 subsequently a runoff coefficient was determined from a total of 43 sub basins within the study area kundu et al 2017 shi et al 2011 additionally the elevation and slope maps were generated in arcgis using the aster dem surface and 3d analyst tool to calculate the distance from a river or stream river polyline network layers and every pixel in the site a raster map representing the study area was prepared the distance from any point to a stream or river is calculated using euclidean relation chen et al 2015 kazakis et al 2015a in order to determine the rainfall intensity r factor the monthly rainfall data of 33 rain gauge stations were collected from iran metrological organization irimo for 24 years from 1991 to 2015 irimo 2016 the spatial distribution of these stations is shown in fig 2 then the rainfall intensity r map was developed based on the modified fournier index mfi using eq 3 morgan 2005 3 mfi i 1 12 p i 2 p where pi is the monthly average amount of precipitation for month i mm and p is the average annual precipitation mm mfi can be used to evaluate the land susceptibility to erosion by calculating the erodibility of land and soil losses and also in assessing land susceptibility to sliding aghiruş 2010 costea 2012 the rainfall erosivity classes was determined by the mfi methodology for the present study previous have made use of this index successfully to provide a summary assessment of the probability of rainfall with significant erosive effects costea 2012 having calculated the mfi for each station in order to obtain mfi for the whole study area the results were then interpolated using the kriging method in arcgis environment no topographic control to manage orographic rainfall effects was performed due to the high number of weather stations in the area and the homogeneous distribution of elevations from the boundary and towards the middle of the basin soil erodibility is a factor that exerts a great impact on flood flow hydrographs as well as the damages related to it such as large sediment yields at flash floods kourgialas and karatzas 2017b since the existing land use and erosion data for the site was merely descriptive to avoid data inconsistency rs methods satellite images and the traditional geological field mapping were applied to check their validity and update them before inserting in the model having prepared thematic layers selected weights from 1 to 10 to be assigned to each factor features the final map was further classified in different categories all the above mentioned key factors were finally normalized according to the ahp and eigenvector techniques and overlaid in eq 1 for all the factors except distance from drainage network and soil erosion and land use the jenk natural breaks chen et al 2013a jenks 1967 method was applied to establish different flood hazard levels establishing the number of classes for each factor based on engineering expertise and judgement jenks 1967 the jenks natural breaks classification method may also be used which consists in clustering data to determine the best arrangement of values into classes by minimizing the average deviation from the class mean while maximizing the deviation from the means of the other groups for each class jenks 1967 however it is recommended to evaluate any statistical approach with expertise judgement and any historic flood data available given that distributions may differ from reasonable values specifically with the slope angle and distant from a cell in the model to a reach or river within the basin demek 1972 2 5 validating results measuring the reliability of the criteria and robustness of the methodology is key to obtain realistic outputs therefore it is imperative to conduct validation procedures to test the results because of the high level of uncertainty of the field data gathered for the model due to the little amount and difficulty faced during the measurements required to obtain various parameters these inputs may sometimes lead to high variability of outputs lenhart et al 2002 therefore sensitivity analyses are required to reduce the uncertainty within the model kundu et al 2017 kushwaha and jain 2013 these analyses are suitable techniques to identify the implications of each parameter towards flood hazard analysis since sensitivity analysis reduces the subjective perspective of various criteria providing numerical results and help make decisions on weighting values assigned to each criterion the single parameter analysis was introduced by napolitano et al 1996 in a different case scenario to estimate the contamination vulnerability of aquifers in several studies kazakis et al 2015a another single parameter sensitivity analysis manages the over parameterization that usually occurs in hydrological modelling box and jenkins 1976 kundu et al 2017 sensitivity analyses were conducted for each factor and were implemented to calculate the basin s risk of flood napolitano and fabbri 1996 the sensitivity analysis method replaces the indexes used for the ahp with effective weights calculated using eq 4 4 w f i f w v 100 where w the effective weight of each factor fi the factor i features value fw the factor weight v the aggregated value of the applied index the sensitivity analysis was then applied to all seven factors assumed to generate the mfhi map from the sensitivity analysis the effective weights table 3 are then applied to obtain the modified flood hazard index mfhi the mfhi index assumes the same class rating and parameters as the fhi but using different weight values the difference between mfhi and fhi lies in the sensitivity analysis applied to assign the new weights thus improving the reliability of the results finally these results were validated against 42 years of recorded flooding data 3 results and discussion 3 1 flood hazard index fhi the identification of the flood prone areas was undertaken using an ahp based multi criteria decision analysis approach which consists of determining the weights of the selected thematic layers fig 3 the procedure of weighting thematic layers was set such that the consistency ratio for all of the obtained thematic layers was less than the limited threshold 0 10 to guarantee the consistency of the analysis saaty 1980 according to the range of values obtained for these criteria relative proper weights were assigned to different layers and their associated features the methodology followed in this paper is simple and focused on those variables that would exceed the drainage system capacity due to high peak flows the selected flood criteria factors as well as the corresponding weights assigned are shown in table 3 their selection was based on assumed values by experts in the field such as hydro geologists hydro agronomists environmentalists and literature review kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a sinha et al 2008 xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 the amount of water flow and its intensity depend on the characteristics of the basin especially its land use shape size and the weather conditions preceding to a rainfall occurrence season and antecedent moisture condition controlling the amount of rainfall that can permeate into the soil these parameters vary from one site to another thus it is very important to carefully select appropriate and realistic values 3 1 1 runoff coefficient based on the initial hypothesis and the sensitivity analysis output results of table 3 the most contributing factor towards high flood hazard levels is the runoff coefficient in order to calculate the runoff coefficient a 35 year average annual runoff 1982 2016 was used which shows the amount of water flowing through the sub basins higher values of runoff coefficient indicate higher runoff and areas of concentrated flow and consequently higher potential of flood to occur the runoff coefficient values vary in a range between 0 031 and 0 18 with the highest values occurring in the northern part of study area when rainfall occurs over a catchment and runoff begins to flow through it several factors determine the amount of rainfall that will flow downhill and how fast it will travel furthermore a percentage of the rain that falls on a basin is captured by vegetation and soil and the remainder is routed through waterways as flow alaghmand et al 2014 bathrellos et al 2017 rivers and streams are also key hydrological units to convey storm water the depth of water over the reach or stream will depend upon the geometry characteristics vegetation cover and the characteristics of obstacles found on their path 3 1 2 elevation and slope due to the fact that water flows in the direction of gravity runoff and infiltration will be heavily influenced by the topography of the basin slope has a direct impact on runoff generation and transformation from rainfall to runoff as the slope angle increses the runoff generation increases and is conveyed towards areas with milder slopes areas at lower elevations downstream with flat slopes are more likely to be flooded compared to areas in higher elevation with steep slopes the study area is surrounded by mountains and high elevation areas low elevation areas are present in the central and south east portions of the basin the slope map is shown in fig 3 on average about 51 of study area has slopes angles ranging around 0 5 05 and 22 between 5 06 and 12 3 these figures for slopes range from 20 9 to 31 9 ranged around 15 and 9 while only 3 of study area is located on slope angles greater than 32 the study area is surrounded by mountain ranges at the north and south of the basin containing steep slopes while the central part has in general a mild slope which results in higher vulnerability to flood events by simple observation low slope and low elevation areas have been assigned the highest hazard weight rating as prone areas table 3 slope and elevation are not the only most flood hazard important factors but they are considered reliable criteria because they are derived from the aster dem they can finely discriminate land units to delineate areas of different hazard levels for a detailed assessment these two indices accordingly received higher weights dem they can finely discriminate land units to delineate areas of different hazard levels for a detailed assessment these two indices accordingly received higher weights 3 1 3 distance from drainage network when modeling flood river overflows play a critical role in the initiation of a flood event when the volume of water exceeds the drainage capacity of the streams in the area the water depth will increase in low lying areas leading to waterlogging often the inundation emanates from riverbeds and expands to the surroundings the farther the location of a site to a river bed the lower the risk of flood therefore distance from the drainage network has been considered as the third most influential factor in the methodology the classes of this criterion have been defined according to historical floods that took place in different parts of the world it has been found that areas near the river network 500 m are considered highly flood prone areas whereas the effect of this parameter decreases in distances 2000 m fig 3 and table 3 3 1 4 rainfall intensity the monthly data used to estimate the rainfall intensity is not always applicable for flood hazard analysis however they were considered acceptable due to the number of meteorological stations around the mpb with a 24 year record which is considered a reasonable record length compared to other nearby sites it is relevant to mention that the present method requires a classification into five categories of hazard level and therefore does not require rather accurate rainfall data the rainfall intensity was determined by using the modified fournier index costea 2012 scrinzi et al 2006 in this study monthly rainfall data of 33 rain gage stations located on mpb were collected from the iran metrological organization irimo 2016 for the 24 year period 1991 2015 for the present study mfi ranges from 24 1 to 48 5 table 3 with the higher values located in the southern part and northcentral part of the study area fig 3 the modified fournier index mfi was used to classify the erosivity index at mpb resulting in low erosion hazard class 60 costea 2012 it was observed that the index calculated presented an intermittent trend varying yearly costea 2012 despite the variations between years the mean annual erosivity index classified the site into a low erosion hazard zone fig 3 since rainfall intensity is associated both with the frequency and the amount of precipitation it is crucial to consider both values ouma and tateishi 2014 tehrany et al 2014a 3 1 5 soil erosion the geological characteristics of the study area heavily influence the flood hazard index however they were not considered directly in the calculation because they can be incorporated into the swat model indirectly the presence of high erosivity of soils increases the risk of flooding particularly during heavy rainfall intensities therefore after rainfall intensity this factor was considered the next most relevant factor the original data related to the soil erosion of mpb was obtained from the national soil and water research institute of iran ministry of agriculture nswri 2016 soil erodibility can be obtained from average annual records of soil profile reaction to processes of detachment and transport of particles as a result of runoff and raindrop impact kourgialas and karatzas 2017a panagos et al 2012 the rate of detachment of soil particles is mainly a function of the cohesivity of the soil the ability to hold water controls the amount of runoff present in cohesive soils while less cohesive soils have less capacity and thus represent a higher flood risk in addition higher sediment yields present in the runoff or flow often occur on less cohesive soils which results in higher peak flow rates and subsequently causes more damage through flash floods cazemier et al 2001 chang et al 2010 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a ni et al 2003 table 2 3 1 6 land use the behavior of the relationship between rainfall and the resulting runoff and groundwater as well as the flow of debris depends heavily on the land use characteristics of the site nswri 2016 forests and dense vegetation covered areas increase the amount of water infiltration and abstractions while urban and pasture covered areas augment the amount of overland flow the land use is considered the least important factor in the present study since the effect of land use was intrinsically considered in swat model to calculate the average runoff coefficient different classes of land use and the associated percentage are presented in table 3 and the land use map is shown in fig 3 the map analysis shows that 25 of the basin area consists of dry farming 24 of semi dense pasture 23 of low density pasture and about 19 of irrigated agriculture and gardens table 3 in the urban and rural sector some intensive human practices may increase the risk of flood resulting in the likelihood of damage and losses these changes may be reflected through land use information and thus can be taken into account for the calculation of the hazard index 3 2 flood hazard mapping the final output flood hazard map was developed by combining the defined factors and now is illustrated in fig 4 the output classes were defined based on the linear combined data derived from information provided by the model described previously the fhi ranges around 0 101 0 356 and based on these results the study area was categorized into five potential hazard zones representing a very low fhi 0 101 0 187 b low fhi 0 188 0 220 c moderate fhi 0 221 0 249 d high fhi 0 250 0 279 and e very high fhi 0 280 0 356 flood potential hazard the very high and high flood hazard sites spread almost over the central part of study area specifically in the northwestern southeastern and center portions of the basin covering an area of 1180 12 and 2696 km2 28 of total area respectively moreover 2700 km2 28 of the mpb is subject to moderate flood hazard and are mainly distributed around the central portion of the study area subsequently a surface area of 2216 km2 23 and 893 km2 9 lie within low and very low flood hazard potential areas respectively the low and very low hazard potential areas comprise a major portion of the eastern and western part of the study area the results clearly show a significant percentage 40 of areas in mbp are under very high or high flood hazard the areas labelled in the map as high flood hazard are strongly influenced by the runoff coefficient courses according to the high weight given to this factor in the model the final map shows that the mpb has the highest flood hazard over an extended area as a consequence of the combination of lowlands with slopes under 5 table 4 shows the flood hazard areas and the corresponding percentage for each of land uses according to the land use maps overlaid on the flood hazard output map 43 30 and 18 of the very high flood hazard zones are located in dry farming irrigated cropland and pasture and low density pasture areas respectively likewise the majority of high flood hazard areas are dry farming irrigated cropland and pasture and low density pastures followed by semi dense pastures and urban areas whereas irrigated cropland and pasture and dry farming represent 31 and 29 of this zone very low flood prone areas appear mainly at woodland and shrub land and in high density pasture areas breaking it down into land use classification 43 24 of high density pasture 36 29 of semi dense pasture 38 11 of woodland and shrub land 36 41 of scatter forest and finally 30 85 of semi dense forests of mpb are under low flood hazard while 42 55 of scatter forests 48 45 of semi dense forest and 33 71 of low density pasture are under moderate flood hazard the map shows very high flood hazard areas located at extended urbanization areas such as mashhad city the forests and high density pastures with the lowest percentages of very high and high flood hazard lie in the relatively safe region from which seven are found within the low hazard zone and three in the safe zone the fhi map revealed the importance of streams and tributaries in flood events fhi indicates that riverbeds in the lowland are even more prone to flood other similar studies have identified a direct relationship between agricultural land management and the behavior or flooding at the sub basin level 10 km2 kourgialas and karatzas 2017a o connell et al 2007 land use management heavily influences the impact of flood peak delay in intermediate and lower elevation areas especially during moderate rainfall events these measures are key to alleviate flooding by retaining and capturing rainfall during a storm and subsequently reducing the time of flood warnings salazar et al 2009 at mpb there is a large number of crops located primarily at the intermediate and low elevation areas these locations represent an interesting target for the implementation of appropriate land use practices and policies at the national scale to assess flooding such as the enhancement of the infiltration capacity through changes in vegetation cover and the runoff flow connectivity through the system it is recommended to accompany these types of preventive measures with a flood warning system at the river basin scale weather stations may be used to provide real time hydro meteorological information to provide early flood warnings kourgialas and karatzas 2011 salazar et al 2009 the information would also provide a measurement of the threat and the procedures to be applied accordingly by government agencies these findings provide insight towards flow mitigation plan and preventive action as well as a guide to adaptation approaches for agricultural and urban land use practices to minimize flood damage caused by human impact on the landscape and climate change blackwell et al 2006 morris et al 2010 thieken et al 2007 3 3 validation sensitivity analysis the weight factors and their associated feature classes thresholds of the model input have a crucial impact on the evaluation of the results since their determinations were significantly influenced by the interpretations of experts the selection of the flood hazard areas can be sensitive to changes in the decision weights associated with the criteria chang et al 2008 fernández and lutz 2010a based on the judgement of the experts to address this issue a sensitivity analysis was conducted where layer weights values were varied to evaluate the differences in the final result initially fhi considered the runoff coefficient as the dominant parameter elevation and slope angle respectively were considered the next significant parameter and followed by rainfall intensity soil erosion and land use surprisingly the sensitivity analysis concluded that the order of influence of these factors in the studied region is identical to the fhi this confirms the high accuracy of the proposed method however some calculated factors had slight differences table 5 the results of the sensitivity analysis also showed that the least sensitive factor was land use which was expected due to the weight factors assigned tehrany et al 2014b table 3 the mfhi map and fhi map are very similar however fhi underestimates the hazard level at the tributaries and reaches located at the center of the mbp whereas the sensitivity analysis conducted with the mfhi classified these areas as high flood hazard potential despite these differences as shown in fig 4a and b the sensitivity analysis results coincide with the fhi outcomes in general the analysis performed comparing both fhi and mfhi reveals relevant data regarding the weight of each parameter and how they affect the outcome of the flood hazard classification land use was assigned the smallest weight partly due to the almost uniform values across the region tehrany et al 2014b however the effect of land use is especially critical to urban areas where the population is high it is relevant to note that land use is also taken into account within the swat model and would heavily influence the runoff coefficient factor additionally the distance from drainage produced relatively significant impacts on the resultant hazard map which can be clearly observed particularly in the north west area in order to verify the final flood hazard map a review of historical flooding on mbp was introduced diakakis et al 2012 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 as shown in fig 4 the legend shows black dots representing the locations where historical floods occurred with green dots around each representing the number of occurrences of flood on each location the size of the green dots indicates the number of occurrences the bigger the circle the greater the number of occurrences it is noted in this diagram how most of the historic record flood points appear on the eastern portions of mpb in order to validate the final output flood hazard map in accordance to the historical flood records the extract by mask tool was applied using gis the cells of the flood hazard raster map were extracted exactly where the coordinates of the historical flood records were located through this method it is possible to identify which flood hazard index classification corresponded to each of the flood record points additionally the number of the flooded points that were located in each flood hazard area was determined based on the above procedure for the final flood hazard map almost all the recorded historical floods took place at the moderate to very high flood hazard areas with only 3 of them in areas of low flood hazard records of historical flood events support the indications of the mfhi analysis through the recurrent flooding of mpb as shown in table 6 mfhi analysis classifies as highly susceptible areas with a high number of recorded flood events in very high and high classes an additional indication of the accuracy of the proposed methodology according to table 6 for both fhi and mfhi maps more than 97 of historical flood events have occurred in moderate to very high and 27 at very high flood hazard locations which represent 12 of the total mpb total area the consistent matching between the flood hazard map and the historic flood point records not only occurs at low and semi mountainous locations but also at the mountain plateaus of mpb in fig 4 a comparison between fhi and mfhi in terms of number of events demonstrates that the fhi underestimates high and very high flood hazard areas several locations of historical records of flood with high levels of occurrence have been found to be assessed by the mfhi while fhi had underestimated with low classification indexes additionally the sensitivity analysis results revealed that very high and high flood hazard ranking zones represented 16 and 30 of the entire mbp while the fhi estimated 12 and 28 respectively it has also been observed that the fhi overestimated areas that were ranked as low and moderate flood hazard through the presented method 3 4 discussion of proposed methodology a detailed review by birkholz et al 2014 highlighted the necessity to reformulate the perception of flood hazard in research work to develop a more integrated and comprehensive approach of how risk perceptions influence the capacity resilience and vulnerability of individuals and communities against flood due to the research advances and increasing computational and data resources there is a large gap between large scale approaches and detailed reach scale hydraulic models sampson et al 2015 large scale flood modeling approaches have recently begun to include hydrological modeling components to provide more accurate flood mapping dottori et al 2016 the present study incorporates swat as an accurate approach to help forecast flood events using a rainfall runoff response that would enhance the behavior of the parameters of the basin as well as reducing the uncertainty of the parameters used for the mcda process to obtain the fhi index the main advantage of the fhi index is its ability to provide an overall assessment of flood hazard areas the limitations of the fhi methodology are usually related to the requirements of the raw data such as detailed topography accurate and complete historic hydrometeorological data as well as up to date soil land use information of the analyzed site even if all of these requirements are met it only reduces the level of uncertainty of the flood hazard assessment the proposed methodology on the other hand can be suitable where limited data is available and the framework can be used to relatively prioritize vulnerable areas the validation of the modeling results with historical flood events demonstrated the accuracy of the final results and confirmed that using hydrological modeling swat is reliable flexible and produces highly accurate results furthermore in this study developed with swat model requires minimum data that is available globally it provides a comprehensive method to facilitate decision making and offers a time efficient and cost effective method for the identification of flood prone sites the intent of the present research study is to provide a methodology that relies non only on static index based methodologies but also incorporating an framework integrating hydrological models such as swat with mdca using gis tools if the proposed mfhi methodology was to be used in other different regions other weight values for each criterion factor would need to be assumed depending on the geophysical characteristics of the target site which shows the main drawback of the method relying heavily on the subjectivity of the weight values of each criterion however the single parameter sensitivity analysis proved to be a useful to evaluate the weights assumed as table 6 shows the proposed mfhi has proven to acquire similar results compared to fhi the differences may lie in the fact that swat incorporates many of the contributing parameters in the model to obtain more accurate or realistic results previous examples of fhi work suggest different results in the ranking of the factors assumed as well as different factors that were not included in the present study chen et al 2015 fernández and lutz 2010b papaioannou et al 2015 tehrany et al 2013 tehrany et al 2014b xiao et al 2017 for instance kourgialas and karatzas 2016 and kazakis et al 2015b suggested flow accumulation had a major contribution towards hazard mapping for the present work it was preliminarily included but it had proven to develop a small sensitivity towards the flood hazard results and thus it was removed from the analysis soil water retention was a major factor included by chen et al 2015 modeled using the scs cn number method for runoff calculation which requires soil cover and land used altogether the advantage of using swat includes all these factors except that they interact independently in the rainfall runoff model providing more sensitivity to each of these factors and not relying on a single curve number parameter distance to rivers and streams as well as water table levels were important factors assumed for hazard assessment in the case of fernández and lutz 2010b since the data available for mpb had shown a decline in water table levels this criterion was also removed from the analysis nswri 2016 as shown in the previous similar works cited utilizing fhi methodology the weight of parameter assumed for any basin will vary from site mcda problems are based on the specific characteristics of case study but can be modified and applied in other regions accordingly the present study considers the runoff coefficient as a factor for first time modeled more accurately with swat and has demonstrated its relevance towards flood hazard mapping previous work using mcda have shown that land use may represent an important criterion kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 kourgialas and karatzas 2017b although land use in our case presented little influence towards determining hazard levels because of the low weight values assumed it may be misleading due to the fact that it may indirectly affect other parameters in our case the runoff coefficient the present study provides a baseline for future work to develop sensitivity analysis not only for the criteria factors assumed for the site but also the influence of the same factors towards the hydrologic model through the implementation of these models a further step for future research work involves the estimation of peak flows corresponding to different exceedance probabilities at locations where the output map has identified high and very high flood hazard levels the output information may provide local authorities and land development managers and stakeholders and farmers with a comprehensive tool to assess flooding in areas under risk of flood accordingly it is recommended other future studies may use different weight criteria assumption methods to modify the proposed methodology the applications of the fhi can be used to assess flood hazards in other locations coupled with validation methods such as the sensitivity analysis this methodology is able to provide reliable and accurate results the present mfhi approach may prove helpful to evaluate global models at a large scale to reduce the over or under estimation of the flood hazards using a rather simple gis based tool which requires a relatively less expensive method to be applied even if the available data is scarce 4 conclusion the purpose of the present study is to propose a methodology for flood hazard assessment that is transferable to different locations around the globe the proposed model can be used for basin management and for the development of flood prevention and mitigation plans that may lead to a reduction of flood impact or damage caused by intensive precipitation the method spatially analyzes seven parameters combining the information in the flood hazard index fhi the parameters are runoff coefficient r elevation e slope s distance from the drainage network d rainfall intensity ri soil erosion se and land use l the weight of each parameter was calculated by using the analytic hierarchy process that consists of a sophisticated statistical analysis the highest weight was assigned to the runoff coefficient and the lowest to land use flood hazard was classified in five categories ranging from very high to very low the output values were validated by overlaying historical flood in the basin as well as the development of a statistical sensitivity analysis on the values assigned to the different criteria to validate the accuracy and consistency of the developed methodology the proposed modified method is named mfhi the comparison of the flood hazard maps obtained with the fhi and mfhi indices indicate that both indices are reliable however it is necessary to use the historical flood records to test the consistency of the results in high and very high flood hazard areas according to the results 9 of the total area of study area is subject to very low flood hazard while about 40 is under very high or high flood hazard since flood events represent a major concern in study area the presented methodology could provide insight for the identification of potential flood hazard areas and for improved and innovative water and risk management practices additionally this study discussed and proposed a global flood hazard investigation framework for identifying very high flood risk areas it is hoped that the developed methodology will benefit water management professionals engaged in climate change and natural disaster management planning scenarios across the globe by providing sustainable development and resilience to extreme weather events conflict of interest no interests to

6458,rain gauges are the foundation in hydrology to collect rainfall data however gauge observations alone are limited at representing the complete rainfall distribution on the other hand weather radar can provide a nearly complete spatial distribution of rainfall qualitatively at high temporal and spatial resolution yet concerns about the biases in the precipitation estimates hamper the direct use of radar data in hydrological applications thus the focus of this study is to derive a scheme to merge radar precipitation estimates and the contemporaneous point wise rain gauge observations it is common practice to construct radar gauge pairs by assuming the vertical and instant falling of the hydrometeors from aloft onto the ground on many occasions the assumption is invalid as it ignores a significant fact that the hydrometeors are very likely to be laterally advected in the air by the wind while descending especially from a large height and or with the existence of snow the laterally displacement of rainfall will result in a great discrepancy of radar and gauge data concerning these issues a method to quantify the displacement of rainfall is proposed and the results of the quantification are integrated into much improved surface precipitation estimates keywords surface precipitation estimation radar gauge combination rainfall displacement 1 introduction modern weather radar products due to their large areal coverage and high temporal and spatial resolution have been widely used for precipitation information all over the world a fundamental problem before radar derived precipitation amounts can be utilized for hydrological purpose is to ensure that they possess enough accuracy and robustness there are many sources of errors hindering the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe by radar for example clutter contamination signal attenuation anomalous propagation of the radar beam uncertainty in reflectivity rain rate z r conversion etc rain gauges as the only direct measuring device of surface precipitation are still counted as the most reliable source of precipitation information in hydrology rain gauges might be poor in capturing the instantaneous precipitation intensity but the measurement error diminishes rapidly as the integration time increases fabry 2015 as the point wise rain gauges are usually sparsely distributed they are limited at representing the complete spatial distribution of precipitation due to the pros and cons of the two most commonly used sources of precipitation information the idea of merging radar and rain gauge measurements has become widely accepted for surface precipitation estimation by exploiting the strength and minimizing the weakness of each method e g goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 hasan et al 2016 a number of methods have been developed for the merging of radar gauge data the radar gauge merging techniques can be roughly grouped into three categories mean bias reduction methods geostatistical merging methods and copula based interpolation methods mean bias reduction methods are a series of techniques focusing on reducing the mean gauge radar bias for example based on the comparison between processed radar accumulation and rain gauge accumulation of hourly rainfall in the operational uk nimrod system a multiplicative factor is applied to the domain of each radar site and the ratio is updated on an hourly basis harrison et al 2009 a similar adjustment scheme is also applied for the nexrad system seo 1998 however the mean bias adjustment is carried out through the post event comparison namely the rainfall events are reconstructed hence the scheme is more suitable for improving the applicability of historical radar rainfall events to hydrological or hydraulic designs rather than for the purpose of short term real time forecasting wang et al 2013 the geostatistical merging method is a generic name for a family of techniques to predict the value of a function at a given point by computing a weighted average of the known values of the function in the neighborhood of the point the so called best linear and unbiased estimator blue is generated based on the information in the covariance function or variogram the weights of the blue are obtained by minimizing the estimation error under the unbiased condition according to jewell and nicolas 2015 geostatistical merging methods can be broadly divided into two categories for the first category interpolation is applied independently gauge rainfall is spatially interpolated to the resolution of radar rainfall then the difference between the interpolated gauge rainfall and the radar rainfall is added to the radar rainfall to obtain an estimate at ungauged locations block kriging ehret et al 2008 and conditional merging sinclair and pegram 2005 are representatives of the kind for the second category both datasets are integrated in the kriging algorithm and the weights of the blue are constrained by both representatives of this category include kriging with external drift haberlandt 2007 velasco forero et al 2009 and co kriging schuurmans et al 2007 sideris et al 2014 copula based interpolation methods are also used as geostatistical tools the innovation of the scheme includes the separate treatment of dependence and marginal distribution as well as the possibility of realizing non gaussian dependence by using nonsymmetrical copula models such as the v copula bárdossy and li 2008 etc the widely applied geostatistical interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging or kriging with external drift have implicitly posed the assumption of gaussianity on the observations which is not appropriate for many environmental variables thus the blue of these methods might allow a systematic under or over estimation of the variable in regions of big or small observations lebrenz and bárdossy 2018 measurements made using weather radar are usually physically located above the ground level due to the increase of the radar beams height with distance caused by the earth s curvature and the elevation angle of the radar antenna in other words radar is estimating the meteorological phenomena at some distance above the ground in order to use radar precipitation accumulation to estimate the surface precipitation the measurements need to be corrected for the effects of beam height lauri et al 2012 it is common practice to compare gauge data with the collocated radar data by assuming a vertical descent of the hydrometeors however hydrometeors are very likely to be laterally advected in the air by the wind as they fall from the radar beam to ground level the displacement could be enormous for snow with the order as large as 10 20 km mittermaier et al 2004 even for raindrops with a higher fall speed and larger body weight the drift could be over considerable distances lack and fox 2007 there are not many studies on wind induced radar biases early studies address the issue qualitatively such as atlas and plank 1953 harrold et al 1974 and collier 1999 according to qiang and dawei 2014 the first quantitative method was proposed by mittermaier et al 2004 where the wind effect was analyzed by simulating the fall streaks of snow lack and fox 2007 use wind fields determined by doppler radar to estimate the trajectories of falling drops and thereby assess the error induced in surface rainfall rate qiang and dawei 2014 propose a fully formulated scheme for the numerical simulation of raindrop movement in a three dimensional wind field the common ground of these studies is the necessity of wind data and furthermore the raindrop size distribution has to be assumed the term wind drift is used by the previous authors e g collier 1999 lack and fox 2007 and sandford 2015 to decribe the motion of the raindrops below the radar beam to a point on the surface that is not vertically below the radar observation to avoid confusion we use rainfall displacement to term the displacement of rainfall not necessarily between the level of the radar beam and the surface but between two images measured at different altitudes by different radars furthermore in this paper rainfall displacement not only refers to the displacement that can be observed spatially e g between contemporaneous radar images measured at different altitudes but also the displacement that can be observed temporally between images measured at different time steps by one radar this paper has two focuses first a technique is proposed to quantify the rainfall displacement between two radar images and between a radar image and a number of contemporaneous surface observations second radar and gauge data are combined to give a complete description of surface precipitation where radar data is used semi quantitatively as a pattern indicator and at the same time rainfall displacement information from the radar beam to ground level is integrated in a stochastic manner such that the agreement of radar and gauge data is maximized 2 study domain and data the study domain is located in the district of reutlingen in the southeast of germany the climate there is mild with the average annual rainfall of about 1040 mm and the average annual temperature of around 9 1 c the climate is considered to be temperate oceanic cfb according to the köppen geiger climate classification system as indicated in fig 1 the study domain is a square in the grid with the side length of 19 km a gauge network consisting of 12 pluviometers is available within the domain the weighing rain gauges are owned by stadtentwässerung reutlingen which record and document precipitation every 1 min the german weather service dwd runs a network of 17 c band radars available data for the study domain are from radar türkheim abbreviated as tur and radar feldberg abbreviated as fbg as shown in fig 2 dwd uses the dx file format to encode local radar sweeps in this study raw dx products are used which are then subject to a processing chain composed of arranged in order clutter removal gabella and notarpietro 2002 attenuation correction krämer and verworn 2008 jacobi and heistermann 2016 re projection from polar coordinates to cartesian grid clip the square data for the study domain beam blockage is avoided in the data aquisition all the processing steps in this study are operated under the environment of wradlib an open source library for weather radar data processing heistermann et al 2013 a weather radar takes snapshots of reflectivity distribution over a large area from which the distribution of precipitation intensity is estimated the snapshots of reflectivity are expressed as plan position indicators or ppis there is a systematic change of ppis in the observation height with range as the domain that we are researching is relatively small the change in elevation is neglected the center of the domain is approximately 45 km from tur and 113 km from fbg with the elevation angle as low as possible to avoid ground echoes and under the normal propagation condition tur and fbg are measuring at 1280 m and 2280 m above the ground m a g respectively considering the small size of the study domain neglecting the change in elevation the spatial pattern indicated by radar is not affected by the bright band phenomenon 3 rainfall displacement in this section a method is proposed to quantify rainfall displacement we discuss two possibilities to recognize rainfall displacement one is by comparing two radar images either measured by one radar at different time steps or measured at the same time by different radars at different altitudes the former the displacement observed in time is more related to the evolution of radar images which has been addressed by former authors such as rinehart and garvey 1978 horn and schunck 1981 and bab hadiashar et al 1996 while the displacement observed spatially between two radar images at different altitudes is rarely mentioned if the two are images of instantaneous rainfall intensity at the same instant the displacement in between can be considered as a guide to assess the velocity vector of the field at that instant the other possibility to recognize rainfall displacement is by comparing a radar image with a number of contemporaneous rain gauge observations in this case the displacement of rainfall is assessed between the level of the radar beam and the ground which makes the quantified displacement information even more useful to be integrated into the surface precipitation estimation note that the second possibility only applies for accumulated rainfall as rain gauges are poor in capturing the instantaneous rainfall intensity in this sense the quantified displacement vector can be considered as a mean displacement vector on the relevant time period note that the proposed method is suitable for a domain of small size as it is assumed that all pixels in the field move uniformly along a vector to take the rainfall displacement uncertainty into account the displacement vector is considered as a random variable and the result of the quantification is not a single best vector but a probability matrix analogous to a probability mass function indicating the probability of a field of displacement vectors 3 1 quantification of the rainfall displacement between two radar images the details of the algorithm are described as follows 1 a positive integer m is set as the limit of the displacement i e the maximum number of pixels allowed for the overall migration of the original image for the case where no information concerning the wind direction is available directions in the north south east and west are given an equal chance 2 a regular cartesian grid h ij is defined where i j m m 1 0 m 1 m the coordinates of each grid point are given by 1 h ij α i α j where α is the spatial resolution of the resulting rank correlation matrix the same resolution as used in the radar image h ij is used to indicate the displacement vector 3 the similarity of two images is measured by spearman s rank correlation or simply rank correlation the reason why rank correlation is employed as the measure is due to the assumption that the evolution of radar images is non linear unlike the correlation coefficient which measures the linear relationship the rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship which suits this specific case it is worth noting that reflectivity z can be used directly in the calculation of rank correlation due to the monotonic relationship between z and r thus no assumption about the z r relation is required let r x r y denote two radar images the rank correlation between image r x and the shifted image r y shifted by vector h ij is calculated by 2 ρ ij r s r x r y h h ij where r s is the formula of spearman s rank correlation note that the calculation in eq 2 is applied for every element in h ij and the resultant ρ ij is a matrix termed the rank correlation matrix there exists a one to one correspondence between entries in ρ ij and entries in the cartesian grid h ij the higher the value of the entry in ρ ij the more likely the corresponding vector in h ij is the actual displacement vector as many vectors in h ij deliver quite similar results the displacement vector can be considered as a random variable 4 following the thinking that the higher the value of the entry in ρ ij and so the more likely the corresponding entry in h ij the probability mass function p ij of the displacement vector can be calculated as 3 p h h ij p ij 0 for ρ ij ρ oo g ρ ij ρ oo else where ρ oo is the original rank correlation when the corresponding shift is 0 0 function g x is monotonically increasing when x 0 and continuous at zero i e g 0 0 ρ oo is used as the threshold value it means the field is subject to a zero wind field any displacement vector in h ij associated with an entry in ρ ij with a higher value than ρ oo is considered to be more likely to be the displacement vector than 0 0 the threshold value could be increased if a large portion of vectors in h ij are shown to be greater than ρ oo but the choice relies on subjective judgement there is a wide selection of functions g x such as the power function x a the exponential function e bx 1 and the logarithmic function ln cx 1 where a b and c are positive constants the first derivative of g x matters as large dg dx means more weights are given to those displacement vectors associated with higher rank correlations the choice of the g x function influences the result but only to a minor extent on the final estimates of surface rainfall where the quantified displacement information is integrated as demonstrated by yan 2018 in chapter 4 3 3 in this study we use a simple power function g x x 2 p ij is further scaled by a constant to ensure the sum of all entries equals 1 4 p ij p ij i j p ij the probability mass function of the displacement vector is also a matrix and is termed probability matrix which quantifies the rainfall displacement by indicating the probability of individual displacement vectors note that the scheme is not applicable when the rank correlation of two images is low normally without any structured texture in the rank correlation matrix even after applying a bunch of displacement vectors this could happen for two images with remarkable difference in measurement height or time step this also applies to the case to be discussed in section 3 2 3 2 quantification of the rainfall displacement between a radar image and a number of contemporaneous surface observations the quantification of the rainfall displacement between a radar image and a number of contemporaneous surface observations is very similar as the algorithm described in section 3 1 only differing in step 3 first the limit of the shift is determined and the cartesian grid h ij is defined as described in steps 1 and 2 in section 3 1 there are 1 a map r aloft given by radar and 2 k surface observations z k located at s k k 1 k the radar map shifted by vector in h ij is denoted as r ij r ij r h h ij the rank correlation between gauge observations and the collocated radar data in the shifted field is calculated by 5 ρ ij r s z k r ij s k the result is a rank correlation matrix ρ ij that is in one to one correspondence with the cartesian grid h ij the measure of similarity is still the rank correlation due to the monotonicity of the two datasets being of interest note that the rank correlation measures the difference between radar and gauge data the higher the rank correlation the smaller the difference between radar and gauge data and vice versa then the probability matrix p ij is generated according to step 4 in section 3 1 note that the same g x x 2 is employed and ρ oo is still used as the threshold value 3 3 examples the proposed scheme is first used to quantify the displacement between two radar images 5 min apart as illustrated in fig 3 the left and middle panels indicate two instantaneous maps of rain rate by tur at different time steps and the right is the rank correlation matrix ρ ij derived from the two the shift is limited to 8 pixels to the north south east and west and the resolution of ρ ij is the same as that of the radar maps i e 500 500 m ρ ij indicates the most likely displacement vectors of the field i e pixels colored darker green in fig 3 right the scheme is then used to quantify the displacement between two radar images measured at different altitudes at the same instant as illustrated in fig 4 the left and middle panels indicate two instantaneous maps of rain rate for the same instant by fbg left and tur middle the ρ ij derived from the two are shown on the right with the same shifting limit and resolution as in fig 3 note that the weird look of the map in the left panel is due to the degradation of map resolution at far range of the radar beam the z r relation used in the conversion is z 254 r 1 42 the same parameterization as adopted by dwd 4 surface precipitation estimation once the rainfall displacement is quantified the next step is to integrate the information of rainfall displacement into the surface precipitation estimation 4 1 radar quantile map to estimate the rainfall field on the ground radar data and surface observations are combined it should be clarified that in this study radar data is used semi quantitatively to indicate the spatial pattern of precipitation at the surface specifically each radar map is scaled between 0 and 1 with a uniform distribution in quantiles thus a radar map after scaling is referred to as a quantile map the procedure is illustrated by the example shown in fig 4 the left and middle panels show two maps of precipitation rate measured at different altitudes at the same instant the magnitudes of the two maps differ remarkably while they both indicate a similar spatial pattern the great variation in rainfall magnitude in the vertical might be produced by the bright band effect but the cause is not the main focus here the point is the similarity in the spatial pattern at different altitudes in fact it was often found that similar patterns at the two levels had widely different magnitudes all of them serve as evidence that the rainfall related magnitudes can vary wildly in the vertical while the spatial patterns in the quantile maps are relatively stable it is therefore proposed in this study that radar maps measured aloft should be used semi quantitatively to indicate the spatial pattern of precipitation at the surface 4 2 the expected rainfall field given that radar data should be used semi quantitatively as a pattern indicator for surface precipitation the next step is to combine the radar quantile map and surface observations with the information of rainfall displacement being integrated the details of the combination scheme are described as follows 1 the probability matrix p ij carrying the rainfall displacement information between the relevant radar image of accumulated rainfall and a number of contemporaneous surface observations is determined according to the algorithm described in section 3 2 2 before importing the information of rainfall displacement some nomenclature should be clarified let r denote the radar rainfall field without shifting and u denote the corresponding quantile map the radar rainfall field shifted by vectors in h ij denoted as r ij has the corresponding quantile map u ij which can be calculated by 6 u ij g ij r ij where g ij is the empirical cumulative distribution function of r ij 3 generate a marginal distribution function whereby a quantile map can be converted to a rainfall map the generation scheme of the marginal distribution function is described as follows a the locations of the rain gauges s 1 s k and the corresponding observations z 1 z k are determined the gauge observations are then sorted in ascending order z 1 z k b the collocated radar quantiles are determined u ij s 1 u ij s k u 1 u k and also sorted in ascending order u 1 u k note that the sorting procedure in a and b will destroy the original one to one correspondence of gauge observations and the collocated radar quantiles if the two datasets have different rankings however without sorting points z k u k k 1 k cannot be placed on a monotonic increasing line which would destroy the nature of the marginal distribution function c set u 0 the probability of zero precipitation z 0 0 which can be considered as the ratio of the rainfall area to the total area of the field if the smallest gauge observation z 1 is zero then z 0 u 0 z 1 u 1 otherwise u 0 u 1 2 d it is then assumed that the two datasets z k and u k have one to one correspondence and they are the points on the marginal distribution function f ij in between these points linear interpolation is employed 7 f ij z u k u k 1 z k z k 1 z z k 1 u k 1 with z k 1 and z k being the two nearest neighbors of z where z k 1 z z k u k 1 and u k being the quantiles corresponding to z k 1 and z k e due to the fact that the rain gauges are sparse relative to radar data and non uniformly distributed in the domain it is very likely that the extremes of the rainfall field cannot be sampled properly by the gauges thus extrapolation is employed to take care of the extremes z z k an exponential distribution function is used for the extropolation as given by eq 8 the only parameter λ is calculated by eq 9 8 f z 1 e λ z for z 0 0 for z 0 9 λ 1 z k ln 1 u k where z k u k is the pair composed of the largest gauge observation and the maximum collocated radar quantile the exponential distribution function is used because compared to the more complex weibull or gamma distributions it is simple and adequately describes the rainfall behaviour note that the generation scheme of the marginal distribution function is based on the assumption that the gauge observations are representative of the entire field the assumption might be invalid on some occasions for example the gauge observations are not representative if the upper or lower quantiles of the field are not sampled properly fig 5 shows two 15 min events where the upper and lower quantiles are not sampled properly by the gauges note that the gauge observations are plotted next to their locations at the top and the collocated radar data are plotted accompanied at the bottom table 1 lists the ranked gauge observations and the collocated radar quantiles for the two events in fig 5 thus to improve the applicability of the proposed scheme it is preferable that there should be more rain gauges uniformly distributed in the domain of interest 4 through the marginal distribution function the quantile map u ij can be converted to a rainfall map by applying the inverse of the marginal and finally the information of rainfall displacement is introduced by 10 z i j p ij f ij 1 u ij note that each rainfall field converted from u ij plays a part in the final estimation but different rainfall fields have different impacts those vectors in h ij delivering higher rank correlations and thus associated with larger probability in p ij are more influential whereby the introduction of rainfall displacement information maximizes the rank correlation or minimizes the conflict between gauge observations and the collocated radar quantiles as the resultant field is a weighted average of multiple fields it is termed the expected rainfall field it should be clarified that the expected here is in the statistical sense as the displacement vector is considered as a random variable the displacement information is given as the probability matrix of the displacement vector and the information is therefore integrated in a stochastic manner 4 3 example the proposed method is used to generate surface precipitation for a 15 min event shown in the right panel in fig 6 for comparison the surface precipitation ignoring the information of rainfall displacement is shown in the left panel which is obtained by direct conversion of the quantile map without shifting by its corresponding marginal 11 z f 1 g r f 1 u where g denotes the empirical cumulative distribution function of r the rank correlation ρ between the gauge observations and the collocated estimates has been calculated for both cases and labelled in the figure title an increase in ρ from 0 802 to 0 951 has been observed which actually shows an increase in the agreement of radar and gauge data due to the integration of displacement information as a weighted average procedure is applied there is a smoothing effect in the resultant expected field fig 7 reveals the smoothing effect by the marginal of the expected rainfall field red line namely the empirical cumulative distribution function of the expected rainfall field which is much smoother compared to the other marginals in fig 7 note that the marginals of the shifted rainfall fields and the rainfall field without shift are obtained according to the procedure described in section 4 2 step 3 it should be stressed that the proposed scheme uses only one radar image it is recommended that the lower image should be used as it is more relevant with the surface precipitation unless otherwise specified in this study the lower radar image by tur is used in the surface precipitation estimation nonetheless different estimates of surface precipitation can be generated based on radar images measured at different altitudes fig 8 shows two estimates of surface precipitation for the same event based on the two radars fbg left and tur right note that the two estimates use the same gauge observations the corresponding radar images are shown in fig 9 the similarity of the two estimates shows the relative independence of the procedure on the measurement height of radar images the expected rainfall field is effective in reducing the mismatch of radar and gauge data it represents the product with both the radar pattern and rainfall displacement information being integrated however there exists a discrepancy between gauge observations and the collocated estimates from the expected rainfall field the failure is due to the fact that no constraints have been imposed on those estimates despite the discrepancy at gauge locations the estimates from the expected rainfall fields are far superior to the similar products with only the radar pattern being integrated namely the products ignoring the displacement information to demonstrate this point an experiment was made before describing the experiment it needs to be noted that the goodness of an estimate is measured by the discrepancy at the gauge locations the smaller the discrepancy the better the estimate four error statistics are selected to quantify the discrepancy mean error me root mean square error rmse pearson s correlation coefficient ρ p and kling gupta efficiency kge detailed description of the four error statistics is given in section 5 4 for sixty relatively heavy 15 min events the expected rainfall fields are generated and the error statistics between the gauge observations and the collocated estimates are calculated the results are the data series of the four error statistics of length 60 the means of the four series are calculated and presented in table 2 under the column labelled displacement for comparison the results for the rainfall fields with only the radar pattern being integrated ignoring the displacement information are listed under no displacement the comparison of the two demonstrates the benefit of introducing the rainfall displacement information in the surface precipitation estimation 5 geostatistical improvement in this section the expected rainfall field is further improved at gauge locations by geostatistical interpolation methods kriging with external drift and residual kriging geostatistical methods are founded on the principles of statistical spatial autocorrelation these methods interpolate the variable of interest at known locations to the unknown locations providing a linear estimator 12 z x i 1 n λ i z x i where the weights λ i are chosen a priori such that the estimation is unbiased and the estimation variance is minimized i e best linear unbiased estimate blue 5 1 kriging with external drift kriging with external drift ked ahmed and de marsily 1987 permits a trend in the regionalized variable a second variable y is assumed to be linearly correlated with the first variable z by 13 e z x a y x b where a and b are constants the optimum weights of the linear estimator are obtained by minimizing the variance of the estimation error e z x z x 2 under the unbiased condition ked has been frequently applied in various disciplines of practice and science e g bourennane et al 2000 van de kassteele et al 2009 in this study the second variable is the expected rainfall field given as a regular grid of precipitation the realizations of the first variable z are given by the rain gauge observations due to the small number of the realizations of z it is difficult to derive a variogram therefrom hence the variogram is derived from the rainfall field obtained by converting the radar quantile map by its inverse marginal distribution the expected rainfall field is not used in the derivation of the variogram due to its smoothing effect the expected rainfall field is not a realization of surface precipitation as it is a weighted average of multiple fields the variogram derived from such a smooth field usually presents an extended correlation length 5 2 residual kriging in the procedure of residual kriging rk ordinary kriging ok is first applied to interpolate the residuals at gauge locations to the entire field in the present case the residuals means the difference between gauge observations z x i and the estimates at gauge locations from the expected rainfall field z y x i 14 r x i z x i z y x i the estimate is obtained by superimposing the ordinary kriging results of the residuals on the expected rainfall field 15 z x z y x r x 5 3 examples the algorithms of ked and rk are used to improve the expected rainfall field of a 15 min event as shown in fig 10 for comparison the estimate by ok is shown accompanied which is purely based on the rain gauge observations denoted by the red crosses in the figures as shown by the example in fig 10 the estimate by ok has difficulty in capturing the spatial pattern due to the sparsity of the rain gauge observations in this case the estimates by ked and rk are similar because the radar quantiles are properly sampled at the gauge locations namely large and small quantiles are both sampled approximate uniform distribution of the sampled quantiles whereby the trend information could be adequately captured by ked thus the estimate by ked is similar with that by rk where the detrended residuals participate in the kriging operation 5 4 cross validation the leave one out cross validation loocv method is employed to test the performance of different geostatistical methods ok ked and rk the method uses a single rain gauge observation from the original samples as the validation data and the remaining observations as the training data the procedure is repeated such that each observation in the samples has been used once as the validation data four error statistics the measure of the difference between the sample values and the corresponding loocv estimates for all the samples are selected to evaluate the performance of these methods details of the four error statistics are listed below the mean error me checks if the estimation is biased or not chua and bras 1982 16 me 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i the root mean square error rmse is a measure of the size of the error where the estimates are considered to be accurate if the rmse is close to zero 17 rmse 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i 2 the pearson s correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation of two variables x and y 18 ρ x y e x μ x y μ y σ x σ y with μ x μ y being the means of x y and σ x σ y being the standard deviations of x y to take the variability of the estimates into account the kling gupta efficiency kge is introduced kge is expressed as the difference between unity and the euclidian distance ed from the ideal point in the three dimensional criteria space 19 kge 1 ed 20 ed ρ 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 with ρ being the pearson s correlation coefficient α being the variability error as expressed in eq 21 and β representing the bias error as expressed in eq 22 21 α σ est σ obs 22 β μ est μ obs with μ est μ obs being the mean of the estimated and the observed variables and σ est σ obs representing the standard deviation of the estimated and the observed variables all three components α β and ρ are dimensionless and have their ideal values at unity hence the value of kge ranges from to 1 with unity being the ideal case the loocv procedure is applied to 24 15 min events these events are relatively heavy with evident spatial variability as measured by the standard deviation the 15 min duration is used because the radar based estimates of surface precipitation have great potential to be used as the data source for the early detection of flooding which is demanding on the rapidity of data acquisition the descriptive statistics of gauge data for these events are provided in table 3 note that the expected rainfall field is also generated according to the rule of loocv with one gauge observation hidden for each cross validation sub process the cross validation results are shown in table 4 note that the results of me are ignored here as the differences of this statistic are similar and small for each event the method with the best performance in terms of rmse the pearson s correlation coefficient ρ p and kge are written in bold and italics as shown by the table 13 best performances in terms of rmse are from ok versus 11 from ked and rk 11 best performances in terms of ρ p are from ok versus 13 from ked and rk the scores of ked and rk are added up because they both represent the performance of the estimates integrating the information on radar spatial pattern and rainfall displacement thus for the two statistics rmse and ρ p it ends in a draw however in terms of the capability of preserving the variability measured by kge none of the estimates from ok perform the best in fact kge is the most informative statistic for both low and high rainfalls and should be given more weight in decision making comparing the results from ked and rk rk seems more advantageous in terms of rmse 2 best performances from ked versus 9 from rk ρ p 6 best performances from ked versus 7 from rk and kge 9 best performances from ked versus 15 from rk however for many events the differences in the values of these statistics are not obvious especially for kge and ρ p to demonstrate the benefit of integrating the rainfall displacement information in the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe at ground level an extra experiment was made the method of rk is used where the second variable is the radar based estimate without importing the rainfall displacement information i e the rainfall field converted from the radar quantile map without shift the loocv procedure is applied again to these 24 events and the results are evaluated by the four error statistics and then compared with the similar results by rk using the expected rainfall field as the second variable i e displacement integrated products the results of the experiment are shown in table 5 with the best performances in terms of the four error statistics printed in bold and italics the overwhelming superiority of the displacement integrated estimates demonstrates the benefit of introducing the rainfall displacement information in the qpe process 6 conclusion the focus of the paper is to estimate the rainfall field at the surface over a short time period based on weather radar and surface observations the innovations of the study come in three aspects first it has been made clear that the value of radar is evident when it is used as a pattern indicator compared to the unpredictable change of the rainfall related magnitudes along the vertical column the change in the spatial pattern is relatively small and traceable therefore the pattern measured aloft after some modification a horizontal uniform shift over a relatively small area can be used as the pattern of surface precipitation second the gauge observations are used as a guide as to how much and in what direction the field should be moved such that the mismatch between radar and gauge data can be reduced the third innovation is the method used to introduce the rainfall displacement information in the qpe process where the rainfall displacement uncertainty is taken into account by considering the displacement vector as a random variable and thus the displacement information is imported as the probability mass function of the random variable the rainfall field obtained by combining the radar quantile map and surface observations with the rainfall displacement information being integrated the expected rainfall field is further improved by kriging with external drift ked and residual kriging rk to fulfill the point equality constraints at gauge locations the results obtained from ked and rk are superior to ordinary kriging between the gauges as expected due to the introduction of the spatial pattern from radar as well as the integration of rainfall displacement information in particular the benefit of introducing rainfall displacement information is further demonstrated by the overwhelming superiority of the displacement integrated estimates by using rk over the similar products without displacement information being integrated acknowledgements thanks to professor geoff pegram and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments which helped us to improve the quality of the manuscript 
6458,rain gauges are the foundation in hydrology to collect rainfall data however gauge observations alone are limited at representing the complete rainfall distribution on the other hand weather radar can provide a nearly complete spatial distribution of rainfall qualitatively at high temporal and spatial resolution yet concerns about the biases in the precipitation estimates hamper the direct use of radar data in hydrological applications thus the focus of this study is to derive a scheme to merge radar precipitation estimates and the contemporaneous point wise rain gauge observations it is common practice to construct radar gauge pairs by assuming the vertical and instant falling of the hydrometeors from aloft onto the ground on many occasions the assumption is invalid as it ignores a significant fact that the hydrometeors are very likely to be laterally advected in the air by the wind while descending especially from a large height and or with the existence of snow the laterally displacement of rainfall will result in a great discrepancy of radar and gauge data concerning these issues a method to quantify the displacement of rainfall is proposed and the results of the quantification are integrated into much improved surface precipitation estimates keywords surface precipitation estimation radar gauge combination rainfall displacement 1 introduction modern weather radar products due to their large areal coverage and high temporal and spatial resolution have been widely used for precipitation information all over the world a fundamental problem before radar derived precipitation amounts can be utilized for hydrological purpose is to ensure that they possess enough accuracy and robustness there are many sources of errors hindering the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe by radar for example clutter contamination signal attenuation anomalous propagation of the radar beam uncertainty in reflectivity rain rate z r conversion etc rain gauges as the only direct measuring device of surface precipitation are still counted as the most reliable source of precipitation information in hydrology rain gauges might be poor in capturing the instantaneous precipitation intensity but the measurement error diminishes rapidly as the integration time increases fabry 2015 as the point wise rain gauges are usually sparsely distributed they are limited at representing the complete spatial distribution of precipitation due to the pros and cons of the two most commonly used sources of precipitation information the idea of merging radar and rain gauge measurements has become widely accepted for surface precipitation estimation by exploiting the strength and minimizing the weakness of each method e g goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 hasan et al 2016 a number of methods have been developed for the merging of radar gauge data the radar gauge merging techniques can be roughly grouped into three categories mean bias reduction methods geostatistical merging methods and copula based interpolation methods mean bias reduction methods are a series of techniques focusing on reducing the mean gauge radar bias for example based on the comparison between processed radar accumulation and rain gauge accumulation of hourly rainfall in the operational uk nimrod system a multiplicative factor is applied to the domain of each radar site and the ratio is updated on an hourly basis harrison et al 2009 a similar adjustment scheme is also applied for the nexrad system seo 1998 however the mean bias adjustment is carried out through the post event comparison namely the rainfall events are reconstructed hence the scheme is more suitable for improving the applicability of historical radar rainfall events to hydrological or hydraulic designs rather than for the purpose of short term real time forecasting wang et al 2013 the geostatistical merging method is a generic name for a family of techniques to predict the value of a function at a given point by computing a weighted average of the known values of the function in the neighborhood of the point the so called best linear and unbiased estimator blue is generated based on the information in the covariance function or variogram the weights of the blue are obtained by minimizing the estimation error under the unbiased condition according to jewell and nicolas 2015 geostatistical merging methods can be broadly divided into two categories for the first category interpolation is applied independently gauge rainfall is spatially interpolated to the resolution of radar rainfall then the difference between the interpolated gauge rainfall and the radar rainfall is added to the radar rainfall to obtain an estimate at ungauged locations block kriging ehret et al 2008 and conditional merging sinclair and pegram 2005 are representatives of the kind for the second category both datasets are integrated in the kriging algorithm and the weights of the blue are constrained by both representatives of this category include kriging with external drift haberlandt 2007 velasco forero et al 2009 and co kriging schuurmans et al 2007 sideris et al 2014 copula based interpolation methods are also used as geostatistical tools the innovation of the scheme includes the separate treatment of dependence and marginal distribution as well as the possibility of realizing non gaussian dependence by using nonsymmetrical copula models such as the v copula bárdossy and li 2008 etc the widely applied geostatistical interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging or kriging with external drift have implicitly posed the assumption of gaussianity on the observations which is not appropriate for many environmental variables thus the blue of these methods might allow a systematic under or over estimation of the variable in regions of big or small observations lebrenz and bárdossy 2018 measurements made using weather radar are usually physically located above the ground level due to the increase of the radar beams height with distance caused by the earth s curvature and the elevation angle of the radar antenna in other words radar is estimating the meteorological phenomena at some distance above the ground in order to use radar precipitation accumulation to estimate the surface precipitation the measurements need to be corrected for the effects of beam height lauri et al 2012 it is common practice to compare gauge data with the collocated radar data by assuming a vertical descent of the hydrometeors however hydrometeors are very likely to be laterally advected in the air by the wind as they fall from the radar beam to ground level the displacement could be enormous for snow with the order as large as 10 20 km mittermaier et al 2004 even for raindrops with a higher fall speed and larger body weight the drift could be over considerable distances lack and fox 2007 there are not many studies on wind induced radar biases early studies address the issue qualitatively such as atlas and plank 1953 harrold et al 1974 and collier 1999 according to qiang and dawei 2014 the first quantitative method was proposed by mittermaier et al 2004 where the wind effect was analyzed by simulating the fall streaks of snow lack and fox 2007 use wind fields determined by doppler radar to estimate the trajectories of falling drops and thereby assess the error induced in surface rainfall rate qiang and dawei 2014 propose a fully formulated scheme for the numerical simulation of raindrop movement in a three dimensional wind field the common ground of these studies is the necessity of wind data and furthermore the raindrop size distribution has to be assumed the term wind drift is used by the previous authors e g collier 1999 lack and fox 2007 and sandford 2015 to decribe the motion of the raindrops below the radar beam to a point on the surface that is not vertically below the radar observation to avoid confusion we use rainfall displacement to term the displacement of rainfall not necessarily between the level of the radar beam and the surface but between two images measured at different altitudes by different radars furthermore in this paper rainfall displacement not only refers to the displacement that can be observed spatially e g between contemporaneous radar images measured at different altitudes but also the displacement that can be observed temporally between images measured at different time steps by one radar this paper has two focuses first a technique is proposed to quantify the rainfall displacement between two radar images and between a radar image and a number of contemporaneous surface observations second radar and gauge data are combined to give a complete description of surface precipitation where radar data is used semi quantitatively as a pattern indicator and at the same time rainfall displacement information from the radar beam to ground level is integrated in a stochastic manner such that the agreement of radar and gauge data is maximized 2 study domain and data the study domain is located in the district of reutlingen in the southeast of germany the climate there is mild with the average annual rainfall of about 1040 mm and the average annual temperature of around 9 1 c the climate is considered to be temperate oceanic cfb according to the köppen geiger climate classification system as indicated in fig 1 the study domain is a square in the grid with the side length of 19 km a gauge network consisting of 12 pluviometers is available within the domain the weighing rain gauges are owned by stadtentwässerung reutlingen which record and document precipitation every 1 min the german weather service dwd runs a network of 17 c band radars available data for the study domain are from radar türkheim abbreviated as tur and radar feldberg abbreviated as fbg as shown in fig 2 dwd uses the dx file format to encode local radar sweeps in this study raw dx products are used which are then subject to a processing chain composed of arranged in order clutter removal gabella and notarpietro 2002 attenuation correction krämer and verworn 2008 jacobi and heistermann 2016 re projection from polar coordinates to cartesian grid clip the square data for the study domain beam blockage is avoided in the data aquisition all the processing steps in this study are operated under the environment of wradlib an open source library for weather radar data processing heistermann et al 2013 a weather radar takes snapshots of reflectivity distribution over a large area from which the distribution of precipitation intensity is estimated the snapshots of reflectivity are expressed as plan position indicators or ppis there is a systematic change of ppis in the observation height with range as the domain that we are researching is relatively small the change in elevation is neglected the center of the domain is approximately 45 km from tur and 113 km from fbg with the elevation angle as low as possible to avoid ground echoes and under the normal propagation condition tur and fbg are measuring at 1280 m and 2280 m above the ground m a g respectively considering the small size of the study domain neglecting the change in elevation the spatial pattern indicated by radar is not affected by the bright band phenomenon 3 rainfall displacement in this section a method is proposed to quantify rainfall displacement we discuss two possibilities to recognize rainfall displacement one is by comparing two radar images either measured by one radar at different time steps or measured at the same time by different radars at different altitudes the former the displacement observed in time is more related to the evolution of radar images which has been addressed by former authors such as rinehart and garvey 1978 horn and schunck 1981 and bab hadiashar et al 1996 while the displacement observed spatially between two radar images at different altitudes is rarely mentioned if the two are images of instantaneous rainfall intensity at the same instant the displacement in between can be considered as a guide to assess the velocity vector of the field at that instant the other possibility to recognize rainfall displacement is by comparing a radar image with a number of contemporaneous rain gauge observations in this case the displacement of rainfall is assessed between the level of the radar beam and the ground which makes the quantified displacement information even more useful to be integrated into the surface precipitation estimation note that the second possibility only applies for accumulated rainfall as rain gauges are poor in capturing the instantaneous rainfall intensity in this sense the quantified displacement vector can be considered as a mean displacement vector on the relevant time period note that the proposed method is suitable for a domain of small size as it is assumed that all pixels in the field move uniformly along a vector to take the rainfall displacement uncertainty into account the displacement vector is considered as a random variable and the result of the quantification is not a single best vector but a probability matrix analogous to a probability mass function indicating the probability of a field of displacement vectors 3 1 quantification of the rainfall displacement between two radar images the details of the algorithm are described as follows 1 a positive integer m is set as the limit of the displacement i e the maximum number of pixels allowed for the overall migration of the original image for the case where no information concerning the wind direction is available directions in the north south east and west are given an equal chance 2 a regular cartesian grid h ij is defined where i j m m 1 0 m 1 m the coordinates of each grid point are given by 1 h ij α i α j where α is the spatial resolution of the resulting rank correlation matrix the same resolution as used in the radar image h ij is used to indicate the displacement vector 3 the similarity of two images is measured by spearman s rank correlation or simply rank correlation the reason why rank correlation is employed as the measure is due to the assumption that the evolution of radar images is non linear unlike the correlation coefficient which measures the linear relationship the rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship which suits this specific case it is worth noting that reflectivity z can be used directly in the calculation of rank correlation due to the monotonic relationship between z and r thus no assumption about the z r relation is required let r x r y denote two radar images the rank correlation between image r x and the shifted image r y shifted by vector h ij is calculated by 2 ρ ij r s r x r y h h ij where r s is the formula of spearman s rank correlation note that the calculation in eq 2 is applied for every element in h ij and the resultant ρ ij is a matrix termed the rank correlation matrix there exists a one to one correspondence between entries in ρ ij and entries in the cartesian grid h ij the higher the value of the entry in ρ ij the more likely the corresponding vector in h ij is the actual displacement vector as many vectors in h ij deliver quite similar results the displacement vector can be considered as a random variable 4 following the thinking that the higher the value of the entry in ρ ij and so the more likely the corresponding entry in h ij the probability mass function p ij of the displacement vector can be calculated as 3 p h h ij p ij 0 for ρ ij ρ oo g ρ ij ρ oo else where ρ oo is the original rank correlation when the corresponding shift is 0 0 function g x is monotonically increasing when x 0 and continuous at zero i e g 0 0 ρ oo is used as the threshold value it means the field is subject to a zero wind field any displacement vector in h ij associated with an entry in ρ ij with a higher value than ρ oo is considered to be more likely to be the displacement vector than 0 0 the threshold value could be increased if a large portion of vectors in h ij are shown to be greater than ρ oo but the choice relies on subjective judgement there is a wide selection of functions g x such as the power function x a the exponential function e bx 1 and the logarithmic function ln cx 1 where a b and c are positive constants the first derivative of g x matters as large dg dx means more weights are given to those displacement vectors associated with higher rank correlations the choice of the g x function influences the result but only to a minor extent on the final estimates of surface rainfall where the quantified displacement information is integrated as demonstrated by yan 2018 in chapter 4 3 3 in this study we use a simple power function g x x 2 p ij is further scaled by a constant to ensure the sum of all entries equals 1 4 p ij p ij i j p ij the probability mass function of the displacement vector is also a matrix and is termed probability matrix which quantifies the rainfall displacement by indicating the probability of individual displacement vectors note that the scheme is not applicable when the rank correlation of two images is low normally without any structured texture in the rank correlation matrix even after applying a bunch of displacement vectors this could happen for two images with remarkable difference in measurement height or time step this also applies to the case to be discussed in section 3 2 3 2 quantification of the rainfall displacement between a radar image and a number of contemporaneous surface observations the quantification of the rainfall displacement between a radar image and a number of contemporaneous surface observations is very similar as the algorithm described in section 3 1 only differing in step 3 first the limit of the shift is determined and the cartesian grid h ij is defined as described in steps 1 and 2 in section 3 1 there are 1 a map r aloft given by radar and 2 k surface observations z k located at s k k 1 k the radar map shifted by vector in h ij is denoted as r ij r ij r h h ij the rank correlation between gauge observations and the collocated radar data in the shifted field is calculated by 5 ρ ij r s z k r ij s k the result is a rank correlation matrix ρ ij that is in one to one correspondence with the cartesian grid h ij the measure of similarity is still the rank correlation due to the monotonicity of the two datasets being of interest note that the rank correlation measures the difference between radar and gauge data the higher the rank correlation the smaller the difference between radar and gauge data and vice versa then the probability matrix p ij is generated according to step 4 in section 3 1 note that the same g x x 2 is employed and ρ oo is still used as the threshold value 3 3 examples the proposed scheme is first used to quantify the displacement between two radar images 5 min apart as illustrated in fig 3 the left and middle panels indicate two instantaneous maps of rain rate by tur at different time steps and the right is the rank correlation matrix ρ ij derived from the two the shift is limited to 8 pixels to the north south east and west and the resolution of ρ ij is the same as that of the radar maps i e 500 500 m ρ ij indicates the most likely displacement vectors of the field i e pixels colored darker green in fig 3 right the scheme is then used to quantify the displacement between two radar images measured at different altitudes at the same instant as illustrated in fig 4 the left and middle panels indicate two instantaneous maps of rain rate for the same instant by fbg left and tur middle the ρ ij derived from the two are shown on the right with the same shifting limit and resolution as in fig 3 note that the weird look of the map in the left panel is due to the degradation of map resolution at far range of the radar beam the z r relation used in the conversion is z 254 r 1 42 the same parameterization as adopted by dwd 4 surface precipitation estimation once the rainfall displacement is quantified the next step is to integrate the information of rainfall displacement into the surface precipitation estimation 4 1 radar quantile map to estimate the rainfall field on the ground radar data and surface observations are combined it should be clarified that in this study radar data is used semi quantitatively to indicate the spatial pattern of precipitation at the surface specifically each radar map is scaled between 0 and 1 with a uniform distribution in quantiles thus a radar map after scaling is referred to as a quantile map the procedure is illustrated by the example shown in fig 4 the left and middle panels show two maps of precipitation rate measured at different altitudes at the same instant the magnitudes of the two maps differ remarkably while they both indicate a similar spatial pattern the great variation in rainfall magnitude in the vertical might be produced by the bright band effect but the cause is not the main focus here the point is the similarity in the spatial pattern at different altitudes in fact it was often found that similar patterns at the two levels had widely different magnitudes all of them serve as evidence that the rainfall related magnitudes can vary wildly in the vertical while the spatial patterns in the quantile maps are relatively stable it is therefore proposed in this study that radar maps measured aloft should be used semi quantitatively to indicate the spatial pattern of precipitation at the surface 4 2 the expected rainfall field given that radar data should be used semi quantitatively as a pattern indicator for surface precipitation the next step is to combine the radar quantile map and surface observations with the information of rainfall displacement being integrated the details of the combination scheme are described as follows 1 the probability matrix p ij carrying the rainfall displacement information between the relevant radar image of accumulated rainfall and a number of contemporaneous surface observations is determined according to the algorithm described in section 3 2 2 before importing the information of rainfall displacement some nomenclature should be clarified let r denote the radar rainfall field without shifting and u denote the corresponding quantile map the radar rainfall field shifted by vectors in h ij denoted as r ij has the corresponding quantile map u ij which can be calculated by 6 u ij g ij r ij where g ij is the empirical cumulative distribution function of r ij 3 generate a marginal distribution function whereby a quantile map can be converted to a rainfall map the generation scheme of the marginal distribution function is described as follows a the locations of the rain gauges s 1 s k and the corresponding observations z 1 z k are determined the gauge observations are then sorted in ascending order z 1 z k b the collocated radar quantiles are determined u ij s 1 u ij s k u 1 u k and also sorted in ascending order u 1 u k note that the sorting procedure in a and b will destroy the original one to one correspondence of gauge observations and the collocated radar quantiles if the two datasets have different rankings however without sorting points z k u k k 1 k cannot be placed on a monotonic increasing line which would destroy the nature of the marginal distribution function c set u 0 the probability of zero precipitation z 0 0 which can be considered as the ratio of the rainfall area to the total area of the field if the smallest gauge observation z 1 is zero then z 0 u 0 z 1 u 1 otherwise u 0 u 1 2 d it is then assumed that the two datasets z k and u k have one to one correspondence and they are the points on the marginal distribution function f ij in between these points linear interpolation is employed 7 f ij z u k u k 1 z k z k 1 z z k 1 u k 1 with z k 1 and z k being the two nearest neighbors of z where z k 1 z z k u k 1 and u k being the quantiles corresponding to z k 1 and z k e due to the fact that the rain gauges are sparse relative to radar data and non uniformly distributed in the domain it is very likely that the extremes of the rainfall field cannot be sampled properly by the gauges thus extrapolation is employed to take care of the extremes z z k an exponential distribution function is used for the extropolation as given by eq 8 the only parameter λ is calculated by eq 9 8 f z 1 e λ z for z 0 0 for z 0 9 λ 1 z k ln 1 u k where z k u k is the pair composed of the largest gauge observation and the maximum collocated radar quantile the exponential distribution function is used because compared to the more complex weibull or gamma distributions it is simple and adequately describes the rainfall behaviour note that the generation scheme of the marginal distribution function is based on the assumption that the gauge observations are representative of the entire field the assumption might be invalid on some occasions for example the gauge observations are not representative if the upper or lower quantiles of the field are not sampled properly fig 5 shows two 15 min events where the upper and lower quantiles are not sampled properly by the gauges note that the gauge observations are plotted next to their locations at the top and the collocated radar data are plotted accompanied at the bottom table 1 lists the ranked gauge observations and the collocated radar quantiles for the two events in fig 5 thus to improve the applicability of the proposed scheme it is preferable that there should be more rain gauges uniformly distributed in the domain of interest 4 through the marginal distribution function the quantile map u ij can be converted to a rainfall map by applying the inverse of the marginal and finally the information of rainfall displacement is introduced by 10 z i j p ij f ij 1 u ij note that each rainfall field converted from u ij plays a part in the final estimation but different rainfall fields have different impacts those vectors in h ij delivering higher rank correlations and thus associated with larger probability in p ij are more influential whereby the introduction of rainfall displacement information maximizes the rank correlation or minimizes the conflict between gauge observations and the collocated radar quantiles as the resultant field is a weighted average of multiple fields it is termed the expected rainfall field it should be clarified that the expected here is in the statistical sense as the displacement vector is considered as a random variable the displacement information is given as the probability matrix of the displacement vector and the information is therefore integrated in a stochastic manner 4 3 example the proposed method is used to generate surface precipitation for a 15 min event shown in the right panel in fig 6 for comparison the surface precipitation ignoring the information of rainfall displacement is shown in the left panel which is obtained by direct conversion of the quantile map without shifting by its corresponding marginal 11 z f 1 g r f 1 u where g denotes the empirical cumulative distribution function of r the rank correlation ρ between the gauge observations and the collocated estimates has been calculated for both cases and labelled in the figure title an increase in ρ from 0 802 to 0 951 has been observed which actually shows an increase in the agreement of radar and gauge data due to the integration of displacement information as a weighted average procedure is applied there is a smoothing effect in the resultant expected field fig 7 reveals the smoothing effect by the marginal of the expected rainfall field red line namely the empirical cumulative distribution function of the expected rainfall field which is much smoother compared to the other marginals in fig 7 note that the marginals of the shifted rainfall fields and the rainfall field without shift are obtained according to the procedure described in section 4 2 step 3 it should be stressed that the proposed scheme uses only one radar image it is recommended that the lower image should be used as it is more relevant with the surface precipitation unless otherwise specified in this study the lower radar image by tur is used in the surface precipitation estimation nonetheless different estimates of surface precipitation can be generated based on radar images measured at different altitudes fig 8 shows two estimates of surface precipitation for the same event based on the two radars fbg left and tur right note that the two estimates use the same gauge observations the corresponding radar images are shown in fig 9 the similarity of the two estimates shows the relative independence of the procedure on the measurement height of radar images the expected rainfall field is effective in reducing the mismatch of radar and gauge data it represents the product with both the radar pattern and rainfall displacement information being integrated however there exists a discrepancy between gauge observations and the collocated estimates from the expected rainfall field the failure is due to the fact that no constraints have been imposed on those estimates despite the discrepancy at gauge locations the estimates from the expected rainfall fields are far superior to the similar products with only the radar pattern being integrated namely the products ignoring the displacement information to demonstrate this point an experiment was made before describing the experiment it needs to be noted that the goodness of an estimate is measured by the discrepancy at the gauge locations the smaller the discrepancy the better the estimate four error statistics are selected to quantify the discrepancy mean error me root mean square error rmse pearson s correlation coefficient ρ p and kling gupta efficiency kge detailed description of the four error statistics is given in section 5 4 for sixty relatively heavy 15 min events the expected rainfall fields are generated and the error statistics between the gauge observations and the collocated estimates are calculated the results are the data series of the four error statistics of length 60 the means of the four series are calculated and presented in table 2 under the column labelled displacement for comparison the results for the rainfall fields with only the radar pattern being integrated ignoring the displacement information are listed under no displacement the comparison of the two demonstrates the benefit of introducing the rainfall displacement information in the surface precipitation estimation 5 geostatistical improvement in this section the expected rainfall field is further improved at gauge locations by geostatistical interpolation methods kriging with external drift and residual kriging geostatistical methods are founded on the principles of statistical spatial autocorrelation these methods interpolate the variable of interest at known locations to the unknown locations providing a linear estimator 12 z x i 1 n λ i z x i where the weights λ i are chosen a priori such that the estimation is unbiased and the estimation variance is minimized i e best linear unbiased estimate blue 5 1 kriging with external drift kriging with external drift ked ahmed and de marsily 1987 permits a trend in the regionalized variable a second variable y is assumed to be linearly correlated with the first variable z by 13 e z x a y x b where a and b are constants the optimum weights of the linear estimator are obtained by minimizing the variance of the estimation error e z x z x 2 under the unbiased condition ked has been frequently applied in various disciplines of practice and science e g bourennane et al 2000 van de kassteele et al 2009 in this study the second variable is the expected rainfall field given as a regular grid of precipitation the realizations of the first variable z are given by the rain gauge observations due to the small number of the realizations of z it is difficult to derive a variogram therefrom hence the variogram is derived from the rainfall field obtained by converting the radar quantile map by its inverse marginal distribution the expected rainfall field is not used in the derivation of the variogram due to its smoothing effect the expected rainfall field is not a realization of surface precipitation as it is a weighted average of multiple fields the variogram derived from such a smooth field usually presents an extended correlation length 5 2 residual kriging in the procedure of residual kriging rk ordinary kriging ok is first applied to interpolate the residuals at gauge locations to the entire field in the present case the residuals means the difference between gauge observations z x i and the estimates at gauge locations from the expected rainfall field z y x i 14 r x i z x i z y x i the estimate is obtained by superimposing the ordinary kriging results of the residuals on the expected rainfall field 15 z x z y x r x 5 3 examples the algorithms of ked and rk are used to improve the expected rainfall field of a 15 min event as shown in fig 10 for comparison the estimate by ok is shown accompanied which is purely based on the rain gauge observations denoted by the red crosses in the figures as shown by the example in fig 10 the estimate by ok has difficulty in capturing the spatial pattern due to the sparsity of the rain gauge observations in this case the estimates by ked and rk are similar because the radar quantiles are properly sampled at the gauge locations namely large and small quantiles are both sampled approximate uniform distribution of the sampled quantiles whereby the trend information could be adequately captured by ked thus the estimate by ked is similar with that by rk where the detrended residuals participate in the kriging operation 5 4 cross validation the leave one out cross validation loocv method is employed to test the performance of different geostatistical methods ok ked and rk the method uses a single rain gauge observation from the original samples as the validation data and the remaining observations as the training data the procedure is repeated such that each observation in the samples has been used once as the validation data four error statistics the measure of the difference between the sample values and the corresponding loocv estimates for all the samples are selected to evaluate the performance of these methods details of the four error statistics are listed below the mean error me checks if the estimation is biased or not chua and bras 1982 16 me 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i the root mean square error rmse is a measure of the size of the error where the estimates are considered to be accurate if the rmse is close to zero 17 rmse 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i 2 the pearson s correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation of two variables x and y 18 ρ x y e x μ x y μ y σ x σ y with μ x μ y being the means of x y and σ x σ y being the standard deviations of x y to take the variability of the estimates into account the kling gupta efficiency kge is introduced kge is expressed as the difference between unity and the euclidian distance ed from the ideal point in the three dimensional criteria space 19 kge 1 ed 20 ed ρ 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 with ρ being the pearson s correlation coefficient α being the variability error as expressed in eq 21 and β representing the bias error as expressed in eq 22 21 α σ est σ obs 22 β μ est μ obs with μ est μ obs being the mean of the estimated and the observed variables and σ est σ obs representing the standard deviation of the estimated and the observed variables all three components α β and ρ are dimensionless and have their ideal values at unity hence the value of kge ranges from to 1 with unity being the ideal case the loocv procedure is applied to 24 15 min events these events are relatively heavy with evident spatial variability as measured by the standard deviation the 15 min duration is used because the radar based estimates of surface precipitation have great potential to be used as the data source for the early detection of flooding which is demanding on the rapidity of data acquisition the descriptive statistics of gauge data for these events are provided in table 3 note that the expected rainfall field is also generated according to the rule of loocv with one gauge observation hidden for each cross validation sub process the cross validation results are shown in table 4 note that the results of me are ignored here as the differences of this statistic are similar and small for each event the method with the best performance in terms of rmse the pearson s correlation coefficient ρ p and kge are written in bold and italics as shown by the table 13 best performances in terms of rmse are from ok versus 11 from ked and rk 11 best performances in terms of ρ p are from ok versus 13 from ked and rk the scores of ked and rk are added up because they both represent the performance of the estimates integrating the information on radar spatial pattern and rainfall displacement thus for the two statistics rmse and ρ p it ends in a draw however in terms of the capability of preserving the variability measured by kge none of the estimates from ok perform the best in fact kge is the most informative statistic for both low and high rainfalls and should be given more weight in decision making comparing the results from ked and rk rk seems more advantageous in terms of rmse 2 best performances from ked versus 9 from rk ρ p 6 best performances from ked versus 7 from rk and kge 9 best performances from ked versus 15 from rk however for many events the differences in the values of these statistics are not obvious especially for kge and ρ p to demonstrate the benefit of integrating the rainfall displacement information in the quantitative precipitation estimation qpe at ground level an extra experiment was made the method of rk is used where the second variable is the radar based estimate without importing the rainfall displacement information i e the rainfall field converted from the radar quantile map without shift the loocv procedure is applied again to these 24 events and the results are evaluated by the four error statistics and then compared with the similar results by rk using the expected rainfall field as the second variable i e displacement integrated products the results of the experiment are shown in table 5 with the best performances in terms of the four error statistics printed in bold and italics the overwhelming superiority of the displacement integrated estimates demonstrates the benefit of introducing the rainfall displacement information in the qpe process 6 conclusion the focus of the paper is to estimate the rainfall field at the surface over a short time period based on weather radar and surface observations the innovations of the study come in three aspects first it has been made clear that the value of radar is evident when it is used as a pattern indicator compared to the unpredictable change of the rainfall related magnitudes along the vertical column the change in the spatial pattern is relatively small and traceable therefore the pattern measured aloft after some modification a horizontal uniform shift over a relatively small area can be used as the pattern of surface precipitation second the gauge observations are used as a guide as to how much and in what direction the field should be moved such that the mismatch between radar and gauge data can be reduced the third innovation is the method used to introduce the rainfall displacement information in the qpe process where the rainfall displacement uncertainty is taken into account by considering the displacement vector as a random variable and thus the displacement information is imported as the probability mass function of the random variable the rainfall field obtained by combining the radar quantile map and surface observations with the rainfall displacement information being integrated the expected rainfall field is further improved by kriging with external drift ked and residual kriging rk to fulfill the point equality constraints at gauge locations the results obtained from ked and rk are superior to ordinary kriging between the gauges as expected due to the introduction of the spatial pattern from radar as well as the integration of rainfall displacement information in particular the benefit of introducing rainfall displacement information is further demonstrated by the overwhelming superiority of the displacement integrated estimates by using rk over the similar products without displacement information being integrated acknowledgements thanks to professor geoff

6459,fluid flow architecture in fractured reservoirs is mainly based on the dual porosity model in this model the matrix block is considered as a fluid storage source and fracture as a flow path nevertheless in naturally fractured reservoirs different properties of matrix blocks and fracture systems have caused the triple porosity model to be more applicable than the traditional dual porosity model the existed triple porosity models presented so far are mainly based on pseudo steady state flow in the matrix block and vug and via a semi analytic form in this paper two analytical models of triple porosity model are presented with consideration of transient flow the first model being the series flow of the matrix block to the vug and the vug to the fracture and the second model transient parallel flow of the matrix block and vug to the fracture in this paper for the first time an analytical and transient shape factor between different regions is put forward using the developed new solution various flow regimes in triple porosity model have been identified in the series triple porosity model changing the parameters of vug and matrix did not affect the early production while it influenced the rate of the middle and lately times the shape factor between the matrix and vug was independent of the physical properties of vug while the shape factor between vug and fracture was influenced by the physical properties of vug and matrix in the parallel triple porosity model the shape factor of matrix fracture and vug fracture were not dependent on the properties of the other regions of rock moreover a decrease in inter porosity coefficient and an increase in storativity ratio increased the shape factor in transient time additionally in order to validate the analytical model the results of the model are compared with the numerical simulations this study presents a new analytical and transient shape factor which finds application in simulation of triple porosity

decades fluid flow in fractured reservoir has been addressed dejam et al 2009 dejam and hassanzadeh 2011 dejam et al 2014 mashayekhizadeh et al 2011 mashayekhizadeh et al 2012 since it has a wide range of applications dejam 2019 a triple porosity model is used to model a porous media that has three regions with a different physical properties the triple porosity model is presented for modeling the fluid flow in the fracture and two matrix blocks with different properties or a matrix block and two fracture system with different properties alahmadi 2010 tivayanonda 2012 ci qun 1983 represented the analytical solution of the triple porosity model with consideration of the pseudo steady state flow in two matrix blocks with different physical properties that flows to the fracture they provided their model in a two dimensional and in a finite and infinite porous medium abdassah and ershaghi 1986 presented the triple porosity semi analytic model for the first time in petroleum engineering they examined two models the horizontal matrix blocks separated by the fractures and the matrix blocks of the uniformly separated from each other by their perpendicular fractures two matrix blocks with different rock properties were considered as a fracture flow source jalali and ershaghi 1987 developed the abdassah and ershaghi 1986 model they provided a triple porosity model by considering two matrix blocks and the radial flow inside the fracture the flow of fluid within the matrix blocks was considered to be pseudo steady state transient and the combination of these two al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 considered a triple porosity model for two fracture systems with different physical properties their represented model consisted of a matrix block and two fractures with permeability of one of the fractures being greater than the other the model of al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 examines two states a a micro fracture is replaced with one of the matrix blocks in the abdassah and ershaghi 1986 model and the fluid is transferred from the matrix and micro fracture block to the macro fracture and then produced from the well b the flow of fluid is transferred from the matrix block to the micro fracture and from the micro fracture to the macro fracture which moves from the macro or micro fracture to the well the flow of fluid in the matrix block is linear and pseudo steady state and in the fracture system is radial and transient liu et al 2003 developed warren and root 1963 dual porosity model to provide a triple porosity model their model includes a fracture matrix block and vug the fluid flow is transmitted only from the fracture to the well and the flow of fluid in the matrix block and the vug is linear and pseudo steady state in this model unlike the previous models there exists a fluid flow between the vug and the matrix wu et al 2007 used the work accomplished by liu et al 2003 to study fluid flow in a fracture vug and matrix system using dimensionless parameters and taking into account two parameters of wellbore storage and skin they presented a triple porosity semi analytical model and attempted to calculate reservoir parameters using field data dreier et al 2004 considered the transient flow between the micro and macro fracture to develop the al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 model they also presented the quad porosity model by considering the fluid flow of the matrix block to the micro fracture or the micro and macro fractures nie et al 2009 studied the triple porosity model with respect to the flow of the matrix and vug to the fracture system the same as the jalali and ershaghi 1987 model hassanzadeh et al 2009 stated that shape factors are boundary conditional through the semi analytical solution of diffusivity equation for different matrix geometry in the fracture the difference between their work and the previous model was the involvement of transient and spherical flow in the matrix block and vug and also the effect of quadratic pressure gradient in the triple porosity model al ahmadi and wattenbarger 2011 investigated the triple porosity model in different flow states in a semi stable and transient region between different regions considering the triple porosity system the relationship between matrix and micro cleavage with macro gap al ahmadi and wattenbarger 2011 put forward a triple porosity model in which the fluid flow occurs from the matrix to the micro fracture and from the micro fracture to the macro fracture the triple porosity model only considered pseudo steady state and transient flow regimes dehghanpour and shirdel 2011 presented a transient and pseudo steady state model of the triple porosity model wherein spherical flow occurs in the matrix and vug systems and radial flow in the fracture guo et al 2012 investigated a dual permeability flow model of well test analysis in a triple porosity reservoir they considered inter porosity flows from a vug to both a fracture system and matrix block and inter porosity flow from a matrix block to a fracture system in accordance with the pressure responses from fractured reservoirs and methods for interpreting pressure data such as pressure derivatives fractured reservoir pressure responses impose a different triple porosity behavior from that of dual porosity behavior several studies have already been carried out on the well test of fractured reservoirs with triple porosity data interpretation model matching and reservoir parameters calculation al ghamdi et al 2011 escobar et al 2004 li et al 2006 mirshekari et al 2007 wang and zhang 2008 yang et al 2005 zhao et al 2010 camacho velazquez et al 2002 attempted to make interpretations of the well test data for fractured reservoirs taking into account the triple porosity single permeability porosity model the initial flow occurs only within the fracture and the triple porosity double permeability model the initial flow occurs within the fracture and the vug ali et al 2013 developed an analytical procedure to determine the reservoir parameters such as length of fracture and micro fractures and matrix permeability in triple porosity model huang et al 2015 presented a new triple porosity model for shale gas reservoirs to describe that gas flows from formation to wellbore with considering diffusion of the dissolved gas molecules in kerogen bulk desorption from the pore walls knudsen diffusion and slip flow in nanopores and conventional flow in natural fracture network sang et al 2016 proposed a numerical triple porosity model considering desorption and molecular diffusion in the kerogen and viscous flow in the matrix and fracture system qiu and li 2018 derived a new analytical solution by integration transform for history matching and forecasting field production data dejam et al 2018 investigated the role of a hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a finite dual porosity reservoir the semi analytical solution allows identification of five flow regimes and can be applicable to a model for estimating reservoir parameters development of a straightforward solution for series and parallel triple porosity models is still lacking in literature also the shape factor coefficients in the literature are expressed for the dual porosity model abbasi et al 2018 hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 hassanzadeh et al 2009 ranjbar et al 2013 and they cannot be used to model the triple porosity model in order to address this existing gap two analytical models series and parallel triple porosity models are presented with consideration of transient flow and an analytical and transient shape factor between different regions is put forward therefore the findings of this study can improve the current understandings of the fluid flow in triple porosity formations the organization for this work is as follows first two analytical models of triple porosity considering the series transient flow from the matrix block to the vug and the vug to the fracture as well as the parallel flow of the matrix block and vug to the fracture are presented fig 1 then based on the importance of shape factor parameter for simulation of fractured reservoirs a transient analytical relationship for calculating the shape factor between different regions is delineated also the effect of physical parameters of different regions on production flow and shape factor was investigated subsequently an equation for the shape factor is presented that has matrix and fracture parameters and is enormously applicable in simulating fluid flow in fractured reservoirs finally in order to validate the analytical model the results of the model are compared with the numerical simulator 2 basic model in this section the triple porosity models are described regarding the way that fluid is transferred from the matrix to the vug and the fracture as well as the vug to the fracture the triple porosity models are expressed in two ways 2 1 series fluid flow between the regions in the triple porosity model in this triple porosity model fluid flows from the matrix to the vug and subsequently from the vug to the fracture system fig 2 shows the schematic of this state of triple porosity model in which there is no direct flow between the matrix and the fracture with respect to the fluid flow symmetry in fig 2 for the modeling of the fluid flow in the triple porosity model half of the model can be considered and as in fig 3 the no flow boundary condition is used the proposed exact analytical model can be applied as a basic tool for flow modeling in heterogeneous porous and stimulated reservoir volume srv where there micro fractures can be considered as vug 2 2 parallel fluid flow between the regions in the triple porosity model in this triple porosity model the fluid flow is transmitted directly from the matrix to the fracture system fig 4 shows the schematic of this state of triple porosity model due to the flow symmetry within the matrix block and vug and the homogeneity of these two regions the boundary conditions of the matrix and vug blocks are no flow and the fluid flow is linearly transmitted from the matrix block and vug to the fracture fig 5 to make this mathematical model more tractable and easy to understand the following assumptions are given each medium is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic constant fluid properties flow of slightly compressible fluid with constant viscosity the fracture vug and matrix are initially at the same initial pressure symmetric flow in matrix both series and parallel triple porosity model and vug parallel triple porosity model fluid flows through the fractures to the wellbore 3 analytical model in this section the triple porosity analytical model is presented considering series and parallel fluid flow between the regions in the fractured reservoirs note that the fluid flow between the regions is transient 3 1 series triple porosity model in this study a new analytical solution for fluid flow in the triple porosity model has been developed which may be used to model the flow in a porous medium that has different rock properties in various locations the basic fluid flow equation in the fracture vug and matrix blocks is the diffusivity equation which can be expressed as follows d i d 2 p i d x 2 d p i dt where 1 d i k ϕ μ c t i where d is the diffusivity coefficient k is the permeability ϕ is the porosity µ is the viscosity ct is the compressibility the fracture vug and matrix blocks are identified by index 1 2

physical properties which has a high accuracy and low computational cost than numerical methods 3 2 parallel triple porosity model considering the control volume in the fracture and the material balance law we can obtain the differential equation governing the flow of fluid in the fracture jalali and ershaghi 1987 the fluid flow equation in the fracture is as follows 8 φ μ c t k f p f t 2 p f

fluid flow of the block of matrix and vug can occur in the linear cylindrical and spherical forms when the flow in the matrix block vug is cylindrical or spherical then the matrix block pressure in the triple porosity model will be the same as in table 2 which hassanzadeh et al 2009 also introduced for the dual porosity model in this study we proved the governing equations for triple porosity model in the case of slab geometry eqn 40 derivation for cylindrical and spherical flow is not given here and only final form is shown in table 2 4 shape factor between regions in the single porosity model considering the different regions matrix vug and fracture alongside each other the flow equations are discrete and solved in these regions and due to the property differences between the regions the duration of the simulation time increases and the simulation results may not converge abbasi et al 2018 for this purpose the dual and triple porosity model is used to model this type of reservoirs to express the fluid transfer between different regions the concept of the shape factor is expressed kazemi 1969 warren and root 1963 the shape factors introduced so far for the dual porosity model usually have a constant value bourbiaux et al 1999 lim and aziz 1995 however the fluid transfer rate between different regions at the initial times is greater and this value decreases gradually to reach its lowest value stabilized value in this section the transient and analytical shape factors between the matrix and the vug as well as the vug and fracture in the triple porosity model are discussed the relationship between the pressure difference in the matrix vug system vug fracture system and the fluid flow rate is expressed in the following this proportion is defined by introducing a shape factor σ hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 19 q m k m ρ μ σ p m p f also the fluid flow in a porous medium whose end is a no flow boundary is expressed as 20 q m ϕ m c m ρ p m t by integrating eqs 19 and 20 we have 21 k m ρ μ σ ϕ m c m ρ p dm t p df p dm according to both series and parallel triple porosity models the shape factor between different regions in these two models is expressed as 4 1 series triple porosity model as shown in fig 2 in the series triple porosity model according to the fluid flow between the regions a shape factor between the matrix and the vug and a shape factor between the vug and the fracture is defined shape factor between matrix and vug 22 σ mv x 4 x 3 2 ϕ m c m μ x 4 x 3 2 k m p dm t p dv p dm shape factor between vug and fracture due to the fact that the flow inside the vug is transient the center of the vug is flowing we cannot use eq 20 to calculate the flow rate from the vug to the fracture instead we can use the darcy equation at the interface of these two media 23 q v k v μ x 3 x 2 p v x x x 2 and the shape factor is expressed as 24 σ vf x 3 x 2 2 p dv x x x 2 p df p dv x 3 x 2 4 2 parallel triple porosity model as shown in fig 4 in the parallel triple porosity model the matrix block and vug are directly adjusted to the fracture two shape factors between the regions can be expressed as follows shape factor between vug and fracture based on eq 21 and having p dv t d p dv and pdf one can express the vug shape factor as a function of triple porosity system parameters by 25 σ v φ c t v φ c t m φ c t v φ c t f a k f k v p

geometries of matrix block is presented in table 3 5 results and discussion in this section the results of both series and parallel triple porosity models are expressly discussed the effect of rock parameters of the matrix block vug and fracture on the rate and the shape factor between the regions is also investigated 5 1 series triple porosity model the proposed exact analytical model can be applied as a basic tool for flow modeling in heterogeneous porous media and is less time consuming when compared to equivalent numerical methods fig 6 shows the pressure distribution of a triple series porosity model at different times in order to illustrate the pressure distribution in the matrix vug and fracture the length of the regions is considered more and the data used in table 4 is given as shown in fig 6 there are three different flow regimes 1 pressure gradient in the fracture 1 m which is linear and due to its high permeability and its proximity to the well bore is very low 2 the pressure distribution in vug 3 m 1 m which has a moderate permeability is almost linear and the pressure gradient is larger than the fracture 3 pressure distribution in the matrix block 5 m 3 m with low permeability and consequently has the highest pressure drop to investigate the effect of permeability and length of vug and matrix on the flow rate in the series triple porosity model we use the inter porosity coefficient which is defined as follows 29 λ v 12 a x 3 x 2 2 k v k f 30 λ m 12 a x 4 x 3 2 k m k f where kv km kf are vug matrix and fracture permeability respectively λv inter porosity coefficient of vug λm inter porosity coefficient of matrix a is cross section area x3 x2 is vug length and x4 x3 is matrix block length based on series triple porosity model six flow regimes can be recognized as the pressure propagates through the fracture vug and matrix block system due to the linear flow in the fracture the flow rate is proportional to t these flow regimes are shown on the log log plot of 2 t q versus time in fig 7 and explained in details in the table 5 fig 8 shows the effect of the inter porosity coefficient of vug λv on the production rate in a series triple porosity model in fig 8 with increasing vug inter porosity coefficient λv i e increasing vug permeability or decreasing vug length the production rate increases and due to increasing vug permeability or decreasing vug length the pressure disturbance reaches the matrix block faster and the production flow from the matrix block is accelerated it is worth mentioning that vug inter porosity coefficient λv has no effect on the at the early time production i e when production comes from the fracture and at the very late time when the pressure drop reaches to the center of the matrix block fig 9 shows the effect of matrix inter porosity coefficient λm on the production rate in a series triple porosity model as shown in fig 9 by increasing the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the production rate increases when the pressure drop reaches the matrix block and does not affect the flow rate of the fracture and vug when the pressure drop reaches the matrix block the production rate increases at high values of the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm which means more permeability or a smaller matrix block length the pressure drop rapidly reaches the center of the matrix block and the flow regime becomes pseudo steady state fig 10 shows the effect of the vug inter porosity coefficient λv on the shape factor between the vug and fracture and also vug and matrix in the series triple porosity model as shown in fig 10 the vug inter porosity coefficient λv affects only the transient region of the shape factor between the vug and the fracture as the vug inter porosity coefficient λv increases the transit time of the vug fracture shape factor decreases and finally after passing the pressure drop and reaching it to the matrix block they equal at a constant value also the variation of vug inter porosity coefficient λv has no effect on the shape factor between the matrix block and the vug the value of the shape factor between the matrix and the vug in the pseudo steady state flow regime is proved to be 9 85 that is consistent with the previous studies abbasi et al 2018 hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 lim and aziz 1995 also the value of shape factor between the vug and the fracture in the pseudo steady state flow regime is proved to be the fixed number 8 which is consistent with the previous numerical studies in the case of dual porosity sarda et al 2001 fig 11 shows the effect of the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm on the shape factor between the vug and fracture and also vug and matrix in the series triple porosity model as shown in fig 11 the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm affects the transient region of the vug and matrix shape factor so that by increasing the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the transit time of the matrix vug shape factor decreases and quickly reaches the stabilized constant value of 9 85 which is consistent with previous studies abbasi et al 2018 the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm affects the coefficient of shape factor between the vug and the fracture so the matrix acts as a source for the vug and by increasing the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the pressure drop during the vug is less and the shape factor between the matrix and the fracture is also increased 5 2 parallel triple porosity model based on parallel triple porosity model five flow regimes can be recognized as the pressure propagates through the fracture vug and matrix block system these flow regimes are shown on the log log plot of 2 t d q d versus dimensionless time in fig 12 and explained in details in the table 6 fig 13 shows the vug inter porosity coefficient λv on the production rate in the parallel triple porosity model as shown in fig 8 the flow rate of the triple porosity model has two protuberance which shows the fluid transfer from the vug to fracture and the matrix block to the fracture in fig 13 with increasing vug inter porosity coefficient λv the amount of dimension flow rate increases at the first protuberance indicating the participation of the vug in production but it does not affect the dimensionless rate in the early time production from the fracture and late time production from the matrix block fig 14 shows the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm on the production rate in the parallel triple porosity model in fig 14 with increasing matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the amount of dimension flow rate increases at the second protuberance indicating the participation of the matrix in production but it does not affect the dimensionless rate in the early and middle time production from the fracture and vug middle time production from the vug and late time the pressure drop reaches the center of the matrix block and the flow is pseudo steady state fig 15 shows the effect of the vug storativity ratio ωv on the dimensionless rate from the fracture in fig 15 the total fluid flow rate including the fracture vug and matrix block is constant but by increasing the vug storativity ratio ωv decreasing the matrix storativity ratio ωm the oil rate increases fig 16 shows the effect of vug inter porosity coefficient λv on the vug fracture and matrix vug of the parallel triple porosity model in the near producing well as shown in fig 16 the vug inter porosity coefficient λv affects only the transient regime of the shape factor between the vug and the fracture so that by increasing the vug inter porosity coefficient λv the vug fracture shape factor quickly reaches to a stabilized value in the parallel triple porosity model owing to the fact that the fluid transfer from the matrix and vug system is performed separately and these two media have nothing to do with each other the change in the rock properties in one medium does not affect the other therefore one can conclude the vug inter porosity coefficient λv will only affect the shape factor between the matrix and the fracture in addition by comparing the vug fracture and the fracture matrix shape factor it can be said that due to the low permeability of the matrix the transient region of matrix fracture shape factor is always greater than that of the vug fracture shape factor fig 17 shows the effect of matrix or vug flow geometry on shape factor as shown in this figure shape factor of spherical flow is greater than the cylinder and the slab flow and converge to the different value at late time the shape factor of spherical cylinder and the slab flow show a transient period and then converges to constant value of 25 65 18 2 and 9 87 respectively pervious study reported a similar value for these matrix flow geometry hassanzadeh et al 2009 fig 18 shows the time as a function of vug inter porosity coefficient λv to reach the constant shape factor as shown in fig 15 by increasing the vug or matrix inter porosity coefficient the flow of fluid from the matrix or vug to the fracture occurs rapidly thus the shape factor reaches the stabilized value pseudo steady state faster fig 19 shows the effect of the vug and matrix storativity ratio on the vug fracture and matrix fracture shape factor as shown in fig 19 with increasing the vug storativity ratio ωv the greater the amount of fluid from the vug to the fracture which causes the transient shape factor to increase this is true for the matrix as well in fig 19 unlike increasing the vug storativity ratio ωv and decreasing matrix storativity ratio ωm increasing vug fracture shape factor in transient region is more than the reduction of the matrix fracture shape factor in transient region this is due to the low permeability of the matrix block relative to the vug which causes the ability to transfer fluid less than the matrix block as shown in figs 18 and 19 the two parameters of the inter porosity coefficient and the storativity ratio of the matrix and the vug affect the transient region and stabilization time of shape factor the shape factor consists of two transient and constant parts according to the time interval of each section the following relation can be presented for the areas near the wells 31 σ l islab i m a t r i x v u g 2 2 27 1 ω i 3 872 λ i t d 0 492 π 2

good fit with the actual shape factor in addition to the simplicity of the relationship it can be used in numerical and commercial simulators 6 validation 6 1 a series triple porosity model in order to validate the presented analytical model a numerical simulator was used the schematic of the model is shown in fig 21 the single porosity model is considered to have dimensions of 13 12 ft 948 ft 3 28 ft and the number of grids is 31 31 1 in order to verify the one dimensional flow the permeability of the matrix blocks was set to zero in the y and z directions the well was considered to be in the right section of model its volume is much larger than that of the matrix block which does not change the pressure of this grid by moving the fluid from the matrix block into the grid the parameters used to simulate the flow in the triple porosity model are given in table 7 fig 22 shows the matrix block vug and fracture average pressure of the analytical model and numerical simulator versus time as shown in fig 22 due to the high permeability and the proximity of the fracture to the opening of the fracture the average pressure of the fracture is equal to the bottom hole pressure and the average vug pressure decreases rapidly after a short time and is equal to the pressure of the production well the matrix block average pressure decreases slowly due to the low permeability and the distance from the production well and the fluid production continues until the pressure of the matrix block is equal to the pressure of the production well it can be seen that the presented analytical model is in good agreement with numerical simulator results and can be used for later studies 6 2 parallel triple porosity model in this section kazemi simulation data are used to validate the analytical parallel triple porosity model kazemi 1969 the data used to model the triple porosity is given in table 8 using the data in table 8 a numerical simulator model was constructed similar to fig 23 the gridding of the first and second media is logarithmic so that near the fracture which is a large drop in pressure the size of the grids is smaller and the distance from the fracture is larger in order to study the flow as a one dimensional the permeability of the first and second media are considered zero in the y and z directions fig 24 shows the mean pressure of the media 1 and 2 as shown in the figure and according to the data in table 8 we can say that k2 3 k1 and φ2 1 5φ1 which means that the pressure drop of the medium 2 less than the media 1 the results of the triple porosity analytical model show a good agreement with the simulation results 7 conclusions in this paper two triple porosity models were presented a series triple porosity model in which the fluid flows from the vug to the fracture and from the matrix to the vug b parallel triple porosity model where fluid within the matrix and vug blocks flows separately into the fracture the proposed models can be used in the modeling of dual porosity and simulation of heterogeneous porous media dynamic behavior rate and pressure change of these two models of triple porosity and different flow regimes were investigated presented analytical model is in good agreement with numerical simulator results and can be used for later studies two triple porosity analytical models presented in this study have led to the following conclusions in the series triple porosity model changing the parameters of vug and matrix did not affect the early production while changing the physical parameters of vug and matrix affected the rate of the middle and lately times respectively in the series triple porosity model the shape factor between matrix and vug was independent of the physical properties of vug and had two transient and constant regions and constant regions with a constant value of π2 in the series triple porosity model the shape factor between vug and fracture was influenced by the physical properties of vug and matrix which had a decreasing trend relative to time and finally reached a constant value of 8 in the parallel triple porosity model vug and matrix systems are separate and according to the physical parameters fluid flow from vug to the fracture is faster than flow from matrix into the fracture also the shape factor of matrix fracture and vug fracture are not dependent on the properties of the other regions of rock in the parallel triple porosity model the time needed for the shape factor to reach a constant value is a function of inter porosity coefficient and storativity ratio in such a way that decreasing inter porosity coefficient and increasing storativity ratio the shape factor in transient time presented shape factor correlation which is a function of the matrix vug and fracture parameter can be used in the simulation of fractured reservoirs with commercial dual or triple porosity model conflict of interest none declared appendix a a separation of

6459,fluid flow architecture in fractured reservoirs is mainly based on the dual porosity model in this model the matrix block is considered as a fluid storage source and fracture as a flow path nevertheless in naturally fractured reservoirs different properties of matrix blocks and fracture systems have caused the triple porosity model to be more applicable than the traditional dual porosity model the existed triple porosity models presented so far are mainly based on pseudo steady state flow in the matrix block and vug and via a semi analytic form in this paper two analytical models of triple porosity model are presented with consideration of transient flow the first model being the series flow of the matrix block to the vug and the vug to the fracture and the second model transient parallel flow of the matrix block and vug to the fracture in this paper for the first time an analytical and transient shape factor between different regions is put forward using the developed new solution various flow regimes in triple porosity model have been identified in the series triple porosity model changing the parameters of vug and matrix did not affect the early production while it influenced the rate of the middle and lately times the shape factor between the matrix and vug was independent of the physical properties of vug while the shape factor between vug and fracture was influenced by the physical properties of vug and matrix in the parallel triple porosity model the shape factor of matrix fracture and vug fracture were not dependent on the properties of the other regions of rock moreover a decrease in inter porosity coefficient and an increase in storativity ratio increased the shape factor in transient time additionally in order to validate the analytical model the results of the model are compared with the numerical simulations this study presents a new analytical and transient shape factor which finds application in simulation of triple porosity

decades fluid flow in fractured reservoir has been addressed dejam et al 2009 dejam and hassanzadeh 2011 dejam et al 2014 mashayekhizadeh et al 2011 mashayekhizadeh et al 2012 since it has a wide range of applications dejam 2019 a triple porosity model is used to model a porous media that has three regions with a different physical properties the triple porosity model is presented for modeling the fluid flow in the fracture and two matrix blocks with different properties or a matrix block and two fracture system with different properties alahmadi 2010 tivayanonda 2012 ci qun 1983 represented the analytical solution of the triple porosity model with consideration of the pseudo steady state flow in two matrix blocks with different physical properties that flows to the fracture they provided their model in a two dimensional and in a finite and infinite porous medium abdassah and ershaghi 1986 presented the triple porosity semi analytic model for the first time in petroleum engineering they examined two models the horizontal matrix blocks separated by the fractures and the matrix blocks of the uniformly separated from each other by their perpendicular fractures two matrix blocks with different rock properties were considered as a fracture flow source jalali and ershaghi 1987 developed the abdassah and ershaghi 1986 model they provided a triple porosity model by considering two matrix blocks and the radial flow inside the fracture the flow of fluid within the matrix blocks was considered to be pseudo steady state transient and the combination of these two al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 considered a triple porosity model for two fracture systems with different physical properties their represented model consisted of a matrix block and two fractures with permeability of one of the fractures being greater than the other the model of al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 examines two states a a micro fracture is replaced with one of the matrix blocks in the abdassah and ershaghi 1986 model and the fluid is transferred from the matrix and micro fracture block to the macro fracture and then produced from the well b the flow of fluid is transferred from the matrix block to the micro fracture and from the micro fracture to the macro fracture which moves from the macro or micro fracture to the well the flow of fluid in the matrix block is linear and pseudo steady state and in the fracture system is radial and transient liu et al 2003 developed warren and root 1963 dual porosity model to provide a triple porosity model their model includes a fracture matrix block and vug the fluid flow is transmitted only from the fracture to the well and the flow of fluid in the matrix block and the vug is linear and pseudo steady state in this model unlike the previous models there exists a fluid flow between the vug and the matrix wu et al 2007 used the work accomplished by liu et al 2003 to study fluid flow in a fracture vug and matrix system using dimensionless parameters and taking into account two parameters of wellbore storage and skin they presented a triple porosity semi analytical model and attempted to calculate reservoir parameters using field data dreier et al 2004 considered the transient flow between the micro and macro fracture to develop the al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 model they also presented the quad porosity model by considering the fluid flow of the matrix block to the micro fracture or the micro and macro fractures nie et al 2009 studied the triple porosity model with respect to the flow of the matrix and vug to the fracture system the same as the jalali and ershaghi 1987 model hassanzadeh et al 2009 stated that shape factors are boundary conditional through the semi analytical solution of diffusivity equation for different matrix geometry in the fracture the difference between their work and the previous model was the involvement of transient and spherical flow in the matrix block and vug and also the effect of quadratic pressure gradient in the triple porosity model al ahmadi and wattenbarger 2011 investigated the triple porosity model in different flow states in a semi stable and transient

model in which the fluid flow occurs from the matrix to the micro fracture and from the micro fracture to the macro fracture the triple porosity model only considered pseudo steady state and transient flow regimes dehghanpour and shirdel 2011 presented a transient and pseudo steady state model of the triple porosity model wherein spherical flow occurs in the matrix and vug systems and radial flow in the fracture guo et al 2012 investigated a dual permeability flow model of well test analysis in a triple porosity reservoir they considered inter porosity flows from a vug to both a fracture system and matrix block and inter porosity flow from a matrix block to a fracture system in accordance with the pressure responses from fractured reservoirs and methods for interpreting pressure data such as pressure derivatives fractured reservoir pressure responses impose a different triple porosity behavior from that of dual porosity behavior several studies have already been carried out on the well test of fractured reservoirs with triple porosity data interpretation model matching and reservoir parameters calculation al ghamdi et al 2011 escobar et al 2004 li et al 2006 mirshekari et al 2007 wang and zhang 2008 yang et al 2005 zhao et al 2010 camacho velazquez et al 2002 attempted to make interpretations of the well test data for fractured reservoirs taking into account the triple porosity single permeability porosity model the initial flow occurs only within the fracture and the triple porosity double permeability model the initial flow occurs within the fracture and the vug ali et al 2013 developed an analytical procedure to determine the reservoir parameters such as length of fracture and micro fractures and matrix permeability in triple porosity model huang et al 2015 presented a new triple porosity model for shale gas reservoirs to describe that gas flows from formation to wellbore with considering diffusion of the dissolved gas molecules in kerogen bulk desorption from the pore walls knudsen diffusion and slip flow in nanopores and conventional flow in natural fracture network sang et al 2016 proposed a numerical triple porosity model considering desorption and molecular diffusion in the kerogen and viscous flow in the matrix and fracture system qiu and li 2018 derived a new analytical solution by integration transform for history matching and forecasting field production data dejam et al 2018 investigated the role of a hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a finite dual porosity reservoir the semi analytical solution allows identification of five flow regimes and can be applicable to a model for estimating reservoir parameters development of a straightforward solution for series and parallel triple porosity models is still lacking in literature also the shape factor coefficients in the literature are expressed for the dual porosity model abbasi et al 2018 hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 hassanzadeh et al 2009 ranjbar et al 2013 and they cannot be used to model the triple porosity model in order to address this existing gap two analytical models series and parallel triple porosity models are presented with consideration of transient flow and an analytical and transient shape factor between different regions is put forward therefore the findings of this study can improve the current understandings of the fluid flow in triple porosity formations the organization for this work is as follows first two analytical models of triple porosity considering the series transient flow from the matrix block to the vug and the vug to the fracture as well as the parallel flow of the matrix block and vug to the fracture are presented fig 1 then based on the importance of shape factor parameter for simulation of fractured reservoirs a transient analytical relationship for calculating the shape factor between different regions is delineated also the effect of physical parameters of different regions on production flow and shape factor was investigated subsequently an equation for the shape factor is presented that has matrix and fracture parameters and is enormously applicable in simulating fluid flow in fractured reservoirs finally in order to validate the analytical model the results of the model are compared with the numerical simulator 2 basic model in this section the triple porosity models are described regarding the way that fluid is transferred from the matrix to the vug and the fracture as well as the vug to the fracture the triple porosity models are expressed in two ways 2 1 series fluid flow between the regions in the triple porosity model in this triple porosity model fluid flows from the matrix to the vug and subsequently from the vug to the fracture system fig 2 shows the schematic of this state of triple porosity model in which there is no direct flow between the matrix and the fracture with respect to the fluid flow symmetry in fig 2 for the modeling of the fluid flow in the triple porosity model half of the model can be considered and as in fig 3 the no flow boundary condition is used the proposed exact analytical model can be applied as a basic tool for flow modeling in heterogeneous porous and stimulated reservoir volume srv where there micro fractures can be considered as vug 2 2 parallel fluid flow between the regions in the triple porosity model in this triple porosity model the fluid flow is transmitted directly from the matrix to the fracture system fig 4 shows the schematic of this state of triple porosity model due to the flow symmetry within the matrix block and vug and the homogeneity of these two regions the boundary conditions of the matrix and vug blocks are no flow and the fluid flow is linearly transmitted from the matrix block and vug to the fracture fig 5 to make this mathematical model more tractable and easy to understand the following assumptions are given each medium is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic constant fluid properties flow of slightly compressible fluid with constant viscosity the fracture vug and matrix are initially at the same initial pressure symmetric flow in matrix both series and parallel triple porosity model and vug parallel triple porosity model fluid flows through the fractures to the wellbore 3 analytical model in this section the triple porosity analytical model is presented considering series and parallel fluid flow between the regions in the fractured reservoirs note that the fluid flow between the regions is transient 3 1 series triple porosity model in this study a new analytical solution for fluid flow in the triple porosity model has been developed which may be used to model the flow in a porous medium that has different rock properties in various locations the basic fluid flow equation in the fracture vug and matrix blocks is the diffusivity equation which can be expressed as follows d i d 2 p i d x 2 d p i dt where 1 d i

physical properties which has a high accuracy and low computational cost than numerical methods 3 2 parallel triple porosity model considering the control volume in the fracture and the material balance law we can obtain the differential equation governing the flow of fluid in the fracture jalali and ershaghi 1987 the fluid flow equation in the fracture is as follows 8 φ μ c t k f p f t 2 p f

1 ω f ω v s 3 tanh 3 1 ω f ω v s λ m 1 2 y d the matrix block is considered to model the parallel triple porosity in the form of slab within which the flow is linear in the fractured reservoirs the fluid flow of the block of matrix and vug can occur in the linear cylindrical and spherical forms when the flow in the matrix block vug is cylindrical or spherical then the matrix block pressure in the triple porosity model will be the same as in table 2 which hassanzadeh et al 2009 also introduced for the dual porosity model in this study we proved the governing equations for triple porosity model in the case of slab geometry eqn 40 derivation for cylindrical and spherical flow is not given here and only final form is shown in table 2 4 shape factor between regions in the single porosity model considering the different regions matrix vug and fracture alongside each other the flow equations are discrete and solved in these regions and due to the property differences between the regions the duration of the simulation time increases and the simulation results may not converge abbasi et al 2018 for this purpose the dual and triple porosity model is used to model this type of reservoirs to express the fluid transfer between different regions the concept of the shape factor is expressed kazemi 1969 warren and root 1963 the shape factors introduced so far for the dual porosity model usually have a constant value bourbiaux et al 1999 lim and aziz 1995 however the fluid transfer rate between different regions at the initial times is greater and this value decreases gradually to reach its lowest value stabilized value in this section the transient and analytical shape factors between the matrix and the vug as well as the vug and fracture in the triple porosity model are discussed the relationship between the pressure difference in the matrix vug system vug fracture system and the fluid flow rate is expressed in the following this proportion is defined by introducing a shape factor σ hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 19 q m k m ρ μ σ p m p f also the fluid flow in a porous medium whose end is a no flow boundary is expressed as 20 q m ϕ m c m ρ p m t by integrating eqs 19 and 20 we have 21 k m ρ μ σ ϕ m c m ρ p dm t p df p dm according to both series and parallel triple porosity models the shape factor between different regions in these two models is expressed as 4 1 series triple porosity model as shown in fig 2 in the series triple porosity model according to the fluid flow between the regions a shape factor between the matrix and the vug and a shape factor between the vug and the fracture is defined shape factor between matrix and vug 22 σ mv x 4 x 3 2 ϕ m c m μ x 4 x 3 2 k m p dm t p dv p dm shape factor between vug and fracture due to the fact that the flow inside the vug is transient the center of the vug is flowing we cannot use eq 20 to calculate the flow rate from the vug to the fracture instead we can use the darcy equation at the interface of these two media 23 q v k v μ x 3 x 2 p v x x x 2 and the shape factor is expressed as 24 σ vf x 3 x 2 2 p dv x x x 2 p df p dv x 3 x 2 4 2 parallel triple porosity model as shown in fig 4 in the parallel triple porosity model the matrix block and vug are directly adjusted to the fracture two shape factors between the regions can be expressed as follows shape factor between vug and fracture based on eq 21 and having p dv t d p dv and pdf one can express the vug shape factor as a function of triple porosity system parameters by 25 σ v φ c t v φ c t m φ c t v φ c t f a k f k v p dv t d p df p dv and we have 26 σ v l v 2 12 1 ω f ω m λ v l 1 s tanh 3 1 ω f ω m s λ v 3 1 ω f ω m s λ v p df l 1 p df tanh 3 1 ω f ω m s λ v 3 1 ω f ω m s λ v p df shape factor between matrix and fracture owing to the fact that with regard to initial and boundary conditions a solution to the matrix diffusivity equation is achieved by using this solution the average matrix pressure is calculated and the dimensionless shape factor can be derived 27 σ m φ c t m φ c t m φ c t v φ c t f a k f k m p dm t d p df p dm and we have 28 σ m l m 2 12 1 ω f ω v λ m l 1 s tanh 3 1 ω f ω v s λ m 3 1 ω f ω v s λ m p df l 1 p df tanh 3 1 ω f ω v s λ m 3 1 ω f ω v s λ m p df also the average pressure of the matrix block and the shape factor between the matrix vug and the fracture for different geometries of matrix block is presented in table 3 5 results and discussion in this section the results of both series and parallel triple porosity models are expressly discussed the effect of rock parameters of the matrix block vug and fracture on the rate and the shape factor between the regions is also investigated 5 1 series triple porosity model the proposed exact analytical model can be applied as a basic tool for flow modeling in heterogeneous porous media and is less time consuming when compared to equivalent numerical methods fig 6 shows the pressure distribution of a triple series porosity model at different times in order to illustrate the pressure distribution in the matrix vug and fracture the length of the regions is considered more and the data used in table 4 is given as shown in fig 6 there are three different flow regimes 1 pressure gradient in the fracture 1 m which is linear and due to its high permeability and its proximity to the well bore is very low 2 the pressure distribution in vug 3 m 1 m which has a moderate permeability is almost linear and the pressure gradient is larger than the fracture 3 pressure distribution in the matrix block 5 m 3 m with low permeability and consequently has the highest pressure drop to investigate the effect of permeability and length of vug and matrix on the flow rate in the series triple porosity model we use the inter porosity coefficient which is defined as follows 29 λ v 12 a x 3 x 2 2 k v k f 30 λ m 12 a x 4 x 3 2 k m k f where kv km kf are vug matrix and fracture permeability respectively λv inter porosity coefficient of vug λm inter porosity coefficient of matrix a is cross section area x3 x2 is vug length and x4 x3 is matrix block length based on series triple porosity model six flow regimes can be recognized as the pressure propagates through the fracture vug and matrix block system due to the linear flow in the fracture the flow rate is proportional to t these flow regimes are shown on the log log plot of 2 t q versus time in fig 7 and explained in details in the table 5 fig 8 shows the effect of the inter porosity coefficient of vug λv on the production rate in a series triple porosity model in fig 8 with increasing vug inter porosity coefficient λv i e increasing vug permeability or decreasing vug length the production rate increases and due to increasing vug permeability or decreasing vug length the pressure disturbance reaches the matrix block faster and the production flow from the matrix block is accelerated it is worth mentioning that vug inter porosity coefficient λv has no effect on the at the early time production i e when production comes from the fracture and at the very late time when the pressure drop reaches to the center of the matrix block fig 9 shows the effect of matrix inter porosity coefficient λm on the production rate in a series triple porosity model as shown in fig 9 by increasing the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the production rate increases when the pressure drop reaches the matrix block and does not affect the flow rate of the fracture and vug when the pressure drop reaches the matrix block the production rate increases at high values of the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm which means more permeability or a smaller matrix block length the pressure drop rapidly reaches the center of the matrix block and the flow regime becomes pseudo steady state fig 10 shows the effect of the vug inter porosity coefficient λv on the shape factor between the vug and fracture and also vug and matrix in the series triple porosity model as shown in fig 10 the vug inter porosity coefficient λv affects only the transient region of the shape factor between the vug and the fracture as the vug inter porosity coefficient λv increases the transit time of the vug fracture shape factor decreases and finally after passing the pressure drop and reaching it to the matrix block they equal at a constant value also the variation of vug inter porosity coefficient λv has no effect on the shape factor between the matrix block and the vug the value of the shape factor between the matrix and the vug in the pseudo steady state flow regime is proved to be 9 85 that is consistent with the previous studies abbasi et al 2018 hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 lim and aziz 1995 also the value of shape factor between the vug and the fracture in the pseudo steady state flow regime is proved to be the fixed number 8 which is consistent with the previous numerical studies in the case of dual porosity sarda et al 2001 fig 11 shows the effect of the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm on the shape factor between the vug and fracture and also vug and matrix in the series triple porosity model as shown in fig 11 the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm affects the transient region of the vug and matrix shape factor so that by increasing the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the transit time of the matrix vug shape factor decreases and quickly reaches the stabilized constant value of 9 85 which is consistent with previous studies abbasi et al 2018 the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm affects the coefficient of shape factor between the vug and the fracture so the matrix acts as a source for the vug and by increasing the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the pressure drop during the vug is less and the shape factor between the matrix and the fracture is also increased 5 2 parallel triple porosity model based on parallel triple porosity model five flow regimes can be recognized as the pressure propagates through the fracture vug and matrix block system these flow regimes are shown on the log log plot of 2 t d q d versus dimensionless time in fig 12 and explained in details in the table 6 fig 13 shows the vug inter porosity coefficient λv on the production rate in the parallel triple porosity model as shown in fig 8 the flow rate of the triple porosity model has two protuberance which shows the fluid transfer from the vug to fracture and the matrix block to the fracture in fig 13 with increasing vug inter porosity coefficient λv the amount of dimension flow rate increases at the first protuberance indicating the participation of the vug in production but it does not affect the dimensionless rate in the early time production from the fracture and late time production from the matrix block fig 14 shows the matrix inter porosity coefficient λm on the production rate in the parallel triple porosity model in fig 14 with increasing matrix inter porosity coefficient λm the amount of dimension flow rate increases at the second protuberance indicating the participation of the matrix in production but it does not affect the dimensionless rate in the early and middle time production from the fracture and vug middle time production from the vug and late time the pressure drop reaches the center of the matrix block and the flow is pseudo steady state fig 15 shows the effect of the vug storativity ratio ωv on the dimensionless rate from the fracture in fig 15 the total fluid flow rate including the fracture vug and matrix block is constant but by increasing the vug storativity ratio ωv decreasing the matrix storativity ratio ωm the oil rate increases fig 16 shows the effect of vug inter porosity coefficient λv on the vug fracture and matrix vug of the parallel triple porosity model in the near producing well as shown in fig 16 the vug inter porosity coefficient λv affects only the transient regime of the shape factor between the vug and the fracture so that by increasing the vug inter porosity coefficient λv the vug fracture shape factor quickly reaches to a stabilized value in the parallel triple porosity model owing to the fact that the fluid transfer from the matrix and vug system is performed separately and these two media have nothing to do with each other the change in the rock properties in one medium does not affect the other therefore one can conclude the vug inter porosity coefficient λv will only affect the shape factor between the matrix and the fracture in addition by comparing the vug fracture and the fracture matrix shape factor it can be said that due to the low permeability of the matrix the transient region of matrix fracture shape factor is always greater than that of the vug fracture shape factor fig 17 shows the effect of matrix or vug flow geometry on shape factor as shown in this figure shape factor of spherical flow is greater than the cylinder and the slab flow and converge to the different value at late time the shape factor of spherical cylinder and the slab flow show a transient period and then converges to constant value of 25 65 18 2 and 9 87 respectively pervious study reported a similar value for these matrix flow geometry hassanzadeh et al 2009 fig 18 shows the time as a function of vug inter porosity coefficient λv to reach the constant shape factor as shown in fig 15 by increasing the vug or matrix inter porosity coefficient the flow of fluid from the matrix or vug to the fracture occurs rapidly thus the shape factor reaches the stabilized value pseudo steady state faster fig 19 shows the effect of the vug and matrix storativity ratio on the vug fracture and matrix fracture shape factor as shown in fig 19 with increasing the vug storativity ratio ωv the greater the amount of fluid from the vug to the fracture which causes the transient shape factor to increase this is true for the matrix as well in fig 19 unlike increasing the vug storativity ratio ωv and decreasing matrix storativity ratio ωm increasing vug fracture shape factor in transient region is more than the reduction of the matrix fracture shape factor in transient region this is due to the low permeability of the matrix block relative to the vug which causes the ability to transfer fluid less than the matrix block as shown in figs 18 and 19 the two parameters of the inter porosity coefficient and the storativity ratio of the matrix and the vug affect the transient region and stabilization time of shape factor the shape factor consists of two transient and constant parts according to the time interval of each section the following relation can be presented for the areas near the wells 31 σ l islab i m a t r i x v u g 2 2 27 1 ω i 3 872 λ i t d 0 492 π 2

good fit with the actual shape factor in addition to the simplicity of the relationship it can be used in numerical and commercial simulators 6 validation 6 1 a series triple porosity model in order to validate the presented analytical model a numerical simulator was used the schematic of the model is shown in fig 21 the single porosity model is considered to have dimensions of 13 12 ft 948 ft 3 28 ft and the number of grids is 31 31 1 in order to verify the one dimensional flow the permeability of the matrix blocks was set to zero in the y and z directions the well was considered to be in the right section of model its volume is much larger than that of the matrix block which does not change the pressure of this grid by moving the fluid from the matrix block into the grid the parameters used to simulate the flow in the triple porosity model are given in table 7 fig 22 shows the matrix block vug and fracture average pressure of the analytical model and numerical simulator versus time as shown in fig 22 due to the high permeability and the proximity of the fracture to the opening of the fracture the average pressure of the fracture is equal to the bottom hole pressure and the average vug pressure decreases rapidly after a short time and is equal to the pressure of the production well the matrix block average pressure decreases slowly due to the low permeability and the distance from the production well and the fluid production continues until the pressure of the matrix block is equal to the pressure of the production well it can be seen that the presented analytical model is in good agreement with numerical simulator results and can be used for later studies 6 2 parallel triple porosity model in this section kazemi simulation data are used to validate the analytical parallel triple porosity model kazemi 1969 the data used to model the triple porosity is given in table 8 using the data in table 8 a numerical simulator model was constructed similar to fig 23 the gridding of the first and second media is logarithmic so that near the fracture which is a large drop in pressure the size of the grids is smaller and the distance from the fracture is larger in order to study the flow as a one dimensional the permeability of the first and second media are considered zero in the y and z directions fig 24 shows the mean pressure of the media 1 and 2 as shown in the figure and according to the data in table 8 we can say that k2 3 k1 and φ2 1 5φ1 which means that the pressure drop of the medium 2 less than the media 1 the results of the triple porosity analytical model show a good agreement with the simulation results 7 conclusions in this paper two triple porosity models were presented a series triple porosity model in which the fluid flows from the vug to the fracture and from the matrix to the vug b parallel triple porosity model where fluid within the matrix and vug blocks flows separately into the fracture the proposed models can be used in the modeling of dual porosity and simulation of heterogeneous porous media dynamic behavior rate and pressure change of these two models of triple porosity and different flow regimes were investigated presented analytical model is in good agreement with numerical simulator results and can be used for later studies two triple porosity analytical models presented in this study have led to the following conclusions in the series triple porosity model changing the parameters of vug and matrix did not affect the early production while changing the physical parameters of vug and matrix affected the rate of the middle and lately times respectively in the series triple porosity model the shape factor between matrix and vug was independent of the physical properties of vug and had two transient and constant regions and constant regions with a constant value of π2 in the series triple porosity model the shape factor between vug and fracture was influenced by the physical properties of vug and matrix which had a decreasing trend relative to time and finally reached a constant value of 8 in the parallel triple porosity model vug and matrix systems are separate and according to the physical parameters fluid flow from vug to the fracture is faster than flow from matrix into the fracture also the shape factor of matrix fracture and vug fracture are not dependent on the properties of the other regions of rock in the parallel triple porosity model the time needed for the shape factor to reach a constant value is a function of inter porosity coefficient and storativity ratio in such a way that decreasing inter porosity coefficient and increasing storativity ratio the shape factor in transient time presented shape factor correlation which is a function of the matrix vug and fracture parameter can be used in the simulation of fractured reservoirs with commercial dual or triple porosity model conflict of interest none declared appendix a a separation of
