19635,waterborne food borne and sewage borne pathogens are a major global concern with the annual recurrence most notably during the summer of outbreaks of gastroenteritis of unconfirmed etiology associated with recreational activities in marine environments the consumption of contaminated water based foodstuffs is also related to outbreaks of human illness the main goals of the present study were i to identify the genetic assemblages of giardia duodenalis cysts in growing and depurated oysters destined for human consumption on the southern coast of são paulo brazil ii to verify the main circulating g duodenalis assemblages and their subtypes in different brackish waters used for the production of mollusks and for recreational purposes iii to track the contamination of growing and depurated oysters by the human adenovirus and identify the infectivity of adenoviral particles recovered from oysters before and after depuration iv to evaluate the occurrence and genotype of the free living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba in brackish water and oysters from all the sites described above four sampling sites in the cananeia estuary were selected to search for pathogenic and amphizoic protozoa giardia and acanthamoeba respectively site 1 oyster growth site 2 catchment water before uv depuration procedure site 3 filter backwash filtration stage of water treatment and site 4 oyster depuration tank oysters at sites 1 and 4 were evaluated for the presence of adenovirus hadv analysis consisted of conventional microbiological as well as molecular methods giardia duodenalis were detected in all the water sites analyzed and the molecular analysis revealed that sub assemblage aii was the most frequently distributed throughout the estuarine environment although one sample was identified as belonging to the assemblage c acanthamoeba were also isolated from different locations of the estuarine area and were detected at all the analyzed sites the majority of isolates belonged to the t3 genotype while the t4 genotype was identified once the sequencing reaction of giardia duodenalis revealed the contamination of three batches of depurated oysters by the sub assemblage aii with respect to viruses seven batches of oysters four growing and three depurated were found to be harboring infectious hadv particles when submitted to plaque assay overall the results of the sequencing reactions combined with the plaque assay revealed that the isolates of giardia duodenalis and the infectious hadv particles identified in oyster tissues have the potential to infect humans and pose a threat if consumed raw or lightly cooked this is the first report on the sub assemblage aii identified in oysters which are submitted to a cleaning and disinfection procedure prior to human consumption in brazil acanthamoeba specific genotypes were also identified for the first time in a recreational estuarine area in brazil contributing to knowledge of their molecular and environmental epidemiology which is considered scarce even in marine and estuarine areas of the world graphical abstract image keywords acanthamoeba human adenovirus giardia duodenalis brackish water viral infectivity oysters 1 introduction each year many visitors are attracted to brazilian coastal areas due to their natural beauty tropical climate and warm waters according to the study of international tourist demand of the brazilian tourism department 2015 almost 47 of foreign visitors to brazil between 2008 and 2014 came to the country for leisure of these tourists 59 3 cited sun and beaches as the reason for their trip followed by 21 4 who mentioned nature more specifically ecotourism and adventure tourism coastal areas in brazil are usually used for leisure and recreational purposes and may also serve as a food or income source for coastal communities leal et al 2008 souza et al 2012 the discharge of untreated and treated wastewater into water bodies however is currently the main source of contamination of these sites and other environments into which it flows introducing a wide variety of human pathogens that endanger the health of bathers fayer et al 2004 castro hermida et al 2008 wyn jones et al 2011 xie et al 2017 several studies have suggested that many gastrointestinal dermatologic respiratory and ophthalmic illnesses are related to recreational activities in river or coastal areas affected by sewage borne pathogens meanwhile the global burden of human disease caused by wastewater pollution of oceans and seas has been estimated at 4 million lost person years annually sunderland et al 2007 castro hermida et al 2008 kite powell et al 2008 moore et al 2013 some microorganisms are naturally present in aquatic environments such as the free living eukaryotic amoeba which humans or animals can come into contact with while bathing or swimming lorenzo morales et al 2006 visvesvara et al 2007 recreational water is clearly an important source of exposure to acanthamoeba spp and the isolation of the protozoa has been documented in lakes and river waters swimming pools drinking water systems bottled mineral water and to a lesser extent in seawater lorenzo morales et al 2005 2006 caumo et al 2009 winck et al 2011 the growing importance of acanthamoeba spp in medical care and research over the last decade is due to their potential to infect human hosts causing severe diseases such as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis gae a chronic brain infection that occurs most frequently in immunosuppressed individuals and amoebic keratitis ak a sight threatening infection of the cornea related to contact lens misuse marciano cabral and cabral 2003 visvesvara et al 2007 lorenzo morales et al 2015 in addition to their role as pathogens acanthamoeba spp serve as vehicles or vectors and hosts of various pathogenic microorganisms that are resistant to phagocytosis by the amoebae and include not only bacteria but also viruses and protozoa these interactions facilitate the dispersal of important human pathogens in the environment such as legionella pneumophila mycobacterium spp listeria monocytogenes escherichia coli serotype o 157 pseudomonas aeruginosa adenoviruses and waterborne protozoa like cryptosporidium and toxoplasma gondii oocysts winiecka krusnell et al 2009 scheid et al 2010 scheid and schwarzenberger 2011 siddiqui and khan 2012 in addition to the threat posed by recreational activities another important public health aspect linked to the contamination of coastal waters is the possibility of the occurrence of foodborne outbreaks where seafood such as several species of filter feeder edible mollusks are harvested or cultured in areas affected by sewage gómez couso et al 2005 robertson 2007 bellou et al 2013 the mariculture industry has grown rapidly around the world as have concerns over food safety quality assurance and management throughout the food value chain food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2012 among pathogens vehiculated by the ingestion of contaminated food and water giardia duodenalis is considered one of the major global causes of gastroenteric disease in humans in both developing and industrialized countries lemos et al 2005 baldursson and karanis 2011 fletcher et al 2012 the molecular characterization of g duodenalis describes eight different genotypes or genetic assemblages a h cysts recovered from human samples are usually grouped into assemblages a or b though cysts from animals such as dogs cats livestock horses pigs and other primates can also be grouped into these assemblages the other assemblages c h are usually associated with specific hosts cacciò and ryan 2008 cacciò and sprong 2010 bowman and lucio foster 2010 feng and xiao 2011 this protozoan is ubiquitous in different water environments and possesses marked characteristics that contribute to its persistence even when subject to environmental stressors or when faced with the disinfectants routinely used to destroy its infectivity thus maximizing the risk of potential exposure among the human population craun et al 2005 baldursson and karanis 2011 human enteric viruses such as rotavirus human adenovirus hadv hepatitis a virus hav and norovirus nov are frequently found in oyster tissues even when harvested in seawater with acceptable levels of bacteriological fecal contamination indicators souza et al 2012 leal et al 2013 bagordo et al 2013 fusco et al 2013 human adenoviruses hadv are considered the most persistent enteric viruses in the environment and are frequently associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis infections in the upper and lower respiratory tract and conjunctivitis rzezutka and cook 2004 mena and gerba 2008 hadv has been identified as a marker for viral contamination in water and is considered a high priority emerging contaminant present in drinking water and a potential parameter for identifying environmental contamination usepa 2016 although some attempts have been made to prevent foodborne disease linked to oyster consumption shellfish borne pathogens especially viruses and protozoa may persist in oyster tissues even when submitted to cleaning procedures before the marketing of the mollusks ueki et al 2007 nappier et al 2010 guyader et al 2012 souza et al 2013 our previous study demonstrated that the uv depuration employed in the shellfish industry to purify mollusk tissues did not completely remove viruses and protozoa from mollusk flesh leal et al 2013 it has also been noted that both groups of pathogens are able to remain infectious in marine waters highlighting the need for analysis of virus infectivity and the use of molecular tools to track protozoa contamination to assess possible risks to public health tamburrini and pozio 1999 rzezutka and cook 2004 fayer et al 2004 considering the important issues surrounding these waterborne pathogens the aims of the present study were i to identify the genetic assemblages of giardia duodenalis cysts in growing and depurated oysters destined for human consumption and cultivated in a cooperative on the southern coast of são paulo brazil ii to verify the main circulating g duodenalis assemblages and their subtypes in different brackish waters used for either for mollusk growing or recreational purposes iii to track the contamination of growing and depurated oysters by the human adenovirus and to infer the infectivity of adenoviral particles recovered from oysters during these two different steps before and after depuration iv to evaluate the occurrence of free living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba in water and oysters from all the sites mentioned above and to carry out its molecular genotyping 2 material and methods 2 1 study design and sampling sites the estuary lagoon complex of cananeia located on the southern coast of the state of são paulo 25 s 48 w was selected for this study this brackish environment is situated in a region known as the vale do ribeira a continental area of hills and mountain ridges and suffers the constant influence of the waters of the ribeira de iguape river mendonça and katsuragawa 2001 the estuary has a total length of approximately 110 km and is one of the most important preserved brazilian coastal ecosystems it has been described as the third most productive estuary in the world in terms of primary productivity international union for conservation of nature iucn 2003 filla et al 2008 the cananeia estuary is considered the main producer of oysters crassostrea brasiliana lamarck 1818 syn crassostrea gazar on the coast of the state of são paulo in terms of natural stocks oysters associated with mangroves are exploited or cultured for human consumption and transported to retail markets they constitute the main source of income of the autochthonous population the oysters are primarily grown in a nature reserve known as mandira which was selected as site 1 in the present study and cultivated in captive growths after reaching approximately 10 cm in size they are transported to a cooperative located 25 km away from the mandira region where they are submitted to weekly purification treatment uv depuration procedure the mollusks are kept in plastic trays at least 100 200 dozen oysters per depuration period the estuarine water is caught site 2 and used to fill the depuration tank after being filtered in a sand filter site 3 and sequentially passed through glass cylinders containing uv lamps 40w housed in small plastic containers the uv irradiated water approximately 5000 l is poured into the depuration tank site 4 until the mollusks become submerged the estuarine water receives uv irradiation only once when the tank is filled after this procedure the oysters remain in the depuration process for between 3 and 24 h tourists also use the catchment water site site 2 for recreational purposes as there is a resort hotel located very close to the cooperative the most common activities are swimming and diving kayaking and jet skiing the cooperative of oysters is located 6 km away from cananeia city for this reason water supplied by companies and treatment sewage plants are not available in that region the cooperative and hotel are within a few meters from the estuary the water supply is provided by wells and sewage is deposited in septic tanks water 10 l per sample for all sites and mollusk a dozen oysters sample from sites 1 and 4 respectively or in other words before and after the depuration procedure were harvested monthly from september 2009 to november 2010 and were analyzed for several pathogenic protozoa and enteric viruses leal et al 2013 2 2 genotyping of giardia duodenalis assemblages of cysts recovered from water and oysters the water and oysters were previously analyzed for giardia duodenalis in accordance with the methodologies described by leal et al 2013 briefly the innerwater extrapallial cavity fluid and gills from each animal were extracted and pooled the elution of the gill pools was performed using tween 80 0 1 for 1 h in a mixer rk dynal subsequently the gills and innerwater pool of the oysters were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 1 050 g and the final pellets kept at 4 c until examination the water samples were analyzed using membrane filtration filtered with a 3 0 μm pore size 47 mm diameter millipore filter the membranes were eluted using the tween 80 solution and the eluants centrifuged at 1050 g for 10 min to obtain a pellet all the oyster pellets and water samples were submitted to immunomagnetic separation using a dynabeads anti giardia kit according to manufacturer s instructions dynal biotech oslo norway the protozoa were visualized by dual staining with specific monoclonal anti giardia antibodies merifluor kit meridian bioscience and the vital dye dapi and morphological features were simultaneously confirmed by phase contrast microscopy dna was extracted using the zr fungal bacterial dna kit zymo research according to the manufacturer s original protocols in a previous study by our group leal et al 2013 a fragment of 218 bp of the beta giardin gene was amplified by pcr in all the water and oyster pellet samples as another tool for tracking the occurrence of and contamination by giardia duodenalis since giardia was the most prevalent pathogen detected in the different water sites and from the samples of oysters destined for human consumption its genotypic characterization was performed to characterize the genetic assemblages and the main subtypes in the present study a fragment of 530 bp of the triose phosphate isomerase gene tpi was amplified by nested pcr followed by sequencing sulaiman et al 2003 lebbad et al 2010 the primer sets used were al3543 5 aaatiatgcctgctcgtcg 3 al3546 5 caaaccttitccgcaaacc 3 al3544 5 cccttcatcggiggtaactt 3 and al3545 5 gtggccaccacicccgtgcc 3 tpidf 5 ccgttcataggtggcaactt 3 and tpidr 5 gtagccactacaccagttcc 3 this marker was chosen because its high polymorphism rate which is sufficiently discriminatory to type at the subtype level and also because it represents a secondary approach in these samples with single copy and unlinked genes the products obtained through pcr were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen and sequenced using the abi prism big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit version 3 1 applied biosystems the sequencing reactions were analyzed on an abi prism 3500 genetic analyser xl applied biosystems sequences were edited using clc main workbench v6 8 1 clc bio and were aligned with reference sequences using clustalx larkin et al 2007 reference tpi sequences from the major genetic assemblages of g duodenalis were obtained from genbank the sequenced isolates were assigned to the specific assemblage the accession numbers of the sequences obtained in this study were deposited in genbank under accession numbers kr270779 kr270786 the phylogenetic analyses were performed using neighbor joining nj and maximum likelihood ml methods with mega version 5 05 the nucleotide substitution model was selected after jmodeltest analysis posada et al 2008 which indicated tamura nei93 distance with gamma correction tamura and nei 1993 a bootstrap phylogeny test was performed with 10 000 replicates 2 3 hadv analysis in oyster samples 2 3 1 hadv elution and concentration each sample consisted of the dissected and homogenized digestive glands dg of 12 oysters the viruses were eluted from the tissues and concentrated by polyethylene glycol peg precipitation as described by lewis and metcalf 1988 with minor modifications in accordance with rigotto et al 2010 2 3 2 nucleic acid na extraction and qpcr for hadv viral na extraction were performed in 200 μl of the tissue extract after viral concentration from each oyster sample using the qiaamp minielute virus kit qiagen following the manufacturer s guidelines the na were analyzed undiluted and 10 fold diluted in duplicate by qpcr with the same pair of primers and probe and protocol described by hernroth et al 2002 all the qpcr runs included non template and amplification controls the genome copy gc quantification in each sample was performed by comparing each result with a standard curve constructed with plasmids cloned with sequences of hadv2 kindly donated by dr rosina girones from universitat de barcelona spain abi stepone plus real time pcr system applied biosystems ca usa was used in all qpcr assays 2 3 3 plaque assay pa for hadv infectivity assay the tissue extracts were serial diluted and their ability to infect and lyse a 549 cells permissive cells derived from human lung carcinoma cells european collection of cell cultures in non cytotoxic dilutions was checked as described below as a positive control different dilutions of hadv 2 were used to infect the cells 1 2 3 and 4 log10 ml before inoculation in the cell monolayers the tissue extracts were previously treated with 10 u ml penicillin 10 μg ml streptomycin and 0 025 μg ml amphotericin b and inoculated 0 25 ml well at a non cytotoxic dilution 1 16 in triplicate in the a 549 cell monolayers in 24 well plates as described by cromeans et al 2008 and rigotto et al 2011 the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 c with rotation every 15 min manual rotation revealing complete coverage of the cell layer with the inoculum and overlaid with previously melted 0 6 bacto agar in high glucose dmem 2x high glucose dulbecco s modified eagle s medium containing 4 fbs 0 1 mm sodium pyruvate 10 u ml penicillin 10 μg ml streptomycin and 25 mm mgcl2 the samples were then incubated at 37 c for 7 days after the incubation period the agar overlay was removed and the cells were stained with 20 gram s crystal violet and the plaques counted macroscopically pfu plaque forming units 2 4 isolation of acanthamoeba from oysters and estuarine waters samples of oysters 12 animals sample from the growth and depuration tank locations sites 1 and 4 respectively were shucked in a laminar flow cabinet the innerwater was aspirated from the internal side of the shells and animals filtered and placed in centrifuge tubes the membrane filtration technique 3 0 μm pore size was used for free living amoebae fla concentration from all the sites analyzed in this study and membrane elution performed in a laminar flow cabinet using page saline solution all the innerwater pool tubes from the bivalves and the eluants of different water sites were centrifuged twice 10 min 1050 g and the pellets used for acanthamoeba analysis 2 4 1 amoebae culture the pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of page saline the amebae were isolated in monoxenic cultures by inoculating 100 μl of the sediment in petri dishes containing non nutrient agar 1 5 with an overlayer of escherichia coli atcc 25922 suspension to a turbidity of approximately 4 mcfarland standard and that had been heat inactivated 2 h at 56 c the plates were sealed with parafilm spi supplies west chester pa and then incubated at 30 c for up to 15 days de carli 2001 each plate was examined daily under a light microscope at 100 to check for the presence of fla all positive samples were cloned by the dilution method with only one microorganism seeded for each isolate the isolates were cultured axenically in a 75 cm2 culture tissue flask without shaking at 30 c in pyg medium 0 75 wt vol proteose peptone 0 75 wt vol yeast extract and 1 5 glucose supplemented with penicillin g potassium 400 iu ml and streptomycin 400 ml ml schuster 2002 2 4 2 morphological identification of acanthamoeba isolates the trophozoites and cysts isolated from water and oysters were morphologically assessed with particular attention paid to the double wall of the cysts pussard and pons 1977 page 1988 the sizes of the cysts and trophozoites were estimated from trichrome stained smears garcia and brückner 1997 using a calibrated ocular micrometer ten trophozoites and ten cysts of each isolate were measured mean and sd values were subsequently calculated 2 4 3 molecular identification of acanthamoeba isolates the total dna in the samples of each fla positive culture containing 106 trophozoites was extracted as described by salah and iciar 1997 jdp1 and jdp2 primers were used to amplify the asa s1 region of the gene rns coding for the nuclear small subunit ribosomal rna of the amoeba schroeder et al 2001 briefly the amplifications were carried out in a 25 μl volume containing 20 30 ng of dna 0 2 mm dntps invitrogen 0 4 μm of each oligonucleotide reaction buffer 50 mm kcl2 10 mm tris hcl 1 5 mm mgcl2 and 1 u of platinum taq dna polymerase invitrogen the amplification conditions were as follows one initial cycle at 95 c for 5 min 40 cycles at 95 c for 60 s 65 c for 60 s 72 c for 60 s and a final extension cycle at 72 c for 5 min the pcr products were detected by electrophoresis the sequencing reactions were performed by amersham megabace 1000 automated sequencers in order to classify the acanthamoeba isolates of this study five sequences of acanthamoeba were uploaded into the basic local alignment search tool blast program of the us national center for biotechnology information www ncbi nlm nih gov blast to search for the most similar reference sequences the 18s rrna gene sequences of the five acanthamoeba isolates determined in this study were deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers ky613497 ky613501 table 1 3 results and discussion the lack of monitoring parameters for protozoa and viruses in shellfish growing areas increases the risks of contamination and the possibility of foodborne outbreaks mainly because both groups of organisms are highly resistant in the marine environment and their infectious doses are very low bosch 1998 fayer et al 2004 the practice of consuming oysters raw or lightly cooked is also a factor tamburrini and pozio 1999 robertson 2007 bellou et al 2013 our previous results concerning the monitoring of a wide range of pathogens isolated from brackish waters and from oysters cultivated in a cooperative from the southern coast of são paulo leal et al 2013 revealed that giardia was the most prevalent pathogen in all sites the results of the present study make it possible to assign the cysts to their genetic assemblages providing further information about contamination in this region allowing verification of the main sources of fecal contamination and providing knowledge of its distribution and possible impacts on public health the results of the amplification and sequencing of the fragment of the tpi gene confirmed the presence of g duodenalis in different steps related to the food value chain of the oysters table 2 most of the positive samples exhibited the presence of sub assemblage aii although one sample was identified as belonging to the assemblage c fig 1 subtype analysis showed that most of the g duodenalis isolates belonged to the same subtype although a total of five different subtypes could be identified in different steps in oysters destined for human consumption table 3 mixed assemblages and overlapping nucleotides were not found in the isolates in this study the fact that one subtype of g duodenalis was present in most of the samples suggests that there is a dominant subtype in this region probably derived from anthropogenic activity the identification of new subtypes can contribute to the characterization of the genetic diversity of g duodenalis in this region durigan et al 2017 although samples 3d2 1d3 and 5d3 could not be genotyped the amplification reactions confirmed the presence of g duodenalis in these samples most of the g duodenalis assemblages identified in this study are usually found in human samples which lead us to suggest the impact of domestic sewage throughout the estuary of cananeia since the sub assemblage aii was identified in all the water sites analyzed table 2 in addition the results denote the widespread distribution of this waterborne protozoan in brackish waters from cananeia the most worrying signs were identified at site 4 after the depuration step which precedes the marketing of the oysters in the present study the sub assemblage aii was confirmed in three out of six batches of depurated oysters 50 0 even in the gill wash or innerwater pool of these bivalves table 2 sequencing reaction assay revealed that the assemblages identified in the oyster tissues have the potential to infect humans posing a threat if they are consumed raw or lightly cooked this is the first report about sub assemblage aii identified in oysters submitted to a cleaning and disinfection procedure prior to human consumption in brazil although similar number of positive samples could be genotyped from water sites 1 and 4 table 2 sub assemblage aii of g duodenalis was only detected in depurated oysters these results demonstrated that the uv depuration system was not sufficient to remove protozoa from mollusks flesh likewise it is important to emphasize that the uv disinfection step was only applied in water prior to the depuration procedure the same sub assemblage was identified at site 2 which shows that the water used to fill the depuration tank is already contaminated moreover bathers that use this site for recreational purposes may be at risk of acquiring giardiosis although less common assemblage aii can be found in animal samples sprong et al 2009 considering that assemblage c commonly identified in dogs and cats was also detected in our study at site 3 filter backwash it can be suggested that animal feces also contaminate the water used in the oyster depuration system a situation frequently identified during the monitoring period was fishermen carrying their domestic animals especially dogs from site 2 to site 1 captive growth of oysters which may also influence the dispersion of the parasite to different parts of the estuarine environment more studies are required to verify the extent of the contamination of this estuarine area and if more genetic assemblages and subtypes can be identified seven oyster samples identified as positive for hadv by qpcr table 4 had infectious hadv particles when submitted to plaque assay these oysters were collected between september 2009 and november 2010 leal et al 2013 from these four samples were collected from oyster growth located in mandira site 1 and the other three samples were collected after the oyster depuration step site 4 the qpcr performed showed efficiencies greater than 90 with r2 value above 0 9 only samples on which wells yielded a cq threshold cycle value 39 were considered as positive some samples harvested directly from the growth field before the depuration process presented non infectious adenovirus and oysters from the depuration tank exhibited infectious particles this may occur because these samples are not uniformized and the virus can be inactivated by natural environmental stressors the oysters remained for 3 24 h inside the depuration tank before collection and analysis this meant that all the virus particles infectious or not and viral genomes released by the contaminated oysters could contaminate other oysters placed into the tank this may also explain why the gc and pfu values in months with positive results in mandira and also in the depuration tank february and april 2010 exhibited a slight difference in infectious and non infectious adenoviruses in oysters from the growth and depuration sites table 4 another two positive samples from the mandira site december and november 2009 and 2010 respectively contained low infectious hadv values 1 3 103 and 1 2 103 pfu g respectively which were probably inactivated during the depuration process table 4 although the gc values 1 3 108 gc g detected in november 2010 in the growing oyster samples were high they were negative in the sample collected from depurated oysters in the same month the opposite occurred with the sample from july 2010 where 3 6 1010 gc g of hadv was detected in depurated oysters but not in samples harvested during the growing phase these may have been sporadic cases of oyster contamination with widespread contamination in a few animals hadv is a double stranded dna virus and highly resistant to environmental stressors it is one of the most detected human enteric viruses in environmental samples in oysters and seawater albinana gimenez et al 2009 rigotto et al 2010 souza et al 2013 hadv and giardia was detected in several samples during the 11 months of analysis independent of the season of the year rigotto et al 2010 already reported that it was not found a clear relationship between seasonality and hadv presence in environmental samples collected in florianópolis santa catarina brazil oysters and seawater moreover a 3 year study concerning the contamination of mussels by waterborne protozoa from coastal ecosystems of california demonstrated the contamination of shellfish in a few months in all years of the monitoring period even in early and late dry and wet season miller et al 2005 acanthamoeba have been reported as an etiological agent in waterborne outbreaks specially related to keratitis meier et al 1998 baldursson and karanis 2011 yoder et al 2012 plutzer and karanis 2016 contaminated water and the adverse effects of global warming have influenced the amplification of amoebae in surface water resulting in the greater exposure of humans to these opportunistic pathogens and may present a risk to human health schuster and visvesvara 2004 roda husman and schets 2010 amoebas from the genus acanthamoeba were isolated from oysters and estuarine waters table 1 based on cyst morphology three isolates were identified as belonging to group i and two isolates to group ii pussard and pons 1977 group ii includes the amoebae with the greatest environmental distribution and which were most commonly isolated from the water sources as well as the acanthamoeba species responsible for most cases of gae and keratitis stothard et al 1998 castrillón and orozco 2013 khezri et al 2016 after sequencing of the pcr products obtained from the jdp1 and jdp2 primers for the small subunit of ribosomal dna all five sequences from the acanthamoeba isolates from oysters and estuarine water were aligned with acanthamoeba sequences retrieved from genbank when it was revealed that all sequences were 98 99 identical and belonged to genotypes t3 and t4 these genotypes are commonly found in different water sources along with genotypes t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t9 and t17 lorenzo morales et al 2006 nuprasert et al 2010 caumo and rott 2011 khezri et al 2016 plutzer and karanis 2016 the t4 genotype has been identified as the major causative agent of keratitis and gae siddiqui and khan 2012 lorenzo morales et al 2015 while the t3 genotype has been recognized as an agent of keratitis siddiqui and khan 2012 acanthamoeba specific genotypes were also identified for the first time in a recreational estuarine area in brazil in addition to the problems caused by acanthamoeba spp such as encephalitis and keratitis it should be considered that humans are exposed not only to amoebae but also to their associated pathogens pagnier et al 2008 caumo and rott 2011 acanthamoeba spp are known to harbor a wide range of faecally derived waterborne pathogens including enteric bacteria e g escherichia coli o157 h7 shigella sonnei and shigella dysenteriae barker et al 1999 saeed et al 2009 viruses e g adenovirus coxsackievirus enchovirus enterovirus poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus siddiqui et al 2013 and waterborne protozoa like cryptosporidium and toxoplasma gondii oocysts winiecka krusnell et al 2009 scheid and schwarzenberger 2011 the data from the present study suggests that there is significant species diversity of acanthamoeba and very probably associated microorganisms in waters related to the production of mollusks and utilized for recreational purposes 4 conclusions the uv depuration procedure applied by the oyster cooperative was not sufficient to cleanse remove or inactivate enteric waterborne pathogens harbored in oyster s tissues endangering the health of consumers the importance of acanthamoeba spp in medical care has been growing in the last decades this study contributed to knowledge of its environmental or molecular epidemiology which is considered especially scarce even in marine and estuarine areas of the world the results highlight the need for continued monitoring of pathogenic or opportunistic amphizoic microorganisms and more effective legislation in areas intended for human recreation or in shellfish production areas to ensure sanitary quality and safeguard public health 
19635,waterborne food borne and sewage borne pathogens are a major global concern with the annual recurrence most notably during the summer of outbreaks of gastroenteritis of unconfirmed etiology associated with recreational activities in marine environments the consumption of contaminated water based foodstuffs is also related to outbreaks of human illness the main goals of the present study were i to identify the genetic assemblages of giardia duodenalis cysts in growing and depurated oysters destined for human consumption on the southern coast of são paulo brazil ii to verify the main circulating g duodenalis assemblages and their subtypes in different brackish waters used for the production of mollusks and for recreational purposes iii to track the contamination of growing and depurated oysters by the human adenovirus and identify the infectivity of adenoviral particles recovered from oysters before and after depuration iv to evaluate the occurrence and genotype of the free living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba in brackish water and oysters from all the sites described above four sampling sites in the cananeia estuary were selected to search for pathogenic and amphizoic protozoa giardia and acanthamoeba respectively site 1 oyster growth site 2 catchment water before uv depuration procedure site 3 filter backwash filtration stage of water treatment and site 4 oyster depuration tank oysters at sites 1 and 4 were evaluated for the presence of adenovirus hadv analysis consisted of conventional microbiological as well as molecular methods giardia duodenalis were detected in all the water sites analyzed and the molecular analysis revealed that sub assemblage aii was the most frequently distributed throughout the estuarine environment although one sample was identified as belonging to the assemblage c acanthamoeba were also isolated from different locations of the estuarine area and were detected at all the analyzed sites the majority of isolates belonged to the t3 genotype while the t4 genotype was identified once the sequencing reaction of giardia duodenalis revealed the contamination of three batches of depurated oysters by the sub assemblage aii with respect to viruses seven batches of oysters four growing and three depurated were found to be harboring infectious hadv particles when submitted to plaque assay overall the results of the sequencing reactions combined with the plaque assay revealed that the isolates of giardia duodenalis and the infectious hadv particles identified in oyster tissues have the potential to infect humans and pose a threat if consumed raw or lightly cooked this is the first report on the sub assemblage aii identified in oysters which are submitted to a cleaning and disinfection procedure prior to human consumption in brazil acanthamoeba specific genotypes were also identified for the first time in a recreational estuarine area in brazil contributing to knowledge of their molecular and environmental epidemiology which is considered scarce even in marine and estuarine areas of the world graphical abstract image keywords acanthamoeba human adenovirus giardia duodenalis brackish water viral infectivity oysters 1 introduction each year many visitors are attracted to brazilian coastal areas due to their natural beauty tropical climate and warm waters according to the study of international tourist demand of the brazilian tourism department 2015 almost 47 of foreign visitors to brazil between 2008 and 2014 came to the country for leisure of these tourists 59 3 cited sun and beaches as the reason for their trip followed by 21 4 who mentioned nature more specifically ecotourism and adventure tourism coastal areas in brazil are usually used for leisure and recreational purposes and may also serve as a food or income source for coastal communities leal et al 2008 souza et al 2012 the discharge of untreated and treated wastewater into water bodies however is currently the main source of contamination of these sites and other environments into which it flows introducing a wide variety of human pathogens that endanger the health of bathers fayer et al 2004 castro hermida et al 2008 wyn jones et al 2011 xie et al 2017 several studies have suggested that many gastrointestinal dermatologic respiratory and ophthalmic illnesses are related to recreational activities in river or coastal areas affected by sewage borne pathogens meanwhile the global burden of human disease caused by wastewater pollution of oceans and seas has been estimated at 4 million lost person years annually sunderland et al 2007 castro hermida et al 2008 kite powell et al 2008 moore et al 2013 some microorganisms are naturally present in aquatic environments such as the free living eukaryotic amoeba which humans or animals can come into contact with while bathing or swimming lorenzo morales et al 2006 visvesvara et al 2007 recreational water is clearly an important source of exposure to acanthamoeba spp and the isolation of the protozoa has been documented in lakes and river waters swimming pools drinking water systems bottled mineral water and to a lesser extent in seawater lorenzo morales et al 2005 2006 caumo et al 2009 winck et al 2011 the growing importance of acanthamoeba spp in medical care and research over the last decade is due to their potential to infect human hosts causing severe diseases such as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis gae a chronic brain infection that occurs most frequently in immunosuppressed individuals and amoebic keratitis ak a sight threatening infection of the cornea related to contact lens misuse marciano cabral and cabral 2003 visvesvara et al 2007 lorenzo morales et al 2015 in addition to their role as pathogens acanthamoeba spp serve as vehicles or vectors and hosts of various pathogenic microorganisms that are resistant to phagocytosis by the amoebae and include not only bacteria but also viruses and protozoa these interactions facilitate the dispersal of important human pathogens in the environment such as legionella pneumophila mycobacterium spp listeria monocytogenes escherichia coli serotype o 157 pseudomonas aeruginosa adenoviruses and waterborne protozoa like cryptosporidium and toxoplasma gondii oocysts winiecka krusnell et al 2009 scheid et al 2010 scheid and schwarzenberger 2011 siddiqui and khan 2012 in addition to the threat posed by recreational activities another important public health aspect linked to the contamination of coastal waters is the possibility of the occurrence of foodborne outbreaks where seafood such as several species of filter feeder edible mollusks are harvested or cultured in areas affected by sewage gómez couso et al 2005 robertson 2007 bellou et al 2013 the mariculture industry has grown rapidly around the world as have concerns over food safety quality assurance and management throughout the food value chain food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2012 among pathogens vehiculated by the ingestion of contaminated food and water giardia duodenalis is considered one of the major global causes of gastroenteric disease in humans in both developing and industrialized countries lemos et al 2005 baldursson and karanis 2011 fletcher et al 2012 the molecular characterization of g duodenalis describes eight different genotypes or genetic assemblages a h cysts recovered from human samples are usually grouped into assemblages a or b though cysts from animals such as dogs cats livestock horses pigs and other primates can also be grouped into these assemblages the other assemblages c h are usually associated with specific hosts cacciò and ryan 2008 cacciò and sprong 2010 bowman and lucio foster 2010 feng and xiao 2011 this protozoan is ubiquitous in different water environments and possesses marked characteristics that contribute to its persistence even when subject to environmental stressors or when faced with the disinfectants routinely used to destroy its infectivity thus maximizing the risk of potential exposure among the human population craun et al 2005 baldursson and karanis 2011 human enteric viruses such as rotavirus human adenovirus hadv hepatitis a virus hav and norovirus nov are frequently found in oyster tissues even when harvested in seawater with acceptable levels of bacteriological fecal contamination indicators souza et al 2012 leal et al 2013 bagordo et al 2013 fusco et al 2013 human adenoviruses hadv are considered the most persistent enteric viruses in the environment and are frequently associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis infections in the upper and lower respiratory tract and conjunctivitis rzezutka and cook 2004 mena and gerba 2008 hadv has been identified as a marker for viral contamination in water and is considered a high priority emerging contaminant present in drinking water and a potential parameter for identifying environmental contamination usepa 2016 although some attempts have been made to prevent foodborne disease linked to oyster consumption shellfish borne pathogens especially viruses and protozoa may persist in oyster tissues even when submitted to cleaning procedures before the marketing of the mollusks ueki et al 2007 nappier et al 2010 guyader et al 2012 souza et al 2013 our previous study demonstrated that the uv depuration employed in the shellfish industry to purify mollusk tissues did not completely remove viruses and protozoa from mollusk flesh leal et al 2013 it has also been noted that both groups of pathogens are able to remain infectious in marine waters highlighting the need for analysis of virus infectivity and the use of molecular tools to track protozoa contamination to assess possible risks to public health tamburrini and pozio 1999 rzezutka and cook 2004 fayer et al 2004 considering the important issues surrounding these waterborne pathogens the aims of the present study were i to identify the genetic assemblages of giardia duodenalis cysts in growing and depurated oysters destined for human consumption and cultivated in a cooperative on the southern coast of são paulo brazil ii to verify the main circulating g duodenalis assemblages and their subtypes in different brackish waters used for either for mollusk growing or recreational purposes iii to track the contamination of growing and depurated oysters by the human adenovirus and to infer the infectivity of adenoviral particles recovered from oysters during these two different steps before and after depuration iv to evaluate the occurrence of free living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba in water and oysters from all the sites mentioned above and to carry out its molecular genotyping 2 material and methods 2 1 study design and sampling sites the estuary lagoon complex of cananeia located on the southern coast of the state of são paulo 25 s 48 w was selected for this study this brackish environment is situated in a region known as the vale do ribeira a continental area of hills and mountain ridges and suffers the constant influence of the waters of the ribeira de iguape river mendonça and katsuragawa 2001 the estuary has a total length of approximately 110 km and is one of the most important preserved brazilian coastal ecosystems it has been described as the third most productive estuary in the world in terms of primary productivity international union for conservation of nature iucn 2003 filla et al 2008 the cananeia estuary is considered the main producer of oysters crassostrea brasiliana lamarck 1818 syn crassostrea gazar on the coast of the state of são paulo in terms of natural stocks oysters associated with mangroves are exploited or cultured for human consumption and transported to retail markets they constitute the main source of income of the autochthonous population the oysters are primarily grown in a nature reserve known as mandira which was selected as site 1 in the present study and cultivated in captive growths after reaching approximately 10 cm in size they are transported to a cooperative located 25 km away from the mandira region where they are submitted to weekly purification treatment uv depuration procedure the mollusks are kept in plastic trays at least 100 200 dozen oysters per depuration period the estuarine water is caught site 2 and used to fill the depuration tank after being filtered in a sand filter site 3 and sequentially passed through glass cylinders containing uv lamps 40w housed in small plastic containers the uv irradiated water approximately 5000 l is poured into the depuration tank site 4 until the mollusks become submerged the estuarine water receives uv irradiation only once when the tank is filled after this procedure the oysters remain in the depuration process for between 3 and 24 h tourists also use the catchment water site site 2 for recreational purposes as there is a resort hotel located very close to the cooperative the most common activities are swimming and diving kayaking and jet skiing the cooperative of oysters is located 6 km away from cananeia city for this reason water supplied by companies and treatment sewage plants are not available in that region the cooperative and hotel are within a few meters from the estuary the water supply is provided by wells and sewage is deposited in septic tanks water 10 l per sample for all sites and mollusk a dozen oysters sample from sites 1 and 4 respectively or in other words before and after the depuration procedure were harvested monthly from september 2009 to november 2010 and were analyzed for several pathogenic protozoa and enteric viruses leal et al 2013 2 2 genotyping of giardia duodenalis assemblages of cysts recovered from water and oysters the water and oysters were previously analyzed for giardia duodenalis in accordance with the methodologies described by leal et al 2013 briefly the innerwater extrapallial cavity fluid and gills from each animal were extracted and pooled the elution of the gill pools was performed using tween 80 0 1 for 1 h in a mixer rk dynal subsequently the gills and innerwater pool of the oysters were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 1 050 g and the final pellets kept at 4 c until examination the water samples were analyzed using membrane filtration filtered with a 3 0 μm pore size 47 mm diameter millipore filter the membranes were eluted using the tween 80 solution and the eluants centrifuged at 1050 g for 10 min to obtain a pellet all the oyster pellets and water samples were submitted to immunomagnetic separation using a dynabeads anti giardia kit according to manufacturer s instructions dynal biotech oslo norway the protozoa were visualized by dual staining with specific monoclonal anti giardia antibodies merifluor kit meridian bioscience and the vital dye dapi and morphological features were simultaneously confirmed by phase contrast microscopy dna was extracted using the zr fungal bacterial dna kit zymo research according to the manufacturer s original protocols in a previous study by our group leal et al 2013 a fragment of 218 bp of the beta giardin gene was amplified by pcr in all the water and oyster pellet samples as another tool for tracking the occurrence of and contamination by giardia duodenalis since giardia was the most prevalent pathogen detected in the different water sites and from the samples of oysters destined for human consumption its genotypic characterization was performed to characterize the genetic assemblages and the main subtypes in the present study a fragment of 530 bp of the triose phosphate isomerase gene tpi was amplified by nested pcr followed by sequencing sulaiman et al 2003 lebbad et al 2010 the primer sets used were al3543 5 aaatiatgcctgctcgtcg 3 al3546 5 caaaccttitccgcaaacc 3 al3544 5 cccttcatcggiggtaactt 3 and al3545 5 gtggccaccacicccgtgcc 3 tpidf 5 ccgttcataggtggcaactt 3 and tpidr 5 gtagccactacaccagttcc 3 this marker was chosen because its high polymorphism rate which is sufficiently discriminatory to type at the subtype level and also because it represents a secondary approach in these samples with single copy and unlinked genes the products obtained through pcr were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen and sequenced using the abi prism big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit version 3 1 applied biosystems the sequencing reactions were analyzed on an abi prism 3500 genetic analyser xl applied biosystems sequences were edited using clc main workbench v6 8 1 clc bio and were aligned with reference sequences using clustalx larkin et al 2007 reference tpi sequences from the major genetic assemblages of g duodenalis were obtained from genbank the sequenced isolates were assigned to the specific assemblage the accession numbers of the sequences obtained in this study were deposited in genbank under accession numbers kr270779 kr270786 the phylogenetic analyses were performed using neighbor joining nj and maximum likelihood ml methods with mega version 5 05 the nucleotide substitution model was selected after jmodeltest analysis posada et al 2008 which indicated tamura nei93 distance with gamma correction tamura and nei 1993 a bootstrap phylogeny test was performed with 10 000 replicates 2 3 hadv analysis in oyster samples 2 3 1 hadv elution and concentration each sample consisted of the dissected and homogenized digestive glands dg of 12 oysters the viruses were eluted from the tissues and concentrated by polyethylene glycol peg precipitation as described by lewis and metcalf 1988 with minor modifications in accordance with rigotto et al 2010 2 3 2 nucleic acid na extraction and qpcr for hadv viral na extraction were performed in 200 μl of the tissue extract after viral concentration from each oyster sample using the qiaamp minielute virus kit qiagen following the manufacturer s guidelines the na were analyzed undiluted and 10 fold diluted in duplicate by qpcr with the same pair of primers and probe and protocol described by hernroth et al 2002 all the qpcr runs included non template and amplification controls the genome copy gc quantification in each sample was performed by comparing each result with a standard curve constructed with plasmids cloned with sequences of hadv2 kindly donated by dr rosina girones from universitat de barcelona spain abi stepone plus real time pcr system applied biosystems ca usa was used in all qpcr assays 2 3 3 plaque assay pa for hadv infectivity assay the tissue extracts were serial diluted and their ability to infect and lyse a 549 cells permissive cells derived from human lung carcinoma cells european collection of cell cultures in non cytotoxic dilutions was checked as described below as a positive control different dilutions of hadv 2 were used to infect the cells 1 2 3 and 4 log10 ml before inoculation in the cell monolayers the tissue extracts were previously treated with 10 u ml penicillin 10 μg ml streptomycin and 0 025 μg ml amphotericin b and inoculated 0 25 ml well at a non cytotoxic dilution 1 16 in triplicate in the a 549 cell monolayers in 24 well plates as described by cromeans et al 2008 and rigotto et al 2011 the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 c with rotation every 15 min manual rotation revealing complete coverage of the cell layer with the inoculum and overlaid with previously melted 0 6 bacto agar in high glucose dmem 2x high glucose dulbecco s modified eagle s medium containing 4 fbs 0 1 mm sodium pyruvate 10 u ml penicillin 10 μg ml streptomycin and 25 mm mgcl2 the samples were then incubated at 37 c for 7 days after the incubation period the agar overlay was removed and the cells were stained with 20 gram s crystal violet and the plaques counted macroscopically pfu plaque forming units 2 4 isolation of acanthamoeba from oysters and estuarine waters samples of oysters 12 animals sample from the growth and depuration tank locations sites 1 and 4 respectively were shucked in a laminar flow cabinet the innerwater was aspirated from the internal side of the shells and animals filtered and placed in centrifuge tubes the membrane filtration technique 3 0 μm pore size was used for free living amoebae fla concentration from all the sites analyzed in this study and membrane elution performed in a laminar flow cabinet using page saline solution all the innerwater pool tubes from the bivalves and the eluants of different water sites were centrifuged twice 10 min 1050 g and the pellets used for acanthamoeba analysis 2 4 1 amoebae culture the pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of page saline the amebae were isolated in monoxenic cultures by inoculating 100 μl of the sediment in petri dishes containing non nutrient agar 1 5 with an overlayer of escherichia coli atcc 25922 suspension to a turbidity of approximately 4 mcfarland standard and that had been heat inactivated 2 h at 56 c the plates were sealed with parafilm spi supplies west chester pa and then incubated at 30 c for up to 15 days de carli 2001 each plate was examined daily under a light microscope at 100 to check for the presence of fla all positive samples were cloned by the dilution method with only one microorganism seeded for each isolate the isolates were cultured axenically in a 75 cm2 culture tissue flask without shaking at 30 c in pyg medium 0 75 wt vol proteose peptone 0 75 wt vol yeast extract and 1 5 glucose supplemented with penicillin g potassium 400 iu ml and streptomycin 400 ml ml schuster 2002 2 4 2 morphological identification of acanthamoeba isolates the trophozoites and cysts isolated from water and oysters were morphologically assessed with particular attention paid to the double wall of the cysts pussard and pons 1977 page 1988 the sizes of the cysts and trophozoites were estimated from trichrome stained smears garcia and brückner 1997 using a calibrated ocular micrometer ten trophozoites and ten cysts of each isolate were measured mean and sd values were subsequently calculated 2 4 3 molecular identification of acanthamoeba isolates the total dna in the samples of each fla positive culture containing 106 trophozoites was extracted as described by salah and iciar 1997 jdp1 and jdp2 primers were used to amplify the asa s1 region of the gene rns coding for the nuclear small subunit ribosomal rna of the amoeba schroeder et al 2001 briefly the amplifications were carried out in a 25 μl volume containing 20 30 ng of dna 0 2 mm dntps invitrogen 0 4 μm of each oligonucleotide reaction buffer 50 mm kcl2 10 mm tris hcl 1 5 mm mgcl2 and 1 u of platinum taq dna polymerase invitrogen the amplification conditions were as follows one initial cycle at 95 c for 5 min 40 cycles at 95 c for 60 s 65 c for 60 s 72 c for 60 s and a final extension cycle at 72 c for 5 min the pcr products were detected by electrophoresis the sequencing reactions were performed by amersham megabace 1000 automated sequencers in order to classify the acanthamoeba isolates of this study five sequences of acanthamoeba were uploaded into the basic local alignment search tool blast program of the us national center for biotechnology information www ncbi nlm nih gov blast to search for the most similar reference sequences the 18s rrna gene sequences of the five acanthamoeba isolates determined in this study were deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers ky613497 ky613501 table 1 3 results and discussion the lack of monitoring parameters for protozoa and viruses in shellfish growing areas increases the risks of contamination and the possibility of foodborne outbreaks mainly because both groups of organisms are highly resistant in the marine environment and their infectious doses are very low bosch 1998 fayer et al 2004 the practice of consuming oysters raw or lightly cooked is also a factor tamburrini and pozio 1999 robertson 2007 bellou et al 2013 our previous results concerning the monitoring of a wide range of pathogens isolated from brackish waters and from oysters cultivated in a cooperative from the southern coast of são paulo leal et al 2013 revealed that giardia was the most prevalent pathogen in all sites the results of the present study make it possible to assign the cysts to their genetic assemblages providing further information about contamination in this region allowing verification of the main sources of fecal contamination and providing knowledge of its distribution and possible impacts on public health the results of the amplification and sequencing of the fragment of the tpi gene confirmed the presence of g duodenalis in different steps related to the food value chain of the oysters table 2 most of the positive samples exhibited the presence of sub assemblage aii although one sample was identified as belonging to the assemblage c fig 1 subtype analysis showed that most of the g duodenalis isolates belonged to the same subtype although a total of five different subtypes could be identified in different steps in oysters destined for human consumption table 3 mixed assemblages and overlapping nucleotides were not found in the isolates in this study the fact that one subtype of g duodenalis was present in most of the samples suggests that there is a dominant subtype in this region probably derived from anthropogenic activity the identification of new subtypes can contribute to the characterization of the genetic diversity of g duodenalis in this region durigan et al 2017 although samples 3d2 1d3 and 5d3 could not be genotyped the amplification reactions confirmed the presence of g duodenalis in these samples most of the g duodenalis assemblages identified in this study are usually found in human samples which lead us to suggest the impact of domestic sewage throughout the estuary of cananeia since the sub assemblage aii was identified in all the water sites analyzed table 2 in addition the results denote the widespread distribution of this waterborne protozoan in brackish waters from cananeia the most worrying signs were identified at site 4 after the depuration step which precedes the marketing of the oysters in the present study the sub assemblage aii was confirmed in three out of six batches of depurated oysters 50 0 even in the gill wash or innerwater pool of these bivalves table 2 sequencing reaction assay revealed that the assemblages identified in the oyster tissues have the potential to infect humans posing a threat if they are consumed raw or lightly cooked this is the first report about sub assemblage aii identified in oysters submitted to a cleaning and disinfection procedure prior to human consumption in brazil although similar number of positive samples could be genotyped from water sites 1 and 4 table 2 sub assemblage aii of g duodenalis was only detected in depurated oysters these results demonstrated that the uv depuration system was not sufficient to remove protozoa from mollusks flesh likewise it is important to emphasize that the uv disinfection step was only applied in water prior to the depuration procedure the same sub assemblage was identified at site 2 which shows that the water used to fill the depuration tank is already contaminated moreover bathers that use this site for recreational purposes may be at risk of acquiring giardiosis although less common assemblage aii can be found in animal samples sprong et al 2009 considering that assemblage c commonly identified in dogs and cats was also detected in our study at site 3 filter backwash it can be suggested that animal feces also contaminate the water used in the oyster depuration system a situation frequently identified during the monitoring period was fishermen carrying their domestic animals especially dogs from site 2 to site 1 captive growth of oysters which may also influence the dispersion of the parasite to different parts of the estuarine environment more studies are required to verify the extent of the contamination of this estuarine area and if more genetic assemblages and subtypes can be identified seven oyster samples identified as positive for hadv by qpcr table 4 had infectious hadv particles when submitted to plaque assay these oysters were collected between september 2009 and november 2010 leal et al 2013 from these four samples were collected from oyster growth located in mandira site 1 and the other three samples were collected after the oyster depuration step site 4 the qpcr performed showed efficiencies greater than 90 with r2 value above 0 9 only samples on which wells yielded a cq threshold cycle value 39 were considered as positive some samples harvested directly from the growth field before the depuration process presented non infectious adenovirus and oysters from the depuration tank exhibited infectious particles this may occur because these samples are not uniformized and the virus can be inactivated by natural environmental stressors the oysters remained for 3 24 h inside the depuration tank before collection and analysis this meant that all the virus particles infectious or not and viral genomes released by the contaminated oysters could contaminate other oysters placed into the tank this may also explain why the gc and pfu values in months with positive results in mandira and also in the depuration tank february and april 2010 exhibited a slight difference in infectious and non infectious adenoviruses in oysters from the growth and depuration sites table 4 another two positive samples from the mandira site december and november 2009 and 2010 respectively contained low infectious hadv values 1 3 103 and 1 2 103 pfu g respectively which were probably inactivated during the depuration process table 4 although the gc values 1 3 108 gc g detected in november 2010 in the growing oyster samples were high they were negative in the sample collected from depurated oysters in the same month the opposite occurred with the sample from july 2010 where 3 6 1010 gc g of hadv was detected in depurated oysters but not in samples harvested during the growing phase these may have been sporadic cases of oyster contamination with widespread contamination in a few animals hadv is a double stranded dna virus and highly resistant to environmental stressors it is one of the most detected human enteric viruses in environmental samples in oysters and seawater albinana gimenez et al 2009 rigotto et al 2010 souza et al 2013 hadv and giardia was detected in several samples during the 11 months of analysis independent of the season of the year rigotto et al 2010 already reported that it was not found a clear relationship between seasonality and hadv presence in environmental samples collected in florianópolis santa catarina brazil oysters and seawater moreover a 3 year study concerning the contamination of mussels by waterborne protozoa from coastal ecosystems of california demonstrated the contamination of shellfish in a few months in all years of the monitoring period even in early and late dry and wet season miller et al 2005 acanthamoeba have been reported as an etiological agent in waterborne outbreaks specially related to keratitis meier et al 1998 baldursson and karanis 2011 yoder et al 2012 plutzer and karanis 2016 contaminated water and the adverse effects of global warming have influenced the amplification of amoebae in surface water resulting in the greater exposure of humans to these opportunistic pathogens and may present a risk to human health schuster and visvesvara 2004 roda husman and schets 2010 amoebas from the genus acanthamoeba were isolated from oysters and estuarine waters table 1 based on cyst morphology three isolates were identified as belonging to group i and two isolates to group ii pussard and pons 1977 group ii includes the amoebae with the greatest environmental distribution and which were most commonly isolated from the water sources as well as the acanthamoeba species responsible for most cases of gae and keratitis stothard et al 1998 castrillón and orozco 2013 khezri et al 2016 after sequencing of the pcr products obtained from the jdp1 and jdp2 primers for the small subunit of ribosomal dna all five sequences from the acanthamoeba isolates from oysters and estuarine water were aligned with acanthamoeba sequences retrieved from genbank when it was revealed that all sequences were 98 99 identical and belonged to genotypes t3 and t4 these genotypes are commonly found in different water sources along with genotypes t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t9 and t17 lorenzo morales et al 2006 nuprasert et al 2010 caumo and rott 2011 khezri et al 2016 plutzer and karanis 2016 the t4 genotype has been identified as the major causative agent of keratitis and gae siddiqui and khan 2012 lorenzo morales et al 2015 while the t3 genotype has been recognized as an agent of keratitis siddiqui and khan 2012 acanthamoeba specific genotypes were also identified for the first time in a recreational estuarine area in brazil in addition to the problems caused by acanthamoeba spp such as encephalitis and keratitis it should be considered that humans are exposed not only to amoebae but also to their associated pathogens pagnier et al 2008 caumo and rott 2011 acanthamoeba spp are known to harbor a wide range of faecally derived waterborne pathogens including enteric bacteria e g escherichia coli o157 h7 shigella sonnei and shigella dysenteriae barker et al 1999 saeed et al 2009 viruses e g adenovirus coxsackievirus enchovirus enterovirus poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus siddiqui et al 2013 and waterborne protozoa like cryptosporidium and toxoplasma gondii oocysts winiecka krusnell et al 2009 scheid and schwarzenberger 2011 the data from the present study suggests that there is significant species diversity of acanthamoeba and very probably associated microorganisms in waters related to the production of mollusks and utilized for recreational purposes 4 conclusions the uv depuration procedure applied by the oyster cooperative was not sufficient to cleanse remove or inactivate enteric waterborne pathogens harbored in oyster s tissues endangering the health of consumers the importance of acanthamoeba spp in medical care has been growing in the last decades this study contributed to knowledge of its environmental or molecular epidemiology which is considered especially scarce even in marine and estuarine areas of the world the results highlight the need for continued monitoring of pathogenic or opportunistic amphizoic microorganisms and more effective legislation in areas intended for human recreation or in shellfish production areas to ensure sanitary quality and safeguard public health

environmental fate of gbp after the discharge by wwtps and reported also inconclusive data for example onesios and bouwer 2012 observed a very low removal of gbp in sand columns inoculated with wwtp effluent 10 removal within 200 days while yu et al 2006 observed high biodegradation 90 removal within 50 days in growth media inoculated with activated sludge different removal rates of organic micropollutants may be caused by different microbial community compositions and origins of the investigated inocula kim et al 2017 moreover a study revealed the susceptibility of gbp against photolysis herrmann et al 2015 and also described the formation of biologically stable transformation products 2 azaspiro 4 5 decan 3 one gbp lactam hydrolysis of gbp is reported to be of minor importance lyman et al 1990 as removal process however to the best of our knowledge no study reported the degradability of gbp or elucidated a transformation pathway in rivers and river sediment systematically and provided detailed information on the fate of gbp in the aquatic environment once it is discharged by wwtps to close this knowledge gap this study addresses the biological degradation of gbp in surface waters and river sediments special focus was laid on i the biodegradability of gbp in different river sediments ii the effect of different redox conditions aerobic anaerobic on the transformation of gbp iii the identification of transformation products tps and iv the proposal of a transformation pathway of gbp in river sediments in addition we sampled wwtp influents and effluents rivers and streams as well as groundwater and drinking water to investigate whether the tps and gbp can be detected as predicted from the lab scale experiments 2 materials and

water aerobic sediments and corresponding surface water were collected from three german rivers in january 2015 the river rhine at koblenz sediment a as well as at the small creeks baybach b and unterbach c see table s1 in the si the sediments were taken with a van veen sampler from a depth of 0 20 cm below the sediment surface and taken to lab in plastic buckets additionally an anaerobic sediment d was taken from the river elbe near hitzacker germany in july 2015 and stored air tight until the experiments were conducted surface water and sediments were stored at 4 c until the start of the experiments within 1 7 d 2 2 2 laboratory batch experiments the transformation of gbp and gbp lactam was investigated in water sediment systems wss and surface water systems ws under aerobic and anaerobic conditions table 1 to determine degradation rate constants the target compounds were spiked in triplicates at the μg l 1 level table 1 and the vessels were gently shaken on a reciprocating shaker to identify tps the target compounds were additionally spiked at elevated concentration at the mg l 1 range in duplicates aerobic or triplicates anaerobic as negative controls additional test vessels of each experimental condition were set up without spiking target substances 2 2 3 aerobic tests sediments were sieved 2 mm and added to corresponding surface water in 500 ml glass bottles to attain a sediment to water ratio of 1 5 dry weight to ensure oxygen saturation in the supernatant the bottles were kept open and were slightly shaken throughout the experiments after an equilibration period of nine days the ph was constant and the test substances were added separately to the test vessels löffler et al 2005 in addition sterile inactive control experiments by autoclaving filled test vessels three times for 15 min at 121 c were used to differentiate between biotic and abiotic transformation processes to inhibit an increase of the ph and a bacterial re growth the sterile vessels were bubbled with co2 air 10 co2 90 air directed through a 0 2 μm cellulose acetate filter sartorius göttingen germany after spiking the test substance and directly before each sampling date the test vessels were shaken to homogenize the slurry of the test systems after a short sedimentation time 1 2 ml were taken from the supernatant passed through syringe filters 0 45 μm cellulose acetate sartorius göttingen germany and stored in hplc vials at 4 c until further analysis additionally 10 ml samples filtered were taken from replicates spiked with elevated concentrations acidified with hcl and stored at 18 c in these samples dissolved organic carbon doc was quantified photometrically lck385 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany all experiments were run at room temperature 22 1 c and at ph of 7 5 8 0 the ph was kept stable over the incubation time due to adding 10 co2 to the air bubbled through the water sediment systems 2 2 4 anaerobic tests for anaerobic degradation experiments 120 ml glass serum bottles were used each bottle was filled with 80 g of surface water 20 g of the anaerobic elbe sediment wss d and was closed with butyl stoppers to keep the system free of oxygen the surface water was purged with argon for 2 h before pouring into the test vessels to avoid contact with atmospheric oxygen all working steps concerning the preparation treatment and sampling of the batch experiments were conducted in a glovebox under argon atmosphere to be consistent with the aerobic experiments the test vessels were also slightly shaken 50 r min 1 and incubated in the dark at room temperature 22 1 c anaerobic conditions in the batch systems were randomly checked photometrically by measuring fe ii harvey et al 1955 after an equilibration time of 18 days target substances were added the equilibration time was reached when the reduction of fe iii to fe ii was observed for sampling 1 0 ml was filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm and stored at 18 c until further analysis the first sample was taken 30 min after spiking the test substance in parallel 3 0 ml were taken from the test systems with elevated spike concentrations and were immediately analyzed for doc 2 3 detection of target compounds in environmental samples grab samples of surface water from four german streams groundwater and potable water details see section 5 in the si were collected in addition corresponding 72 h composite samples from the influent and effluent of four conventional wwtps were taken table s6 in si the analytical procedure was analogous to the incubation samples samples of wwtp influents and effluents were diluted with ultra pure water 1 10 and 1 4 respectively the injection volume ranged from 20 to 80 μl recoveries of gbp and gbp lactam were determined in all different environmental matrices in triplicates at three different concentration levels 10 100 1000 ng l 1 results see si table s4 to determine the in situ degradation of gbp in a river an

further analysis 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 quantification of target compounds prior to analysis gbp d4 and gbp lactam d6 were added as internal standards final concentration 150 ng l 1 for the

from the aqueous phase within 11 40 d in all wss exp 1 1 fig 1 a c in all three sediments the degradation of gbp can be described by a pseudo first order kinetic the rate constant kbiol ranged from 1

biomass quantity microbial community composition kim et al 2017 of the used sediments for further information on the sediments see table s1 in the si in incubation experiments without sediment exp 1 3

1a c under anaerobic conditions exp 1 5 gbp was not significantly removed over the incubation duration of 54 days considering the analytical uncertainty wss d fig 1 d hence aerobic biotransformation processes in the sediments are most likely the primary drivers for the elimination of gbp during the laboratory incubations sorption is not expected to play a major role due to the very high polarity of gbp log d 1 55 chemicalize 2017 3 2 gbp lactam and its relevance in the transformation pathway in addition to many quantitatively less important tps see next section 3 3 aerobic degradation experiments with gbp revealed one major tp which was identified as gbp lactam tp153 m h m z 154 1227 2 azaspiro 4 5 decan 3 one table 2 gbp lactam is formed by an intramolecular cyclization of the carboxylic acid and the amine moiety resulting in a γ lactam amidation as at sterile and anaerobic conditions only a negligible quantity of gbp lactam was formed the transformation of gbp to gbp lactam is most likely a biologically mediated process which occurs predominantly under aerobic conditions under aerobic incubations the maximum concentrations of gbp lactam accounted for about 18 wss b and c of the initial gbp concentration fig 1b and c however gbp lactam is not stable as its concentrations decreased with incubation time fig 1b and c in wss a the concentrations of gbp lactam amounted only to up to 2 of initial gbp concentration in the study by herrmann et al 2015 gbp lactam was reported to be a major phototransformation product of gbp for mice zambon et al 2008 reported a 20 fold lower ld50 lethal dose for 50 of the tested population for gbp lactam than for gbp additionally it has been observed that gbp lactam causes myoclonic and generalized clonic seizures in kindled rats potschka et al 2000 gbp lactam is also known to be present as an impurity of gbp in pharmaceutical compositions zhixin et al 2011 as consequence the united states pharmacopeia usp limited the percentage of gbp lactam to less than 0 4 w w in pharmaceutical compositions to reduce adverse effects on patients zhixin et al 2011 to investigate the role of gbp lactam in the transformation pathway of gbp separate incubation experiments were conducted with gbp lactam exp 2 1 2 5 table 1 under aerobic conditions exp 2 1 wss a fig 2 a gbp lactam was almost completely removed 3 of initial concentration within 55 days meanwhile an intermediate formation of gbp up to 18 maximum at 26 d of the initial gbp lactam concentration was observed in contrast gbp was neither formed in the inactivated controls nor in the anaerobic experiments exp 2 4 and 2 5 fig 2a and b consequently the reverse reaction from gbp lactam to gbp amide hydrolysis appears to be also a biologically mediated process occurring under aerobic conditions in comparison to the elimination rates of gbp kbiol 3 9 0 2 x 10 6 s 1 in wss a those of gbp lactam were about six times slower kbiol 0 7 0 1 x 10 6 s 1 hence the minor gbp lactam formation in gbp experiments in wss a 2 of initial concentration fig 1 a cannot be explained by a fast further degradation of gbp lactam obviously there have to be alternative initial transformation reactions of gbp see section 3 3 in comparison to wss a gbp was degraded two to four times slower in wss c and b this was concurrent with an elevated formation of gbp lactam which also suggests that the amidation of gbp is only a side reaction of the transformation pathway of gbp in water systems without contact to sediment the decrease of gbp lactam exp 2 3 ws a dt50 100 30 d fig s1 b in si was up to nine times slower compared to the decrease in water sediment systems exp 2 1 wss a dt50 12 1 2 d fig 2 a table s5 in the si to check for further tps of gbp the theoretical carbon content of gbp and gbp lactam concentrations measured by lc ms were compared to total doc in spiked replicates exp 1 2 10 mg l 1 and negative controls see fig s2 in si in wss a where gbp was rapidly eliminated and gbp lactam was not formed the doc quickly declined to the level of the negative control fig s2 a in si in contrast in wss b where gbp was removed and gbp lactam was formed in appreciable quantities the doc only slowly decreased and after 120 d there was still a gap of approximately 20 between the doc in the spiked batches and the negative controls fig s2 b in si however this gap can be almost completely explained by the concentrations of gbp lactam which was still detectable after 120 d in general the doc considerations indicate that gbp lactam is likely the only quantitatively relevant tp 3 3 transformation pathway of gbp under aerobic conditions 3 3 1 identification of tps tps were identified by using a combination of a high resolution mass spectrometry hrms b ms ms fragmentation experiments ms2 ms3 c retention time rt shifts d transformation experiments with gbp gbp lactam and gbp d4 and e relative amounts formed in experiments spiked with gbp compared to those spiked with gbp lactam including gbp lactam at least seven increasing m z values were observed in the aerobic degradation studies two of these substances were identified via authentic reference standards gbp lactam tp186 and one by a self synthesized standard tp213 for details on the synthesis see section 1 3 in the si due to the missing carboxylic moiety lactam structure gbp lactam could only be detected in positive ionization mode esi m z 154 1228 δ 1 ppm while gbp was also detected in negative ionization mode esi gbp structure containing the acetic acid side chain m z 170 1192 δ 3 ppm although the sensitivity was much lower compared to esi mode m z 172 1334 δ 1 ppm hence peaks that were not detected in esi mode likely imply a lactam structure a further indication of lactam structures was a negligible shift in rt when using alkaline ph 8 9 instead of acidic ph 3 lc conditions the bigger shift in rt in case of gbp is caused by the deprotonated carboxylic acid moiety at ph 8 9 as e g the rt of gbp decreased substantially from 5 6 min to 2 1 min δrt 3 5 min while the rt of gbp lactam only changed marginally from 8 7 to 8 1 min δrt 0 6 min table 2 for gbp a noticeable in source fragmentation loss of water in the esi source 5 of gbp intensity during positive electrospray ionization occurred leading to a chromatographic peak with the same mass m z 154 1228 m h as gbp lactam at the rt of gbp see xic in si fig s39 the fragmentation behavior of the source fragment of gbp m z 154 1228 and the ms3 of gbp parent ion m z 154 1228 were identical but differed from the fragmentation pattern of gbp lactam compare figs 3 and 4 or figs s5 s6 s8 in the si while all three fragmentations included mainly combinations of a water h2o ammonia nh3 and carbon monoxide co cleavage two characteristic differences enabled to distinguish between gbp structures and lactam structures first the dominant fragment in the ms3 spectra of gbp parent ion m z 154 1228 was m z 137 0961 δ17 0269 nh3 fig 3 while the dominant fragment of gbp lactam ms2 of m z 154 1228 was m z 95 0854 δ59 0376 c2h5no loss of acetamide fig 4 furthermore a loss of water m z 136 1121 δ18 0109 h2o and carbon monoxide m z 126 1277 δ27 9953 co in the ms3 spectrum was only observed for gbp fig 3 exemplarily the structural elucidation of tps with a nominal m z of 186 1127 is discussed in detail in the following paragraph see table 2 tp185 was detected only in positive ionization mode at a nominal mass of m z 186 1127 m h and formed three chromatographic peaks ph 3 at retention times of 1 3 tp185a 1 4 tp185b and 2 1 3 0 min tp185c later named as peak 2 5 min due to insufficient chromatographic separation chromatograms see figs s21 and s28 in the si within a mass error of 1 ppm the only possible sum molecular formula m h allowing c h o n was c9h16o3n this molecular formula either indicates an additional keto group in comparison to gbp or a twofold hydroxylation of gbp lactam for proposed structures see table 2 different structural isomers might have been formed since at least three peaks were detected with the same nominal mass of 186 1127 additional measurements at ph 8 9 could not be used to distinguish between the gbp and gbp lactam backbone due to the already very early elution of the peaks at ph 3 however the shorter rts for tp185a b 1 3 and 1 4 min ph 3 table 2 are an indication for the presence of a carboxylic moiety of the gbp structure while tp185c 2 5 min ph 3 indicates a lactam structure according to the higher rt of gbp lactam 8 7 min ph 3 compared to gbp 5 6 min ph 3 see above and table 2 in addition peaks at 1 3 and 1 4 min were detected predominantly in studies with gbp and tp185c was found with higher intensities in experiments with gbp lactam as initial substance however more evidence for the proposed structure of the three tps was gained by the respective ms2 and ms3 spectra solely within the ms3 data of tp185c peak at rt 2 5 min 186 1127 168 1022 ms3 the cleavage of ethenone δ42 0108 c2h2o fragment mass m z 108 0812 after a twofold loss of water was found which is only possible if tp185c contains two oh moieties at the cyclohexane ring figs 5 and 6 a and not for the proposed structures of tp185a b table 2 likewise fragment m z 95 0855 in the ms3 spectrum of tp185c with fragment m z 168 1022 186 1127 168 1022 ms3 as parent ion formed by a loss of water fig 5 represents the cleavage of n formylformamide δ73 0164 c2h3no2 fig 6b this fragmentation reaction analogous to the formation of fragment 95 0854 out of gbp lactam via loss of c2h5no fig 4 is only possible if one hydroxyl group in tp185c is positioned at the alpha carbon close to the amide moiety as an oh group in alpha position to the amide nitrogen atom is expected to be unstable hence tp185c was identified as twofold hydroxylated gbp lactam whereas the exact positions of the hydroxyl groups could not be finally located chromatographic and hrms data indicate that several isomers are co eluting due to the short rts tp185a b was suggested to be gbp with a keto moiety formed via the dehydrogenation of an added oh group table 2 this assumption was backed up by the respective ms2 and ms3 spectra first the ms2 of tp185a shows a predominant loss of water m z 168 1022 δ18 0078 fig s23 in the si whereas tp185b reveals mainly a loss of ammonia m z 169 0861 δ17 0239 fig s25 in the si in addition fragment m z 98 0600 found in the ms3 spectrum of tp185a 186 1127 168 1022 ms3 fig s24 in the si formed by the cleavage of c4h6o δ70 0400 and fragment m z 128 0708 detected in ms2 spectrum of tp185b fig s25 in the si formed by the loss of c3h6o δ58 0392 indicates a keto moiety at the hexane ring as the loss of a c4 and c3 fragment is only possible at the hexane ring see fragmentation pathway in fig 6c furthermore hrms data of the transformation studies with gbp d4 studies deuterated at both free carbon atoms of the side chains clearly reveal no keto moiety in alpha position to the carboxylic acid carbon atom m z 190 1373 c9h12d4no3 δ 2 ppm hence the location of the keto group is limited to the cyclohexane ring whereas the exact positions could not be figured out 3 3 2 proposed transformation pathway the overall outcome was a varied web of transformation reactions which can be principally explained by five mechanisms i intramolecular amidation amide hydrolysis ii hydroxylation of the cyclohexane ring and side chain iii oxidative dehydrogenation of oh moieties iv oxidative deamination and v acetylation of the primary amine the proposed structures of the eight tps the time courses of their intensities during the incubation experiments and their role in the overall transformation pathway are shown in fig 7 along with a categorization of the reactions leading to the individual tps except for tp167 and tp185c all tps are only intermediates since their intensities decrease with ongoing incubation no further tps were detected however it was estimated from the peak areas that excluding gbp lactam all other tps did not account for a significant proportion 1 of the initial gbp concentration gbp lactam occurred during transformation of gbp as an intermediate product until further transformation or reverse reaction to gbp nevertheless gbp lactam was partially transformed to tp185c tp169 and tp167 except for tp187a b and tp185a b all tps were detected in incubation experiments with both gbp and gbp lactam fig 7 consequently gbp lactam was partly transformed to gbp via amide hydrolysis as it is indicated by the open ring structure of tp186 and tp213 observed in incubation experiments with gbp lactam as initial substance fig 7 and or further transformed via the same mechanisms as gbp e g hydroxylation tp169a b oxidative dehydrogenation tp167a b however gbp lactam was degraded at a slower rate in comparison to gbp see sections 3 1 and 3 2 which is why the decrease of gbp concentrations can only be explained to a small proportion by the formation of gbp lactam as a result the formation of gbp lactam is only a side reaction in the transformation pathway of gbp the acetylation of gbp tp213 is also considered to be only a secondary reaction no tps were detected that clearly indicate an oxidative ring opening followed by a successive shortening of the carbon chain via loss of co2 e g via baeyer villiger monooxygenases kawamoto et al 2008 stirling et al 1977 trudgill 1990 the reasons why no further tps were found might be i a very rapid degradation leading to mineralization ii insufficient detection limits iii high polarity and small masses of the tps not covered by the lc ms method or more unlikely iv sorption of tps to the sediment surface the inclusion of gbp lactam into the doc calculations provided a closed doc balance which confirms that no quantitatively relevant dead end tps in the water phase were overlooked therefore the overall transformation of gbp might contain the incorporation into biomass formation of volatile products or mineralization 4 environmental relevance of gbp and gbp lactam in order to investigate the occurrence of gbp and its biological quantitatively most relevant tp gbp lactam we monitored them in influents and effluents of four german wwtps as well as in receiving waters for sample details see section 5 in the si in wwtp influents gbp was present at high concentrations of up to 8 5 μg l 1 table 3 while the tp gbp lactam was only detected close to the loq 0 03 μg l 1 elimination rates of gbp during wastewater treatment ranged from 14 to 54 whereby gbp was partially transformed to gbp lactam table 3 as consequence concentrations of gbp lactam of up to 1 5 μg l 1 were detected in wwtp effluents the sum of gbp and gbp lactam quantified in wwtp effluents accounts to 58 96 of the gbp loads present in wwtp influents table 3 as sorption to sludge particles can be assumed to be of minor importance gbp lactam log d 1 03 chemicalize 2017 other tps than gbp lactam uptake into biomass and or mineralization might be responsible for the incomplete mass balances nevertheless gbp lactam is formed in wastewater treatment and hence is discharged together with gbp into surface waters gbp up to 3 2 μg l 1 and gbp lactam up to 0 7 μg l 1 both in the river usa table 4 at the small stream usa the concentrations of gbp and gbp lactam decreased by 48 and 25 between the two sampling sites respectively fig 8 however in order to determine the degradation it was necessary to compensate for dilution processes along the river stretch as the antiepileptic cbz is known to be persistent in natural systems due to its biotic and abiotic stability the decrease of its concentration was very likely caused only by dilution löffler et al 2005 as consequence the removal of gbp and gbp lactam was normalized by the concentration decrease of cbz 28 for gbp a removal of about 28 was observed while the load of gbp lactam did not change significantly along the flow distance fig 8 these results are in a good agreement with those obtained from water sediment experiments conducted in lab scale as gbp was degraded in the water sediment systems much faster kbiol 3 9 0 2 x 10 6 s 1 in wss a than gbp lactam kbiol 0 7 0 1 x 10 6 s 1 in wss a moreover high quantities of gbp lactam in surface waters might be mainly attributed to the presence of gbp lactam in wwtp effluents and only to a minor proportion to the degradation of gbp in rivers streams gbp and gbp lactam were also detected in german groundwater with concentrations up to 1 3 and 1 5 μg l 1 respectively table 4 while our studies showed the biodegradability of gbp in river sediments under aerobic conditions gbp was persistent under anaerobic conditions furthermore too short retention times as well as partly anaerobic conditions during bank or soil filtration might inhibit biodegradation and might be responsible for elevated gbp concentrations of up to 1 3 μg l 1 in groundwater and 0 6 μg l 1 in potable water high concentrations of gbp lactam of up to 1 5 μg l 1 in groundwater and 0 07 μg l 1 in potable water confirmed its environmental stability 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first study determining the fate of gbp in river sediments under abiotic and anaerobic conditions we showed that gbp is rapidly biodegraded in lab scale water sediment studies under aerobic conditions dt50 2 7 d and transformed to gbp lactam via amidation up to 18 of initial gbp concentration concerning the ubiquitous presence of gbp and gbp lactam in the urban water cycle especially groundwater and potable water further eco toxicological studies should be conducted to evaluate potential risks on ecosystems and human health due to the enhanced environmental persistence of gbp lactam compared to gbp we further advise to consider gbp lactam in monitoring programs moreover future investigations might focus on treatment technologies to effectively remove gbp and gbp lactam in wwtps prior to their discharge into receiving waters used for the production of drinking water hereof a combination of advanced treatment processes such as e g biological active granular activated carbon gac with oxidative processes such as ozonation might be promising approaches acknowledgements financial support by the federal ministry of education and

paffrath 2017 in 2016 about 45 mio ddd s ddd 1 8 g who 2016 of gbp were prescribed in germany schwabe and paffrath 2017 gbp is not metabolized at all and is thus entirely excreted as unchanged gbp via urine gallimore and gidal 2010 about 80 tons of gbp are excreted into the domestic german wastewater consequently gbp is often detected in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps with concentrations up to the μg l 1 range german wwtp influent 13 2 μg l 1 effluent 12 1 μg l 1 gurke et al 2015 uk wwtp influent up to 37 4 μg l 1 effluent up to 42 6 μg l 1 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009b data on the removal of gbp in wwtps are not conclusive as some studies reported no removal of gbp falås et al 2013 gurke et al 2015 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 kovalova et al 2013 margot et al 2016 morasch et al 2010 while others determined an almost complete removal of gbp during biological wastewater treatment kasprzyk hordern et al 2009a yu et al 2006 according to margot et al 2016 varying removal efficiencies of gabapentin during wastewater treatment may be due to the presence or absence of specific heterotrophic microorganisms able to degrade this compound due to the incomplete removal of gbp in wwtps gbp is frequently discharged into rivers in high quantities and was therefore detected with concentrations up to 2 μg l 1 in surface waters kasprzyk hordern et al 2009b the presence of gbp in surface water is of high concern since it showed teratogenic effects when fed to pregnant mice prakash et al 2008 however only very few studies investigated the environmental fate of gbp after the discharge by wwtps and reported also inconclusive data for example onesios and bouwer 2012 observed a very low removal of gbp in sand columns inoculated with wwtp effluent 10 removal within 200 days while yu et al 2006 observed high biodegradation 90 removal within 50 days in growth media inoculated with activated sludge different removal rates of organic micropollutants may be caused by different microbial community compositions and origins of the investigated inocula kim et al 2017 moreover a study revealed the susceptibility of gbp against photolysis herrmann et al 2015 and also described the formation of biologically stable transformation products 2 azaspiro 4 5 decan 3 one gbp lactam hydrolysis of gbp is reported to be of minor importance lyman et al 1990 as removal process however to the best of our knowledge no study reported the degradability of gbp or elucidated a transformation pathway in rivers and river sediment systematically and provided detailed information on the fate of gbp in the aquatic environment once it is discharged by wwtps to close this knowledge gap this study addresses the biological degradation of gbp in surface waters and river sediments special focus was laid on i the biodegradability of gbp in different river sediments ii the effect of different redox conditions aerobic anaerobic on the transformation of gbp iii the identification of transformation products tps and iv the proposal of a transformation pathway of gbp in river sediments in addition we sampled wwtp influents and effluents rivers and streams as well as groundwater and drinking water to investigate whether the tps and gbp can be detected as predicted from the lab scale experiments 2 materials and

water aerobic sediments and corresponding surface water were collected from three german rivers in january 2015 the river rhine at koblenz sediment a as well as at the small creeks baybach b and unterbach c see table s1 in the si the sediments were taken with a van veen sampler from a depth of 0 20 cm below the sediment surface and taken to lab in plastic buckets additionally an anaerobic sediment d was taken from the river elbe near hitzacker germany in july 2015 and stored air tight until the experiments were conducted surface water and sediments were stored at 4 c until the start of the experiments within 1 7 d 2 2 2 laboratory batch experiments the transformation of gbp and gbp lactam was investigated in water sediment systems wss and surface water systems ws under aerobic and anaerobic conditions table 1 to determine degradation rate constants the target compounds were spiked in triplicates at the μg l 1 level table 1 and the vessels were gently shaken on a reciprocating shaker to identify tps the target compounds were additionally spiked at elevated concentration at the mg l 1 range in duplicates aerobic or triplicates anaerobic as negative controls additional test vessels of each experimental condition were set up without spiking target substances 2 2 3 aerobic tests sediments were sieved 2 mm and added to corresponding surface water in 500 ml glass bottles to attain a sediment to water ratio of 1 5 dry weight to ensure oxygen saturation in the supernatant the bottles were kept open and were slightly shaken throughout the experiments after an equilibration period of nine days the ph was constant and the test substances were added separately to the test vessels löffler et al 2005 in addition sterile inactive control experiments by autoclaving filled test vessels three times for 15 min at 121 c were used to differentiate between biotic and abiotic transformation processes to inhibit an increase of the ph and a bacterial re growth the sterile vessels were bubbled with co2 air 10 co2 90 air directed through a 0 2 μm cellulose acetate filter sartorius göttingen germany after spiking the test substance and directly before each sampling date the test vessels were shaken to homogenize the slurry of the test systems after a short sedimentation time 1 2 ml were taken from the supernatant passed through syringe filters 0 45 μm cellulose acetate sartorius göttingen germany and stored in hplc vials at 4 c until further analysis additionally 10 ml samples filtered were taken from replicates spiked with elevated concentrations acidified with hcl and stored at 18 c in these samples dissolved organic carbon doc was quantified photometrically lck385 hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany all experiments were run at room temperature 22 1 c and at ph of 7 5 8 0 the ph was kept stable over the incubation time due to adding 10 co2 to the air bubbled through the water sediment systems 2 2 4 anaerobic tests for anaerobic degradation experiments 120 ml glass serum bottles were used each bottle was filled with 80 g of surface water 20 g of the anaerobic elbe sediment wss d and was closed with butyl stoppers to keep the system free of oxygen the surface water was purged with argon for 2 h before pouring into the test vessels to avoid contact with atmospheric oxygen all working steps concerning the preparation treatment and sampling of the batch experiments were conducted in a glovebox under argon atmosphere to be consistent with the aerobic experiments the test vessels were also slightly shaken 50 r min 1 and incubated in the dark at room temperature 22 1 c anaerobic conditions in the batch systems were randomly checked photometrically by measuring fe ii harvey et al 1955 after an equilibration time of 18 days target substances were added the equilibration time was reached when the reduction of fe iii to fe ii was observed for sampling 1 0 ml was filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm and stored at 18 c until further analysis the first sample was taken 30 min after spiking the test substance in parallel 3 0 ml were taken from the test systems with elevated spike concentrations and were immediately analyzed for doc 2 3 detection of target compounds in environmental samples grab samples of surface water from four german streams groundwater and potable water details see section 5 in the si were collected in addition corresponding 72 h composite samples from the influent and effluent of four conventional wwtps were taken table s6 in si the analytical procedure was analogous to the incubation samples samples of wwtp influents and effluents were diluted with ultra pure water 1 10 and 1 4 respectively the injection volume ranged from 20 to 80 μl recoveries of gbp and gbp lactam were determined in all different environmental matrices in triplicates at three different concentration levels 10 100 1000 ng l 1 results see si table s4 to determine the in situ degradation of gbp in a river an additional sampling campaign was carried out during a dry period of seven days 2016 07 06 2016 07 13 at a small stream usa in hessen germany hereto at two sampling sites a and b automated samplers p6 l and p6 mini maxx gmbh rangendingen germany collected 4 h a and 24 h b composite samples the flow distance between the two sampling sites was approximately 9 km flow period 1 day there was no substantial input of treated or untreated wastewater between the two sampling sites a 50 3597 n 8 5982 e b 50 3725 n 8 6818 e samples were collected daily filtered 0 45 μm and stored at 4 c until further analysis 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 quantification of target compounds prior to analysis gbp d4 and gbp lactam d6 were added as internal standards final concentration 150 ng l 1 for the

from the aqueous phase within 11 40 d in all wss exp 1 1 fig 1 a c in all three sediments the degradation of gbp can be described by a pseudo first order kinetic the rate constant kbiol ranged from 1

biomass quantity microbial community composition kim et al 2017 of the used sediments for further information on the sediments see table s1 in the si in incubation experiments without sediment exp 1 3 ws a gbp was only degraded after a lag phase of several days fig s1 a in si during autoclaved control experiments exp 1 4 gbp was only removed from the water phase to a negligible proportion 10 20 fig 1a c under anaerobic conditions exp 1 5 gbp was not significantly removed over the incubation duration of 54 days considering the analytical uncertainty wss d fig 1 d hence aerobic biotransformation processes in the sediments are most likely the primary drivers for the elimination of gbp during the laboratory incubations sorption is not expected to play a major role due to the very high polarity of gbp log d 1 55 chemicalize 2017 3 2 gbp lactam and its relevance in the transformation pathway in addition to many quantitatively less important tps see next section 3 3 aerobic degradation experiments with gbp revealed one major tp which was identified as gbp lactam tp153 m h m z 154 1227 2 azaspiro 4 5 decan 3 one table 2 gbp lactam is formed by an intramolecular cyclization of the carboxylic acid and the amine moiety resulting in a γ lactam amidation as at sterile and anaerobic conditions only a negligible quantity of gbp lactam was formed the transformation of gbp to gbp lactam is most likely a biologically mediated process which occurs predominantly under aerobic conditions under aerobic incubations the maximum concentrations of gbp lactam accounted for about 18 wss b and c of the initial gbp concentration fig 1b and c however gbp lactam is not stable as its concentrations decreased with incubation time fig 1b and c in wss a the concentrations of gbp lactam amounted only to up to 2 of initial gbp concentration in the study by herrmann et al 2015 gbp lactam was reported to be a major phototransformation product of gbp for mice zambon et al 2008 reported a 20 fold lower ld50 lethal dose for 50 of the tested population for gbp lactam than for gbp additionally it has been observed that gbp lactam causes myoclonic and generalized clonic seizures in kindled rats potschka et al 2000 gbp lactam is also known to be present as an impurity of gbp in pharmaceutical compositions zhixin et al 2011 as consequence the united states pharmacopeia usp limited the percentage of gbp lactam to less than 0 4 w w in pharmaceutical compositions to reduce adverse effects on patients zhixin et al 2011 to investigate the role of gbp lactam in the transformation pathway of gbp separate incubation experiments were conducted with gbp lactam exp 2 1 2 5 table 1 under aerobic conditions exp 2 1 wss a fig 2 a gbp lactam was almost completely removed 3 of initial concentration within 55 days meanwhile an intermediate formation of gbp up to 18 maximum at 26 d of the initial gbp lactam concentration was observed in contrast gbp was neither formed in the inactivated controls nor in the anaerobic experiments exp 2 4 and 2 5 fig 2a and b consequently the reverse reaction from gbp lactam to gbp amide hydrolysis appears to be also a biologically mediated process occurring under aerobic conditions in comparison to the elimination rates of gbp kbiol 3 9 0 2 x 10 6 s 1 in wss a those of gbp lactam were about six times slower kbiol 0 7 0 1 x 10 6 s 1 hence the minor gbp lactam formation in gbp experiments in wss a 2 of initial concentration fig 1 a cannot be explained by a fast further degradation of gbp lactam obviously there have to be alternative initial transformation reactions of gbp see section 3 3 in comparison to wss a gbp was degraded two to four times slower in wss c and b this was concurrent with an elevated formation of gbp lactam which also suggests that the amidation of gbp is only a side reaction of the transformation pathway of gbp in water systems without contact to sediment the decrease of gbp lactam exp 2 3 ws a dt50 100 30 d fig s1 b in si was up to nine times slower compared to the decrease in water sediment systems exp 2 1 wss a dt50 12 1 2 d fig 2 a table s5 in the si to check for further tps of gbp the theoretical carbon content of gbp and gbp lactam concentrations measured by lc ms were compared to total doc in spiked replicates exp 1 2 10 mg l 1 and negative controls see fig s2 in si in wss a where gbp was rapidly eliminated and gbp lactam was not formed the doc quickly declined to the level of the negative control fig s2 a in si in contrast in wss b where gbp was removed and gbp lactam was formed in appreciable quantities the doc only slowly decreased and after 120 d there was still a gap of approximately 20 between the doc in the spiked batches and the negative controls fig s2 b in si however this gap can be almost completely explained by the concentrations of gbp lactam which was still detectable after 120 d in general the doc considerations indicate that gbp lactam is likely the only quantitatively relevant tp 3 3 transformation pathway of gbp under aerobic conditions 3 3 1 identification of tps tps were identified by using a combination of a high resolution mass spectrometry hrms b ms ms fragmentation experiments ms2 ms3 c retention time rt shifts d transformation experiments with gbp gbp lactam and gbp d4 and e relative amounts formed in experiments spiked with gbp compared to those spiked with gbp lactam including gbp lactam at least seven increasing m z values were observed in the aerobic degradation studies two of these substances were identified via authentic reference standards gbp lactam tp186 and one by a self synthesized standard tp213 for details on the synthesis see section 1 3 in the si due to the missing carboxylic moiety lactam structure gbp lactam could only be detected in positive ionization mode esi m z 154 1228 δ 1 ppm while gbp was also detected in negative ionization mode esi gbp structure containing the acetic acid side chain m z 170 1192 δ 3 ppm although the sensitivity was much lower compared to esi mode m z 172 1334 δ 1 ppm hence peaks that were not detected in esi mode likely imply a lactam structure a further indication of lactam structures was a negligible shift in rt when using alkaline ph 8 9 instead of acidic ph 3 lc conditions the bigger shift in rt in case of gbp is caused by the deprotonated carboxylic acid moiety at ph 8 9 as e g the rt of gbp decreased substantially from 5 6 min to 2 1 min δrt 3 5 min while the rt of gbp lactam only changed marginally from 8 7 to 8 1 min δrt 0 6 min table 2 for gbp a noticeable in source fragmentation loss of water in the esi source 5 of gbp intensity during positive electrospray ionization occurred leading to a chromatographic peak with the same mass m z 154 1228 m h as gbp lactam at the rt of gbp see xic in si fig s39 the fragmentation behavior of the source fragment of gbp m z 154 1228 and the ms3 of gbp parent ion m z 154 1228 were identical but differed from the fragmentation pattern of gbp lactam compare figs 3 and 4 or figs s5 s6 s8 in the si while all three fragmentations included mainly combinations of a water h2o ammonia nh3 and carbon monoxide co cleavage two characteristic differences enabled to distinguish between gbp structures and lactam structures first the dominant fragment in the ms3 spectra of gbp parent ion m z 154 1228 was m z 137 0961 δ17 0269 nh3 fig 3 while the dominant fragment of gbp lactam ms2 of m z 154 1228 was m z 95 0854 δ59 0376 c2h5no loss of acetamide fig 4 furthermore a loss of water m z 136 1121 δ18 0109 h2o and carbon monoxide m z 126 1277 δ27 9953 co in the ms3 spectrum was only observed for gbp fig 3 exemplarily the structural elucidation of tps with a nominal m z of 186 1127 is discussed in detail in the following paragraph see table 2 tp185 was detected only in positive ionization mode at a nominal mass of m z 186 1127 m h and formed three chromatographic peaks ph 3 at retention times of 1 3 tp185a 1 4 tp185b and 2 1 3 0 min tp185c later named as peak 2 5 min due to insufficient chromatographic separation chromatograms see figs s21 and s28 in the si within a mass error of 1 ppm the only possible sum molecular formula m h allowing c h o n was c9h16o3n this molecular formula either indicates an additional keto group in comparison to gbp or a twofold hydroxylation of gbp lactam for proposed structures see table 2 different structural isomers might have been formed since at least three peaks were detected with the same nominal mass of 186 1127 additional measurements at ph 8 9 could not be used to distinguish between the gbp and gbp lactam backbone due to the already very early elution of the peaks at ph 3 however the shorter rts for tp185a b 1 3 and 1 4 min ph 3 table 2 are an indication for the presence of a carboxylic moiety of the gbp structure while tp185c 2 5 min ph 3 indicates a lactam structure according to the higher rt of gbp lactam 8 7 min ph 3 compared to gbp 5 6 min ph 3 see above and table 2 in addition peaks at 1 3 and 1 4 min were detected predominantly in studies with gbp and tp185c was found with higher intensities in experiments with gbp lactam as initial substance however more evidence for the proposed structure of the three tps was gained by the respective ms2 and ms3 spectra solely within the ms3 data of tp185c peak at rt 2 5 min 186 1127 168 1022 ms3 the cleavage of ethenone δ42 0108 c2h2o fragment mass m z 108 0812 after a twofold loss of water was found which is only possible if tp185c contains two oh moieties at the cyclohexane ring figs 5 and 6 a and not for the proposed structures of tp185a b table 2 likewise fragment m z 95 0855 in the ms3 spectrum of tp185c with fragment m z 168 1022 186 1127 168 1022 ms3 as parent ion formed by a loss of water fig 5 represents the cleavage of n formylformamide δ73 0164 c2h3no2 fig 6b this fragmentation reaction analogous to the formation of fragment 95 0854 out of gbp lactam via loss of c2h5no fig 4 is only possible if one hydroxyl group in tp185c is positioned at the alpha carbon close to the amide moiety as an oh group in alpha position to the amide nitrogen atom is expected to be unstable hence tp185c was identified as twofold hydroxylated gbp lactam whereas the exact positions of the hydroxyl groups could not be finally located chromatographic and hrms data indicate that several isomers are co eluting due to the short rts tp185a b was suggested to be gbp with a keto moiety formed via the dehydrogenation of an added oh group table 2 this assumption was backed up by the respective ms2 and ms3 spectra first the ms2 of tp185a shows a predominant loss of water m z 168 1022 δ18 0078 fig s23 in the si whereas tp185b reveals mainly a loss of ammonia m z 169 0861 δ17 0239 fig s25 in the si in addition fragment m z 98 0600 found in the ms3 spectrum of tp185a 186 1127 168 1022 ms3 fig s24 in the si formed by the cleavage of c4h6o δ70 0400 and fragment m z 128 0708 detected in ms2 spectrum of tp185b fig s25 in the si formed by the loss of c3h6o δ58 0392 indicates a keto moiety at the hexane ring as the loss of a c4 and c3 fragment is only possible at the hexane ring see fragmentation pathway in fig 6c furthermore hrms data of the transformation studies with gbp d4 studies deuterated at both free carbon atoms of the side chains clearly reveal no keto moiety in alpha position to the carboxylic acid carbon atom m z 190 1373 c9h12d4no3 δ 2 ppm hence the location of the keto group is limited to the cyclohexane ring whereas the exact positions could not be figured out 3 3 2 proposed transformation pathway the overall outcome was a varied web of transformation reactions which can be principally explained by five mechanisms i intramolecular amidation amide hydrolysis ii hydroxylation of the cyclohexane ring and side chain iii oxidative dehydrogenation of oh moieties iv oxidative deamination and v acetylation of the primary amine the proposed structures of the eight tps the time courses of their intensities during the incubation experiments and their role in the overall transformation pathway are shown in fig 7 along with a categorization of the reactions leading to the individual tps except for tp167 and tp185c all tps are only intermediates since their intensities decrease with ongoing incubation no further tps were detected however it was estimated from the peak areas that excluding gbp lactam all other tps did not account for a significant proportion 1 of the initial gbp concentration gbp lactam occurred during transformation of gbp as an intermediate product until further transformation or reverse reaction to gbp nevertheless gbp lactam was partially transformed to tp185c tp169 and tp167 except for tp187a b and tp185a b all tps were detected in incubation experiments with both gbp and gbp lactam fig 7 consequently gbp lactam was partly transformed to gbp via amide hydrolysis as it is indicated by the open ring structure of tp186 and tp213 observed in incubation experiments with gbp lactam as initial substance fig 7 and or further transformed via the same mechanisms as gbp e g hydroxylation tp169a b oxidative dehydrogenation tp167a b however gbp lactam was degraded at a slower rate in comparison to gbp see sections 3 1 and 3 2 which is why the decrease of gbp concentrations can only be explained to a small proportion by the formation of gbp lactam as a result the formation of gbp lactam is only a side reaction in the transformation pathway of gbp the acetylation of gbp tp213 is also considered to be only a secondary reaction no tps were detected that clearly indicate an oxidative ring opening followed by a successive shortening of the carbon chain via loss of co2 e g via baeyer villiger monooxygenases kawamoto et al 2008 stirling et al 1977 trudgill 1990 the reasons why no further tps were found might be i a very rapid degradation leading to mineralization ii insufficient detection limits iii high polarity and small masses of the tps not covered by the lc ms method or more unlikely iv sorption of tps to the sediment surface the inclusion of gbp lactam into the doc calculations provided a closed doc balance which confirms that no quantitatively relevant dead end tps in the water phase were overlooked therefore the overall transformation of gbp might contain the incorporation into biomass formation of volatile products or mineralization 4 environmental relevance of gbp and gbp lactam in order to investigate the occurrence of gbp and its biological quantitatively most relevant tp gbp lactam we monitored them in influents and effluents of four german wwtps as well as in receiving waters for sample details see section 5 in the si in wwtp influents gbp was present at high concentrations of up to 8 5 μg l 1 table 3 while the tp gbp lactam was only detected close to the loq 0 03 μg l 1 elimination rates of gbp during wastewater treatment ranged from 14 to 54 whereby gbp was partially transformed to gbp lactam table 3 as consequence concentrations of gbp lactam of up to 1 5 μg l 1 were detected in wwtp effluents the sum of gbp and gbp lactam quantified in wwtp effluents accounts to 58 96 of the gbp loads present in wwtp influents table 3 as sorption to sludge particles can be assumed to be of minor importance gbp lactam log d 1 03 chemicalize 2017 other tps than gbp lactam uptake into biomass and or mineralization might be responsible for the incomplete mass balances nevertheless gbp lactam is formed in wastewater treatment and hence is discharged together with gbp into surface waters gbp up to 3 2 μg l 1 and gbp lactam up to 0 7 μg l 1 both in the river usa table 4 at the small stream usa the concentrations of gbp and gbp lactam decreased by 48 and 25 between the two sampling sites respectively fig 8 however in order to determine the degradation it was necessary to compensate for dilution processes along the river stretch as the antiepileptic cbz is known to be persistent in natural systems due to its biotic and abiotic stability the decrease of its concentration was very likely caused only by dilution löffler et al 2005 as consequence the removal of gbp and gbp lactam was normalized by the concentration decrease of cbz 28 for gbp a removal of about 28 was observed while the load of gbp lactam did not change significantly along the flow distance fig 8 these results are in a good agreement with those obtained from water sediment experiments conducted in lab scale as gbp was degraded in the water sediment systems much faster kbiol 3 9 0 2 x 10 6 s 1 in wss a than gbp lactam kbiol 0 7 0 1 x 10 6 s 1 in wss a moreover high quantities of gbp lactam in surface waters might be mainly attributed to the presence of gbp lactam in wwtp effluents and only to a minor proportion to the degradation of gbp in rivers streams gbp and gbp lactam were also detected in german groundwater with concentrations up to 1 3 and 1 5 μg l 1 respectively table 4 while our studies showed the biodegradability of gbp in river sediments under aerobic conditions gbp was persistent under anaerobic conditions furthermore too short retention times as well as partly anaerobic conditions during bank or soil filtration might inhibit biodegradation and might be responsible for elevated gbp concentrations of up to 1 3 μg l 1 in groundwater and 0 6 μg l 1 in potable water high concentrations of gbp lactam of up to 1 5 μg l 1 in groundwater and 0 07 μg l 1 in potable water confirmed its environmental stability 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first study determining the fate of gbp in river sediments under abiotic and anaerobic conditions we showed that gbp is rapidly biodegraded in lab scale water sediment studies under aerobic conditions dt50 2 7 d and transformed to gbp lactam via amidation up to 18 of initial gbp concentration concerning the ubiquitous presence of gbp and gbp lactam in the urban water cycle especially groundwater and potable water further eco toxicological studies should be conducted to evaluate potential risks on ecosystems and human health due to the enhanced environmental persistence of gbp lactam compared to gbp we further advise to consider gbp lactam in monitoring programs moreover future investigations might focus on treatment technologies to effectively remove gbp and gbp lactam in wwtps prior to their discharge into receiving waters used for the production of drinking water hereof a combination of advanced treatment processes such as e g biological active granular activated carbon gac with oxidative processes such as ozonation might be promising approaches acknowledgements financial support by the federal ministry of education and

19637,we assessed the utility of online fluorescence spectroscopy for the real time evaluation of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water online fluorimeters were installed on the raw water intake at four groundwater derived uk public water supplies alongside existing turbidity sensors that are used to forewarn of the presence of microbial contamination in the water industry the fluorimeters targeted fluorescent dissolved organic matter dom peaks at excitation emission wavelengths of 280 365 nm tryptophan like fluorescence tlf and 280 450 nm humic like fluorescence hlf discrete samples were collected for escherichia coli total bacterial cell counts by flow cytometry and laboratory based fluorescence and absorbance both tlf and hlf were strongly correlated with e coli ρ 0 71 0 77 and total bacterial cell concentrations ρ 0 73 0 76 whereas the correlations between turbidity and e coli ρ 0 48 and total bacterial cell counts ρ 0 40 were much weaker no clear tlf peak was observed at the sites and all apparent tlf was considered to be optical bleed through from the neighbouring hlf peak therefore a hlf fluorimeter alone would be sufficient to evaluate the microbial water quality at these sources fluorescent dom was also influenced by site operations such as pump start up and the precipitation of cations on the sensor windows online fluorescent dom sensors are a better indicator of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water than turbidity and they have wide ranging potential applications within the water industry graphical abstract image

2002 worthington and smart 2017 and there is a shortage of suitable online detection methods that could be used to indicate contamination besmer and hammes 2016 currently online turbidity meters are commonly used as a simple pragmatic approach to forewarn of microbiological risk during unexpected pollution events despite turbidity not being considered a reliable indicator of microbiological contamination jung et al 2014 pronk et al 2006 ukwir 2012 an alternative approach for the water industry could be dissolved organic matter dom characterisation by fluorescence spectroscopy there is substantial research demonstrating that wastewater generally displays more intense dom fluorescence than natural waters especially at particular excitation emission wavelength pairs baker 2001 baker and inverarity 2004 carstea et al 2016 goldman et al 2012 lapworth et al 2008 reynolds and ahmad 1997 roehrdanz et al 2016 hence fluorescence spectroscopy could be a useful indicator of the wastewater contamination of natural waters used for drinking stedmon et al 2011 of particular interest is tryptophan like fluorescence tlf at an excitation emission λ ex λ em peak of around 280 350 nm as it has been demonstrated to be positively correlated with bod cod and toc cohen et al 2014 reynolds and ahmad 1997 reynolds 2002 more recently it has also been shown that contaminated drinking water sources containing thermotolerant faecal coliforms ttcs have significantly higher tlf than those that are uncontaminated sorensen et al 2015 2016 there is also a strong positive correlation between tlf intensity and ttc concentration in both field studies of drinking water baker et al 2015 sorensen et al 2015 2016 and controlled laboratory conditions fox et al 2017 to date studies investigating fluorescent dom as a predictor of drinking water contaminated by faecal indicator organisms have been based on infrequent spot sampling however fluorescent dom has the potential to be characterised online and in situ by low power led based fluorimeters such online deployments have predominantly focussed on studying dissolved organic carbon doc dynamics in marine systems and rivers ruhala and zarnetske 2017 shutova et al 2016 provide the only example of deployment in the water industry where online fluorimeters were used as an indicator of dom during the water treatment process the aim of this study was to understand the utility of online fluorescence spectroscopy for the real time evaluation of the microbial quality of raw drinking water at public supplies we measured tlf and humic like fluorescence hlf online at four groundwater derived public water supplies and compared this to in situ turbidity measurements culture based counts of e coli and total bacterial counts measured by flow cytometry 2 methods 2 1 study sites four groundwater derived public water supply sites were selected in southern england fig 1 these sites all abstract from varying types of fractured limestone which is the largest source of groundwater in the uk these limestone aquifers can have rapid flow paths and the selected sites are all known to experience episodic pollution events that are generally linked to heavy rainfall site 1 comprises portland stone formation boreholes site 2 chalk group springs site 3 chalk group boreholes and site 4 jurassic limestone springs 2 2 online analysis tlf was determined every two minutes on the raw water intake at each site for between 6 and 10 months this measurement was undertaken using a telemetered uvilux fluorimeter targeting the excitation emission peak at λ ex 280 15 nm and λ em 365 27 5 nm chelsea technologies group ltd uk the minimum detection limit for the sensor is 0 17 0 18 ppb dissolved tryptophan khamis et al 2015 hlf was also measured every two minutes at sites 1 2 and 3 using a telemetered uvilux fluorimeter targeting the excitation emission peak at λ ex 280 15 nm and λ em 450 27 5 nm chelsea technologies group ltd uk this fluorimeter did not target the centres of the hlf peaks typically observed at λ ex 260 and 320 360 nm fellman et al 2010 but was aligned at the same excitation as tlf because of the optical overlap between the two regions all fluorimeters were installed in flow through cells which excluded all natural light connected to sample taps at each site the temperature of water exiting each cell was monitored with a hobo tidbit v2 onset computer corporation usa factory calibrations were implemented on all uvilux sensors which express tlf and hlf intensity in equivalent units of dissolved tryptophan and quinine sulphate units qsu respectively the former unit is derived from direct calibration of the tlf sensor with tryptophan in deionised water the latter unit is a standardised parameter that relates the fluorescence intensity at λ ex 347 5 nm and λ em 450 nm from 1 ppb of quinine sulphate dissolved in 0 105 m perchloric acid to direct calibration of the hlf sensor with pyrene tetrasulphonic acid in deionised water for the calculation of a tlf hlf ratio tlf was converted to qsu by multiplication by 0 5365 this factor relates the fluorescence intensity of tryptophan to that of quinine sulphate at all sites abstracted raw groundwater is screened in real time against defined turbidity thresholds using nephelometric technology before passing into a treatment plant prior to onward distribution if water exceeds the defined threshold usually 1 ntu it is considered a potential threat to the provision of clean water as high levels of microbial contamination may be present alongside particles that could reduce treatment efficacy dwi 2010 in this case abstraction may cease or raw water may be directed to waste until turbidity returns to below the threshold these instances were observed regularly at sites 1 3 and 4 and all fluorescence data were disregarded during these periods that could last from hours to weeks only site 2 has a complete uninterrupted record of fluorescence data across the monitoring period 2 3 sample collection and laboratory analysis 2 3 1 sample collection and storage duplicate water samples were retrieved from each site on a regular basis for comparison with the online sensors one was collected and analysed for e coli within 8 h following standard water industry compliance procedures ea 2009 the second was collected in sterile 15 ml polypropylene tubes stored in the dark at 4 c and analysed for fluorescence and absorbance and total bacterial cell counts by flow cytometry these second samples were analysed within 48 96 h of collection sample stability tests were performed which confirmed the stability of samples over this timeframe see section 2 3 4 2 3 2 fluorescence and absorbance analysis fluorescence analysis was conducted on unfiltered samples at 20 c with λ ex between 200 and 400 nm 5 nm bandwidth and λ em between 280 and 500 nm 2 nm bandwidth using a varian cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer agilent technologies usa the scan rate was 9600 nm min and the detector voltage was set to 900 v all analysis was performed in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm the raman peak of ultrapure water at 348 nm was used to check for instrument stability prior to and following analysis for blank correction and to standardise the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems absorbance measurements were undertaken in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 1 nm intervals from 800 to 200 nm using a varian cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies usa all absorbance spectra were referenced to a blank of ultrapure water mean absorbance was 0 011 cm 1 σ 0 007 cm 1 at 280 nm this indicates that inner filter correction was not required since the primary inner filter effect was 3 7 across all samples lakowicz 2006 2 3 3 flow cytometry it has been proposed that the total number of bacterial cells by flow cytometry could act as an indicator for drinking water contamination as elevated counts could indicate contamination from external sources containing higher cell densities or the growth of bacteria within the distribution network lautenschlager et al 2013 consequently total bacterial counts were analysed for on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm solid state laser becton dickinson u k ltd oxford u k water samples 500 μl were stained with sybr green i sigma aldrich gillingham uk at a final concentration of 1 200 v v for 20 min in the dark at room temperature before running on the accuri at a slow flow rate 14 μl min 10 μm core for 5 min and a detection threshold of 1500 on channel fl1 a single manually drawn gate was created to discriminate bacterial cells from particulate background and cells per ml were calculated using the total cell count in 5 min divided by the reported volume run in μl the mean absolute error mae from 69 duplicate analyses across all sites was 6536 cells ml 2 3 4 sample stability a series of samples was collected sequentially from each of sites 1 2 and 4 these samples were destructively analysed in triplicate on a daily basis excluding weekends over eleven days for fluorescence and nine days for total bacterial cell counts following the procedures listed above for fluorescence equivalent tlf and hlf wavelength pairs corresponding to the in situ sensors were extracted from the excitation emission matrix the results are expressed in percentage change from the mean of three samples analysed after storage for one day fig s1 there was no consistent change in either tlf or hlf over 11 days hence variation in storage time before analysis is unlikely to have influenced the results nonetheless transformations during storage have been observed within the first 24 h which have not been considered here for example bieroza and heathwaite 2016 demonstrated increases in tlf of 9 11 in unfiltered surface water samples stored at 10 c over this timescale however potential changes in samples collected in this study are likely to be lower given the reduced storage temperature 4 c and because groundwater as a medium is likely to be more stable than river waters due to the generally lower concentrations of bacteria and nutrients of greater significance is the variability between samples analysed in triplicate on the same day fig s1 bacterial cell counts were consistently lower after storage for one day fig s1 with an overall mean decline of 12 between storage for one and two days across all samples nevertheless there was no apparent change between two and four days therefore it is considered that reported bacterial cells counts are marginally lower than at the time of sampling at sites 1 2 and 4 but variation in storage time between 2 and 4 days is unlikely to have influenced the results 2 4 statistical analysis correlations were assessed by spearman s rank spearman 1904 differences in the median between two populations were assessed by mann whitney tests and between multiple populations by the kruskal wallis method kruskal and wallis 1952 followed by a pairwise multiple comparison using dunn s method dunn 1964 e coli data were classified into world health organisation who risk categories for some analyses which defines risks based on the plate count per 100 ml who 1997 as follows very low 0 cfu low 1 9 cfu medium 10 99 cfu high 100 999 cfu and very high 1000 cfu all these statistical analyses were non parametric due to the non normal distribution of all datasets and performed in sigmaplot version 13 parallel factor analysis parafac was undertaken on blank corrected fluorescence eems from all sites to extract model and quantify the spectrally overlapping components parafac uses a least squares algorithm to decompose the data for further details on the method and approach see stedmon et al 2003 the analysis was undertaken using the domfluor v1 7 toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 in matlab version 9 1 rapid model convergence was obtained and validated using independent split half analysis of the dataset following removal of outlier data which had high leverage stedmon and bro 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 online indication of e coli there are strong correlations between tlf and e coli ρ 0 71 p 0 001 n 134 and hlf and e coli ρ 0 77 p 0 001 n 122 but only a moderate correlation between turbidity and e coli ρ 0 48 p 0 001 n 134 when grouping the e coli data into who risk categories tlf hlf and turbidity all vary significantly between categories kruskal wallis p 0 001 fig 2 significant differences exist between all categories for tlf dunn s method however for turbidity and hlf hlf was only monitored at sites 1 3 low and medium categories are not significantly different although both are significantly different from the very low category there were insufficient data to robustly include the high risk category in the analysis n 5 although all variables are generally most elevated in this category fig 2 consideration of the collated dataset as a whole is important for evaluating the universal applicability of these indicators ideally each indicator would also be assessed at each site individually to confirm that any collated analysis is not biased by site to site differences however there is a limited spread of data across risk categories at each individual site with which to undertake such analyses fig s2 where n 5 there is a significant difference between low and medium risk categories at site 1 for tlf mann whitney p 0 04 and turbidity mann whitney p 0 01 but not hlf mann whitney p 0 09 there are no significant differences between very low and low categories at site 2 for any variable mann whitney p 0 49 0 91 similarly correlations are only present at site 1 for all indicators 0 49 0 54 p 0 001 n 53 which has the largest number of samples that are spread across all risk categories at all sites tlf remains in excess of the proposed threshold of 1 3 ppb demonstrated by sorensen et al 2018 to indicate the presence of faecal contamination in untreated drinking water indeed all sites experience e coli contamination but this ranges from commonplace occurrence at site 1 93 of samples to episodic occurrence at site 3 12 of samples tlf always remains above the threshold because the sites appear to have a reasonably consistent tlf baseline of around 4 8 ppb fig 3 comparatively previous groundwater studies linking tlf to faecal indicator organisms in boreholes have suggested a zero tlf baseline sorensen et al 2015 2016 3 2 online indication of total bacterial cell counts a strong positive non linear correlation is observed between tlf and total bacterial cell counts although there is noticeable scatter fig 4 this positive correlation holds at several individual sites site 1 ρ 0 82 n 17 p 0 001 site 2 ρ 0 68 n 91 p 0 001 and site 4 ρ 0 70 n 5 p 0 23 no correlation is evident at site 3 ρ 0 11 n 11 p 0 73 because there is limited variation in tlf σ 0 1 ppb and bacterial cell counts σ 5800 cells ml in fact if site 3 is removed from the overall analysis the overall correlation becomes even stronger ρ 0 86 n 113 p 0 001 it is also noted that there is a discrepancy in the order of 2 ppb tlf at similar low bacterial cell counts between sites 2 and 3 hlf is strongly correlated with total bacterial cell counts in a collated dataset from sites 1 3 fig 4 again this positive correlation is observed at site 1 ρ 0 77 n 17 p 0 001 and site 2 ρ 0 65 n 91 p 0 001 but not site 3 where there is limited variation in counts the correlation coefficients for sites 1 and 2 are very similar to the correlation coefficients between tlf and total bacterial cell counts only a weak correlation is noted between turbidity and total bacterial cell counts across all sites fig 4 the only statistically significant correlation is actually observed at site 2 ρ 0 72 n 91 p 0 001 with no relationships at the other sites ρ 0 01 to 0 18 3 3 complete time series of online indicators at site 2 the complete dataset from site 2 shows the relationship between online indicators and bacteriological variables fig 5 there is a consistent tlf baseline iqr 0 9 ppb where e coli are generally absent or few in number and total bacterial cell counts are reasonably stable iqr 10 000 cells ml following rainfall increases in tlf e coli and total bacterial cell counts are noted these increases are greatest during the main groundwater recharge season ending in march and include several smaller peaks between late may and mid july hlf displays a near identical relationship to tlf and bacteriological variables over the time period examination of the tlf hlf ratio demonstrates it is reasonably stable at around 0 85 except during events when there is a decrease in the ratio due to a proportionally greater increase in hlf there is a noticeable decline in baseline tlf and hlf of around 0 8 ppb and 0 4 qsu respectively over the record turbidity increases appreciably during events in the main groundwater recharge season but returns back to baseline more quickly than the bacteriological and fluorescence variables this partially mirrors the results of pronk et al 2006 who demonstrated that following rises in turbidity doc and e coli counts in springs after rainfall turbidity rapidly returned to baseline values rapidly whereas both doc and e coli remained elevated for several more days these observations may result from turbidity predominantly being associated with larger particles which rapidly settle out whereas smaller particles also associated with bacteria and fluorescent dom continue to be transported through the system it is also noted that turbidity changes during late spring and summer rainfall events are minimal despite sizeable increases in bacteriological variables these observations indicate why turbidity is an inferior indicator of both e coli and total bacterial cells compared to fluorescence at site 2 3 4 hlf bleed through into the tlf spectral region the sensor data from sites 1 to 3 do not indicate a clear tlf peak with relatively constant tlf hlf ratios iqr 0 01 0 03 that never exceed 1 0 fig 3 mean laboratory fluorescence data also do not indicate a visual tlf peak fig 6 the tlf region appears completely masked by the neighbouring hlf peak centred at λ em 420 460 nm which bleeds through and causes an apparent amplified tlf signal deconvoluting the eems statistically using parafac analysis demonstrates that a two component model based on hlf peaks fig s3 explains 98 3 of the variability a validated three component model including an additional tlf component fig s3 provides only a very marginal improvement to 98 6 it is hence unsurprisingly that hlf and tlf were similarly correlated to both e coli and total bacterial cells in other studies hlf has proven to be similarly or better correlated than tlf to bod at wastewater treatment works cohen et al 2014 to total coliforms and e coli at springs frank et al 2018 and to e coli concentration during controlled laboratory experiments fox et al 2017 therefore a hlf fluorimeter alone may suffice for monitoring the microbial quality of untreated drinking water sources in many instances alternatively a sensor that excites at λ ex 280 nm and has a broader emission filter of λ em 335 500 nm could also provide comparable performance the advantage of this device would be a reduction in cost due to the replacement of an expensive narrow bandpass filter the ratios of fluorescent peaks are commonly used to address the issue of optical bleed through e g baker 2002 lapworth et al 2008 variability in tlf hlf ratios between sites demonstrates that there is not a consistent ratio in the absence of a clear tlf peak at these study sites fig 3 this observation arises because fluorescence intensity is always low and relatively consistent at wavelengths slightly shorter than the tlf region λ em 320 340 nm therefore an intense hlf peak will typically result in a lower tlf hlf ratio as the recession in fluorescence intensity from the peak is steeper fig 6b hence site 1 with a relatively intense hlf peak has a median ratio of 0 58 as opposed to a median ratio of 0 73 at site 3 which has the lowest intensity hlf peak consequently using tlf hlf ratios does not allow comparisons between sites although it may indicate relative changes in the fluorescent components at an individual site the lack of a clear tlf peak indicates the sites are not likely to have been appreciably impacted by wastewater during the monitoring period which is the most likely attribution of tlf in groundwater hlf is generally considered to be of allochthonous origin coble et al 2014 and is likely to derive from the near surface in groundwater therefore increases in fluorescence during rainfall events are indicative of water from the near surface rapidly impacting the sites 3 5 operational constraints at all water company sites operating procedures impacted fluorescence monitoring borehole pump start up resulted in spikes in fluorescence as well as turbidity at both borehole sites these spikes typically lasted for minutes to hours until returning to expected levels however fluorescence remained elevated for longer periods up to several days when the primary water source was rotated to another borehole at the same site that had remained on standby for days weeks boreholes contain elevated concentrations of planktonic bacteria cells and doc compared with the surrounding aquifer when they are not pumped due to the accumulation of organic material sorensen et al 2013 the longer a borehole is not pumped the greater the accumulation of this organic material within the borehole and adjacent aquifer consequently a greater load is mobilised by pump start up and it takes longer for fluorescence readings to stabilise furthermore there is likely to be build up of organic material within the pipe network with time when there is no active flow that would then only begin to clear upon pump start up variations in the active pumping rate within a borehole are also likely to impact fluorescence monitoring a higher flow rate increases flow velocities and shear stress within the borehole and aquifer increasing disturbance entrainment and shearing of biofilms previous research has demonstrated an increase in doc mobilisation and bacterial cell counts at higher pumping rates graham et al 2015 kwon et al 2008 a higher pumping rate through the pipe network could similarly increase biofilm mobilisation cloete et al 2003 with a resultant increase in tlf and hlf minor sensor drift of 0 3 0 8 ppb tlf over 6 10 months was evident at all sites and is the underlying cause of the change in baseline fluorescence over time at site 2 sensor drift was evaluated by testing the fluorimeters in ultrapure water and tryptophan standards before installation and following removal at the end of the project there was no visible sign of material on any sensor window but the apparent drift could be corrected for by cleaning the windows with a lens cloth it is recommended that suppliers supplement these optical sensors with self cleaning wipers on the windows for online installations this should resolve the problem but infrequent manual maintenance will still be required to validate the sensor readings more problematic was an installation at a riverbank filtration site that was not included in this paper here there was a dramatic 40 loss of signal in the first two weeks following installation fig s4 the sensor was cleaned and re installed on multiple occasions but similar rates in signal loss were always observed hydrochemical analysis of deposits removed from the windows indicated a build up of metals most notably iron the sensor windows are constructed from silica which has a surface comprising mainly silanol si o h groups any loss of the proton could allow the windows to become negatively charged attracting cations and there could also be exchange of the proton with cations in the sample there are a range of other variables that interfere with fluorescence spectroscopy measurements hudson et al 2007 notably temperature and turbidity khamis et al 2015 turbidity was generally very low with the 95th percentile being 1 0 0 1 0 1 and 1 6 ntu at sites 1 to 4 respectively temperature was similar at all sites with median values of between 10 6 and 12 2 c with variations typically limited to only 1 2 c and only very occasional greater variation therefore neither temperature nor turbidity are likely to have had appreciable influence on the fluorescence results it is possible to generate correction factors to account for variations in temperature and turbidity which could be automated online e g shutova et al 2016 and these may be necessary for surface water sources however khamis et al 2015 demonstrated only marginal improvements by correcting groundwater tlf data and suggest that corrections factors are likely to be unnecessary for groundwater sources universally as generally turbidity is very low and temperature is perennially stable 3 6 beyond an indicator of microbial quality in untreated water online fluorescence has viable applications beyond purely as an indicator of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water bridgeman et al 2015 identified a correlation between tlf and total bacterial cell counts within the treated drinking water distribution network albeit slightly weaker r2 0 56 than in this study the correlations between fluorescence and total bacterial counts observed herein and in bridgeman et al 2015 indicate that online fluorescence spectroscopy could represent a more practical cheaper and robust alternative to flow cytometry for monitoring total bacteria throughout the water supply network however flow cytometry has the potential to record other properties of bacterial communities including cell size viability the proportion of live and dead cells and the metabolically active proportion of the community hammes and egli 2010 within the treated water distribution network it has been demonstrated that hlf is relatively stable heibati et al 2017 so online fluorescence would be a potentially sensitive indicator of any water quality changes potential changes could include cross connection detection which many researchers have highlighted as a future use for online fluorescence e g hambly et al 2010 or failure in the water treatment system further uses could be strategic deployments at the outlets of service reservoirs and large diameter trunk mains which can both suffer from structural integrity issues nevertheless the use of online fluorescence spectroscopy for treated water is likely to be complicated by water treatment processes that remove fluorescent dom to various degrees carstea et al 2016 further work is need to appraise the utility of the technique on treated water fluorescence targeting hlf λ ex λ em of around 350 450 nm has been correlated with doc shutova et al 2016 and toc bieroza et al 2009 bridgeman et al 2015 stedmon et al 2011 in untreated and treated drinking water if peak c is related to the total organic matter load in water then online hlf fluorimeters could be useful to forewarn of the generation of harmful amounts of carcinogenic by products during certain types of disinfection such as trihalomethanes yang et al 2015 fluorescence spectroscopy could also be a useful indicator for the water industry or other abstractors for rapidly characterising the vulnerability of groundwater sources to contamination the higher the fluorescence either tlf or hlf then the stronger the likely link with the near surface which is the source of the majority of microbial and chemical contaminants therefore fluorescence could be considered an instantaneous assessor of risk for groundwater sources 4 conclusions online tryptophan like fluorescence tlf and humic like fluorescence hlf were both strongly correlated with e coli concentration and total bacterial cell counts at public water supplies the current commonly employed microbial indicator in the uk turbidity was more weakly correlated with both bacterial variables nevertheless turbidity is still an essential indicator of suspended solids in raw water that can affect treatment efficacy monitoring both tlf and hlf was unnecessary in this environment with minimal change in the ratio a hlf sensor alone would be sufficient for evaluating when water from the near surface was impacting a groundwater supply fluorescence data were strongly influenced by pump start up at borehole sources and at one site continuous build up of ferric deposits on the sensor reduced intensity by up to 40 within two weeks there is a need for manufacturers to supply fluorimeters that are more resistant to fouling for example through the provision of wiper systems online fluorescence could be a more practical approach for monitoring total bacterial cell counts than flow cytometry online fluorescence is an effective indicator of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water and could be effective throughout the water supply

flow cytometry 2 methods 2 1 study sites four groundwater derived public water supply sites were selected in southern england fig 1 these sites all abstract from varying types of fractured limestone which is the largest source of groundwater in the uk these limestone aquifers can have rapid flow paths and the selected sites are all known to experience episodic pollution events that are generally linked to heavy rainfall site 1 comprises portland stone formation boreholes site 2 chalk group springs site 3 chalk group boreholes and site 4 jurassic limestone springs 2 2 online analysis tlf was determined every two minutes on the raw water intake at each site for between 6 and 10 months this measurement was undertaken using a telemetered uvilux fluorimeter targeting the excitation emission peak at λ ex 280 15 nm and λ em 365 27 5 nm chelsea technologies group ltd uk the minimum detection limit for the sensor is 0 17 0 18 ppb dissolved tryptophan khamis et al 2015 hlf was also measured every two minutes at sites 1 2 and 3 using a telemetered uvilux fluorimeter targeting the excitation emission peak at λ ex 280 15 nm and λ em 450 27 5 nm chelsea technologies group ltd uk this fluorimeter did not target the centres of the hlf peaks typically observed at λ ex 260 and 320 360 nm fellman et al 2010 but was aligned at the same excitation as tlf because of the optical overlap between the two regions all fluorimeters were installed in flow through cells which excluded all natural light connected to sample taps at each site the temperature of water exiting each cell was monitored with a hobo tidbit v2 onset computer corporation usa factory calibrations were implemented on all uvilux sensors which express tlf and hlf intensity in equivalent units of dissolved tryptophan and quinine sulphate units qsu respectively the former unit is derived from direct calibration of the tlf sensor with tryptophan in deionised water the latter unit is a standardised parameter that relates the fluorescence intensity at λ ex 347 5 nm and λ em 450 nm from 1 ppb of quinine sulphate dissolved in 0 105 m perchloric acid to direct calibration of the hlf sensor with pyrene tetrasulphonic acid in deionised water for the calculation of a tlf hlf ratio tlf was converted to qsu by multiplication by 0 5365 this factor relates the fluorescence intensity of tryptophan to that of quinine sulphate at all sites abstracted raw groundwater is screened in real time against defined turbidity thresholds using nephelometric technology before passing into a treatment plant prior to onward distribution if water exceeds the defined threshold usually 1 ntu it is considered a potential threat to the provision of clean water as high levels of microbial contamination may be present alongside particles that could reduce treatment efficacy dwi 2010 in this case abstraction may cease or raw water may be directed to waste until turbidity returns to below the threshold these instances were observed regularly at sites 1 3 and 4 and all fluorescence data were disregarded during these periods that could last from hours to weeks only site 2 has a complete uninterrupted record of fluorescence data across the monitoring period 2 3 sample collection and laboratory analysis 2 3 1 sample collection and storage duplicate water samples were retrieved from each site on a regular basis for comparison with the online sensors one was collected and analysed for e coli within 8 h following standard water industry compliance procedures ea 2009 the second was collected in sterile 15 ml polypropylene tubes stored in the dark at 4 c and analysed for fluorescence and absorbance and total bacterial cell counts by flow cytometry these second samples were analysed within 48 96 h of collection sample stability tests were performed which confirmed the stability of samples over this timeframe see section 2 3 4 2 3 2 fluorescence and absorbance analysis fluorescence analysis was conducted on unfiltered samples at 20 c with λ ex between 200 and 400 nm 5 nm bandwidth and λ em between 280 and 500 nm 2 nm bandwidth using a varian cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer agilent technologies usa the scan rate was 9600 nm min and the detector voltage was set to 900 v all analysis was performed in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm the raman peak of ultrapure water at 348 nm was used to check for instrument stability prior to and following analysis for blank correction and to standardise the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems absorbance measurements were undertaken in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 1 nm intervals from 800 to 200 nm using a varian cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies usa all absorbance spectra were referenced to a blank of ultrapure water mean absorbance was 0 011 cm 1 σ 0 007 cm 1 at 280 nm this indicates that inner filter correction was not required since the primary inner filter effect was 3 7 across all samples lakowicz 2006 2 3 3 flow cytometry it has been proposed that the total number of bacterial cells by flow cytometry could act as an indicator for drinking water contamination as elevated counts could indicate contamination from external sources containing higher cell densities or the growth of bacteria within the distribution network lautenschlager et al 2013 consequently total bacterial counts were analysed for on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm solid state laser becton dickinson u k ltd oxford u k water samples 500 μl were stained with sybr green i sigma aldrich gillingham uk at a final concentration of 1 200 v v for 20 min in the dark at room temperature before running on the accuri at a slow flow rate 14 μl min 10 μm core for 5 min and a detection threshold of 1500 on channel fl1 a single manually drawn gate was created to discriminate bacterial cells from particulate background and cells per ml were calculated using the total cell count in 5 min divided by the reported volume run in μl the mean absolute error mae from 69 duplicate analyses across all sites was 6536 cells ml 2 3 4 sample stability a series of samples was collected sequentially from each of sites 1 2 and 4 these samples were destructively analysed in triplicate on a daily basis excluding weekends over eleven days for fluorescence and nine days for total bacterial cell counts following the procedures listed above for fluorescence equivalent tlf and hlf wavelength pairs corresponding to the in situ sensors were extracted from the excitation emission matrix the results are expressed in percentage change from the mean of three samples analysed after storage for one day fig s1 there was no consistent change in either tlf or hlf over 11 days hence variation in storage time before analysis is unlikely to have influenced the results nonetheless transformations during storage have been observed within the first 24 h which have not been considered here for example bieroza and heathwaite 2016 demonstrated increases in tlf of 9 11 in unfiltered surface water samples stored at 10 c over this timescale however potential changes in samples collected in this study are likely to be lower given the reduced storage temperature 4 c and because groundwater as a medium is likely to be more stable than river waters due to the generally lower concentrations of bacteria and nutrients of greater significance is the variability between samples analysed in triplicate on the same day fig s1 bacterial cell counts were consistently lower after storage for one day fig s1 with an overall mean decline of 12 between storage for one and two days across all samples nevertheless there was no apparent change between two and four days therefore it is considered that reported bacterial cells counts are marginally lower than at the time of sampling at sites 1 2 and 4 but variation in storage time between 2 and 4 days is unlikely to have influenced the results 2 4 statistical analysis correlations were assessed by spearman s rank spearman 1904 differences in the median between two populations were assessed by mann whitney tests and between multiple populations by the kruskal wallis method kruskal and wallis 1952 followed by a pairwise multiple comparison using dunn s method dunn 1964 e coli data were classified into world health organisation who risk categories for some analyses which defines risks based on the plate count per 100 ml who 1997 as follows very low 0 cfu low 1 9 cfu medium 10 99 cfu high 100 999 cfu and very high 1000 cfu all these statistical analyses were non parametric due to the non normal distribution of all datasets and performed in sigmaplot version 13 parallel factor analysis parafac was undertaken on blank corrected fluorescence eems from all sites to extract model and quantify the spectrally overlapping components parafac uses a least squares algorithm to decompose the data for further details on the method and approach see stedmon et al 2003 the analysis was undertaken using the domfluor v1 7 toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 in matlab version 9 1 rapid model convergence was obtained and validated using independent split half analysis of the dataset following removal of outlier data which had high leverage stedmon and bro 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 online indication of e coli there are strong correlations between tlf and e coli ρ 0 71 p 0 001 n 134 and hlf and e coli ρ 0 77 p 0 001 n 122 but only a moderate correlation between turbidity and e coli ρ 0 48 p 0 001 n 134 when grouping the e coli data into who risk categories tlf hlf and turbidity all vary significantly between categories kruskal wallis p 0 001 fig 2 significant differences exist between all categories for tlf dunn s method however for turbidity and hlf hlf was only monitored at sites 1 3 low and medium categories are not significantly different although both are significantly different from the very low category there were insufficient data to robustly include the high risk category in the analysis n 5 although all variables are generally most elevated in this category fig 2 consideration of the collated dataset as a whole is important for evaluating the universal applicability of these indicators ideally each indicator would also be assessed at each site individually to confirm that any collated analysis is not biased by site to site differences however there is a limited spread of data across risk categories at each individual site with which to undertake such analyses fig s2 where n 5 there is a significant difference between low and medium risk categories at site 1 for tlf mann whitney p 0 04 and turbidity mann whitney p 0 01 but not hlf mann whitney p 0 09 there are no significant differences between very low and low categories at site 2 for any variable mann whitney p 0 49 0 91 similarly correlations are only present at site 1 for all indicators 0 49 0 54 p 0 001 n 53 which has the largest number of samples that are spread across all risk categories at all sites tlf remains in excess of the proposed threshold of 1 3 ppb demonstrated by sorensen et al 2018 to indicate the presence of faecal contamination in untreated drinking water indeed all sites experience e coli contamination but this ranges from commonplace occurrence at site 1 93 of samples to episodic occurrence at site 3 12 of samples tlf always remains above the threshold because the sites appear to have a reasonably consistent tlf baseline of around 4 8 ppb fig 3 comparatively previous groundwater studies linking tlf to faecal indicator organisms in boreholes have suggested a zero tlf baseline sorensen et al 2015 2016 3 2 online indication of total bacterial cell counts a strong positive non linear correlation is observed between tlf and total bacterial cell counts although there is noticeable scatter fig 4 this positive correlation holds at several individual sites site 1 ρ 0 82 n 17 p 0 001 site 2 ρ 0 68 n 91 p 0 001 and site 4 ρ 0 70 n 5 p 0 23 no correlation is evident at site 3 ρ 0 11 n 11 p 0 73 because there is limited variation in tlf σ 0 1 ppb and bacterial cell counts σ 5800 cells ml in fact if site 3 is removed from the overall analysis the overall correlation becomes even stronger ρ 0 86 n 113 p 0 001 it is also noted that there is a discrepancy in the order of 2 ppb tlf at similar low bacterial cell counts between sites 2 and 3 hlf is strongly correlated with total bacterial cell counts in a collated dataset from sites 1 3 fig 4 again this positive correlation is observed at site 1 ρ 0 77 n 17 p 0 001 and site 2 ρ 0 65 n 91 p 0 001 but not site 3 where there is limited variation in counts the correlation coefficients for sites 1 and 2 are very similar to the correlation coefficients between tlf and total bacterial cell counts only a weak correlation is noted between turbidity and total bacterial cell counts across all sites fig 4 the only statistically significant correlation is actually observed at site 2 ρ 0 72 n 91 p 0 001 with no relationships at the other sites ρ 0 01 to 0 18 3 3 complete time series of online indicators at site 2 the complete dataset from site 2 shows the relationship between online indicators and bacteriological variables fig 5 there is a consistent tlf baseline iqr 0 9 ppb where e coli are generally absent or few in number and total bacterial cell counts are reasonably stable iqr 10 000 cells ml following rainfall increases in tlf e coli and total bacterial cell counts are noted these increases are greatest during the main groundwater recharge season ending in march and include several smaller peaks between late may and mid july hlf displays a near identical relationship to tlf and bacteriological variables over the time period examination of the tlf hlf ratio demonstrates it is reasonably stable at around 0 85 except during events when there is a decrease in the ratio due to a proportionally greater increase in hlf there is a noticeable decline in baseline tlf and hlf of around 0 8 ppb and 0 4 qsu respectively over the record turbidity increases appreciably during events in the main groundwater recharge season but returns back to baseline more quickly than the bacteriological and fluorescence variables this partially mirrors the results of pronk et al 2006 who demonstrated that following rises in turbidity doc and e coli counts in springs after rainfall turbidity rapidly returned to baseline values rapidly whereas both doc and e coli remained elevated for several more days these observations may result from turbidity predominantly being associated with larger particles which rapidly settle out whereas smaller particles also associated with bacteria and fluorescent dom continue to be transported through the system it is also noted that turbidity changes during late spring and summer rainfall events are minimal despite sizeable increases in bacteriological variables these observations indicate why turbidity is an inferior indicator of both e coli and total bacterial cells compared to fluorescence at site 2 3 4 hlf bleed through into the tlf spectral region the sensor data from sites 1 to 3 do not indicate a clear tlf peak with relatively constant tlf hlf ratios iqr 0 01 0 03 that never exceed 1 0 fig 3 mean laboratory fluorescence data also do not indicate a visual tlf peak fig 6 the tlf region appears completely masked by the neighbouring hlf peak centred at λ em 420 460 nm which bleeds through and causes an apparent amplified tlf signal deconvoluting the eems statistically using parafac analysis demonstrates that a two component model based on hlf peaks fig s3 explains 98 3 of the variability a validated three component model including an additional tlf component fig s3 provides only a very marginal improvement to 98 6 it is hence unsurprisingly that hlf and tlf were similarly correlated to both e coli and total bacterial cells in other studies hlf has proven to be similarly or better correlated than tlf to bod at wastewater treatment works cohen et al 2014 to total coliforms and e coli at springs frank et al 2018 and to e coli concentration during controlled laboratory experiments fox et al 2017 therefore a hlf fluorimeter alone may suffice for monitoring the microbial quality of untreated drinking water sources in many instances alternatively a sensor that excites at λ ex 280 nm and has a broader emission filter of λ em 335 500 nm could also provide comparable performance the advantage of this device would be a reduction in cost due to the replacement of an expensive narrow bandpass filter the ratios of fluorescent peaks are commonly used to address the issue of optical bleed through e g baker 2002 lapworth et al 2008 variability in tlf hlf ratios between sites demonstrates that there is not a consistent ratio in the absence of a clear tlf peak at these study sites fig 3 this observation arises because fluorescence intensity is always low and relatively consistent at wavelengths slightly shorter than the tlf region λ em 320 340 nm therefore an intense hlf peak will typically result in a lower tlf hlf ratio as the recession in fluorescence intensity from the peak is steeper fig 6b hence site 1 with a relatively intense hlf peak has a median ratio of 0 58 as opposed to a median ratio of 0 73 at site 3 which has the lowest intensity hlf peak consequently using tlf hlf ratios does not allow comparisons between sites although it may indicate relative changes in the fluorescent components at an individual site the lack of a clear tlf peak indicates the sites are not likely to have been appreciably impacted by wastewater during the monitoring period which is the most likely attribution of tlf in groundwater hlf is generally considered to be of allochthonous origin coble et al 2014 and is likely to derive from the near surface in groundwater therefore increases in fluorescence during rainfall events are indicative of water from the near surface rapidly impacting the sites 3 5 operational constraints at all water company sites operating procedures impacted fluorescence monitoring borehole pump start up resulted in spikes in fluorescence as well as turbidity at both borehole sites these spikes typically lasted for minutes to hours until returning to expected levels however fluorescence remained elevated for longer periods up to several days when the primary water source was rotated to another borehole at the same site that had remained on standby for days weeks boreholes contain elevated concentrations of planktonic bacteria cells and doc compared with the surrounding aquifer when they are not pumped due to the accumulation of organic material sorensen et al 2013 the longer a borehole is not pumped the greater the accumulation of this organic material within the borehole and adjacent aquifer consequently a greater load is mobilised by pump start up and it takes longer for fluorescence readings to stabilise furthermore there is likely to be build up of organic material within the pipe network with time when there is no active flow that would then only begin to clear upon pump start up variations in the active pumping rate within a borehole are also likely to impact fluorescence monitoring a higher flow rate increases flow velocities and shear stress within the borehole and aquifer increasing disturbance entrainment and shearing of biofilms previous research has demonstrated an increase in doc mobilisation and bacterial cell counts at higher pumping rates graham et al 2015 kwon et al 2008 a higher pumping rate through the pipe network could similarly increase biofilm mobilisation cloete et al 2003 with a resultant increase in tlf and hlf minor sensor drift of 0 3 0 8 ppb tlf over 6 10 months was evident at all sites and is the underlying cause of the change in baseline fluorescence over time at site 2 sensor drift was evaluated by testing the fluorimeters in ultrapure water and tryptophan standards before installation and following removal at the end of the project there was no visible sign of material on any sensor window but the apparent drift could be corrected for by cleaning the windows with a lens cloth it is recommended that suppliers supplement these optical sensors with self cleaning wipers on the windows for online installations this should resolve the problem but infrequent manual maintenance will still be required to validate the sensor readings more problematic was an installation at a riverbank filtration site that was not included in this paper here there was a dramatic 40 loss of signal in the first two weeks following installation fig s4 the sensor was cleaned and re installed on multiple occasions but similar rates in signal loss were always observed hydrochemical analysis of deposits removed from the windows indicated a build up of metals most notably iron the sensor windows are constructed from silica which has a surface comprising mainly silanol si o h groups any loss of the proton could allow the windows to become negatively charged attracting cations and there could also be exchange of the proton with cations in the sample there are a range of other variables that interfere with fluorescence spectroscopy measurements hudson et al 2007 notably temperature and turbidity khamis et al 2015 turbidity was generally very low with the 95th percentile being 1 0 0 1 0 1 and 1 6 ntu at sites 1 to 4 respectively temperature was similar at all sites with median values of between 10 6 and 12 2 c with variations typically limited to only 1 2 c and only very occasional greater variation therefore neither temperature nor turbidity are likely to have had appreciable influence on the fluorescence results it is possible to generate correction factors to account for variations in temperature and turbidity which could be automated online e g shutova et al 2016 and these may be necessary for surface water sources however khamis et al 2015 demonstrated only marginal improvements by correcting groundwater tlf data and suggest that corrections factors are likely to be unnecessary for groundwater sources universally as generally turbidity is very low and temperature is perennially stable 3 6 beyond an indicator of microbial quality in untreated water online fluorescence has viable applications beyond purely as an indicator of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water bridgeman et al 2015 identified a correlation between tlf and total bacterial cell counts within the treated drinking water distribution network albeit slightly weaker r2 0 56 than in this study the correlations between fluorescence and total bacterial counts observed herein and in bridgeman et al 2015 indicate that online fluorescence spectroscopy could represent a more practical cheaper and robust alternative to flow cytometry for monitoring total bacteria throughout the water supply network however flow cytometry has the potential to record other properties of bacterial communities including cell size viability the proportion of live and dead cells and the metabolically active proportion of the community hammes and egli 2010 within the treated water distribution network it has been demonstrated that hlf is relatively stable heibati et al 2017 so online fluorescence would be a potentially sensitive indicator of any water quality changes potential changes could include cross connection detection which many researchers have highlighted as a future use for online fluorescence e g hambly et al 2010 or failure in the water treatment system further uses could be strategic deployments at the outlets of service reservoirs and large diameter trunk mains which can both suffer from structural integrity issues nevertheless the use of online fluorescence spectroscopy for treated water is likely to be complicated by water treatment processes that remove fluorescent dom to various degrees carstea et al 2016 further work is need to appraise the utility of the technique on treated water fluorescence targeting hlf λ ex λ em of around 350 450 nm has been correlated with doc shutova et al 2016 and toc bieroza et al 2009 bridgeman et al 2015 stedmon et al 2011 in untreated and treated drinking water if peak c is related to the total organic matter load in water then online hlf fluorimeters could be useful to forewarn of the generation of harmful amounts of carcinogenic by products during certain types of disinfection such as trihalomethanes yang et al 2015 fluorescence spectroscopy could also be a useful indicator for the water industry or other abstractors for rapidly characterising the vulnerability of groundwater sources to contamination the higher the fluorescence either tlf or hlf then the stronger the likely link with the near surface which is the source of the majority of microbial and chemical contaminants therefore fluorescence could be considered an instantaneous assessor of risk for groundwater sources 4 conclusions online tryptophan like fluorescence tlf and humic like fluorescence hlf were both strongly correlated with e coli concentration and total bacterial cell counts at public water supplies the current commonly employed microbial indicator in the uk turbidity was more weakly correlated with both bacterial variables nevertheless turbidity is still an essential indicator of suspended solids in raw water that can affect treatment efficacy monitoring both tlf and hlf was unnecessary in this environment with minimal change in the ratio a hlf sensor alone would be sufficient for evaluating when water from the near surface was impacting a groundwater supply fluorescence data were strongly influenced by pump start up at borehole sources and at one site continuous build up of ferric deposits on the sensor reduced intensity by up to 40 within two weeks there is a need for manufacturers to supply fluorimeters that are more resistant to fouling for example through the provision of wiper systems online fluorescence could be a more practical approach for monitoring total bacterial cell counts than flow cytometry online fluorescence is an effective indicator of the microbial quality of untreated drinking water and could be effective throughout the water supply

19638,tetracycline tc is one of the most widely used antibiotics with significant impacts on human health and thus it needs appropriate approaches for its removal in the present study we evaluated the performance and complete pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation on a ti ti4o7 anode prepared by plasma spraying morphological data and composition analysis indicated a compact coating layer on the anode which had the characteristic peaks of ti4o7 as active constituent the tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode followed a pseudo first order kinetics and the tc removal efficiency reached 95 8 in 40 min the influential factors on tc decay kinetics included current density anode cathode distance and initial tc concentration this anode also had high durability and the tc removal efficiency was maintained over 95 after five times reuse for the first time we unraveled the complete pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation using high performance liquid chromatograph hplc and gas chromatograph gc coupled with mass spectrometer ms oh radicals produced from electrochemical oxidation attack the double bond phenolic group and amine group of tc forming a primary intermediate m z 461 secondary intermediates m z 432 477 and 509 and tertiary intermediates m z 480 448 and 525 the latter were further oxidized to the key downstream intermediate m z 496 followed by further downstream intermediates m z 451 412 396 367 351 298 and 253 and eventually short chain carboxylic acids we also evaluated the toxicity change during the electrochemical oxidation process with bioluminescent bacteria the bioluminescence inhibition ratio peaked at 10 min 55 41 likely owing to the high toxicity of intermediates with m z 461 432 and 477 as obtained from quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis the bioluminescence inhibition ratio eventually decreased to 16 78 in 40 min due to further transformation of tc and intermediates by comprehensively analyzing the influential factors and complete degradation pathway of tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode our research provides deeper insights into the risk assessment of intermediates and their toxicity assigning new perspectives for practical electrochemical oxidation to effectively eliminate the amount and toxicity of tc and other antibiotics in wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords tetracycline ti ti4o7 anode electrochemical oxidation degradation pathway toxicity assessment 1 introduction antibiotics in water have received increasing attention because of their biological impact and potential risks to the environment and human health christou et al 2017 jin et al 2017 wang et al 2016a among various antibiotics tetracycline tc is extensively used for treating human diseases and rearing livestocks due to its great therapeutic values brinzila et al 2012 vedenyapina et al 2008 wu et al 2012 nevertheless the majority of tc is discharged into the environment owing to its poor decomposition in animals and human bodies liu et al 2013 therefore environmental media have become the main sink of tc wastewater is an important source of tc to the environment in which tc concentration reaches up to 2 2 mg l and the situation is increasingly deteriorating yang et al 2014 additionally studies also report high levels of tc detected in groundwater and surface water 0 1 4 5 μg l showing threats to the aquatic environment pena et al 2010 tc can intensify the threats of pharmaceutical resistance among microbial populations and generate even more toxic degradation by products khan et al 2010 wu et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 hence eliminating tc is urgently needed various techniques have been widely investigated for tc removal from wastewater including biological processes benavides et al 2017 coagulation saitoh et al 2017 sedimentation saitoh et al 2014 adsorption yu et al 2017 ozonation khan et al 2010 photocatalysis wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 and photoelectrocatalysis daghrir et al 2013 conventional methods e g biological processes coagulation sedimentation and adsorption cannot achieve high tc removal efficiency and rate because they are not specifically designed for tc degradation benavides et al 2017 saitoh et al 2014 2017 yu et al 2017 ozonation is effective to remove tc owing to its high oxidation performance but the removal efficiency of total organic carbon toc is not satisfactory because ozonation can typically degrade organic compounds into short chain carboxylic acids but not completely into co2 and h2o dalmazio et al 2007 khan et al 2010 high tc and toc removal efficiencies can be achieved by photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis for their high catalytic oxidation activities but the relatively high cost might limit their large scale application daghrir et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 therefore it is still necessary to develop more efficient processes to eliminate tc from the effluents of wastewater treatment plants in recent years electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been shown to be a promising technology for removing tc because of their strong oxidation performance mild conditions and environmental compatibility brinzila et al 2012 rossi et al 2008 yang et al 2016 the performance of eaops is greatly dependent on the activity and stability of the anode cho and hoffmann 2015 yang and hoffmann 2016 several anodes are reported to have satisfactory performance in electrochemically oxidizing tc e g ti ruo2 ti ruo2 iro2 and boron doped diamond bdd brinzila et al 2012 rossi et al 2008 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 the ti ruo2 and ti ruo2 iro2 anodes can achieve high tc removal efficiency 90 but fail in removing cod and toc effectively 30 rossi et al 2008 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 the bdd anode is a better electrochemical anode because it nearly completely mineralizes tc and its intermediates achieving high removal efficiencies of tc 95 cod 93 and toc 87 brinzila et al 2012 however the bdd anode has a relatively high price 15 000 22 000 m2 and this limits its industrial applications radjenovic and sedlak 2015 recently substoichiometric titanium dioxide ti4o7 has been proposed as an alternative anode material with the features of having high oxygen evolution potential oep good electrical conductivity satisfactory chemical stability and easy preparation guo et al 2016 santos et al 2016 you et al 2016 zaky and chaplin 2014 the mechanisms of oxidizing organic compounds over the ti4o7 anode are mainly ascribed to the high reactivity of physisorbed hydroxyl radicals a oh which form when water is oxidized at the surface of the non active anode bejan et al 2012 zaky and chaplin 2013 additionally the involvement of oh radicals in the electrochemical oxidation process over the ebonex anode a sub oxide of tio2 with the optimal electrical conductivity at the composition of ti4o7 has been reported in a previous study by spin trapping bejan et al 2012 the formation and activity of oh radicals on the ti4o7 anode is also proved by guo and nayak with coumarin and terephthalic acid probes guo et al 2016 nayak and chaplin 2018 with similar oep compared to the bdd anode chen 2004 the ti4o7 anode shows great potential in removing tc with high efficiencies through electrochemical oxidation nevertheless only a few studies have applied the ti4o7 anode in wastewater treatment a porous magneli phase ti4o7 anode was used for industrial wastewater electrochemical oxidation achieving high cod 66 and dissolved organic carbon 47 removal efficiencies you et al 2016 the use of the porous ti4o7 anode as a reactive electrochemical membrane had a satisfactory removal efficiency for phenolic compounds nearly 100 in wastewater zaky and chaplin 2014 nevertheless there is no study addressing the performance and influential factors of the ti4o7 anode in the tc electrochemical oxidation meanwhile the incomplete mineralization upon tc electrochemical oxidation has recently raised new concerns due to the toxicity of residual intermediates in effluents thus the tc degradation pathway draws more attention for evaluating the toxicity of intermediates which is an issue in many oxidation processes of other organic pollutants for instance the degradation intermediates of bezafibrate and ofloxacin in the ozonation process are more toxic than their parent compounds resulting in an increased toxicity of effluents sui et al 2017 tay and madehi 2015 some previous studies have reported the degradation pathways of tc in ozonation and photocatalysis which significantly alter the effluent toxicity khan et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 only one literature study has reported an incomplete tc degradation pathway and the toxicity change during the electrochemical oxidation process over a ti ruo2 iro2 anode wu et al 2012 proposing only five intermediates and finding that the delay of toxicity reduction is attributed to some quinone intermediates nevertheless the complete tc electrochemical oxidation pathway is not unraveled and the mechanism of intermediate toxicity change remains unclear deeper investigation into the degradation pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation can provide more comprehensive understandings of the intermediates responsible for most of the toxicity and benefit the implementation of electrochemical oxidation treatment methods for wastewater containing tc in this study a satisfactory performance of the tc electrochemical oxidation was achieved by a ti ti4o7 anode prepared by plasma spraying besides evaluating the tc degradation kinetics and influential factors applied current density anode cathode distance and initial tc concentration our work for the first time identified the complete tc electrochemical oxidation pathway by analysing the degradation intermediates moreover the toxicities of these intermediates were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis to facilitate the understanding of the measured toxicity change during the tc electrochemical oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparing the ti ti4o7 anode the

l cph japan the mineralization current efficiency mce for each treatment at a given time t h was calculated following the analytical procedure reported by hamza hamza et al 2009 details in supporting information effluent toxicity was analyzed in a toxicity analyzer hach lumistox 300 america using bioluminescent vibrio fischeri bacteria according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater rice et al 2012 the bacterial bioluminescent signals were measured after 15 min incubation at 20 1 c 2 4 data analysis kinetics of the tc electrochemical oxidation were calculated based on a pseudo first order kinetic model as described in equation 1 1 d c d t k a c 0 where c mg l is the tc concentration at time t min and c 0 mg l is the initial tc concentration k a min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant in semi log plot ln c ln c 0 k a t the kinetic parameters k a half life t 1 2 correlation coefficient r 2 were calculated from the fitting of the experimental data with the linear regression the bioluminescence inhibition ratio was calculated as described in equation 2 l blank and l sample represent the bioluminescent signals after 15 min incubation in the

bioluminescence inhibition ratio l b l a n k l s a m p l e l b l a n k 100 qsar was used to assess the ecotoxicological potentials of tc and its intermediates with the aid of the ecosar program coupled with epiwin software sui et al 2017 qsar uses the structural information of targeted compounds and provides lc50 values for fish 96 h and daphnid 48 h ec50 values for green algae 96 or 144 h and the values of chronic toxicity all the results were expressed in means standard error the spss package version 11 0 was used for statistical analysis and a p value 0 05 was considered for statistical significance all the graphs were plotted using origin 8 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the ti ti4o7 anode the composition of the titanium plate before and after spraying was examined by xrd as shown in fig 1 the diffraction peaks of the titanium plate are mainly located at 2θ 35 1 38 4 40 2 53 0 62 9 70 7 74 2 76 2 77 4 82 3 and 86 8 matching well with the standard characteristic peaks of titanium jcpds card no 44 1294 after spraying the diffraction peaks are located at 2θ 20 8 26 4 35 4 38 3 40 5 53 0 53 20 63 0 70 6 75 6 and 82 0 fig 1 fitting well with the standard characteristic peaks of ti4o7 jcpds card no 50 0787 no clear diffraction peaks of titanium were observed after spraying and the results indicate the successful ti4o7 coating of the titanium plate the ti4o7 anode prepared by high temperature reduction of tio2 plate has different phases of titanium suboxides zhang et al 2014 among which ti4o7 exhibits the best conductivity guo et al 2016 zaky and chaplin 2014 therefore our ti ti4o7 anode obtained by plasma spraying may have better electrical conductivity and contribute to higher performance in the tc electrochemical oxidation the sem images of the titanium plate before and after spraying illustrate significant morphological changes as shown in fig s1 the surface of the original titanium plate is rough and homogenous fig s1a whereas the anode surface after spraying is a compact and homogenous coating layer fig s1b the strong adhesion of the compact layer might strengthen the stability of the anode yang and hoffmann 2016 the eds data fig s2 and table s2 show that titanium is the predominant element on the original titanium plate surface 98 79 atom before spraying whereas its atomic percentage decreases to 27 27 after spraying and the oxygen atomic percentage increases from 1 21 to 63 64 the ratio of titanium to oxygen atoms on the surface of the sprayed titanium plate is 27 27 63 64 close to 4 7 ti o ratio in ti4o7 further confirming the formation of a ti4o7 coating layer on the titanium plate as the ti ti4o7 anode lsv results in fig s3 illustrated a similar oep of the prepared ti ti4o7 anode 2 6 v vs sce as that of the ti ti4o7 anode developed by spark plasma sintering 2 5 v vs sce zhang et al 2014 the oep of our ti ti4o7 anode was close to that of the bdd anode 2 3 2 7 v vs sce and higher than those of the sno2 anode 1 9 v vs sce iro2 anode 1 6 v vs sce pbo2 anode 1 9 v vs sce and pt anode 1 3 1 6 v vs sce chen 2004 higher oep values represent lower side reactions of oxygen formation and higher current efficiencies li et al 2016 which can promote the electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants additionally the price of our ti ti4o7 anode is about 6100 m2 for details see table s5 in supporting information which is about 60 70 lower than that of the bdd anode 15 000 22 000 m2 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 furthermore large scale industrial manufacturing can further reduce the price of the ti ti4o7 anode suggesting that it is a cheap anode material for electrochemical oxidation and has a huge potential in industrial practices for wastewater treatment 3 2 kinetics of the tc electrochemical oxidation the ti ti4o7 anode achieved 95 8 tc degradation efficiency under standard conditions 40 min reaction time 15 ma cm2 current density 10 mm anode cathode distance and 5 mg l initial tc concentration table 1 the removal efficiency of toc was 75 7 and the mce was 9 9 fig 2 a there was little change in tc degradation efficiency toc removal and mce by prolonging the reaction time to 60 min compared to the ti ruo2 iro2 anode 95 0 63 5 ma cm2 current density and 60 min reaction time zhang et al 2009 our ti ti4o7 anode had a similar tc electrochemical degradation efficiency but higher toc removal efficiency compared to the cod removal efficiency reported by zhang et al 33 the removal efficiencies of tc toc and cod by the bdd anode at 300 a m2 after 240 min reaction were 99 87 and 93 respectively brinzila et al 2012 therefore our ti ti4o7 anode had comparable efficiencies in mineralizing tc and its intermediates as the bdd anode and significantly higher than the ti ruo2 iro2 anode the anodic potential of our ti ti4o7 anode was above 2 5 v vs she similar to those of the ti4o7 reactive electrochemical membrane 1 9 3 2 v vs she and ebonex 2 14 2 64 v vs she anodes which have been reported to form hydroxyl radicals oh at potential above 2 2 v vs she zaky and chaplin 2013 guo et al 2016 nayak and chaplin 2018 also proved the formation of oh radicals on the ti4o7 anode guo et al 2016 suggested that significant concentrations of oh radicals formed at potentials higher than 2 8 v vs she but the formation of oh radicals was observed at potentials above 2 2 v vs she zaky and chaplin 2014 reported two pathways for the electrochemical oxidation of phenolic compounds on eaop anodes e g bdd doped sno2 pbo2 and ti4o7 direct electron transfer at low anodic potential and oh radicals attack at potential higher than 2 0 v vs she although we did not directly measure the formation and activity of oh the high anodic potential and toc removal efficiency 75 7 suggested that the formation of oh radicals is the main mechanism of the tc electrochemical oxidation over the ti ti4o7 anode during the tc electrochemical oxidation process nh4 no3 and no2 were also measured to evaluate the level of complete mineralization fig 2b showed increasing concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 throughout the tc electrochemical degradation process and the increase of nh4 was much faster than that of no3 and no2 our results suggest that nh2 in tc produces nh4 by deamination which might possibly be further chemically denitrified into no3 and no2 the evolution of nh4 no3 and no2 concentrations has not been previously reported in the tc electrochemical oxidation our ti ti4o7 anode also had a satisfactory durability after reuse the tc degradation efficiency was 96 0 95 8 95 8 95 3 and 95 1 after reusing the ti ti4o7 anode 1 2 3 4 and 5 times respectively fig s4a under the same reaction conditions as the fresh ti ti4o7 anode there was limited morphological change on the surface of the ti ti4o7 anode after 5 times reuse as seen from sem and it was still compact with no cracks fig s1c eds data also suggested a similar ti o atomic ratio between the fresh and the reused ti ti4o7 anodes fig s2 and table s2 3 3 factors influencing tc electrochemical oxidation to study the key influential variables affecting the performance of the tc electrochemical oxidation three key operational parameters were altered including current density distance between the ti ti4o7 and titanium cathode and initial tc concentration under all conditions tc degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 97 whereas variable degradation efficiencies were observed as illustrated in fig 3 from the linear regression of the pseudo first order semi log plots the kinetic parameters were calculated and listed in table 1 including the pseudo first order rate constant k a half life t 1 2 and correlation coefficient r 2 in general the tc degradation efficiency had positive linear correlations with the determined rate constant k a under all the experimental conditions r 2 0 879 0 999 fig s4b the tc degradation rate significantly increased with the current density fig 3a and table 1 the k a values increased from 2 9 0 1 10 2 to 8 3 0 2 10 2 min 1 when the applied current density increased from 5 to 25 ma cm2 our results indicated a faster degradation rate at a higher current density similar as the tc electrochemical oxidation with the ti ruo2 iro2 anode in which the k a values increased from 1 8 10 2 to 4 6 10 2 min 1 with the current density increasing from 15 9 to 63 5 ma cm2 zhang et al 2009 it is worth mentioning that the k a values exhibited little change when the current density was above 15 ma cm2 implying that higher current densities could not further accelerate electrochemical oxidation this result was consistent with the degradation of sulfamethoxazole on a ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 anode and ciprofloxacin on a ti sno2 sb anode lin et al 2013 wang et al 2016b possibly attributed to the limited mass transfer rate of organic compounds toward the anode at a higher current density lin et al 2013 the tc degradation efficiency had a negative correlation with the anode cathode distance fig 3b and table 1 the k a values decreased from 8 9 0 1 10 2 to 6 2 0 04 10 2 min 1 when the anode cathode distance increased from 5 to 25 mm and the t 1 2 values increased from 5 6 to 13 0 min accordingly similar results were observed in the electrochemical degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and sulfamethoxazole lin et al 2012 2013 the faster tc electrochemical oxidation at lower electrode distance might be explained by the more effective electrolysis with shorter diffusion distance between electrodes lin et al 2012 2013 however very small electrode distance suffers from manufacturing difficulties in preventing short circuit between the anode and cathode when the initial tc concentration ranged from 5 to 100 mg l the electrochemical degradation efficiency reached 81 6 0 9 to 95 8 0 6 in 40 min fig 3c and table 1 indicating a satisfactory performance of the ti ti4o7 anode for the tc electrochemical oxidation over a broad range of concentrations similar k a values at lower tc concentration 50 mg l suggested a diffusion controlled oxidation process table 1 which is typical for low concentrations of reactants or high current density oliferova et al 2005 panizza and cerisola 2009 when the initial tc concentration was above 50 mg l the k a values decreased and indicated a current controlled oxidation process some previous studies reported that anode oxidation was controlled by mass transfer under low substrate concentration or high current density panizza and cerisola 2009 the process shifted to a current controlled one under high substrate concentration or low current density li and goel 2010 the change of k a values with initial tc concentration was explained by the reaction equilibrium between tc and oh radicals generated from electrochemical oxidation a higher tc concentration results in more tc flux diffusing onto the anode surface where oh generated by low current density is not sufficient for effective oxidation thus the process is current controlled on the contrast diffusion controlled process occurs in case of low tc concentration and high current density 3 4 intermediates and pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation as complete tc mineralization is hardly obtained characterizing the intermediates formed during the tc electrochemical oxidation can provide insight into its degradation pathway and mechanism in the present study water samples were collected at different time points and the intermediates were identified and compared by means of their total ion chromatograms tic in total fifteen intermediates compounds ① to ⑮ q1 scan and product ion scan pis chromatograms in fig s5 were characterized by hplc ms triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and ten intermediates were identified by gc ms compounds 16 to 25 ms spectra in fig s6 as listed in tables s3 and s4 from the structure and concentration dynamics of these intermediates a possible tc degradation pathway through electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode is proposed in fig 4 tc has three types of functional groups with relatively high electron density which are easily attacked by oh radicals in electrochemical oxidation including double bond phenolic group and amine group among them double bond is the most reactive with radicals as the double bond at c11a c12 position has higher electron density than that at c2 c3 position it preferentially reacts with oh radicals and produces the primary intermediate with m z 461 the pis chromatogram in fig s5 1 shows that intermediate ① can be transformed into the product ion with m z 444 by losing nh3 and it is further fragmented to the product ion with m z 426 by losing h2o supporting the molecule with m z 461 as the primary intermediate intermediate ① was also reported in previous studies of the tc ozonation and photocatalysis khan et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 a different intermediate with m z 461 was found in the tc electrochemical oxidation by wu et al which might be produced by electrophilic addition of oh to the benzene ring and to form a resonance stabilized carbon centered radical wu et al 2012 nevertheless this intermediate was not observed in the present study and we speculate that the c11a c12 double bond of tc is more reactive than the benzene ring and might be preferentially attacked by radicals primary intermediate ① can be further oxidized into three potential secondary intermediates by radical attack at different positions namely c4 c2 c3 and c6a c7 when the n ch3 2 at position c4 is oxidized by oh a ketone group is produced at position c4 and consequently forms the intermediate with m z 432 fig s5 2 shows that intermediate ② is transformed into the product ion with m z 415 by losing nh3 and it is further fragmented to the product ion with m z 397 by losing h2o and its structure is thus assigned to the intermediate with m z 432 intermediate ① also produces n n dimethyl hydroxylamine intermediate 16 m z 61 as the by product of intermediate ② by the radical oxidation of the n ch3 2 group alternatively reaction with oh at the c2 c3 double bond of intermediate ① generates an intermediate with m z 477 the pis chromatogram of intermediate ③ fig s5 3 shows its transformation into the product ion with m z 460 by losing nh3 and fragmentation to the product ion with m z 442 by losing h2o supporting it as the intermediate with m z 477 an intermediate with m z 509 may be formed when the double bond at c6a c7 position of the primary intermediate ① is oxidized producing a ketone group and a carboxylic group and is assigned to intermediate ④ from the pis chromatogram fig s5 4 these intermediates have been previously reported upon the ozone degradation of tc khan et al 2010 but were found here for the first time in an electrochemical oxidation process intermediate ② m z 432 is further oxidized to produce a ketone group and a carboxylic group at position c6a and c7 respectively generating an intermediate with m z 480 intermediate ⑤ this intermediate could also be formed from intermediate ④ by radical oxidation of n ch3 2 at position c4 with n n dimethyl hydroxylamine as a by product intermediate 16 the intermediate with m z 448 intermediate ⑥ may be formed from either intermediate ② via oxidation at position c2 and c3 producing a hydroxyl and a ketone group or intermediate ③ via oxidation of n ch3 2 at position c4 producing a ketone group similarly the intermediate with m z 525 intermediate ⑦ may be formed when intermediate ③ is oxidized to produce a ketone group and a carboxylic group at position c6a and c7 respectively intermediate ⑦ can be also produced from radical attack to the c2 c3 double bond of intermediate ④ m z 509 producing a hydroxyl and a ketone group at position c2 and c3 finally the key downstream intermediate with m z 496 intermediate ⑧ may be formed upon oxidation of either c2 c3 double bond of intermediate ⑤ c6a c7 double bond of intermediate ⑥ or n ch3 2 at position c4 of intermediate ⑦ our pis data and fragmentation patterns of the intermediates with m z 480 448 525 and 496 fig s5 support our proposed structures of the four intermediates which are consistent with those in a previous study on the tc ozonation khan et al 2010 only intermediate ③ m z 477 has been previously reported in the tc photocatalysis pathway zhu et al 2013 and none of them have been reported in the tc electrochemical oxidation two functional groups of the key downstream intermediate ⑧ the double bond at position c10 10a and the amide group at position c2 are easily attacked by oh radicals when radicals react with the c10 10a double bond intermediate ⑨ m z 412 and but 2 enedioic acid intermediate 17 m z 116 are the downstream intermediates but 2 enedioic acid can be further oxidized to oxalic acid intermediate 18 m z 90 intermediate ⑨ m z 412 might be either attacked by oh at position c6 to produce the intermediate with m z 396 intermediate ⑪ and methanol intermediate 20 m z 32 or oxidized to produce a ketone group at position c2 as the intermediate with m z 367 intermediate ⑫ and carbamic acid intermediate 19 m z 61 methanol can be further oxidized to formic acid intermediate 21 m z 46 alternatively attacked by oh at position c2 intermediate ⑧ is transformed into an intermediate with m z 451 intermediate ⑩ and carbamic acid intermediate 19 intermediate ⑩ can also produce intermediate ⑫ and but 2 enedioic acid intermediate 17 by oh attack at position c10 10a all these downstream intermediates are reported for the first time in the tc oxidation process intermediate ⑪ can be attacked by oh at position c5a and c11a to produce an intermediate with m z 298 intermediate ⑬ and 2 3 dioxo succinic acid intermediate 22 m z 146 or an intermediate with m z 351 intermediate ⑭ and carbamic acid intermediate 19 intermediate ⑭ might be also degraded starting from intermediate ⑫ with methanol intermediate 20 as by product and further oxidized via oh attack at position c5a and c11a to an intermediate with m z 253 intermediate ⑮ which can be also produced from the radical attack at c2 position of intermediate ⑬ attacked by oh at position c1 c2 and c3 c4 intermediate ⑮ may form 1 hydroxy 4 5 6 trioxo cyclohexane 1 2 dicarboxylic acid intermediate 23 m z 230 and oxalic acid the former may be oxidized at position c5 c5a and c11a c12 producing 2 dicarboxylic 4 5 6 trixo cyclohexane 1 2 dicarboxylic acid intermediate 24 m z 222 and again oxalic acid intermediate 24 is further oxidized to 2 oxo malonic acid intermediate 25 m z 118 the evidence supporting the structures of these intermediates is illustrated in pis data and fragmentation patterns fig s5 and fig s6 and they have not been reported in the previous tc oxidation studies the dynamics of tc and all the fifteen intermediates detected by hplc ms intermediates ① to ⑮ are shown in fig 5 primary intermediate ① peaked at 10 min and gradually decreased below the limit of detection after 30 min indicating its production at the initial stage of the tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode and further oxidation into other intermediates secondary intermediates ② ③ and ④ also peaked at 10 min and declined below the limit of detection after 40 min these results suggest that these compounds are produced from primary intermediate ① and then gradually oxidized to tertiary intermediates ⑤ ⑥ and ⑦ and the key downstream intermediate ⑧ which all peaked at 30 min and slightly decreased at 40 min other downstream intermediates m z 412 451 396 367 351 298 and 253 fig 5c also increased in the first 30 min and gradually declined in 40 min these intermediates might be further oxidized by radicals into short chain carboxylic acids followed by complete mineralization into co2 h2o and inorganic ions such as nitrate or ammonium our proposed tc electrochemical oxidation pathway in fig 4 is different from that in wu s work wu et al 2012 a possible reason might be the different anode used for the tc electrochemical oxidation different reactive species might be generated from the anodes made with different materials and result in different pathways for example different intermediates and degradation pathways of ciprofloxacin have been found in electrochemical oxidation processes between the sno2 sb ti anode and the sb2o5 doped ti ruo2 zro2 ti sbruzr anode palma goyesa et al 2016 wang et al 2016b compared to the pathway proposed by wu et al our work provided a higher resolution in the intermediate analysis to unveil a more reliable tc electrochemical oxidation pathway more intermediates were detected by hplc ms in the present study and additionally ten intermediates with low molecular weight were characterized by gc ms and speculated to be the downstream intermediates in addition the formation and degradation kinetics of tc and its intermediates were analyzed to support the proposed degradation pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation our results suggest very complex reactions during eaops on the ti ti4o7 anode and the mechanisms and pathway for the tc electrochemical oxidation vary across anode materials and require more investigation 3 5 estimation of intermediate toxicity during tc electrochemical oxidation our proposed tc electrochemical oxidation pathway indicated that tc is firstly oxidized into three two and one ring intermediates and eventually carboxylic acids co2 and h2o due to the different toxicities of these intermediates the toxicity evolution during the tc electrochemical oxidation might not follow a declining trend wu et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 nevertheless it is difficult to directly evaluate the toxicity of individual intermediates with new functional groups alternatively we employed luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri to assess the toxicity change during the tc electrochemical oxidation process in addition the results of microtox test were validated by predicting the intermediate toxicities via qsar although the results of microtox test and qasr might be different as ecosar predicts toxicity for higher organisms the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs suggests that fish daphnid and algae can be considered as surrogates for all aquatic organisms and the data on other species are comparable when tested appropriately united nations 2011 as illustrated in fig 6 the bioluminescence inhibition ratio exhibited little change from 54 53 to 55 41 during the first 10 min of the tc electrochemical oxidation and gradually decreased to 16 78 after 40 min the delay of toxicity reduction is consistent with other electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and ozonation processes khan et al 2010 wu et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 indicating the production of some intermediates with high toxicity during the tc advanced oxidation in some cases a significantly increasing toxicity was even reported upon the ozonation of bezafibrate and ofloxacin sui et al 2017 tay and madehi 2015 although wu et al 2012 suggested that some intermediates with quinone form explain the delay of toxicity decrease in the tc electrochemical oxidation they were not detected in either the present study or other tc photocatalytic oxidation zhu et al 2013 and ozonation khan et al 2010 studies zhu et al 2013 explained the delay of toxicity decrease by a lower steric resistance and an easier penetration into the luminescent bacterial cell of the major tc intermediates and khan et al 2010 suggested that the intermediates retaining the three ring structure have similar toxicity as tc however the toxicities of the intermediates during the tc electrochemical oxidation have not been previously investigated by qsar and the relationship between the intermediates and toxicity remains unclear table 2 shows the predicted ecotoxicity values of tc and its intermediates via qsar using the ecosar program all the intermediates are classified into four groups according to ghs as very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l toxic 1 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l harmful 10 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l and not harmful lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l of them primary intermediate ① m z 461 and secondary intermediates ② m z 432 and ③ m z 477 are classified as toxic compounds to aquatic organisms the acute toxicities of intermediates ① ② and ③ to algae and fish are on the same order of magnitude as tc and they also have similar chronic toxicity to daphnid and algae compared to tc intermediate ② has a significantly lower acute toxicity to daphnid and intermediate ③ has a remarkably higher chronic toxicity to fish than tc the concentrations of these intermediates increased during the first 10 min of tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode fig 5 and gradually declined within 30 40 min potentially explaining the delay of toxicity decrease fig 6 additionally the intermediates with m z 509 480 448 525 496 451 and 61 intermediate 16 are harmful to aquatic organisms and they might also contribute to the slow decrease of toxicity during the tc electrochemical oxidation since these intermediates produced from the tc electrochemical oxidation are reported in the present study for the first time their toxicities have not been previously investigated and our work provides deeper insights into the toxicity change during tc electrochemical oxidation we also evaluated the toxicities of the five intermediates in wu et al 2012 table s6 in supporting information although different intermediates were identified in the tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ruo2 iro2 anode compared to the present study they showed similar toxicities as our intermediates ① ② and ③ indicating that the primary intermediates of tc have significant ecotoxicities in different electrochemical oxidation processes and more concerns should be raised it is worth mentioning that eaops produce very complicated reaction pathways and further work is needed for a more comprehensive study into the mechanisms of intermediates production and toxicity alteration along with the tc electrochemical oxidation 4 conclusions in the present study we investigated the tc electrochemical oxidation on a ti ti4o7 anode the ti ti4o7 anode had a compact coating layer with active constituent ti4o7 following a pseudo first order kinetics the tc electrochemical oxidation was favored by the high current density low electrode distance and low initial tc concentration and the highest tc removal efficiency reached 95 8 additionally the ti ti4o7 anode was robust and maintained high degradation efficiencies after 5 times reuse for the first time a complete pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation was proposed based on 25 identified intermediates categorized as primary intermediate ① m z 461 secondary intermediates ② ③ and ④ m z 432 477 and 509 tertiary intermediates ⑤ ⑥ and ⑦ m z 480 448 and 525 key downstream intermediate ⑧ m z 496 downstream intermediates ⑨ to ⑮ m z 412 451 396 367 298 351 and 253 and short chain carboxylic acids oxalic acid formic acid carbamic acid and 2 oxo malonic acid these intermediates possessed different toxicities according to qsar estimates and intermediates ① ② and ③ showed the highest toxicity the production of these toxic intermediates delayed the toxicity decrease during the tc electrochemical oxidation fitting well with the results of toxicity tests this study tested the performance of the tc electrochemical oxidation by a ti ti4o7 anode and proposed a complete degradation pathway facilitating further understanding of toxicity reduction in the tc electrochemical oxidation process and

the anode which had the characteristic peaks of ti4o7 as active constituent the tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode followed a pseudo first order kinetics and the tc removal efficiency reached 95 8 in 40 min the influential factors on tc decay kinetics included current density anode cathode distance and initial tc concentration this anode also had high durability and the tc removal efficiency was maintained over 95 after five times reuse for the first time we unraveled the complete pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation using high performance liquid chromatograph hplc and gas chromatograph gc coupled with mass spectrometer ms oh radicals produced from electrochemical oxidation attack the double bond phenolic group and amine group of tc forming a primary intermediate m z 461 secondary intermediates m z 432 477 and 509 and tertiary intermediates m z 480 448 and 525 the latter were further oxidized to the key downstream intermediate m z 496 followed by further downstream intermediates m z 451 412 396 367 351 298 and 253 and eventually short chain carboxylic acids we also evaluated the toxicity change during the electrochemical oxidation process with bioluminescent bacteria the bioluminescence inhibition ratio peaked at 10 min 55 41 likely owing to the high toxicity of intermediates with m z 461 432 and 477 as obtained from quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis the bioluminescence inhibition ratio eventually decreased to 16 78 in 40 min due to further transformation of tc and intermediates by comprehensively analyzing the influential factors and complete degradation pathway of tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode our research provides deeper insights into the risk assessment of intermediates and their toxicity assigning new perspectives for practical electrochemical oxidation to effectively eliminate the amount and toxicity of tc and other antibiotics in wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords tetracycline ti ti4o7 anode electrochemical oxidation degradation pathway toxicity assessment 1 introduction antibiotics in water have received increasing attention because of their biological impact and potential risks to the environment and human health christou et al 2017 jin et al 2017 wang et al 2016a among various antibiotics tetracycline tc is extensively used for treating human diseases and rearing livestocks due to its great therapeutic values brinzila et al 2012 vedenyapina et al 2008 wu et al 2012 nevertheless the majority of tc is discharged into the environment owing to its poor decomposition in animals and human bodies liu et al 2013 therefore environmental media have become the main sink of tc wastewater is an important source of tc to the environment in which tc concentration reaches up to 2 2 mg l and the situation is increasingly deteriorating yang et al 2014 additionally studies also report high levels of tc detected in groundwater and surface water 0 1 4 5 μg l showing threats to the aquatic environment pena et al 2010 tc can intensify the threats of pharmaceutical resistance among microbial populations and generate even more toxic degradation by products khan et al 2010 wu et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 hence eliminating tc is urgently needed various techniques have been widely investigated for tc removal from wastewater including biological processes benavides et al 2017 coagulation saitoh et al 2017 sedimentation saitoh et al 2014 adsorption yu et al 2017 ozonation khan et al 2010 photocatalysis wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 and photoelectrocatalysis daghrir et al 2013 conventional methods e g biological processes coagulation sedimentation and adsorption cannot achieve high tc removal efficiency and rate because they are not specifically designed for tc degradation benavides et al 2017 saitoh et al 2014 2017 yu et al 2017 ozonation is effective to remove tc owing to its high oxidation performance but the removal efficiency of total organic carbon toc is not satisfactory because ozonation can typically degrade organic compounds into short chain carboxylic acids but not completely into co2 and h2o dalmazio et al 2007 khan et al 2010 high tc and toc removal efficiencies can be achieved by photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis for their high catalytic oxidation activities but the relatively high cost might limit their large scale application daghrir et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 therefore it is still necessary to develop more efficient processes to eliminate tc from the effluents of wastewater treatment plants in recent years electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been shown to be a promising technology for removing tc because of their strong oxidation performance mild conditions and environmental compatibility brinzila et al 2012 rossi et al 2008 yang et al 2016 the performance of eaops is greatly dependent on the activity and stability of the anode cho and hoffmann 2015 yang and hoffmann 2016 several anodes are reported to have satisfactory performance in electrochemically oxidizing tc e g ti ruo2 ti ruo2 iro2 and boron doped diamond bdd brinzila et al 2012 rossi et al 2008 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 the ti ruo2 and ti ruo2 iro2 anodes can achieve high tc removal efficiency 90 but fail in removing cod and toc effectively 30 rossi et al 2008 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 the bdd anode is a better electrochemical anode because it nearly completely mineralizes tc and its intermediates achieving high removal efficiencies of tc 95 cod 93 and toc 87 brinzila et al 2012 however the bdd anode has a relatively high price 15 000 22 000 m2 and this limits its industrial applications radjenovic and sedlak 2015 recently substoichiometric titanium dioxide ti4o7 has been proposed as an alternative anode material with the features of having high oxygen evolution potential oep good electrical conductivity satisfactory chemical stability and easy preparation guo et al 2016 santos et al 2016 you et al 2016 zaky and chaplin 2014 the mechanisms of oxidizing organic compounds over the ti4o7 anode are mainly ascribed to the high reactivity of physisorbed hydroxyl radicals a oh which form when water is oxidized at the surface of the non active anode bejan et al 2012 zaky and chaplin 2013 additionally the involvement of oh radicals in the electrochemical oxidation process over the ebonex anode a sub oxide of tio2 with the optimal electrical conductivity at the composition of ti4o7 has been reported in a previous study by spin trapping bejan et al 2012 the formation and activity of oh radicals on the ti4o7 anode is also proved by guo and nayak with coumarin and terephthalic acid probes guo et al 2016 nayak and chaplin 2018 with similar oep compared to the bdd anode chen 2004 the ti4o7 anode shows great potential in removing tc with high efficiencies through electrochemical oxidation nevertheless only a few studies have applied the ti4o7 anode in wastewater treatment a porous magneli phase ti4o7 anode was used for industrial wastewater electrochemical oxidation achieving high cod 66 and dissolved organic carbon 47 removal efficiencies you et al 2016 the use of the porous ti4o7 anode as a reactive electrochemical membrane had a satisfactory removal efficiency for phenolic compounds nearly 100 in wastewater zaky and chaplin 2014 nevertheless there is no study addressing the performance and influential factors of the ti4o7 anode in the tc electrochemical oxidation meanwhile the incomplete mineralization upon tc electrochemical oxidation has recently raised new concerns due to the toxicity of residual intermediates in effluents thus the tc degradation pathway draws more attention for evaluating the toxicity of intermediates which is an issue in many oxidation processes of other organic pollutants for instance the degradation intermediates of bezafibrate and ofloxacin in the ozonation process are more toxic than their parent compounds resulting in an increased toxicity of effluents sui et al 2017 tay and madehi 2015 some previous studies have reported the degradation pathways of tc in ozonation and photocatalysis which significantly alter the effluent toxicity khan et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 only one literature study has reported an incomplete tc degradation pathway and the toxicity change during the electrochemical oxidation process over a ti ruo2 iro2 anode wu et al 2012 proposing only five intermediates and finding that the delay of toxicity reduction is attributed to some quinone intermediates nevertheless the complete tc electrochemical oxidation pathway is not unraveled and the mechanism of intermediate toxicity change remains unclear deeper investigation into the degradation pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation can provide more comprehensive understandings of the intermediates responsible for most of the toxicity and benefit the implementation of electrochemical oxidation treatment methods for wastewater containing tc in this study a satisfactory performance of the tc electrochemical oxidation was achieved by a ti ti4o7 anode prepared by plasma spraying besides evaluating the tc degradation kinetics and influential factors applied current density anode cathode distance and initial tc concentration our work for the first time identified the complete tc electrochemical oxidation pathway by analysing the degradation intermediates moreover the toxicities of these intermediates were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis to facilitate the understanding of the measured toxicity change during the tc electrochemical oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparing the ti ti4o7 anode the

200 ml min at 900 c for 3 h ti4o7 powders were then sprayed onto the surface of the cleaned titanium plate using a plasma spray system praxair tafa 5500 2000 america and the plasma spraying parameters are shown in table s1 2 2 electrochemical oxidation of tc by the ti ti4o7 anode electrochemical oxidation experiments were conducted in a reactor length 50 mm height 75 mm made of quartz glass a titanium plate 50 mm 75 mm 1 mm was used as the cathode tetracycline hydrochloride c22h25n2o8cl ar grade 99 was purchased from sigma aldrich uk na2so4 aqueous solution 30 mmol l was used as the electrolyte solution without specific statement the reaction was carried out with the current density of 15 ma cm2 anode cathode distance of 10 mm initial tc concentration of 5 mg l and reaction time of 40 min the experiments were carried out in batch mode and 20 ml of water sample aliquots were taken from the reactor at 0 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 min to analyze the concentrations of tc toc and intermediates produced from the electrochemical oxidation all the experiments were carried out in triplicates at 25 1 c to examine the effects of influential parameters on the tc electrochemical oxidation the experimental conditions were adjusted as follows current density 5 10 15 20 and 25 ma cm2 anode cathode distance 5 10 15 20 and 25 mm initial tc concentration 5 10 20 50 70 and 100 mg l all the experiments followed the same procedure mentioned above in triplicates 2 3 analytical methods x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the titanium plate and ti ti4o7 anode were analyzed by a diffractometer rigaku ultima iv japan using the full scan mode with an accelerating voltage of 40 kv surface morphology and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds of the titanium plate and ti ti4o7 anode were analyzed using a sne 4500m scanning electron microscopy sem sec korea with the voltage of 30 kv and resolution of 128 8 ev the linear scan voltammogram lsv was taken using an electrochemical workstation chenhua chi660d shanghai in 0 5 mol l h2so4 solution with the voltage ranging from 0 to 4 v a scan rate of 50 mv s and a sensitivity of 0 1 a v a platinum wire was used as the auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode a ti ti4o7 anode 10 mm 10 mm was used as the working electrode anodic potentials were measured versus a saturated

intermediates were detected by hplc interfaced with a tandem mass spectrometer shimadzu lcms 8040 japan with an inertsustain c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm after the aqueous phase was extracted and solvent exchanged to dichloromethane for details see supporting information it was concentrated to 1 0 ml and analyzed with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 6890gc 5973msd agilent usa equipped with a rxi 5ms column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the detailed parameters of hplc ms and gc ms are described in supporting information inorganic ions including nh4 no3 and no2 formed during electrolysis were detected and quantified with an ion chromatograph ics 1000 dionex usa the working conditions are described in supporting information toc was determined by a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l cph japan the mineralization current efficiency mce for each treatment at a given time t h was calculated following the analytical procedure reported by hamza hamza et al 2009 details in supporting information effluent toxicity was analyzed in a toxicity analyzer hach lumistox 300 america using bioluminescent vibrio fischeri bacteria according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater rice et al 2012 the bacterial bioluminescent signals were measured after 15 min incubation at 20 1 c 2 4 data analysis kinetics of the tc electrochemical oxidation were calculated based on a pseudo first order kinetic model as described in equation 1 1 d c d t k a c 0 where c mg l is the tc concentration at time t min and c 0 mg l is the initial tc concentration k a min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant in semi log plot ln c ln c 0 k a t the kinetic parameters k a half life t 1 2 correlation coefficient r 2 were calculated from the fitting of the experimental data with the linear regression the bioluminescence inhibition ratio was calculated as described in equation 2 l blank and l sample represent the bioluminescent signals after 15 min incubation in the treatment of deionized water and tested samples respectively a higher bioluminescence inhibition ratio indicates higher toxicity of the tested sample al anizi et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 2 bioluminescence inhibition ratio l b l a n k l s a m p l e l b l a n k 100 qsar was used to assess the ecotoxicological potentials of tc and its intermediates with the aid of the ecosar program coupled with epiwin software sui et al 2017 qsar uses the structural information of targeted compounds and provides lc50 values for fish 96 h and daphnid 48 h ec50 values for green algae 96 or 144 h and the values of chronic toxicity all the results were expressed in means standard error the spss package version 11 0 was used for statistical analysis and a p value 0 05 was considered for statistical significance all the graphs were plotted using origin 8 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the ti ti4o7 anode the composition of the titanium plate before and after spraying was examined by xrd as shown in fig 1 the diffraction peaks of the titanium plate are mainly located at 2θ 35 1 38 4 40 2 53 0 62 9 70 7 74 2 76 2 77 4 82 3 and 86 8 matching well with the standard characteristic peaks of titanium jcpds card no 44 1294 after spraying the diffraction peaks are located at 2θ 20 8 26 4 35 4 38 3 40 5 53 0 53 20 63 0 70 6 75 6 and 82 0 fig 1 fitting well with the standard characteristic peaks of ti4o7 jcpds card no 50 0787 no clear diffraction peaks of titanium were observed after spraying and the results indicate the successful ti4o7 coating of the titanium plate the ti4o7 anode prepared by high temperature reduction of tio2 plate has different phases of titanium suboxides zhang et al 2014 among which ti4o7 exhibits the best conductivity guo et al 2016 zaky and chaplin 2014 therefore our ti ti4o7 anode obtained by plasma spraying may have better electrical conductivity and contribute to higher performance in the tc electrochemical oxidation the sem images of the titanium plate before and after spraying illustrate significant morphological changes as shown in fig s1 the surface of the original titanium plate is rough and homogenous fig s1a whereas the anode surface after spraying is a compact and homogenous coating layer fig s1b the strong adhesion of the compact layer might strengthen the stability of the anode yang and hoffmann 2016 the eds data fig s2 and table s2 show that titanium is the predominant element on the original titanium plate surface 98 79 atom before spraying whereas its atomic percentage decreases to 27 27 after spraying and the oxygen atomic percentage increases from 1 21 to 63 64 the ratio of titanium to oxygen atoms on the surface of the sprayed titanium plate is 27 27 63 64 close to 4 7 ti o ratio in ti4o7 further confirming the formation of a ti4o7 coating layer on the titanium plate as the ti ti4o7 anode lsv results in fig s3 illustrated a similar oep of the prepared ti ti4o7 anode 2 6 v vs sce as that of the ti ti4o7 anode developed by spark plasma sintering 2 5 v vs sce zhang et al 2014 the oep of our ti ti4o7 anode was close to that of the bdd anode 2 3 2 7 v vs sce and higher than those of the sno2 anode 1 9 v vs sce iro2 anode 1 6 v vs sce pbo2 anode 1 9 v vs sce and pt anode 1 3 1 6 v vs sce chen 2004 higher oep values represent lower side reactions of oxygen formation and higher current efficiencies li et al 2016 which can promote the electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants additionally the price of our ti ti4o7 anode is about 6100 m2 for details see table s5 in supporting information which is about 60 70 lower than that of the bdd anode 15 000 22 000 m2 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 furthermore large scale industrial manufacturing can further reduce the price of the ti ti4o7 anode suggesting that it is a cheap anode material for electrochemical oxidation and has a huge potential in industrial practices for wastewater treatment 3 2 kinetics of the tc electrochemical oxidation the ti ti4o7 anode achieved 95 8 tc degradation efficiency under standard conditions 40 min reaction time 15 ma cm2 current density 10 mm anode cathode distance and 5 mg l initial tc concentration table 1 the removal efficiency of toc was 75 7 and the mce was 9 9 fig 2 a there was little change in tc degradation efficiency toc removal and mce by prolonging the reaction time to 60 min compared to the ti ruo2 iro2 anode 95 0 63 5 ma cm2 current density and 60 min reaction time zhang et al 2009 our ti ti4o7 anode had a similar tc electrochemical degradation efficiency but higher toc removal efficiency compared to the cod removal efficiency reported by zhang et al 33 the removal efficiencies of tc toc and cod by the bdd anode at 300 a m2 after 240 min reaction were 99 87 and 93 respectively brinzila et al 2012 therefore our ti ti4o7 anode had comparable efficiencies in mineralizing tc and its intermediates as the bdd anode and significantly higher than the ti ruo2 iro2 anode the anodic potential of our ti ti4o7 anode was above 2 5 v vs she similar to those of the ti4o7 reactive electrochemical membrane 1 9 3 2 v vs she and ebonex 2 14 2 64 v vs she anodes which have been reported to form hydroxyl radicals oh at potential above 2 2 v vs she zaky and chaplin 2013 guo et al 2016 nayak and chaplin 2018 also proved the formation of oh radicals on the ti4o7 anode guo et al 2016 suggested that significant concentrations of oh radicals formed at potentials higher than 2 8 v vs she but the formation of oh radicals was observed at potentials above 2 2 v vs she zaky and chaplin 2014 reported two pathways for the electrochemical oxidation of phenolic compounds on eaop anodes e g bdd doped sno2 pbo2 and ti4o7 direct electron transfer at low anodic potential and oh radicals attack at potential higher than 2 0 v vs she although we did not directly measure the formation and activity of oh the high anodic potential and toc removal efficiency 75 7 suggested that the formation of oh radicals is the main mechanism of the tc electrochemical oxidation over the ti ti4o7 anode during the tc electrochemical oxidation process nh4 no3 and no2 were also measured to evaluate the level of complete mineralization fig 2b showed increasing concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 throughout the tc electrochemical degradation process and the increase of nh4 was much faster than that of no3 and no2 our results suggest that nh2 in tc produces nh4 by deamination which might possibly be further chemically denitrified into no3 and no2 the evolution of nh4 no3 and no2 concentrations has not been previously reported in the tc electrochemical oxidation our ti ti4o7 anode also had a satisfactory durability after reuse the tc degradation efficiency was 96 0 95 8 95 8 95 3 and 95 1 after reusing the ti ti4o7 anode 1 2 3 4 and 5 times respectively fig s4a under the same reaction conditions as the fresh ti ti4o7 anode there was limited morphological change on the surface of the ti ti4o7 anode after 5 times reuse as seen from sem and it was still compact with no cracks fig s1c eds data also suggested a similar ti o atomic ratio between the fresh and the reused ti ti4o7 anodes fig s2 and table s2 3 3 factors influencing tc electrochemical oxidation to study the key influential variables affecting the performance of the tc electrochemical oxidation three key operational parameters were altered including current density distance between the ti ti4o7 and titanium cathode and initial tc concentration under all conditions tc degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 97 whereas variable degradation efficiencies were observed as illustrated in fig 3 from the linear regression of the pseudo first order semi log plots the kinetic parameters were calculated and listed in table 1 including the pseudo first order rate constant k a half life t 1 2 and correlation coefficient r 2 in general the tc degradation efficiency had positive linear correlations with the determined rate constant k a under all the experimental conditions r 2 0 879 0 999 fig s4b the tc degradation rate significantly increased with the current density fig 3a and table 1 the k a values increased from 2 9 0 1 10 2 to 8 3 0 2 10 2 min 1 when the applied current density increased from 5 to 25 ma cm2 our results indicated a faster degradation rate at a higher current density similar as the tc electrochemical oxidation with the ti ruo2 iro2 anode in which the k a values increased from 1 8 10 2 to 4 6 10 2 min 1 with the current density increasing from 15 9 to 63 5 ma cm2 zhang et al 2009 it is worth mentioning that the k a values exhibited little change when the current density was above 15 ma cm2 implying that higher current densities could not further accelerate electrochemical oxidation this result was consistent with the degradation of sulfamethoxazole on a ti sno2 sb ce pbo2 anode and ciprofloxacin on a ti sno2 sb anode lin et al 2013 wang et al 2016b possibly attributed to the limited mass transfer rate of organic compounds toward the anode at a higher current density lin et al 2013 the tc degradation efficiency had a negative correlation with the anode cathode distance fig 3b and table 1 the k a values decreased from 8 9 0 1 10 2 to 6 2 0 04 10 2 min 1 when the anode cathode distance increased from 5 to 25 mm and the t 1 2 values increased from 5 6 to 13 0 min accordingly similar results were observed in the electrochemical degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and sulfamethoxazole lin et al 2012 2013 the faster tc electrochemical oxidation at lower electrode distance might be explained by the more effective electrolysis with shorter diffusion distance between electrodes lin et al 2012 2013 however very small electrode distance suffers from manufacturing difficulties in preventing short circuit between the anode and cathode when the initial tc concentration ranged from 5 to 100 mg l the electrochemical degradation efficiency reached 81 6 0 9 to 95 8 0 6 in 40 min fig 3c and table 1 indicating a satisfactory performance of the ti ti4o7 anode for the tc electrochemical oxidation over a broad range of concentrations similar k a values at lower tc concentration 50 mg l suggested a diffusion controlled oxidation process table 1 which is typical for low concentrations of reactants or high current density oliferova et al 2005 panizza and cerisola 2009 when the initial tc concentration was above 50 mg l the k a values decreased and indicated a current controlled oxidation process some previous studies reported that anode oxidation was controlled by mass transfer under low substrate concentration or high current density panizza and cerisola 2009 the process shifted to a current controlled one under high substrate concentration or low current density li and goel 2010 the change of k a values with initial tc concentration was explained by the reaction equilibrium between tc and oh radicals generated from electrochemical oxidation a higher tc concentration results in more tc flux diffusing onto the anode surface where oh generated by low current density is not sufficient for effective oxidation thus the process is current controlled on the contrast diffusion controlled process occurs in case of low tc concentration and high current density 3 4 intermediates and pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation as complete tc mineralization is hardly obtained characterizing the intermediates formed during the tc electrochemical oxidation can provide insight into its degradation pathway and mechanism in the present study water samples were collected at different time points and the intermediates were identified and compared by means of their total ion chromatograms tic in total fifteen intermediates compounds ① to ⑮ q1 scan and product ion scan pis chromatograms in fig s5 were characterized by hplc ms triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and ten intermediates were identified by gc ms compounds 16 to 25 ms spectra in fig s6 as listed in tables s3 and s4 from the structure and concentration dynamics of these intermediates a possible tc degradation pathway through electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode is proposed in fig 4 tc has three types of functional groups with relatively high electron density which are easily attacked by oh radicals in electrochemical oxidation including double bond phenolic group and amine group among them double bond is the most reactive with radicals as the double bond at c11a c12 position has higher electron density than that at c2 c3 position it preferentially reacts with oh radicals and produces the primary intermediate with m z 461 the pis chromatogram in fig s5 1 shows that intermediate ① can be transformed into the product ion with m z 444 by losing nh3 and it is further fragmented to the product ion with m z 426 by losing h2o supporting the molecule with m z 461 as the primary intermediate intermediate ① was also reported in previous studies of the tc ozonation and photocatalysis khan et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 a different intermediate with m z 461 was found in the tc electrochemical oxidation by wu et al which might be produced by electrophilic addition of oh to the benzene ring and to form a resonance stabilized carbon centered radical wu et al 2012 nevertheless this intermediate was not observed in the present study and we speculate that the c11a c12 double bond of tc is more reactive than the benzene ring and might be preferentially attacked by radicals primary intermediate ① can be further oxidized into three potential secondary intermediates by radical attack at different positions namely c4 c2 c3 and c6a c7 when the n ch3 2 at position c4 is oxidized by oh a ketone group is produced at position c4 and consequently forms the intermediate with m z 432 fig s5 2 shows that intermediate ② is transformed into the product ion with m z 415 by losing nh3 and it is further fragmented to the product ion with m z 397 by losing h2o and its structure is thus assigned to the intermediate with m z 432 intermediate ① also produces n n dimethyl hydroxylamine intermediate 16 m z 61 as the by product of intermediate ② by the radical oxidation of the n ch3 2 group alternatively reaction with oh at the c2 c3 double bond of intermediate ① generates an intermediate with m z 477 the pis chromatogram of intermediate ③ fig s5 3 shows its transformation into the product ion with m z 460 by losing nh3 and fragmentation to the product ion with m z 442 by losing h2o supporting it as the intermediate with m z 477 an intermediate with m z 509 may be formed when the double bond at c6a c7 position of the primary intermediate ① is oxidized producing a ketone group and a carboxylic group and is assigned to intermediate ④ from the pis chromatogram fig s5 4 these intermediates have been previously reported upon the ozone degradation of tc khan et al 2010 but were found here for the first time in an electrochemical oxidation process intermediate ② m z 432 is further oxidized to produce a ketone group and a carboxylic group at position c6a and c7 respectively generating an intermediate with m z 480 intermediate ⑤ this intermediate could also be formed from intermediate ④ by radical oxidation of n ch3 2 at position c4 with n n dimethyl hydroxylamine as a by product intermediate 16 the intermediate with m z 448 intermediate ⑥ may be formed from either intermediate ② via oxidation at position c2 and c3 producing a hydroxyl and a ketone group or intermediate ③ via oxidation of n ch3 2 at position c4 producing a ketone group similarly the intermediate with m z 525 intermediate ⑦ may be formed when intermediate ③ is oxidized to produce a ketone group and a carboxylic group at position c6a and c7 respectively intermediate ⑦ can be also produced from radical attack to the c2 c3 double bond of intermediate ④ m z 509 producing a hydroxyl and a ketone group at position c2 and c3 finally the key downstream intermediate with m z 496 intermediate ⑧ may be formed upon oxidation of either c2 c3 double bond of intermediate ⑤ c6a c7 double bond of intermediate ⑥ or n ch3 2 at position c4 of intermediate ⑦ our pis data and fragmentation patterns of the intermediates with m z 480 448 525 and 496 fig s5 support our proposed structures of the four intermediates which are consistent with those in a previous study on the tc ozonation khan et al 2010 only intermediate ③ m z 477 has been previously reported in the tc photocatalysis pathway zhu et al 2013 and none of them have been reported in the tc electrochemical oxidation two functional groups of the key downstream intermediate ⑧ the double bond at position c10 10a and the amide group at position c2 are easily attacked by oh radicals when radicals react with the c10 10a double bond intermediate ⑨ m z 412 and but 2 enedioic acid intermediate 17 m z 116 are the downstream intermediates but 2 enedioic acid can be further oxidized to oxalic acid intermediate 18 m z 90 intermediate ⑨ m z 412 might be either attacked by oh at position c6 to produce the intermediate with m z 396 intermediate ⑪ and methanol intermediate 20 m z 32 or oxidized to produce a ketone group at position c2 as the intermediate with m z 367 intermediate ⑫ and carbamic acid intermediate 19 m z 61 methanol can be further oxidized to formic acid intermediate 21 m z 46 alternatively attacked by oh at position c2 intermediate ⑧ is transformed into an intermediate with m z 451 intermediate ⑩ and carbamic acid intermediate 19 intermediate ⑩ can also produce intermediate ⑫ and but 2 enedioic acid intermediate 17 by oh attack at position c10 10a all these downstream intermediates are reported for the first time in the tc oxidation process intermediate ⑪ can be attacked by oh at position c5a and c11a to produce an intermediate with m z 298 intermediate ⑬ and 2 3 dioxo succinic acid intermediate 22 m z 146 or an intermediate with m z 351 intermediate ⑭ and carbamic acid intermediate 19 intermediate ⑭ might be also degraded starting from intermediate ⑫ with methanol intermediate 20 as by product and further oxidized via oh attack at position c5a and c11a to an intermediate with m z 253 intermediate ⑮ which can be also produced from the radical attack at c2 position of intermediate ⑬ attacked by oh at position c1 c2 and c3 c4 intermediate ⑮ may form 1 hydroxy 4 5 6 trioxo cyclohexane 1 2 dicarboxylic acid intermediate 23 m z 230 and oxalic acid the former may be oxidized at position c5 c5a and c11a c12 producing 2 dicarboxylic 4 5 6 trixo cyclohexane 1 2 dicarboxylic acid intermediate 24 m z 222 and again oxalic acid intermediate 24 is further oxidized to 2 oxo malonic acid intermediate 25 m z 118 the evidence supporting the structures of these intermediates is illustrated in pis data and fragmentation patterns fig s5 and fig s6 and they have not been reported in the previous tc oxidation studies the dynamics of tc and all the fifteen intermediates detected by hplc ms intermediates ① to ⑮ are shown in fig 5 primary intermediate ① peaked at 10 min and gradually decreased below the limit of detection after 30 min indicating its production at the initial stage of the tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode and further oxidation into other intermediates secondary intermediates ② ③ and ④ also peaked at 10 min and declined below the limit of detection after 40 min these results suggest that these compounds are produced from primary intermediate ① and then gradually oxidized to tertiary intermediates ⑤ ⑥ and ⑦ and the key downstream intermediate ⑧ which all peaked at 30 min and slightly decreased at 40 min other downstream intermediates m z 412 451 396 367 351 298 and 253 fig 5c also increased in the first 30 min and gradually declined in 40 min these intermediates might be further oxidized by radicals into short chain carboxylic acids followed by complete mineralization into co2 h2o and inorganic ions such as nitrate or ammonium our proposed tc electrochemical oxidation pathway in fig 4 is different from that in wu s work wu et al 2012 a possible reason might be the different anode used for the tc electrochemical oxidation different reactive species might be generated from the anodes made with different materials and result in different pathways for example different intermediates and degradation pathways of ciprofloxacin have been found in electrochemical oxidation processes between the sno2 sb ti anode and the sb2o5 doped ti ruo2 zro2 ti sbruzr anode palma goyesa et al 2016 wang et al 2016b compared to the pathway proposed by wu et al our work provided a higher resolution in the intermediate analysis to unveil a more reliable tc electrochemical oxidation pathway more intermediates were detected by hplc ms in the present study and additionally ten intermediates with low molecular weight were characterized by gc ms and speculated to be the downstream intermediates in addition the formation and degradation kinetics of tc and its intermediates were analyzed to support the proposed degradation pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation our results suggest very complex reactions during eaops on the ti ti4o7 anode and the mechanisms and pathway for the tc electrochemical oxidation vary across anode materials and require more investigation 3 5 estimation of intermediate toxicity during tc electrochemical oxidation our proposed tc electrochemical oxidation pathway indicated that tc is firstly oxidized into three two and one ring intermediates and eventually carboxylic acids co2 and h2o due to the different toxicities of these intermediates the toxicity evolution during the tc electrochemical oxidation might not follow a declining trend wu et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 nevertheless it is difficult to directly evaluate the toxicity of individual intermediates with new functional groups alternatively we employed luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri to assess the toxicity change during the tc electrochemical oxidation process in addition the results of microtox test were validated by predicting the intermediate toxicities via qsar although the results of microtox test and qasr might be different as ecosar predicts toxicity for higher organisms the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs suggests that fish daphnid and algae can be considered as surrogates for all aquatic organisms and the data on other species are comparable when tested appropriately united nations 2011 as illustrated in fig 6 the bioluminescence inhibition ratio exhibited little change from 54 53 to 55 41 during the first 10 min of the tc electrochemical oxidation and gradually decreased to 16 78 after 40 min the delay of toxicity reduction is consistent with other electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and ozonation processes khan et al 2010 wu et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 indicating the production of some intermediates with high toxicity during the tc advanced oxidation in some cases a significantly increasing toxicity was even reported upon the ozonation of bezafibrate and ofloxacin sui et al 2017 tay and madehi 2015 although wu et al 2012 suggested that some intermediates with quinone form explain the delay of toxicity decrease in the tc electrochemical oxidation they were not detected in either the present study or other tc photocatalytic oxidation zhu et al 2013 and ozonation khan et al 2010 studies zhu et al 2013 explained the delay of toxicity decrease by a lower steric resistance and an easier penetration into the luminescent bacterial cell of the major tc intermediates and khan et al 2010 suggested that the intermediates retaining the three ring structure have similar toxicity as tc however the toxicities of the intermediates during the tc electrochemical oxidation have not been previously investigated by qsar and the relationship between the intermediates and toxicity remains unclear table 2 shows the predicted ecotoxicity values of tc and its intermediates via qsar using the ecosar program all the intermediates are classified into four groups according to ghs as very toxic lc50 ec50 chv 1 mg l toxic 1 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l harmful 10 mg l lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l and not harmful lc50 ec50 chv 100 mg l of them primary intermediate ① m z 461 and secondary intermediates ② m z 432 and ③ m z 477 are classified as toxic compounds to aquatic organisms the acute toxicities of intermediates ① ② and ③ to algae and fish are on the same order of magnitude as tc and they also have similar chronic toxicity to daphnid and algae compared to tc intermediate ② has a significantly lower acute toxicity to daphnid and intermediate ③ has a remarkably higher chronic toxicity to fish than tc the concentrations of these intermediates increased during the first 10 min of tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ti4o7 anode fig 5 and gradually declined within 30 40 min potentially explaining the delay of toxicity decrease fig 6 additionally the intermediates with m z 509 480 448 525 496 451 and 61 intermediate 16 are harmful to aquatic organisms and they might also contribute to the slow decrease of toxicity during the tc electrochemical oxidation since these intermediates produced from the tc electrochemical oxidation are reported in the present study for the first time their toxicities have not been previously investigated and our work provides deeper insights into the toxicity change during tc electrochemical oxidation we also evaluated the toxicities of the five intermediates in wu et al 2012 table s6 in supporting information although different intermediates were identified in the tc electrochemical oxidation on the ti ruo2 iro2 anode compared to the present study they showed similar toxicities as our intermediates ① ② and ③ indicating that the primary intermediates of tc have significant ecotoxicities in different electrochemical oxidation processes and more concerns should be raised it is worth mentioning that eaops produce very complicated reaction pathways and further work is needed for a more comprehensive study into the mechanisms of intermediates production and toxicity alteration along with the tc electrochemical oxidation 4 conclusions in the present study we investigated the tc electrochemical oxidation on a ti ti4o7 anode the ti ti4o7 anode had a compact coating layer with active constituent ti4o7 following a pseudo first order kinetics the tc electrochemical oxidation was favored by the high current density low electrode distance and low initial tc concentration and the highest tc removal efficiency reached 95 8 additionally the ti ti4o7 anode was robust and maintained high degradation efficiencies after 5 times reuse for the first time a complete pathway of the tc electrochemical oxidation was proposed based on 25 identified intermediates categorized as primary intermediate ① m z 461 secondary intermediates ② ③ and ④ m z 432 477 and 509 tertiary intermediates ⑤ ⑥ and ⑦ m z 480 448 and 525 key downstream intermediate ⑧ m z 496 downstream intermediates ⑨ to ⑮ m z 412 451 396 367 298 351 and 253 and short chain carboxylic acids oxalic acid formic acid carbamic acid and 2 oxo malonic acid these intermediates possessed different toxicities according to qsar estimates and intermediates ① ② and ③ showed the highest toxicity the production of these toxic intermediates delayed the toxicity decrease during the tc electrochemical oxidation fitting well with the results of toxicity tests this study tested the performance of the tc electrochemical oxidation by a ti ti4o7 anode and proposed a complete degradation pathway facilitating further understanding of toxicity reduction in the tc electrochemical oxidation process and providing insights into the application potential of the electrochemical oxidation technique to efficiently eliminate antibiotics from wastewater acknowledgements this work was financially supported

composition of inorganic and organic n forms 2 distinguish the sources and biogeochemical mechanisms of nitrate n no3 n transport using stable isotopes of no3 and bayesian mixing model and 3 determine the dissolved organic n don bioavailability using bioassays in a longitudinal gradient from freshwater to estuarine ecosystem located in the tampa bay florida united states we found that don was the most dominant n form mean 64 range 46 83 followed by particulate organic n pon mean 22 range 14 37 whereas inorganic n forms nox n 7 nh4 n 7 were 14 of total n in freshwater and estuarine waters stable isotope data of no3 revealed that nitrification was the main contributor 36 4 followed by soil and organic n sources 25 5 no3 fertilizers 22 4 and nh4 fertilizers 15 7 bioassays showed that 14 to 65 of don concentrations decreased after 5 days of incubation indicating utilization of don by microbes in freshwater and estuarine waters these results suggest that despite low proportion of inorganic n forms the higher concentrations and bioavailability of don can be a potential source of n for algae and bacteria leading to water quality degradation in the estuarine waters graphical

leached waters from turfgrass stormwater runoff pond outflow waters and streams in urban watersheds lusk et al 2018 osborne et al 2013 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b to control n transport to water bodies we need a better understanding of the composition source identification and bioavailability of n nitrogen transported from the land exists in water bodies in many forms nh4 no2 no3 organic n which transform from one form to another due to the biogeochemical processes such as immobilization mineralization nitrification and denitrification seitzinger and harrison 2008 for example organic n is converted to nh4 by mineralization causse et al 2015 and nitrification converts nh4 to no3 corre et al 2017 when no3 is formed in terrestrial systems it might be leached from soil to water or

al 2016 and types of microbial communities park et al 2016 numerous studies have suggested that it is important to incorporate don into n loading budgets as don might be a potential source of n for microbes in water bodies korsaeth et al 2003 sun et al 2017 van kessel et al 2009 a better understanding of the composition sources and bioavailability of n would aid in devising solutions to reduce n transport from land to water bodies our specific objectives were to investigate the 1 composition of inorganic and organic n forms 2 determine the sources of no3 n and 3 assess the bioavailability of don in a longitudinal gradient from freshwater to estuarine ecosystem our hypotheses were as follows h1 organic n forms would be more dominant in estuarine than freshwater ecosystem h2 n loading from land to water bodies would be controlled by mixing of multiple sources and biotic processes i e nitrification and denitrification and h3 a part of don in estuarine ecosystem would be more bioavailable to microbes than don in freshwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area was braden river drainage area 133 km2 which flows into manatee river and then onto tampa bay estuary florida united states fig 1 thirteen sampling sites in a longitudinal gradient 4 10 km away from each site were selected along the freshwater braden river manatee river to estuarine tampa bay estuary

then both rivers flow into tampa bay estuary where the most downstream site e3 was located fig 1 salinity values were used to distinguish between freshwater and estuarine sites such that eight sites u1 to u3 m1 to m5 had mean salinity ranging from 0 27 to 0 53 and were classified as freshwater whereas four sites e1 to e3 mr had mean salinity ranging from 23 56 to 34 02 and were classified as

agricultural 13 natural 5 and wetland and water 10 the land use data for individual 13 sites is shown in fig 2 2 2 sample collection samples were collected at monthly intervals from december 2015 to may 2016 at 13 selected locations fig 1 along the braden river u1 to l1 manatee river mr e1 and e2 and tampa bay estuary e3 sites u1 and u2 were sampled only from march to may 2016 during each sampling event a composite grab sample was collected from the edge of the river bank sites u1 to m1 l1 to e3 and bridges sites m2 and m3 during each sample collection at each site five 1 l samples were collected and mixed in a bucket before taking a composite 1 l sample in an acid washed 10 hydrochloric acid hcl amber glass bottle which was kept on ice and transported to the lab for further processing and analyses three 1 l inoculum samples were collected from the most downstream site e3 in amber glass bottles for the bioassay study after collection the inoculum samples were filtered

contributions parnell et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 2017 in the bayesian mixing model measured δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values for each of the freshwater and estuarine samples from december 2015 to may 2016 n 72 were assigned as customer and the mean isotopic values of the no3 n sources from the literature were assigned as sources isotopic composition of no3 is not only useful for source identification but can be used to investigate the influence of nitrification and denitrification processes the δ18o no3 value from 10 to 10 has been suggested to be indicative of nitrification which can be calculated using this formula δ18o no3 1 3 δ18o o2 2 3 δ18o h2o kendall et al 2007 whereas the ratio of 2 1 between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 has been reported by researchers as an indication of denitrification aravena and robertson 1998 lehmann et al 2003 2 6 bioassay experiments subsamples of collected water samples from 13 sites during march may 2016 n 39 were mixed with inoculum collected from the most downstream site e3 in the estuary following methods described by osborne et al 2013 and lusk and toor 2016a 2016b in brief the bioassay experiment was conducted by mixing 320 ml of sample with 100 ml of inoculum in 1 l amber glass bottle the mixed samples were divided into two portions and designated as t0 initial samples and t5 incubated samples subsamples of t0 were immediately filtered using whatman 47 mm gf f 0 45 μm pore size filter and analyzed for tdn nh4 n and nox n whereas the unfiltered were analyzed for tn the samples designated as t5 were kept in glass bottle and incubated at 12 12 h dark light cycle in an air conditioned laboratory with temperature maintained at 22 2 c for 5 days then the samples were filtered and analyzed for tdn nh4 n and nox n whereas the unfiltered samples were analyzed for tn all analyses were completed within 24 h a flow chart describing various steps used in the bioassay study is included in the supplementary information si fig s1 2 7 statistical analysis the sas jmp pro 12 software was used for statistical analysis of the data differences in the mean for response variables i e tn don pon nh4 n nox n and

linear mixed model unstructured correlation was used to test the differences in the response values noted above using the following as fixed effects 1 freshwater and estuarine and 2 initial t0 and incubated t5 concentrations tukey s multiple comparison test honest significant difference hsd was used to confirm the significant group differences for both sets of models an alpha equal to 0 05 was used as a threshold for statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and discharge total rainfall during the study period december 2015 to may 2016 was 52 cm monthly mean 8 6 cm with the highest amount in may 27 cm and the lowest amount in april 0 4 cm discharge data were obtained from usgs database for two sites located along the braden river si fig s2 where total monthly discharge was generally low except for january and may with values ranging from 36 5 to 46 5 m3 s at u2 site and from 84 1 to 103 8 m3 s at m4 site 3 2 longitudinal distribution of nitrogen forms several states in the united states have developed numeric nutrient criteria for n to protect and restore the water bodies for example according to florida administrative code fac tn numeric value in our study region for freshwater is 1 65 mg l fac 2012a and for estuarine waters is 1 80 tons million m3 of water which translates to 1 8 mg l fac 2012b in 13 study sites mean tn concentrations were lower freshwater 1 12 mg l estuarine 0 72 mg l than the numeric criteria values for the region fig 3 a suggesting that these waters met the threshold numeric criteria values during the study period in this study tn was highest at the upstream site u2 1 12 mg l and lowest at the most downstream site e3 0 48 mg l elevated tn at u2 could be due to the contribution from upland agricultural sources figs 2 and 3a overall a decrease in the tn concentration from freshwater to estuarine ecosystem was observed fig 3a linear mixed model showed that tn was positively correlated with pon r 2 0 73 p 0 0001 this might be partially attributed to the effect of reservoir which functions as sink for suspended sediments and particulates nemery et al 2016 seitzinger et al 2010 as our data showed that pon slightly decreased from m1 to m5 fig 3b statistical analysis across all sampling sites showed that tn concentrations were inversely correlated with salinity r 2 0 47 p 0 0001 pennino et al 2016 suggested that more reduction in tn towards the estuary may be attributed to the dilution in estuarine area by the tidal marine waters and burial of n in the estuarine sediments our samples showed that concentrations of tn were significantly correlated with don r 2 0 76 p 0 0001 thus decrease in don concentrations in our study reflected a decrease in tn reduction of don might be attributed to transformation of don to nh4 by ammonification and further transformation into no2 and no3 through nitrification suggesting that a part of don may have been biologically transformed and or biologically utilized in the lower reaches of river and estuary xia et al 2013 this may also explain a slight increase in both nh4 and no3 in the estuarine sites mr to e3 fig 3b contribution of don to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication in water bodies has been recognized seitzinger and sanders 1999 seitzinger et al 2002 studies have shown that don is the most dominant n form in freshwater ecosystems osborne et al 2013 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b our results also showed that don was the most dominant form at all sampling sites mean 64 range 46 83 followed by pon 22 range 14 37 whereas inorganic n forms were 14 of tn nox n 7 nh4 n 7 at all sites fig 3b the high concentrations of don in the freshwater and estuarine ecosystem may be attributed to several factors such as 1 contribution of pon from plant materials leaves grass clippings that settle in the water bodies and then contributes don 2 the effects of low stream flow and velocity as this leads to greater contact between solute and streambed resulting in greater breakdown of leaf litter in the streams which then contributes don li and davis 2014 lusk and toor 2016a scott et al 2007 the dominance of don and pon in this subtropical ecosystem suggests that a better understanding of don sources including terrestrial runoff of plant detritus leaching from plant materials and microbial contributions is needed to reduce n losses from land to water bodies linear mixed model results showed that nh4 n was negatively correlated with don r 2 0 28 p 0 05 this may explain a slight reduction in nh4 n from u1 to m5 sites suggesting bio assimilation of nh4 n by microbes which was then released as don bronk et al 1994 kaushal et al 2014 pujo pay and conan 2003 statistical analysis also showed that no3 n concentrations were significantly different between sites u3 and m5 tukey s hsd p 0 05 suggesting potential denitrification of no3 to n2 wollheim et al 2008 in freshwater sites u1 to l1 no3 n was the main din form with mean concentrations of 0 02 0 23 mg l while in the estuarine sites e1 to e3 nh4 n was the dominant din form with mean concentrations of 0 06 0 13 mg l there are no significant differences in no3 n concentrations between freshwater and estuarine however nh4 n concentration in the estuarine sites was significantly higher than freshwater tukey s hsd p 0 05 in addition to ammonification of organic n increase in nh4 n in the estuarine sites might be attributed to humic shuttle mechanism as described by bronk et al 2007 that at upstream marshes with low salinity nh4 n is bonded to the anionic sites of humic substances and when these humic substances reach downstream estuarine area with high saline waters the salts i e ca2 mg2 replace nh4 on the anionic sites resulting in nh4 release and high concentrations in estuarine waters we plotted monthly tn data from december 2015 to may 2016 and observed that most monthly values did not significantly vary except for april 2016 sampling event si fig s3 3 3 water isotopes in freshwater and estuarine waters across all freshwater and estuarine sites δ18o h2o ranged from 2 70 to 1 87 mean 0 26 and δd h2o ranged from 9 20 to 14 03 mean 2 70 fig 4 linear mixed model showed that the mean salinity was positively correlated with mean δ18o h2o r 2 0 69 p 0 0001 and δd h2o r 2 0 74 p 0 0001 at all sampling sites suggesting that the isotopic values of both δ18o h2o and δd h2o increased as the water salinity increased from freshwater to estuarine sites lambs et al 2015 mean isotopic values of δ18o h2o for all 13 sites were higher in estuarine range 0 64 to 0 89 than freshwater range 0 36 to 1 96 similarly δd h2o values were also greater in estuarine range 7 42 to 9 17 than freshwater 6 87 to 1 76 si fig s4 statistically both δ18o h2o and δd h2o isotope values were significantly tukey s hsd p 0 05 greater in the estuarine than freshwater sites higher isotopic values in estuarine sites suggests greater evaporation bowen et al 2011 horibe and ogura 1968 which could be expected due to the absence of shade trees and slow moving water in estuarine sites due to the proximity to ocean and less elevation as compared to the upstream freshwater sites with high tree cover and fast moving water due to the elevation gradient and smaller channel further the changes in isotopic composition in our samples from freshwater to estuarine sites were also likely caused by mixing of freshwater with estuarine water global meteoric water line gmwl is an equation interpreted as δd h2o 8 δ18o h2o 10 which represents the relationship between h and o isotopes of water craig 1961 contribution of evaporated moisture can be determined by using the y intercept known as deuterium excess or d excess δd h2o 8 δ18o h2o of the equation coplen 1993 the linear mixed model fixed effect coefficient showed no significant difference in intercept and slope between the regression line of freshwater and estuarine p value 0 1282 the d excess values in our samples from freshwater δd h2o 4 48 δ18o h2o 3 36 and estuarine δd h2o 5 25 δ18o h2o 4 44 were lower than the d excess value from gmwl 10 fig 4 likely due to the evaporation or mixing with evaporated water mohammed et al 2016 yang and toor 2016 evaporation is expected to occur in our watershed due to the high temperature 21 26 c observed during the study period 3 4 origin of nitrate nitrogen in freshwater and estuarine waters in all samples δ15n no3 ranged from 4 32 to 29 18 mean 6 23 and δ18o no3 ranged from 4 03 to 19 76 mean 6 20 fig 5 based on these isotopic values it is clear that atmospheric deposition did not contribute no3 n in our freshwater and estuarine waters as the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for atmospheric deposition have been reported to be 15 to 15 and 23 to 80 respectively kendall et al 2007 the isotopic values in our samples were in the range observed for multiple sources such as nitrification inorganic fertilizer no3 and nh4 and soil and organic n figs 5 and si fig s5 however the ranges of isotope values for the sources overlap making it impossible to visually distinguish the contribution of specific sources thus a bayesian mixing model was used which showed that nitrification was the dominant contributor of no3 n across all sites 36 4 followed by soil and organic n sources 25 5 no3 fertilizer 22 4 and nh4 fertilizers 15 7 figs 6a and si fig s5 contribution of nitrification can be determined from δ18o no3 values where δ18o no3 from 10 to 10 indicates insitu soil nitrification theoretically for more precise values no3 n from nitrification can be calculated using the formula δ18o no3 1 3 δ18o o2 2 3 δ18o h2o kendall et al 2007 the expected values of δ18o no3 for nitrification in our samples obtained from the equation ranged from 6 04 to 9 08 plotted in fig 5 the mixing model data indicated that nitrification was the most dominant source of no3 n at all sampling sites except for u1 l1 and e3 fig 6 b table 2 the mean contribution of nitrification to no3 was 37 7 range 17 6 49 5 in the freshwater and 33 3 range 19 3 44 1 in estuarine waters the water isotope data section 3 3 showed that evaporation occurred in our samples due to the high temperature which may have resulted in greater nitrification for example strauss et al 2004 reported that high river temperature increase the nitrification rate in water bodies soil and organic n was the second most dominant no3 n source in our water samples suggesting mineralization of organic n to nh4 and further nitrification to no3 the mixing model suggested that soil and organic n contributed 13 4 to 39 0 mean 24 3 of no3 in the freshwater and 18 8 to 43 3 mean 28 3 of no3 in the estuarine waters in this watershed a part of this no3 may have originated from stormwater that carries organic materials such as leaf litter and grass clipping from land to water fissore et al 2012 lusk and toor 2016a the mixing model indicated that nh4 fertilizers contribution to no3 n was 8 6 to 41 1 mean 16 7 in the freshwater and 11 1 to 15 0 mean 13 5 in the estuarine whereas no3 fertilizer contributed 5 0 to 46 4 mean 21 3 in the freshwater and 19 4 to 27 3 mean 25 0 in the estuarine waters inorganic fertilizers were the most dominant source of no3 n in the most upstream site u1 and at all sampling sites suggesting runoff of fertilizers from agricultural land site u1 and from urban landscape fertilization practices in residential areas sites u2 onwards along braden river to tampa bay estuary cao et al 2014 fissore et al 2012 reported that fertilizers used in the landscape are one of the largest n fluxes in the ecosystems han et al 2014 estimated net anthropogenic n inputs and found that n inputs from fertilizer were also the largest sources to investigate whether denitrification occurred in our samples n isotope data and no3 n concentration were plotted si fig s6 where denitrification can be explained by 1 increase in δ15n no3 with decrease in no3 n concentration and 2 ratio of 2 1 between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 aravena and robertson 1998 lehmann et al 2003 divers et al 2014 our samples showed possible denitrification in april 2016 and also in estuarine area where there was an increase in δ15n no3 and decrease no3 n concentrations as also observed by divers et al 2014 3 5 bioavailability of don in freshwater and estuarine waters across all freshwater and estuarine sites our results showed that don was the main n form fig 3 therefore we investigated the bioavailability of don as there is a potential that a portion of don might be bioavailable and contribute to water quality degradation the don concentrations in the initial samples from all sites were 0 26 0 80 mg l 57 to 96 of tdn and decreased to 0 09 0 69 mg l 23 to 81 of tdn after 5 days of incubation fig 7 a the changes in don concentration before and after incubation were significantly different tukey s hsd p 0 05 with 14 to 65 of don removal fig 7b suggesting that a portion of don in our samples consisted of n pool that was bioavailable to microbes bronk et al 2007 in contrast 4 to 7 of don removal reported in other studies after 5 days of incubation might be due to the failure of inoculum to grow the refractory nature of the don pool and favorable use of din by microorganisms bronk et al 2007 lusk and toor 2016b osborne et al 2013 in our samples don was approximately 57 to 96 of tdn which means only a small portion of the din was present 4 to 43 suggesting that a greater amount of don was available and thus consumed by microbes studies have shown that the labile pool of don is dominated by autochthonous sources and may be comprised of labile carbohydrates proteins and amino acids that can be immediately available to microbes bronk et al 2007 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b microbial populations have been reported to play a dual role as consumers and producers fasching et al 2014 guillemette and del giorgio 2012 which means that these labile n compounds can also be released as microbial metabolites which can be then reused and reformed e g lusk and toor 2016b this may explain the dominance of don in our estuarine waters even though they had high don bioavailability fig 3b our finding was similar to hendrickson et al 2007 who reported that 38 92 of don in an urbanized stream in florida was bioavailable they suggested that urbanization shifted the nature of don from refractory to more labile pools due to the increase in impervious surfaces where inputs from terrestrial plant organic matter were replaced by labile organic pool that was dominant in urban surface runoff our results also showed that the bioavailability of don was significantly higher tukey s hsd p 0 05 in the estuarine 50 65 as compared to freshwater sites 14 36 fig 7b this might be due to the fact that the 1 inoculum was obtained from estuarine area thus the microbes were more efficient in utilizing estuarine don than freshwater don and or 2 shift from allochthonous to autochtonous organic n as water flowed from upstream to downstream as explained by the river continuum concept vanote et al 1980 our results are similar to park et al 2016 who showed that don in ocean waters was more bioavailable than freshwater and concluded that salinity and types of microbial communities might be responsible for degradation of organic n the lower don bioavailability in freshwater sites might be likely due to the high doc don 17 34 as compared to the estuarine sites 17 21 suggesting greater contribution of terrestrial plant or soil derived sources bernal et al 2005 that was allochthonous and consisted of refractory n fractions i e lignin and cellulose lusk and toor 2016a 2016b moran et al 1999 sleighter et al 2014 kaushal and lewis 2005 also reported that don uptake is low when c n ratio is high we observed that after 5 days of incubation din concentrations significantly tukey s hsd p 0 05 increased at all sites except sites u1 and u2 and ranged from 13 to 81 si fig s7 whereas don concentrations decreased fig 7a studies have shown that mineralization of organic n results in increase of nh4 high concentrations of nh4 n with high activity of microbes will induce nitrification bijoor et al 2008 butler et al 2012 causse et al 2015 this observation is supported by our isotopic results of δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 that showed that nitrification was the main source of no3 n in our study sites this finding is similar to results of seitzinger and sanders 1999 who reported that din concentration increased along with increase in don bioavailability the reduction in don in our samples might also be due to the abiotic processes such as photochemical degradation that can convert a part of don to nh4 n seitzinger and sanders 1999 doane 2017 4 conclusions in this study we captured information about composition of the n forms sources of no3 and don bioavailability in subtropical coastal urban waters data showed that among all n forms don was the most dominant n form at all sampling sites mean 64 range 46 83 followed by pon mean 22 range 14 37 and inorganic n forms mean 14 range 3 26 isotopic data showed that no3 transport from land to water was controlled by mixing of multiple sources with nitrification as the most dominant contributor 36 4 followed by soil and organic n sources 25 5 no3 fertilizer 22 4 and nh4 fertilizers 15 7 bioassays indicated that a portion of don pool which was the most dominant n form in all waters was bioavailable and can be a potential source of n for microbes in the tampa bay estuary although the estuarine waters had low din 14 tn the higher bioavailability of don suggests that microbes will be able to consume don to meet n requirement thus leading to water quality

19639,nitrogen n transport from land to water is a dominant contributor of n in estuarine waters leading to eutrophication harmful algal blooms and hypoxia our objectives were to 1 investigate the composition of inorganic and organic n forms 2 distinguish the sources and biogeochemical mechanisms of nitrate n no3 n transport using stable isotopes of no3 and bayesian mixing model and 3 determine the dissolved organic n don bioavailability using bioassays in a longitudinal gradient from freshwater to estuarine ecosystem located in the tampa bay florida united states we found that don was the most dominant n form mean 64 range 46 83 followed by particulate organic n pon mean 22 range 14 37 whereas inorganic n forms nox n 7 nh4 n 7 were 14 of total n in freshwater and estuarine waters stable isotope data of no3 revealed that nitrification was the main contributor 36 4 followed by soil and organic n sources 25 5 no3 fertilizers 22 4 and nh4 fertilizers 15 7 bioassays showed that 14 to 65 of don concentrations decreased after 5 days of incubation indicating utilization of don by microbes in freshwater and estuarine waters these results suggest that despite low proportion of inorganic n forms the higher concentrations and bioavailability of don can be a potential source of n for algae and bacteria leading to water quality degradation in the estuarine waters graphical

korth et al 2012 jørgensen et al 2014 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b sipler and bronk 2015 a number of studies on don have been conducted in the freshwater fellman et al 2009 kaushal and lewis 2005 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b and marine ecosystems badr et al 2008 berman and bronk 2003 boynton and kemp 2008 petrone et al 2009 these studies have collectively shown that don is the predominant n form in leached waters from turfgrass stormwater runoff pond outflow waters and streams in urban watersheds lusk et al 2018 osborne et al 2013 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b to control n transport to water bodies we need a better understanding of the composition source identification and bioavailability of n nitrogen transported from the land exists in water bodies in many forms nh4 no2 no3 organic n which transform from one form to another due to the biogeochemical processes such as immobilization mineralization nitrification and denitrification seitzinger and harrison 2008 for example organic n is converted to nh4 by mineralization causse et al 2015 and nitrification converts nh4 to no3 corre et al 2017 when no3 is formed in terrestrial systems it might be leached from soil to water or denitrified brookshire et al 2012 implying that hydrologic export of n forms is controlled by soil n transformations zou et al 2016 the proportion of n forms in water bodies depends on the land use anthropogenic activities climatic variability watershed characteristics and origin of n causse et al 2015 seitzinger and harrison 2008 the relative contribution of different processes and sources of n

ratios of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 has been reported as a powerful tool to distinguish no3 n sources and determine n transport mechanisms from land to water bodies hale et al 2014 divers et al 2014 yang and toor 2016 several studies have used the dual isotopes of no3 to assess nonpoint source n loading and to distinguish inorganic and organic n sources jankowski et al 2012 kaushal et al 2011 yang and toor 2016 2017 since don is the most dominant n form in freshwater and estuarine ecosystems berman and bronk 2003 kaushal and lewis 2005 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b knowledge of don bioavailability is essential to determine the potential of this pool to be biologically available bioavailability of don can be estimated using bioassays in which water samples are incubated with

al 2016 and types of microbial communities park et al 2016 numerous studies have suggested that it is important to incorporate don into n loading budgets as don might be a potential source of n for microbes in water bodies korsaeth et al 2003 sun et al 2017 van kessel et al 2009 a better understanding of the composition sources and bioavailability of n would aid in devising solutions to reduce n transport from land to water bodies our specific objectives were to investigate the 1 composition of inorganic and organic n forms 2 determine the sources of no3 n and 3 assess the bioavailability of don in a longitudinal gradient from freshwater to estuarine ecosystem our hypotheses were as follows h1 organic n forms would be more dominant in estuarine than freshwater ecosystem h2 n loading from land to water bodies would be controlled by mixing of multiple sources and biotic processes i e nitrification and denitrification and h3 a part of don in estuarine ecosystem would be more bioavailable to microbes than don in freshwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area was braden river drainage area 133 km2 which flows into manatee river and then onto tampa bay estuary florida united states fig 1 thirteen sampling sites in a longitudinal gradient 4 10 km away from each site were selected along the freshwater braden river manatee river to estuarine tampa bay estuary

then both rivers flow into tampa bay estuary where the most downstream site e3 was located fig 1 salinity values were used to distinguish between freshwater and estuarine sites such that eight sites u1 to u3 m1 to m5 had mean salinity ranging from 0 27 to 0 53 and were classified as freshwater whereas four sites e1 to e3 mr had mean salinity ranging from 23 56 to 34 02 and were classified as estuarine fig 2 site l1 was considered a mix between freshwater and estuarine as the mean salinity was 10 34 the land use data obtained from the southwest florida management district was used in

agricultural 13 natural 5 and wetland and water 10 the land use data for individual 13 sites is shown in fig 2 2 2 sample collection samples were collected at monthly intervals from december 2015 to may 2016 at 13 selected locations fig 1 along the braden river u1 to l1 manatee river mr e1 and e2 and tampa bay estuary e3 sites u1 and u2 were sampled only from march to may 2016 during each sampling event a composite grab sample was collected from the edge of the river bank sites u1 to m1 l1 to e3 and bridges sites m2 and m3 during each sample collection at each site five 1 l samples were collected and mixed in a bucket before taking a composite 1 l sample in an acid washed 10 hydrochloric acid hcl amber glass bottle which was kept on ice and transported to the lab for further processing and analyses three 1 l inoculum samples were collected from the most downstream site e3 in amber glass bottles for the bioassay study after collection the inoculum samples were filtered through 150 μm mesh to remove heterotrophic organisms that might consume autotrophic organism osborne et al 2013 2 3 nitrogen forms analysis a subsample of the water samples was vacuum filtered using

contributions parnell et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 2017 in the bayesian mixing model measured δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values for each of the freshwater and estuarine samples from december 2015 to may 2016 n 72 were assigned as customer and the mean isotopic values of the no3 n sources from the literature were assigned as sources isotopic composition of no3 is not only useful for source identification but can be used to investigate the influence of nitrification and denitrification processes the δ18o no3 value from 10 to 10 has been suggested to be indicative of nitrification which can be calculated using this formula δ18o no3 1 3 δ18o o2 2 3 δ18o h2o kendall et al 2007 whereas the ratio of 2 1 between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 has been reported by researchers as an indication of denitrification aravena and robertson 1998 lehmann et al 2003 2 6 bioassay experiments subsamples of collected water samples from 13 sites during march may 2016 n 39 were mixed with inoculum collected from the most downstream site e3 in the estuary following methods described by osborne et al 2013 and lusk and toor 2016a 2016b in brief the bioassay experiment was conducted by mixing 320 ml of sample with 100 ml of inoculum in 1 l amber glass bottle the mixed samples were divided into two portions and designated as t0 initial samples and t5 incubated samples subsamples of t0 were immediately filtered using whatman 47 mm gf f 0 45 μm pore size filter and analyzed for tdn nh4 n and nox n whereas the unfiltered were analyzed for tn the samples designated as t5 were kept in glass bottle and incubated at 12 12 h dark light cycle in an air conditioned laboratory with temperature maintained at 22 2 c for 5 days then the samples were filtered and analyzed for tdn nh4 n and nox n whereas the unfiltered samples were analyzed for tn all analyses were completed within 24 h a flow chart describing various steps used in the bioassay study is included in the supplementary information si fig s1 2 7 statistical analysis the sas jmp pro 12 software was used for statistical analysis of the data differences in the mean for response variables i e tn don pon nh4 n nox n and percent don bioavailability from 13 sites were modeled using linear mixed model with ar 1 correlation where site was specified as a fixed effect and time of sampling was included as random effect linear mixed model unstructured correlation was used to test the differences in the response values noted above using the following as fixed effects 1 freshwater and estuarine and 2 initial t0 and incubated t5 concentrations tukey s multiple comparison test honest significant difference hsd was used to confirm the significant group differences for both sets of models an alpha equal to 0 05 was used as a threshold for statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and discharge total rainfall during the study period december 2015 to may 2016 was 52 cm monthly mean 8 6 cm with the highest amount in may 27 cm and the lowest amount in april 0 4 cm discharge data were obtained from usgs database for two sites located along the braden river si fig s2 where total monthly discharge was generally low except for january and may with values ranging from 36 5 to 46 5 m3 s at u2 site and from 84 1 to 103 8 m3 s at m4 site 3 2 longitudinal distribution of nitrogen forms several states in the united states have developed numeric nutrient criteria for n to protect and restore the water bodies for example according to florida administrative code fac tn numeric value in our study region for freshwater is 1 65 mg l fac 2012a and for estuarine waters is 1 80 tons million m3 of water which translates to 1 8 mg l fac 2012b in 13 study sites mean tn concentrations were lower freshwater 1 12 mg l estuarine 0 72 mg l than the numeric criteria values for the region fig 3 a suggesting that these waters met the threshold numeric criteria values during the study period in this study tn was highest at the upstream site u2 1 12 mg l and lowest at the most downstream site e3 0 48 mg l elevated tn at u2 could be due to the contribution from upland agricultural sources figs 2 and 3a overall a decrease in the tn concentration from freshwater to estuarine ecosystem was observed fig 3a linear mixed model showed that tn was positively correlated with pon r 2 0 73 p 0 0001 this might be partially attributed to the effect of reservoir which functions as sink for suspended sediments and particulates nemery et al 2016 seitzinger et al 2010 as our data showed that pon slightly decreased from m1 to m5 fig 3b statistical analysis across all sampling sites showed that tn concentrations were inversely correlated with salinity r 2 0 47 p 0 0001 pennino et al 2016 suggested that more reduction in tn towards the estuary may be attributed to the dilution in estuarine area by the tidal marine waters and burial of n in the estuarine sediments our samples showed that concentrations of tn were significantly correlated with don r 2 0 76 p 0 0001 thus decrease in don concentrations in our study reflected a decrease in tn reduction of don might be attributed to transformation of don to nh4 by ammonification and further transformation into no2 and no3 through nitrification suggesting that a part of don may have been biologically transformed and or biologically utilized in the lower reaches of river and estuary xia et al 2013 this may also explain a slight increase in both nh4 and no3 in the estuarine sites mr to e3 fig 3b contribution of don to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication in water bodies has been recognized seitzinger and sanders 1999 seitzinger et al 2002 studies have shown that don is the most dominant n form in freshwater ecosystems osborne et al 2013 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b our results also showed that don was the most dominant form at all sampling sites mean 64 range 46 83 followed by pon 22 range 14 37 whereas inorganic n forms were 14 of tn nox n 7 nh4 n 7 at all sites fig 3b the high concentrations of don in the freshwater and estuarine ecosystem may be attributed to several factors such as 1 contribution of pon from plant materials leaves grass clippings that settle in the water bodies and then contributes don 2 the effects of low stream flow and velocity as this leads to greater contact between solute and streambed resulting in greater breakdown of leaf litter in the streams which then contributes don li and davis 2014 lusk and toor 2016a scott et al 2007 the dominance of don and pon in this subtropical ecosystem suggests that a better understanding of don sources including terrestrial runoff of plant detritus leaching from plant materials and microbial contributions is needed to reduce n losses from land to water bodies linear mixed model results showed that nh4 n was negatively correlated with don r 2 0 28 p 0 05 this may explain a slight reduction in nh4 n from u1 to m5 sites suggesting bio assimilation of nh4 n by microbes which was then released as don bronk et al 1994 kaushal et al 2014 pujo pay and conan 2003 statistical analysis also showed that no3 n concentrations were significantly different between sites u3 and m5 tukey s hsd p 0 05 suggesting potential denitrification of no3 to n2 wollheim et al 2008 in freshwater sites u1 to l1 no3 n was the main din form with mean concentrations of 0 02 0 23 mg l while in the estuarine sites e1 to e3 nh4 n was the dominant din form with mean concentrations of 0 06 0 13 mg l there are no significant differences in no3 n concentrations between freshwater and estuarine however nh4 n concentration in the estuarine sites was significantly higher than freshwater tukey s hsd p 0 05 in addition to ammonification of organic n increase in nh4 n in the estuarine sites might be attributed to humic shuttle mechanism as described by bronk et al 2007 that at upstream marshes with low salinity nh4 n is bonded to the anionic sites of humic substances and when these humic substances reach downstream estuarine area with high saline waters the salts i e ca2 mg2 replace nh4 on the anionic sites resulting in nh4 release and high concentrations in estuarine waters we plotted monthly tn data from december 2015 to may 2016 and observed that most monthly values did not significantly vary except for april 2016 sampling event si fig s3 3 3 water isotopes in freshwater and estuarine waters across all freshwater and estuarine sites δ18o h2o ranged from 2 70 to 1 87 mean 0 26 and δd h2o ranged from 9 20 to 14 03 mean 2 70 fig 4 linear mixed model showed that the mean salinity was positively correlated with mean δ18o h2o r 2 0 69 p 0 0001 and δd h2o r 2 0 74 p 0 0001 at all sampling sites suggesting that the isotopic values of both δ18o h2o and δd h2o increased as the water salinity increased from freshwater to estuarine sites lambs et al 2015 mean isotopic values of δ18o h2o for all 13 sites were higher in estuarine range 0 64 to 0 89 than freshwater range 0 36 to 1 96 similarly δd h2o values were also greater in estuarine range 7 42 to 9 17 than freshwater 6 87 to 1 76 si fig s4 statistically both δ18o h2o and δd h2o isotope values were significantly tukey s hsd p 0 05 greater in the estuarine than freshwater sites higher isotopic values in estuarine sites suggests greater evaporation bowen et al 2011 horibe and ogura 1968 which could be expected due to the absence of shade trees and slow moving water in estuarine sites due to the proximity to ocean and less elevation as compared to the upstream freshwater sites with high tree cover and fast moving water due to the elevation gradient and smaller channel further the changes in isotopic composition in our samples from freshwater to estuarine sites were also likely caused by mixing of freshwater with estuarine water global meteoric water line gmwl is an equation interpreted as δd h2o 8 δ18o h2o 10 which represents the relationship between h and o isotopes of water craig 1961 contribution of evaporated moisture can be determined by using the y intercept known as deuterium excess or d excess δd h2o 8 δ18o h2o of the equation coplen 1993 the linear mixed model fixed effect coefficient showed no significant difference in intercept and slope between the regression line of freshwater and estuarine p value 0 1282 the d excess values in our samples from freshwater δd h2o 4 48 δ18o h2o 3 36 and estuarine δd h2o 5 25 δ18o h2o 4 44 were lower than the d excess value from gmwl 10 fig 4 likely due to the evaporation or mixing with evaporated water mohammed et al 2016 yang and toor 2016 evaporation is expected to occur in our watershed due to the high temperature 21 26 c observed during the study period 3 4 origin of nitrate nitrogen in freshwater and estuarine waters in all samples δ15n no3 ranged from 4 32 to 29 18 mean 6 23 and δ18o no3 ranged from 4 03 to 19 76 mean 6 20 fig 5 based on these isotopic values it is clear that atmospheric deposition did not contribute no3 n in our freshwater and estuarine waters as the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for atmospheric deposition have been reported to be 15 to 15 and 23 to 80 respectively kendall et al 2007 the isotopic values in our samples were in the range observed for multiple sources such as nitrification inorganic fertilizer no3 and nh4 and soil and organic n figs 5 and si fig s5 however the ranges of isotope values for the sources overlap making it impossible to visually distinguish the contribution of specific sources thus a bayesian mixing model was used which showed that nitrification was the dominant contributor of no3 n across all sites 36 4 followed by soil and organic n sources 25 5 no3 fertilizer 22 4 and nh4 fertilizers 15 7 figs 6a and si fig s5 contribution of nitrification can be determined from δ18o no3 values where δ18o no3 from 10 to 10 indicates insitu soil nitrification theoretically for more precise values no3 n from nitrification can be calculated using the formula δ18o no3 1 3 δ18o o2 2 3 δ18o h2o kendall et al 2007 the expected values of δ18o no3 for nitrification in our samples obtained from the equation ranged from 6 04 to 9 08 plotted in fig 5 the mixing model data indicated that nitrification was the most dominant source of no3 n at all sampling sites except for u1 l1 and e3 fig 6 b table 2 the mean contribution of nitrification to no3 was 37 7 range 17 6 49 5 in the freshwater and 33 3 range 19 3 44 1 in estuarine waters the water isotope data section 3 3 showed that evaporation occurred in our samples due to the high temperature which may have resulted in greater nitrification for example strauss et al 2004 reported that high river temperature increase the nitrification rate in water bodies soil and organic n was the second most dominant no3 n source in our water samples suggesting mineralization of organic n to nh4 and further nitrification to no3 the mixing model suggested that soil and organic n contributed 13 4 to 39 0 mean 24 3 of no3 in the freshwater and 18 8 to 43 3 mean 28 3 of no3 in the estuarine waters in this watershed a part of this no3 may have originated from stormwater that carries organic materials such as leaf litter and grass clipping from land to water fissore et al 2012 lusk and toor 2016a the mixing model indicated that nh4 fertilizers contribution to no3 n was 8 6 to 41 1 mean 16 7 in the freshwater and 11 1 to 15 0 mean 13 5 in the estuarine whereas no3 fertilizer contributed 5 0 to 46 4 mean 21 3 in the freshwater and 19 4 to 27 3 mean 25 0 in the estuarine waters inorganic fertilizers were the most dominant source of no3 n in the most upstream site u1 and at all sampling sites suggesting runoff of fertilizers from agricultural land site u1 and from urban landscape fertilization practices in residential areas sites u2 onwards along braden river to tampa bay estuary cao et al 2014 fissore et al 2012 reported that fertilizers used in the landscape are one of the largest n fluxes in the ecosystems han et al 2014 estimated net anthropogenic n inputs and found that n inputs from fertilizer were also the largest sources to investigate whether denitrification occurred in our samples n isotope data and no3 n concentration were plotted si fig s6 where denitrification can be explained by 1 increase in δ15n no3 with decrease in no3 n concentration and 2 ratio of 2 1 between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 aravena and robertson 1998 lehmann et al 2003 divers et al 2014 our samples showed possible denitrification in april 2016 and also in estuarine area where there was an increase in δ15n no3 and decrease no3 n concentrations as also observed by divers et al 2014 3 5 bioavailability of don in freshwater and estuarine waters across all freshwater and estuarine sites our results showed that don was the main n form fig 3 therefore we investigated the bioavailability of don as there is a potential that a portion of don might be bioavailable and contribute to water quality degradation the don concentrations in the initial samples from all sites were 0 26 0 80 mg l 57 to 96 of tdn and decreased to 0 09 0 69 mg l 23 to 81 of tdn after 5 days of incubation fig 7 a the changes in don concentration before and after incubation were significantly different tukey s hsd p 0 05 with 14 to 65 of don removal fig 7b suggesting that a portion of don in our samples consisted of n pool that was bioavailable to microbes bronk et al 2007 in contrast 4 to 7 of don removal reported in other studies after 5 days of incubation might be due to the failure of inoculum to grow the refractory nature of the don pool and favorable use of din by microorganisms bronk et al 2007 lusk and toor 2016b osborne et al 2013 in our samples don was approximately 57 to 96 of tdn which means only a small portion of the din was present 4 to 43 suggesting that a greater amount of don was available and thus consumed by microbes studies have shown that the labile pool of don is dominated by autochthonous sources and may be comprised of labile carbohydrates proteins and amino acids that can be immediately available to microbes bronk et al 2007 lusk and toor 2016a 2016b microbial populations have been reported to play a dual role as consumers and producers fasching et al 2014 guillemette and del giorgio 2012 which means that these labile n compounds can also be released as microbial metabolites which can be then reused and reformed e g lusk and toor 2016b this may explain the dominance of don in our estuarine waters even though they had high don bioavailability fig 3b our finding was similar to hendrickson et al 2007 who reported that 38 92 of don in an urbanized stream in florida was bioavailable they suggested that urbanization shifted the nature of don from refractory to more labile pools due to the increase in impervious surfaces where inputs from terrestrial plant organic matter were replaced by labile organic pool that was dominant in urban surface runoff our results also showed that the bioavailability of don was significantly higher tukey s hsd p 0 05 in the estuarine 50 65 as compared to freshwater sites 14 36 fig 7b this might be due to the fact that the 1 inoculum was obtained from estuarine area thus the microbes were more efficient in utilizing estuarine don than freshwater don and or 2 shift from allochthonous to autochtonous organic n as water flowed from upstream to downstream as explained by the river continuum concept vanote et al 1980 our results are similar to park et al 2016 who showed that don in ocean waters was more bioavailable than freshwater and concluded that salinity and types of microbial communities might be responsible for degradation of organic n the lower don bioavailability in freshwater sites might be likely due to the high doc don 17 34 as compared to the estuarine sites 17 21 suggesting greater contribution of terrestrial plant or soil derived sources bernal et al 2005 that was allochthonous and consisted of refractory n fractions i e lignin and cellulose lusk and toor 2016a 2016b moran et al 1999 sleighter et al 2014 kaushal and lewis 2005 also reported that don uptake is low when c n ratio is high we observed that after 5 days of incubation din concentrations significantly tukey s hsd p 0 05 increased at all sites except sites u1 and u2 and ranged from 13 to 81 si fig s7 whereas don concentrations decreased fig 7a studies have shown that mineralization of organic n results in increase of nh4 high concentrations of nh4 n with high activity of microbes will induce nitrification bijoor et al 2008 butler et al 2012 causse et al 2015 this observation is supported by our isotopic results of δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 that showed that nitrification was the main source of no3 n in our study sites this finding is similar to results of seitzinger and sanders 1999 who reported that din concentration increased along with increase in don bioavailability the reduction in don in our samples might also be due to the abiotic processes such as photochemical degradation that can convert a part of don to nh4 n seitzinger and sanders 1999 doane 2017 4 conclusions in this study we captured information about composition of the n forms sources of no3 and don bioavailability in subtropical coastal urban waters data showed that among all n forms don was the most dominant n form at all sampling sites mean 64 range 46 83 followed by pon mean 22 range 14 37 and inorganic n forms mean 14 range 3 26 isotopic data showed that no3 transport from land to water was controlled by mixing of multiple sources with nitrification as the most dominant contributor 36 4 followed by soil and organic n sources 25 5 no3 fertilizer 22 4 and nh4 fertilizers 15 7 bioassays indicated that a portion of don pool which was the most dominant n form in all waters was bioavailable and can be a potential source of n for microbes in the tampa bay estuary although the estuarine waters had low din 14 tn the higher bioavailability of don suggests that microbes will be able to consume don to meet n requirement thus leading to water quality
