15845,simultaneous recovery of biopolymers and enhanced bio reactor performance are promising options for sustainable wastewater treatment and the bioactivity of sludge after biopolymer extraction is thus critical for the performance of the system to this end stratified extracellular polymeric substances eps including slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted and the bioactivities of the consequent extraction residues were assessed using aerobic respirogram kinetic and flow cytometry fcm after the initial weak extraction of slime the particle size distribution of the sludge significantly decreased and subsequent extractions of lb eps and tb eps produced an equivalent size distribution in contrast the fractal dimension decreased after each extraction suggesting that lb eps and tb eps affected the compactness of flocs rather than the size the aerobic bacteria distribution estimated using respirogram shows that slime mainly encapsulated heterotrophs while lb eps mainly encapsulated nitrifiers in addition the ammonia nitrogen affinity coefficient decreased from 1 79 to 0 28 mg l when slime was removed thereby encouraging the activities of autotrophic nitrifiers further removal of lb eps induced high energy dispersion as the maintenance coefficient m and the metabolic dispersion index μ m increased from 0 11 to 0 22 and 0 44 to 0 63 respectively meanwhile the yield rate decreased from 0 77 to 0 66 although pellets that resulted from tb eps extraction were not aerobically active as described by respirogram and growth curves they were still metabolically active as measured by live dead cell counting and redox sensor green signal these pellets used more energy for maintenance as indicated by the high maintenance coefficient than those residual after either slime or lb eps extraction in addition the variation in bacteria community distribution across flocs was related to the variation in temperatures suggesting that the inner part of a floc might be hotter than the outer side therefore compared to bacteria in the raw sludge the viable bacteria bounded in lb eps and tb eps convert more energy to heat rather than growth these results indicate that energy was dispersed as metabolic heat for the lb eps extracted sludge and removal of lb eps favored thermogenesis and sludge reduction based on the above findings a simultaneously eps recovery and performance enhancement configuration is thus proposed which holds great promise for the integration of next generation wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stratified eps floc compactness bacterial encapsulation energy dispersion thermogenesis 1 introduction extracellular polymeric substances eps play an essential role in the formation process of bio aggregates biofilm floc and granule siddharth et al 2021 as revealed by previous studies eps are macromolecules with highly diverse chemical composition and structure related to bacterial species and growth conditions mainly composed of polysaccharides ps proteins pn lipids and extracellular dna edna flemming and wingender 2010 additionally fatty acids nucleic acids humic acids amino acids and other molecules are present in smaller amounts due to their varied physicochemical properties eps is applied in many industry sectors e g food paper textile biotechnological pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries casillo et al 2018 xiao and zheng 2016 furthermore eps can be used for medical purposes as they exhibit many biomedical properties antimicrobial anti tumor anti inflammation or antioxidative activity delattre et al 2016 xiao and zheng 2016 therefore recovery eps from wastewater has been an attractive target in wastewater treatment plants despite eps extraction from excess sludge having been widely considered the focus has largely been placed on extracted eps with post extraction residual sludge frequently disposed of as waste cao et al 2021 li et al 2021 yet returning the extracted sludge to the biological system is encouraging in some cases if the bioactivity of the residual sludge is acceptable for example crushing big granules into smaller ones could enhance nitrification by extending the aerobic zone nguyen quoc et al 2021 and releasing carbon sources from the broken sludge into a hydro cyclone system could enhance denitrification xu et al 2019 returning the extracted sludge into the bioreactor systems can promote both performance enhancement and eps recovery however little information on the effect of extraction on bioactivity is available for such purposes although eps constituents depend on influent types operational conditions and extraction procedures pellicer nacher et al 2013 seviour et al 2019 the eps stratification theory based on bound strength has been widely recognized namely dispersed slime loosely bound lb and tightly bound tb eps guo et al 2020 yu et al 2008 the inner layered tb eps promotes microbial aggregation and the surface layered slime forms the gel network to link the incipient flocs together these two components are closely related to floc morphology jia et al 2017 while slime and lb eps could influence sludge flocculation and dewaterability yu et al 2008 recently the generation and consumption mechanism of both tb eps and lb eps has been mathematically described xing et al 2022 however the effect of the eps extraction on the residual sludge is still unclear in other words more attention has been paid to eps itself rather than the residual sludge when the residual sludge is designated to return to bioreactors we must understand its characteristics for better process operation performance enhancement and eps recovery thus in this study eps were successively extracted to assess the residual sludge of each extraction by evaluating the effect of each extraction procedure on the residual sludge bioactivity the role of slime lb eps and tb eps can be clarified with this knowledge a new process configuration is proposed to realize performance enhancement and biopolymer recovery simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sampling and characterization the activated sludge used for analysis in this research was taken from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp that operates with an anaerobic anoxic oxic process aao configuration with a capacity of 500 000 m3 day to ensure the validity and reproducibility of the results the raw sludge sampling was done at least four times with an interval of 3 4 days in 15 days the trends observed in this study were based on multiple samples on different dates all the activated sludge was sampled from the returning sludge from the sedimentation tank to the anaerobic tank after transporting the sludge back to the lab all the sludge samples were screened with 1 mm pore sieve the sludge flocs appeared yellow brown and with normal settleability as the sludge volume index svi was 76 2 28 ml g 1 mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the sampled raw sludge was determined to be as follows mlss 11427 96 mg l 1 the volatile suspended solids vss ratio vss mlss 0 64 0 02 2 2 eps extraction and analysis the total eps was stratified into three fractions slime lb eps and tb eps according to the extraction strength yu et al 2008 the extraction procedures are shown in fig 1 and the centrifugal force for slime extraction has been carefully selected to avoid the overlap between slime and lb eps as described in text s1 of the supplementary information si firstly the raw sludge of 10 ml was filled to 30 ml with pbs ph 7 2 in a centrifugation tube and centrifuged at 1600g at 4 c for 5 min the collected supernatant was defined as slime the easily removed part of eps by weak centrifugation the sediment was resuspended to 30 ml using pbs and then centrifuged at 1600g at 4 c for 5 min the supernatant was decanted and sediment resuspended to 30 ml with pbs followed by 8 min 5w 20 khz ultrasonication for cyto dispersion with an ultrasonic cyto dispersion equipment jy96 iin huxi shanghai china resulted a sonication intensity es of 80 kj l 1 as a complete disaggregation of activated flocs requires sonication intensity around 80 kj l 1 foladori et al 2007 then the sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 10000g at 4 c the bulk solution and the residual sediment were collected separately the organic matter in the bulk solution was designated to be the lb eps fraction the residual sediment was resuspended in pbs again to the original volume of 30 ml as recommended by durmaz and sanin 2001 70g gss cer was applied for eps extraction as such dosage is optimistic to extract the polymer while maintaining bioactivity as much as possible and the jar test apparatus was ice water bathed for 2 h with 200 rpm stirring subsequently the sample was centrifuged at 10000g at 4 c for 30 min the resulting sediment was defined as the pellet then the supernatant was centrifuged at 10000g at 4 c for 15 min three times the final product was defined as tb eps with such procedures slime slime extracted sludge lb eps lb eps extracted sludge tb eps and pellet were prepared accordingly for flow cytometry respirogram and other analysis in this study three dimensional 3d excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out using a f

diameter of the volume distribution mv could be obtained using the equipment software microscope photos of 20 times magnification were taken by a nikon eclipse 50i equipped with a digital camera nikon japan all images were processed with image j software schneider et al 2012 the fractal dimension was calculated using the box counting method the images were firstly binarized then analyzed with the

demonstrate cell vitality baert et al 2016 the supernatant obtained from raw sludge slime lb eps and tb eps samples was diluted 150 fold with pbs before staining the raw sludge slime lb eps and tb eps extracted sediment samples were diluted 6000 fold before staining to ensure that the real time counting by the instrument was less than 1000 cells s 1 all the sediment samples were dispersed with 20 hz 4 5 w ultrasonication for 5 min with an ultrasonic cyto dispersion equipment jy96 iin huxi shanghai china to ensure the cells were separated after filtration with 0 22 μm nylon membrane pall usa dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was used as a solvent to dilute the sgi standard stock solution for 10000 fold next 297 μl of bacterial solution and 3 μl of the diluted sgi solution were added to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and then stained for 15 min at 35 c in the dark for rsg staining 0 3 μl rsg dye was added to 299 7 μl bacteria sample and then stained for 10 min at 37 c in dark after staining the samples were rapidly measured by a bd accuri c6 bd bioscience belgium with dual laser of fixed wavelength 488 and 640 nm fluorescent signals were collected at fl1 equal to 530 nm and fl3 exceeding 670 nm as well as the lateral and forward scattered light intensities the measurements were conducted with a flow rate of 33 ml min 1 the acquired data was processed by bd accuri cflow software and a threshold of 1000 was applied to the green fluorescent channel fl1 to eliminate positive signals of the instrument and sample background each analysis was performed in triplicate and the electronic gates setting of the instrument was kept the same to ensure the comparability of data 2 5 respirogram determination growth curve measurement and the heterotrophic autotrophic biomass quantification to achieve accurate bioactivity assessments respirogram was employed as it precisely describes the respiration rates of different types of bacteria when different experimental conditions are provided li et al 2019 the manually measured respiration rates were as follows the site respiration rate sours for the raw mixed liquid of the sample the quasi endogenous respiration rate sourq after the raw sludge being washed 3 times the endogenous respiration rate soure without external substrates the maximum respiratory rate sourt with sufficient substrates the respiration rate of autotrophic bacteria soura measured with atu and naclo3 to depress the ammonium nh4 n and nitrite no2 n oxidation and heterotrophic bacteria respiration rate sourh stimulated by nitrogen and carbon source respectively all the our values were calculated with originpro originlab corporation usa then the specific oxygen consumption rate sour values were calculated in accordance with the respective our values with the following equation 2 s o u r o u r m l s s where the unit of our is mg o2 l 1 h 1 sour is the specific oxygen utilization rate mg o2 gss 1 h 1 the standard error of the calculated sour and lnour values growth curve plotting were calculated according to the procedures descripted text s2 in si the maximum respiration rate based max m method from li et al 2019 was applied to quantify the heterotrophic autotrophic biomass for example the heterotrophic biomass concentrations xh in the extracted sludge samples were calculated with the equation below 3 x h 1000 o u r h s o u r m a x f c v where empirical coefficient sourmax is the maximum specific our of xh assumed as 150 mg o2 gvss 1 h 1 and fcv takes the value of 1 42 gcod gvss 1 li et al 2019 similarly the autotrophic biomass concentration xa and the total biomass concentration xt could be calculated afterwards the heterotrophic biomass concentrations in the stratified layers of the flocs could be calculated as below 4 1 x h s l i m e x h r a w s l u d g e x h s l i m e e x t r a c t e d 4 2 x h l b e p s x h s l i m e e x t r a c t e d x h l b e p s e x t r a c t e d 4 3 x h tb eps x h lb eps extracted x h pellet where xh raw sludge is the heterotrophic biomass concentration in raw sludge xh slime extracted is the heterotrophic biomass concentration in slime extracted sludge xh slime is the heterotrophic biomass concentration in slime all items in eqs 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 were named in this fashion the autotrophic biomass concentrations were calculated in a similar manner with xa values 2 6 adenine nucleotides determination with uhplc and the aec calculation simultaneous analytical determination of atp adenosine triphosphate adp adenosine diphosphate and amp adenosine monophosphate were measured using ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc ultimate3000 thermo fisher scientific usa accucore aq hplc column length 100 mm diameter 4 6 mm particle size 2 6 μm from thermo scientific was used to identify and quantify adenine nucleotides atp adp and amp the mobile phase buffer and standards were prepared according to menegollo et al 2019 for nucleotide extraction 5 ml 0 4 mol l hclo4 solution was added to 20 ml sludge sample the sample was then centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted ph was adjusted to 6 with 2 1 mol l k2hpo4 solution volumed up the sample with ultrapure water to 30 ml and resuspended the sample the sample was then centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant was filtered using a 0 22 μm nylon membrane pall usa and stored at 4 c the atp adp and amp ratio is functionally more important than the absolute concentration of atp different ratios have been used to test the metabolic pathways that produce and consume atp adenylate energy charge aec was used to describe the energy status of cells atkinson 1968 defined as 5 a c e a t p 0 5 a d p a t p a d p a m p the aec is a scalar index ranging between 0 and 1 when the entire adenine nucleotide pool is in the form of amp the energy charge aec is 0 and the system is completely discharged zero concentrations of atp and adp with only adp the energy charge is 0 5 if the entire adenine nucleotide pool is in the form of atp the aec is 1 2 7 kinetic parameters measurement the yield coefficient of heterotrophic biomass yh specific decay rate of heterotrophs bh maximum specific growth rate of heterotrophs µh is estimated from respirometric experiments using naac as a substrate novák et al 1994 the half saturation coefficient for the autotrophic biomass knh can be evaluated by the infinite dilution procedure of williamson and mccarty 1975 the half saturation coefficient ks of heterotrophic biomass was assessed based on the respirometric method similar to the ammonia half saturation coefficient thus the maintenance coefficient m was calculated with the following equation 6 ds dt μ y m x where ds dt is the consumption rate of the substrate and x is the biomass concentration 2 8 high throughput 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing dna was extracted from the raw sludge slime lb eps and tb eps extracted sediment samples which were stored at 80 c total community genomic dna extraction was performed using a e z n a soil dna kit omega usa following the manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the dna was measured using a qubit 2 0 life usa to ensure that adequate amounts of high quality genomic dna had been extracted amplicon libraries were constructed by illumina miseq 2000 using bacterial universal primers 341 f 50 cctacgggnggcwgcag 30 and 805 r 50 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 30 for the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene both forward and reverse primers were added with a barcode the reaction was set up as follows microbial dna 10 ng μl 2 μl amplicon pcr forward primer 10 μm 1 μl amplicon pcr reverse primer 10 μm 1 μl 2x kapa hifi hot start ready mix 15 μl total 30 μl pcr was performed in a thermal cycler applied biosystems 9700 usa using the following program 1 cycle of denaturing at 95 c for 3 min first 5 cycles of denaturing at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 45 c for 30 s elongation at 72 c for 30 s then 20 cycles of denaturing at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s elongation at 72 c for 30 s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min the pcr products were checked using electrophoresis in 1 w v agarose gels in tbe buffer tris boric acid edta stained with ethidium bromide eb and visualized under uv light pcr amplification pcr product purification and quantification sequencing using the illumina miseq platform at shanghai sangon biotech co ltd and data analysis was carried out according to yang et al 2015 2 9 other physical properties of the sludge and liquid phase constituents ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n svi and mlss vss were measured according to the standard methods apha 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the stratified eps and the residual sludge lb eps exhibited high protein and polysaccharides concentrations fig 2 a which was in line with the reported data xing et al 2022 the cer method employed in this study well separated various organic compounds with fluorescents from the sludge fig 2b d and 3d eem revealed that humic acid ha like substances predominated in slime fig 2b these humic acid like substances could neither be classified into protein pn nor polysaccharide ps as pn ps and ha were the three most abundant contents of eps the total eps concentration was defined as the sum of the three contents wang et al 2020 fig 2a on the other hand lb eps and tb eps are mainly composed of soluble microbial by product and aromatic protein fig 2c d showing that tb eps and lb eps were chemically similar to each other but distinct from the slime results of the particle size distribution psd analyses is shown in fig 3 detailed explanatory data of the fig 3 is summarized in table s1 including the mean diameter of area distribution ma and the mean diameter of the volume distribution mv the ma values are less sensitive to changes in the number of coarse particles in distribution while the mv values are strongly influenced by changes in amount of large particles in the distribution a weak centrifugal force of 1600g for slime extraction broke the flocs into smaller particles fig 3a b as the ma value decreased from 22 92 to 10 18 μm table s1 the ultrasonic cyto dispersion for lb eps extraction further lowered the ma value to 7 37 μm but the strong centrifugation for tb eps extraction only had mild affection as the ma value slightly decreased to 7 08 μm table s1 and the same conclusion could be drawn from fig 3b d however all the extracted samples had larger mv values than the raw sludge sample mv increased from 42 40 to 66 94 μm as slime was extracted table s1 thus indicated the formation of larger particles the increased large particle number was considered to be induced by re flocculation as centrifugal forced was applied to the sample wang et al 2019 minor changes in mv were observed after lb eps and tb eps extraction table s1 implying that the large particles were not greatly affected by lb eps and tb eps extraction the fractal dimension decreased in the sequence of slime lb eps and tb eps extracted sludge fig 3e the successive reduction of fractal dimension indicated that the stratified eps compacted the flocs layer by layer li et al 2020 wu et al 2021 such results demonstrated that all the stratified eps layers were vital for the compactness and matureness of flocs this phenomenon has also been reported by other researchers wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 despite changes in compactness neither lb eps nor tb eps affected the size of flocs as indicated by a negligible change in their psd in contrast the readily removed slime triggered a sudden decrease in psd suggesting that the pellets were incipient flocs and the slime linked or entangled them together to form mature flocs while the bounded lb eps and tb eps coated on the surface of pellets the above mentioned observation is also supported by the reported evidence that eps free pellets formed granules faster than conventional flocs yu et al 2009 as slime could readily link these incipient flocs yuan et al 2014 followed by lb eps and tb eps compacting to further verify these findings the bacteria cell size in the residual sludge and the extracted eps was examined with fcm figs 4 and s2 and the corresponding values were listed in table s2 all sludge residues shared similar size distribution as either size range of 50 150 or 150 350 predominated closely followed by the next major fraction fig 4a and table s2 a therefore extraction of different eps negligibly affected such distribution it was also confirmed that the major fraction of residual sludge was the pellets which exhibited similar large cell size fig 4a while the linked slime or the coated bounded eps encapsulated small bacteria fig 4b to conclude slime is vital to form mature flocs and all eps including lb eps and tb eps can compact flocs by encapsulating small bacteria 3 2 effect of eps extraction on sludge bioactivity the aerobic bioactivities described by the respirogram show that all the respiration rates decreased after the successive eps extractions especially lb eps and tb eps extraction with ultrasonic cyto dispersion table 1 when atp and aec were used to describe the activity and growth status of bacteria slime extraction significantly affected the activity of residual sludge resulting in the lowest aec and atp values in contrast aec and atp suggest that bacteria in pellets grew well very close to that in the raw sludge the conflicting results of the respirogram and adenine nucleotide pool of the pellet can be ascribed to the fact that the respirogram measures bacterial metabolic activity via oxygen depletion rates which is only valid for aerobes while the adenine nucleotide pool is a suitable measure for metabolic activity for most microbes these findings suggest therefore that while aerobic processes occur mainly on the outside of flocs the inner side of the pellet is also metabolically active to further confirm the metabolic activity of pellets total and live cell counting were also performed using fcm a considerable number of live cells were detected in the pellets fig 5 a which was in line with aec and atp values table 1 the difference between lb eps extracted sludge and pellets reflects the function of tb eps encapsulated matter including bacteria the tb eps encapsulated bacteria is very limited fig 5b however the residual pellets of tb eps extraction pellets exhibited obvious distinctions from lb eps extracted sludge fig 5 for example levels of adenylates atp adp and amp table 1 rsg signal intensity and cell density were all increased fig 5a c therefore the tb eps includes suppression inducing matter that inhibited bioactivity in other word the bioactivity was locked by this matter and release of this matter led to recovery however this suppression inducing matter did not affect the aerobic process as the respirogram did not recover after lb eps extraction table 1 nonetheless both lb eps and tb eps extraction triggered significant decreases of endogenous respiration rates soure table 1 and brought about significant decay phases fig 6 the aerobic biomass fraction was calculated assuming that the biomass was proportional to the autotrophic heterotrophic and total respiration rates li et al 2019 it shows that slime encapsulated a major fraction 50 of aerobic heterotrophic biomass while lb eps encapsulated a considerable amount 52 of aerobic autotrophic nitrifying biomass fig 7 this is a significant finding for the aerobic operation of wwtps as aerobic units are still the major parts of the current activated sludge configuration to meet the satisfied discharge standards 3 3 kinetics and community composition of eps extracted sludge slime extraction significantly decreased the ammonia nitrogen nh4 n affinity knh but had little effect on organic affinity ks table 2 the decreased knh was consistent with the finding from respirogram results that slime encapsulated heterotrophs and lb eps encapsulated nitrifiers this encapsulation structure agreed well with the direct visual spatial observations using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish results i e both ammonia and nitrite oxidizers were found to be more abundant in the outer layers slime and lb eps winkler et al 2013 the extraction of slime and consequently removal of 50 of the heterotrophic biomass favored the autotrophic biomass 52 in lb eps capsule fig 7 however this was not true for the organic substrate affinity ks the discrepancy between knh and ks can be ascribed to the fact that nitrifiers are obligate aerobes while organic matter removal organisms are facultative aerobes in addition endogenous respiration specific growth rate and maintenance coefficient were all decreased which may be ascribed to the predominance of nitrifiers this evidence again supports the finding that slime encapsulates heterotrophs and lb eps encapsulates autotrophic nitrifiers as heterotrophs generally grow faster than autotrophs esquivel rios et al 2014 therefore slime hindered nitrification and the extraction of slime may encourage nitrification both lb eps and tb eps extraction led to a significant increase in endogenous respiration or decay rates in terms of bh and kd table 2 which is in line with the growth curves fig 6 these endogenous rates differed from the endogenous rates measured in respirogram space as the former measures the loss in cell mass due to oxidation of internal storage products to produce energy for cell maintenance cell death or predation and the latter shows the oxygen utilized for such endogenous processes also the maintenance coefficient was also increased for lb extracted sludge and tb extracted pellets comparing to the raw and slime extracted sludge since a low maintenance coefficient indicates that more energy is used for growth von stockar et al 2006 the increase in maintenance coefficient suggests none growth activity predominated in the lb eps and tb eps encapsulated sludge although the number of tb eps encapsulated bacteria was relatively limited they significantly affected the metabolism of the sludge generating a higher maintenance coefficient m and energy dispersion index m μ calabrese et al 2021 heat generation is one of the outcomes of energy dispersion calabrese et al 2021 frank 2020 both the small volume of flocs and the high thermal capacity of water make it hard to detect small temperature gradients across flocs however the accumulated effect of temperature gradient can be indirectly evaluated by the variations of bacterial community composition which correlate with seasonal temperature variations griffin and wells 2017 various factors could affect the composition of the bacteria community including do and influent however for a given wwtp the operational do and influent quality vary within a narrow range in different seasons wei et al 2018 making the temperature to be a controlling factor of the bacteria community variation in different seasons numberger et al 2019 wu et al 2019 even though the temperature difference between summer and winter in a plant was much larger than the temperature spatial difference across the floc structure the variation in bacteria community distribution between pellets and slime extracted sludge fig 8 shared similar pattern with the variation from summer to winter in a same plant wang et al 2016 specifically the composition of pellets was similar to the sample taken during hot summer while the outside slime eps extracted sludge was similar to those in cold winter for example the proteobacteria were high in both pellets and samples during summer while the bacteroidetes were high in outside slime extracted sludge and samples during winter wang et al 2016 the fraction of the proteobacteria gradually increased from 32 78 to 41 37 approaching to the core pellet of the floc which is in line with the reported evidence that proteobacteria abundance increased at a high temperature jia et al 2018 lindström et al 2005 concerning the bounded eps extraction of the outer lb eps resulted in a low fraction of bacteroidetes fraction 14 64 and a high planctomycetes fraction 8 83 fig 8 which may be attributed to lower temperatures jia et al 2018 luo et al 2020 the stratified distribution of bacteria at the phylum level suggests that temperature gradient might exist across the floc as some bacteria was sensitive to small temperature gradient yoney and salman 2015 despite direct evidence of the gradient existence is highly desired in the future our results suggest that the pellet was slightly hotter than the slime extracted sludge in fact heat generation from the core of an aggregate as an ecosystem is very common tabata et al 2013 for example in biofilms some of the observed spatial variation in gene expression between cells may associate with internal heat production and internal cells are more likely to generate excess heat frank 2020 however it should be noted that even though the pellets were metabolically active and hotter than the other parts of flocs the energy dispersion index m μ was very close to that of the raw sludge table 2 and lb eps extracted sludge was higher than tb eps extracted pellets it can be assumed that inner environmental advantages allow for heat accumulation resulting in an increase of maximum specific heterotroph growth rate and yield rate table 2 alternatively the removal of tb eps encapsulated suppression inducing matter resulting in pellets could lift growth suppression at the cost of high maintenance coefficient 3 4 implication of eps bacteria encapsulation and energy dispersion slime heterotroph encapsulation is a barrier for nitrification as discussed above in addition the tryptophan like protein in lb eps and tb eps was related to nitrogen removal hou et al 2022 which was observed mainly in the lb eps and tb eps but only negligibly in the slime fig 2 in addition nitrospirae that contain nitrifying taxa which oxidize nitrite to nitrate daims et al 2001 particularly commamox bacteria nitrospira inopinata daims et al 2015 predominated in the inner layer of flocs fig 8 therefore the outer layer of flocs inhibited nitrification and removal of the slime barrier encourages nitrification in addition removal of slime resulted in the breakage of flocs fig 3 which also exposed the nitrifiers to a favorable environment such as readily obtainable oxygen this may explain why the respirogram suggested that the lb eps mainly encapsulated autotrophic nitrifiers fig 7 another strategy which involves crushing large granules is reported to improve nitrification capacity due to a larger aerobic zone fraction nguyen quoc et al 2021 our study suggests that removal of slime results in breakage of flocs which is a practical alternative for enhancing nitrification pellets have been considered as the incipient flocs they exhibited the highest growth rate the highest atp level table 1 the highest cell concentration and a normal dead cell to total cell ratio fig 5a despite having minimal aerobic respiration rates this conflicts with previously reported results that bacteria in pellets are dead or even mineralized mcswain et al 2005 wu et al 2021 xue et al 2022 instead our results show that tb eps encapsulated suppression inducing matter locked the bioactivity the pellets resulting from tb eps extraction exhibited the highest maintenance coefficient and highest endogenous respiration rate table 2 suggesting that a considerable fraction of substrate was used for none growth related metabolism including energy dispersion by heat calabrese et al 2021 and suppression recovery kempes et al 2017 this increased heat dispersion was further supported by a bacteria distribution fig 8 similar to samples taken during hot summer wang et al 2016 two possible beneficial applications can be considered with such residues pellets returned to the reactors one is the potential for sludge reduction which is also supported by the decreased yield coefficient yh table 2 the other is thermogenesis for heat recovery under all scenarios lb eps removal has advantages the lowest yield rate means the lowest sludge production and the highest energy dispersion index means the highest metabolic heat generation based on the above findings a new process configuration is proposed to enhance the nitrification performance facilitate the eps recovery and heat recovery and realize sludge reduction fig 9 similar to the common practice for sludge reduction meng et al 2016 salehiziri et al 2019 sidestream eps extraction reactor will be included in the proposed configuration two lines can be selected according to the desired aims in this process one is the extraction of slime that enhances the nitrification performance with humic acid like eps recovery for which only weak centrifugation is required the other is the extraction of lb eps that reduces the sludge production and increases heat generation for which both ultrasonic cyto dispersion and strong centrifugation should be utilized as mentioned in section 3 1 the extraction of eps would break the integrity of the flocs structure raising concerns about impacts on the activated sludge settleability and effluent quality in fact sidestream processes have been widely used in the biological wastewater treatment particular process such as sludge ozonation even destroys the cell structure completely meng et al 2016 salehiziri et al 2019 in these cases the sludge interchange ratio sir or ir the volume or quantity ratio of sludge returned from the sidestream reactor into the mainstream bioreactors is a controllable design parameter with proper set up the sidestream treatment process could have positive effects on the mainstream treatment meng et al 2016 salehiziri et al 2019 nonetheless it was reported that with lb eps extracted the bio aggregates in the returning sludge to the aeration tank could grow bigger easier since the tb eps was the main driver of sludge granulation because of its increasing adsorption on sludge cells and promoting cells aggregation wang et al 2021 hence it can be expected that the sidestream eps extraction would not affect the settleability of mainstream activated sludge if the sir could be properly controlled in summary this work revealed the possibility of sidestream eps extraction process to realize resource recovery and performance enhancement however the proposed process in this study warrants further investigations particularly via long term field data 4 conclusion the dispersed slime is very important for the morphology of flocs removal of slime results in breakage of flocs thereby favoring nitrification performance due to the removal of outer side heterotrophic bacteria thus exposing nitrifiers to favorable conditions the bounded tb eps and lb eps encapsulated bacteria play an important role in compactness of flocs pollutant removal and heat generation lb eps encapsulated nitrifiers and removal of lb eps exhibited high energy dispersion for generating metabolic heat pellets resulting from further removal of tb eps were proved to be metabolically active with a high maintenance coefficient these might then be predicted to be hotter than the outside of flocs these findings suggest that returning the sludge after either slime or lb eps extraction is significant for performance enhancement eps recovery and heat recovery a novel process configuration for such purposes consists of either slime extraction to enhance the nitrification performance or lb eps extraction to reduce the sludge

15845,simultaneous recovery of biopolymers and enhanced bio reactor performance are promising options for sustainable wastewater treatment and the bioactivity of sludge after biopolymer extraction is thus critical for the performance of the system to this end stratified extracellular polymeric substances eps including slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted and the bioactivities of the consequent extraction residues were assessed using aerobic respirogram kinetic and flow cytometry fcm after the initial weak extraction of slime the particle size distribution of the sludge significantly decreased and subsequent extractions of lb eps and tb eps produced an equivalent size distribution in contrast the fractal dimension decreased after each extraction suggesting that lb eps and tb eps affected the compactness of flocs rather than the size the aerobic bacteria distribution estimated using respirogram shows that slime mainly encapsulated heterotrophs while lb eps mainly encapsulated nitrifiers in addition the ammonia nitrogen affinity coefficient decreased from 1 79 to 0 28 mg l when slime was removed thereby encouraging the activities of autotrophic nitrifiers further removal of lb eps induced high energy dispersion as the maintenance coefficient m and the metabolic dispersion index μ m increased from 0 11 to 0 22 and 0 44 to 0 63 respectively meanwhile the yield rate decreased from 0 77 to 0 66 although pellets that resulted from tb eps extraction were not aerobically active as described by respirogram and growth curves they were still metabolically active as measured by live dead cell counting and redox sensor green signal these pellets used more energy for maintenance as indicated by the high maintenance coefficient than those residual after either slime or lb eps extraction in addition the variation in bacteria community distribution across flocs was related to the variation in temperatures suggesting that the inner part of a floc might be hotter than the outer side therefore compared to bacteria in the raw sludge the viable bacteria bounded in lb eps and tb eps convert more energy to heat rather than growth these results indicate that energy was dispersed as metabolic heat for the lb eps extracted sludge and removal of lb eps favored thermogenesis and sludge reduction based on the above findings a simultaneously eps recovery and performance enhancement configuration is thus proposed which holds great promise for the integration of next generation wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stratified eps floc compactness bacterial encapsulation energy dispersion thermogenesis 1 introduction extracellular polymeric substances eps play an essential role in the formation process of bio aggregates biofilm floc and granule siddharth et al 2021 as revealed by previous studies eps are macromolecules with highly diverse chemical composition and structure related to bacterial species and growth conditions mainly composed of polysaccharides ps proteins pn lipids and extracellular dna edna flemming and wingender 2010 additionally fatty acids nucleic acids humic acids amino acids and other molecules are present in smaller amounts due to their varied physicochemical properties eps is applied in many industry sectors e g food paper textile biotechnological pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries casillo et al 2018 xiao and zheng 2016 furthermore eps can be used for medical purposes as they exhibit many biomedical properties antimicrobial anti tumor anti inflammation or antioxidative activity delattre et al 2016 xiao and zheng 2016 therefore recovery eps from wastewater has been an attractive target in wastewater treatment plants despite eps extraction from excess sludge having been widely considered the focus has largely been placed on extracted eps with post extraction residual sludge frequently disposed of as waste cao et al 2021 li et al 2021 yet returning the extracted sludge to the biological system is encouraging in some cases if the bioactivity of the residual sludge is acceptable for example crushing big granules into smaller ones could enhance nitrification by extending the aerobic zone nguyen quoc et al 2021 and releasing carbon sources from the broken sludge into a hydro cyclone system could enhance denitrification xu et al 2019 returning the extracted sludge into the bioreactor systems can promote both performance enhancement and eps recovery however little information on the effect of extraction on bioactivity is available for such purposes although eps constituents depend on influent types operational conditions and extraction procedures pellicer nacher et al 2013 seviour et al 2019 the eps stratification theory based on bound strength has been widely recognized namely dispersed slime loosely bound lb and tightly bound tb eps guo et al 2020 yu et al 2008 the inner layered tb eps promotes microbial aggregation and the surface layered slime forms the gel network to link the incipient flocs together these two components are closely related to floc morphology jia et al 2017 while slime and lb eps could influence sludge flocculation and dewaterability yu et al 2008 recently the generation and consumption mechanism of both tb eps and lb eps has been mathematically described xing et al 2022 however the effect of the eps extraction on the residual sludge is still unclear in other words more attention has been paid to eps itself rather than the residual sludge when the residual sludge is designated to return to bioreactors we must understand its characteristics for better process operation performance enhancement and eps recovery thus in this study eps were successively extracted to assess the residual sludge of each extraction by evaluating the effect of each extraction procedure on the residual sludge bioactivity the role of slime lb eps and tb eps can be clarified with this knowledge a new process configuration is proposed to realize performance enhancement and biopolymer recovery simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sampling and characterization the activated sludge used for analysis in this research was taken from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp that operates with an anaerobic anoxic oxic process aao configuration with a capacity of 500 000 m3 day to ensure the validity and reproducibility of the results the raw sludge sampling was done at least four times with an interval of 3 4 days in 15 days the trends observed in this study were based on multiple samples on different dates all the activated sludge was sampled from the returning sludge from the sedimentation tank to the anaerobic tank after transporting the sludge back to the lab all the sludge samples were screened with 1 mm pore sieve the sludge flocs appeared yellow brown and with normal settleability as the sludge volume index svi was 76 2 28 ml g 1 mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the sampled raw sludge was determined to be as follows mlss 11427 96 mg l 1 the volatile suspended solids vss ratio vss mlss 0 64 0 02 2 2 eps extraction and analysis the total eps was stratified into three fractions slime lb eps and tb eps according to the extraction strength yu et al 2008 the extraction procedures are shown in fig 1 and the centrifugal force for slime extraction has been carefully selected to avoid the overlap between slime and lb eps as described in text s1 of the supplementary information si firstly the raw sludge of 10 ml was filled to 30 ml with pbs ph 7 2 in a centrifugation tube and centrifuged at 1600g at 4 c for 5 min the collected supernatant was defined as slime the easily removed part of eps by weak centrifugation the sediment was resuspended to 30 ml using pbs and then centrifuged at 1600g at 4 c for 5 min the supernatant was decanted and sediment resuspended to 30 ml with pbs followed by 8 min 5w 20 khz ultrasonication for cyto dispersion with an ultrasonic cyto dispersion equipment jy96 iin huxi shanghai china resulted a sonication intensity es of 80 kj l 1 as a complete disaggregation of activated flocs requires sonication intensity around 80 kj l 1 foladori et al 2007 then the sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 10000g at 4 c the bulk solution and the residual sediment were collected separately the organic matter in the bulk solution was designated to be the lb eps fraction the residual sediment was resuspended in pbs again to the original volume of 30 ml as recommended by durmaz and sanin 2001 70g gss cer was applied for eps extraction as such dosage is optimistic to extract the polymer while maintaining bioactivity as much as possible and the jar test apparatus was ice water bathed for 2 h with 200 rpm stirring subsequently the sample was centrifuged at 10000g at 4 c for 30 min the resulting sediment was defined as the pellet then the supernatant was centrifuged at 10000g at 4 c for 15 min three times the final product was defined as tb eps with such procedures slime slime extracted sludge lb eps lb eps extracted sludge tb eps and

floc size was measured with a laser particle size distribution analyzer ls230 svm beckman usa with a detection range of 0 04 to 2000 μm both the mean diameter of area distribution ma and the mean diameter of the volume distribution mv could be obtained using the equipment software microscope photos of 20 times magnification were taken by a nikon eclipse 50i equipped with a digital camera nikon japan all images were processed with image j software schneider et al 2012 the fractal dimension was calculated using the box counting method the images were firstly binarized then analyzed with the

demonstrate cell vitality baert et al 2016 the supernatant obtained from raw sludge slime lb eps and tb eps samples was diluted 150 fold with pbs before staining the raw sludge slime lb eps and tb eps extracted sediment samples were diluted 6000 fold before staining to ensure that the real time counting by the instrument was less than 1000 cells s 1 all the sediment samples were dispersed with 20 hz 4 5 w ultrasonication for 5 min with an ultrasonic cyto dispersion equipment jy96 iin huxi shanghai china to ensure the cells were separated after filtration with 0 22 μm nylon membrane pall usa dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was used as a solvent to dilute the sgi standard stock solution for 10000 fold next 297 μl of bacterial solution and 3 μl of the diluted sgi solution were added to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and then stained for 15 min at 35 c in the dark for rsg staining 0 3 μl rsg dye was added to 299 7 μl bacteria sample and then stained for 10 min at 37 c in dark after staining the samples were rapidly measured by a bd accuri c6 bd bioscience belgium with dual laser of fixed wavelength 488 and 640 nm fluorescent signals were collected at fl1 equal to 530 nm and fl3 exceeding 670 nm as well as the lateral and forward scattered light intensities the measurements were conducted with a flow rate of 33 ml min 1 the acquired data was processed by bd accuri cflow software and a threshold of 1000 was applied to the green fluorescent channel fl1 to eliminate positive signals of the instrument and sample background each analysis was performed in triplicate and the electronic gates setting of the instrument was kept the same to ensure the comparability of data 2 5 respirogram determination growth curve measurement and the heterotrophic autotrophic biomass quantification to achieve accurate bioactivity assessments respirogram was employed as it precisely describes the respiration rates of different types of bacteria when different experimental conditions are provided li et al 2019 the manually measured respiration rates were as follows the site respiration rate sours for the raw mixed liquid of the sample the quasi endogenous respiration rate sourq after the raw sludge being washed 3 times the endogenous respiration rate soure without external substrates the maximum respiratory rate sourt with sufficient substrates the respiration rate of autotrophic bacteria soura measured with atu and naclo3 to depress the ammonium nh4 n and nitrite no2 n oxidation and heterotrophic bacteria respiration rate sourh stimulated by nitrogen and carbon source respectively all the our values were calculated with originpro originlab corporation usa then the specific oxygen consumption rate sour values were calculated in accordance with the respective our values with the following equation 2 s o u r o u r m l s s where the unit of our is mg o2 l 1 h 1 sour is the specific oxygen utilization rate mg o2 gss 1 h 1 the standard error of the calculated sour and lnour values growth curve plotting were calculated according to the procedures descripted text s2 in si the maximum respiration rate based max m method from li et al 2019 was applied to quantify the heterotrophic autotrophic biomass for example the heterotrophic biomass concentrations xh in the extracted sludge samples were calculated with the equation below 3 x h 1000 o u r h s o u r m a x f c v where empirical coefficient sourmax is the maximum specific our of xh assumed as 150 mg o2 gvss 1 h 1 and fcv takes the value of 1 42 gcod gvss 1 li et al 2019 similarly the autotrophic biomass concentration xa and the total biomass concentration xt could be calculated afterwards the heterotrophic biomass concentrations in the stratified layers of the flocs could be calculated as below 4 1 x h s l i m e x h r a w s l u d g e x h s l i m e e x t r a c t e d 4 2 x h l b e p s x h s l i m e e x t r a c t e d x h l b e p s e x t r a c t e d 4 3 x h tb eps x h lb eps extracted x h pellet where xh raw sludge is the heterotrophic biomass concentration in raw sludge xh slime extracted is the heterotrophic biomass concentration in slime extracted sludge xh slime is the heterotrophic biomass concentration in slime all items in eqs 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 were named in this fashion the autotrophic biomass concentrations were calculated in a similar manner with xa values 2 6 adenine nucleotides determination with uhplc and the aec calculation simultaneous analytical determination of atp adenosine triphosphate adp adenosine diphosphate and amp adenosine monophosphate were measured using ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc ultimate3000 thermo fisher scientific usa accucore aq hplc column length 100 mm diameter 4 6 mm particle size 2 6 μm from thermo scientific was used to identify and quantify adenine nucleotides atp adp and amp the mobile phase buffer and standards were prepared according to menegollo et al 2019 for nucleotide extraction 5 ml 0 4 mol l hclo4 solution was added to 20 ml sludge sample the sample was then centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted ph was adjusted to 6 with 2 1 mol l k2hpo4 solution volumed up the sample with ultrapure water to 30 ml and resuspended the sample the sample was then centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant was filtered using a 0 22 μm nylon membrane pall usa and stored at 4 c the atp adp and amp ratio is functionally more important than the absolute concentration of atp different ratios have been used to test the metabolic pathways that produce and consume atp adenylate energy charge aec was used to describe the energy status of cells atkinson 1968 defined as 5 a c e a t p 0 5 a d p a t p a d p a m p the aec is a scalar index ranging between 0 and 1 when the entire adenine nucleotide pool is in the form of amp the energy charge aec is 0 and the system is completely discharged zero concentrations of atp and adp with only adp the energy charge is 0 5 if the entire adenine nucleotide pool is in the form of atp the aec is 1 2 7 kinetic parameters measurement the yield coefficient of heterotrophic biomass yh specific decay rate of heterotrophs bh maximum specific growth rate of heterotrophs µh is estimated from respirometric experiments using naac as a substrate novák et al 1994 the half saturation coefficient for the autotrophic biomass knh can be evaluated by the infinite dilution procedure of williamson and mccarty 1975 the half saturation coefficient ks of heterotrophic biomass was assessed based on the respirometric method similar to the ammonia half saturation coefficient thus the maintenance coefficient m was calculated with the following equation 6 ds dt μ y m x where ds dt is the consumption rate of the substrate and x is the biomass concentration 2 8 high throughput 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing dna was extracted from the raw sludge slime lb eps and tb eps extracted sediment samples which were stored at 80 c total community genomic dna extraction was performed using a e z n a soil dna kit omega usa following the manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the dna was measured using a qubit 2 0 life usa to ensure that adequate amounts of high quality genomic dna had been extracted amplicon libraries were constructed by illumina miseq 2000 using bacterial universal primers 341 f 50 cctacgggnggcwgcag 30 and 805 r 50 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 30 for the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene both forward and reverse primers were added with a barcode the reaction was set up as follows

illumina miseq platform at shanghai sangon biotech co ltd and data analysis was carried out according to yang et al 2015 2 9 other physical properties of the sludge and liquid phase constituents ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n svi and mlss vss were measured according to the standard methods apha 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the stratified eps and the residual sludge lb eps exhibited high protein and polysaccharides concentrations fig 2 a which was in line with the reported data xing et al 2022 the cer method employed in this study well separated various organic compounds with fluorescents from the sludge fig 2b d and 3d eem revealed that humic acid ha like substances predominated in slime fig 2b these humic acid like substances could neither be classified into protein pn nor polysaccharide ps as pn ps and ha were the three most abundant contents of eps the total eps concentration was defined as the sum of the three contents wang et al 2020 fig 2a on the other hand lb eps and tb eps are mainly composed of soluble microbial by product and aromatic protein fig 2c d showing that tb eps and lb eps were chemically similar to each other but distinct from the slime results of the particle size distribution psd analyses is shown in fig 3 detailed explanatory data of the fig 3 is summarized in table s1 including the mean diameter of area distribution ma and the mean diameter of the volume distribution mv the ma values are less sensitive to changes in the number of coarse particles in distribution while the mv values are strongly influenced by changes in amount of large particles in the distribution a weak centrifugal force of 1600g for slime extraction broke the flocs into smaller particles fig 3a b as the ma value decreased from 22 92 to 10 18 μm table s1 the ultrasonic cyto dispersion for lb eps extraction further lowered the ma value to 7 37 μm but the strong centrifugation for tb eps extraction only had mild affection as the ma value slightly decreased to 7 08 μm table s1 and the same conclusion could be drawn from fig 3b d however all the extracted samples had larger mv values than the raw sludge sample mv increased from 42 40 to 66 94 μm as slime was extracted table s1 thus indicated the formation of larger particles the increased large particle number was considered to be induced by re flocculation as centrifugal forced was applied to the sample wang et al 2019 minor changes in mv were observed after lb eps and tb eps extraction table s1 implying that the large particles were not greatly affected by lb eps and tb eps extraction the fractal dimension decreased in the sequence of slime lb eps and tb eps extracted sludge fig 3e the successive reduction of fractal dimension indicated that the stratified eps compacted the flocs layer by layer li et al 2020 wu et al 2021 such results demonstrated that all the stratified eps layers were vital for the compactness and matureness of flocs this phenomenon has also been reported by other researchers wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 despite changes in compactness neither lb eps nor tb eps affected the size of flocs as indicated by a negligible change in their psd in contrast the readily removed slime triggered a sudden decrease in psd suggesting that the pellets were incipient flocs and the slime linked or entangled them together to form mature flocs while the bounded lb eps and tb eps coated on the surface of pellets the above mentioned observation is also supported by the reported evidence that eps free pellets formed granules faster than conventional flocs yu et al 2009 as slime could readily link these incipient flocs yuan et al 2014 followed by lb eps and tb eps compacting to further verify these findings the bacteria cell size in the residual sludge and the extracted eps was examined with fcm figs 4 and s2 and the corresponding values were listed in table s2 all sludge residues shared similar size distribution as either size range of 50 150 or 150 350 predominated closely followed by the next major fraction fig 4a and table s2 a therefore extraction of different eps negligibly affected such distribution it was also confirmed that the major fraction of residual sludge was the pellets which exhibited similar large cell size fig 4a while the linked slime or the coated bounded eps encapsulated small bacteria fig 4b to conclude slime is vital to form mature flocs and all eps including lb eps and tb eps can compact flocs by encapsulating small bacteria 3 2 effect of eps extraction on sludge bioactivity the aerobic bioactivities described by the respirogram show that all the respiration rates decreased after the successive eps extractions especially lb eps and tb eps extraction with ultrasonic cyto dispersion table 1 when atp and aec were used to describe the activity and growth status of bacteria slime extraction significantly affected the activity of residual sludge resulting in the lowest aec and atp values in contrast aec and atp suggest that bacteria in pellets grew well very close to that in the raw sludge the conflicting results of the respirogram and adenine nucleotide pool of the pellet can be ascribed to the fact that the respirogram measures bacterial metabolic activity via oxygen depletion rates which is only valid for aerobes while the adenine nucleotide pool is a suitable measure for metabolic activity for most microbes these findings suggest therefore that while aerobic processes occur mainly on the outside of flocs the inner side of the pellet is also metabolically active to further confirm the metabolic activity of pellets total and live cell counting were also performed using fcm a considerable number of live cells were detected in the pellets fig 5 a which was in line with aec and atp values table 1 the difference between lb eps extracted sludge and pellets reflects the function of tb eps encapsulated matter including bacteria the tb eps encapsulated bacteria is very limited fig 5b however the residual pellets of tb eps extraction pellets exhibited obvious distinctions from lb eps extracted sludge fig 5 for example levels of adenylates atp adp and amp table 1 rsg signal intensity and cell density were all increased fig 5a c therefore the tb eps includes suppression inducing matter that inhibited bioactivity in other word the bioactivity was locked by this matter and release of this matter led to recovery however this suppression inducing matter did not affect the aerobic process as the respirogram did not recover after lb eps extraction table 1 nonetheless both lb eps and tb eps extraction triggered significant decreases of endogenous respiration rates soure table 1 and brought about significant decay phases fig 6 the aerobic biomass fraction was calculated assuming that the biomass was proportional to the autotrophic heterotrophic and total respiration rates li et al 2019 it shows that slime encapsulated a major fraction 50 of aerobic heterotrophic biomass while lb eps encapsulated a considerable amount 52 of aerobic autotrophic nitrifying biomass fig 7 this is a significant finding for the aerobic operation of wwtps as aerobic units are still the major parts of the current activated sludge configuration to meet the satisfied discharge standards 3 3 kinetics and community composition of eps extracted sludge slime extraction significantly decreased the ammonia nitrogen nh4 n affinity knh but had little effect on organic affinity ks table 2 the decreased knh was consistent with the finding from respirogram results that slime encapsulated heterotrophs and lb eps encapsulated nitrifiers this encapsulation structure agreed well with the direct visual spatial observations using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish results i e both ammonia and nitrite oxidizers were found to be more abundant in the outer layers slime and lb eps winkler et al 2013 the extraction of slime and consequently removal of 50 of the heterotrophic biomass favored the autotrophic biomass 52 in lb eps capsule fig 7 however this was not true for the organic substrate affinity ks the discrepancy between knh and ks can be ascribed to the fact that nitrifiers are obligate aerobes while organic matter removal organisms are facultative aerobes in addition endogenous respiration specific growth rate and maintenance coefficient were all decreased which may be ascribed to the predominance of nitrifiers this evidence again supports the finding that slime encapsulates heterotrophs and lb eps encapsulates autotrophic nitrifiers as heterotrophs generally grow faster than autotrophs esquivel rios et al 2014 therefore slime hindered nitrification and the extraction of slime may encourage nitrification both lb eps and tb eps extraction led to a significant increase in endogenous respiration or decay rates in terms of bh and kd table 2 which is in line with the growth curves fig 6 these endogenous rates differed from the endogenous rates measured in respirogram space as the former measures the loss in cell mass due to oxidation of internal storage products to produce energy for cell maintenance cell death or predation and the latter shows the oxygen utilized for such endogenous processes also the maintenance coefficient was also increased for lb extracted sludge and tb extracted pellets comparing to the raw and slime extracted sludge since a low maintenance coefficient indicates that more energy is used for growth von stockar et al 2006 the increase in maintenance coefficient suggests none growth activity predominated in the lb eps and tb eps encapsulated sludge although the number of tb eps encapsulated bacteria was relatively limited they significantly affected the metabolism of the sludge generating a higher maintenance coefficient m and energy dispersion index m μ calabrese et al 2021 heat generation is one of the outcomes of energy dispersion calabrese et al 2021 frank 2020 both the small volume of flocs and the high thermal capacity of water make it hard to detect small temperature gradients across flocs however the accumulated effect of temperature gradient can be indirectly evaluated by the variations of bacterial community composition which correlate with seasonal temperature variations griffin and wells 2017 various factors could affect the composition of the bacteria community including do and influent however for a given wwtp the operational do and influent quality vary within a narrow range in different seasons wei et al 2018 making the temperature to be a controlling factor of the bacteria community variation in different seasons numberger et al 2019 wu et al 2019 even though the temperature difference between summer and winter in a plant was much larger than the temperature spatial difference across the floc structure the variation in bacteria community distribution between pellets and slime extracted sludge fig 8 shared similar pattern with the variation from summer to winter in a same plant wang et al 2016 specifically the composition of pellets was similar to the sample taken during hot summer while the outside slime eps extracted sludge was similar to those in cold winter for example the proteobacteria were high in both pellets and samples during summer while the bacteroidetes were high in outside slime extracted sludge and samples during winter wang et al 2016 the fraction of the proteobacteria gradually increased from 32 78 to 41 37 approaching to the core pellet of the floc which is in line with the reported evidence that proteobacteria abundance increased at a high temperature jia et al 2018 lindström et al 2005 concerning the bounded eps extraction of the outer lb eps resulted in a low fraction of bacteroidetes fraction 14 64 and a high planctomycetes fraction 8 83 fig 8 which may be attributed to lower temperatures jia et al 2018 luo et al 2020 the stratified distribution of bacteria at the phylum level suggests that temperature gradient might exist across the floc as some bacteria was sensitive to small temperature gradient yoney and salman 2015 despite direct evidence of the gradient existence is highly desired in the future our results suggest that the pellet was slightly hotter than the slime extracted sludge in fact heat generation from the core of an aggregate as an ecosystem is very common tabata et al 2013 for example in biofilms some of the observed spatial variation in gene expression between cells may associate with internal heat production and internal cells are more likely to generate excess heat frank 2020 however it should be noted that even though the pellets were metabolically active and hotter than the other parts of flocs the energy dispersion index m μ was very close to that of the raw sludge table 2 and lb eps extracted sludge was higher than tb eps extracted pellets it can be assumed that inner environmental advantages allow for heat accumulation resulting in an increase of maximum specific heterotroph growth rate and yield rate table 2 alternatively the removal of tb eps encapsulated suppression inducing matter resulting in pellets could lift growth suppression at the cost of high maintenance coefficient 3 4 implication of eps bacteria encapsulation and energy dispersion slime heterotroph encapsulation is a barrier for nitrification as discussed above in addition the tryptophan like protein in lb eps and tb eps was related to nitrogen removal hou et al 2022 which was observed mainly in the lb eps and tb eps but only negligibly in the slime fig 2 in addition nitrospirae that contain nitrifying taxa which oxidize nitrite to nitrate daims et al 2001 particularly commamox bacteria nitrospira inopinata daims et al 2015 predominated in the inner layer of flocs fig 8 therefore the outer layer of flocs inhibited nitrification and removal of the slime barrier encourages nitrification in addition removal of slime resulted in the breakage of flocs fig 3 which also exposed the nitrifiers to a favorable environment such as readily obtainable oxygen this may explain why the respirogram suggested that the lb eps mainly encapsulated autotrophic nitrifiers fig 7 another strategy which involves crushing large granules is reported to improve nitrification capacity due to a larger aerobic zone fraction nguyen quoc et al 2021 our study suggests that removal of slime results in breakage of flocs which is a practical alternative for enhancing nitrification pellets have been considered as the incipient flocs they exhibited the highest growth rate the highest atp level table 1 the highest cell concentration and a normal dead cell to total cell ratio fig 5a despite having minimal aerobic respiration rates this conflicts with previously reported results that bacteria in pellets are dead or even mineralized mcswain et al 2005 wu et al 2021 xue et al 2022 instead our results show that tb eps encapsulated suppression inducing matter locked the bioactivity the pellets resulting from tb eps extraction exhibited the highest maintenance coefficient and highest endogenous respiration rate table 2 suggesting that a considerable fraction of substrate was used for none growth related metabolism including energy dispersion by heat calabrese et al 2021 and suppression recovery kempes et al 2017 this increased heat dispersion was further supported by a bacteria distribution fig 8 similar to samples taken during hot summer wang et al 2016 two possible beneficial applications can be considered with such residues pellets returned to the reactors one is the potential for sludge reduction which is also supported by the decreased yield coefficient yh table 2 the other is thermogenesis for heat recovery under all scenarios lb eps removal has advantages the lowest yield rate means the lowest sludge production and the highest energy dispersion index means the highest metabolic heat generation based on the above findings a new process configuration is proposed to enhance the nitrification performance facilitate the eps recovery and heat recovery and realize sludge reduction fig 9 similar to the common practice for sludge reduction meng et al 2016 salehiziri et al 2019 sidestream eps extraction reactor will be included in the proposed configuration two lines can be selected according to the desired aims in this process one is the extraction of slime that enhances the nitrification performance with humic acid like eps recovery for which only weak centrifugation is required the other is the extraction of lb eps that reduces the sludge production and increases heat generation for which both ultrasonic cyto dispersion and strong centrifugation should be utilized as mentioned in section 3 1 the extraction of eps would break the integrity of the flocs structure raising concerns about impacts on the activated sludge settleability and effluent quality in fact sidestream processes have been widely used in the biological wastewater treatment particular process such as sludge ozonation even destroys the cell structure completely meng et al 2016 salehiziri et al 2019 in these cases the sludge interchange ratio sir or ir the volume or quantity ratio of sludge returned from the sidestream reactor into the mainstream bioreactors is a controllable design parameter with proper set up the sidestream treatment process could have positive effects on the mainstream treatment meng et al 2016 salehiziri et al 2019 nonetheless it was reported that with lb eps extracted the bio aggregates in the returning sludge to the aeration tank could grow bigger easier since the tb eps was the main driver of sludge granulation because of its increasing adsorption on sludge cells and promoting cells aggregation wang et al 2021 hence it can be expected that the sidestream eps extraction would not affect the settleability of mainstream activated sludge if the sir could be properly controlled in summary this work revealed the possibility of sidestream eps extraction process to realize resource recovery and performance enhancement however the proposed process in this study warrants further investigations particularly via long term field data 4 conclusion the dispersed slime is very important for the morphology of flocs removal of slime results in breakage of flocs thereby favoring nitrification performance due to the removal of outer side heterotrophic bacteria thus exposing nitrifiers to favorable conditions the bounded tb eps and lb eps encapsulated bacteria play an important role in compactness of flocs pollutant removal and heat generation lb eps encapsulated nitrifiers and removal of lb eps exhibited high energy dispersion for generating metabolic heat pellets resulting from further removal of tb eps were proved to be metabolically active with a high maintenance coefficient these might then be predicted to be hotter than the outside of flocs these findings suggest that returning the sludge after either slime or lb eps extraction is significant for performance enhancement eps recovery and heat recovery a novel process configuration for such purposes consists of either slime extraction to enhance the nitrification performance or lb eps extraction to reduce the sludge

15846,anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was is usually limited by the low generation efficiency of methane the addition of composite conductive materials cms is a promising strategy to enhance ad performance in this study a new green magnetic straw based biochar msbc was synthesised by a simple ball milling carbonisation method and its effects on ad performance of sludge were investigated experimental results showed that the as synthesised msbc had an intrinsic graphene oxide like structure with fe species serving as electroactive sites these characteristics translate into a high electron transfer et capability after adding msbc the volatile fatty acid production and methane yield were significantly increased by 14 13 and 45 36 respectively analysis of the changes in the et system activities hydrogenase activities cyt c concentrations and the electron transfer capacity of the sludge sample with and without the msbc revealed that the msbc enhanced intracellular et and changed the extracellular et pathway from indirect interspecies hydrogen transfer to direct interspecies electron transfer diet which would be responsible for increasing methane production and proportion in the biogas however further analyses of key enzyme activities and the microbial community indicated that the msbc reinforces the methanogenesis pathway by creating a favourable environment i e by enhancing hydrolysis acidification and diet based co2 reduction for acetoclastic methanogens these findings however are expected to provide an important reference for developing cms application in ad graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge biodegradation magnetic straw based biochar enzyme activity methane production electron transfer 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment produces large amounts of waste activated sludge was for example by the end of 2020 the yield of sludge in china surpassed 50 0 million tonnes year calculated with an water content of 80 and the global yield is predicted to reach 103 0 million tonnes year by 2025 xu et al 2021 was is rich in complex organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides which pose environmental risks if not disposed of properly with the increasing global demand for energy organic matter in was is widely regarded as a potential source of renewable energy anaerobic digestion ad is an economical and effective method for resource and energy recovery from sludge baek et al 2021 in general the ad process comprises four successive steps namely hydrolysis acidification acetogenesis and methanogenesis that require the actions of diverse microbes to be coordinated li et al 2021 however the implementation of ad in sludge has long been limited by the poor syntrophic metabolism of the microbes during ad process interspecies hydrogen transfer iht in which organic matter oxidising bacteria that require an electron acceptor reduce h to generate hydrogen h2 and methanogens utilise h2 as electron donors has been considered the main interspecies electron transfer pathway for achieving syntrophic metabolism zhao et al 2017b however syntrophic metabolism via iht becomes thermodynamically unfavourable when the h2 partial pressure exceeds a quite low threshold 10 4 to 10 5 atm resulting in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas and the further suppression of methanogens wang et al 2021 direct interspecies electron transfer diet which is performed by conductive pili or c type cytochromes to connect microorganisms electrically is regarded a more effective interspecies electron exchange pathway for syntrophic metabolism than iht baek et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014 2012 notably the establishment of diet can not only strengthen co2 reduction based methanogenesis but also provide a more favourable environment for the growth of acetoclastic methanogens which can potentially enhance acetoclastic methanogenesis for example it has been reported that with the augmentation of diet both the mrna encoding enzymes involved in co2 reduction pathway methanogenesis and the abundance of acetate dependent methanogens can be enhanced wang et al 2018 recent studies have shown that conductive materials cms can establish electrical connections between syntrophic partners to facilitate the diet process in general cms are mainly divided into carbon based cms e g biochar granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth graphite graphene and iron based cms e g magnetite jiang et al 2020 li et al 2018 mei et al 2018 qi et al 2021 yin et al 2018 carbon based cms which have a large surface area and high stability and conductivity are prone to facilitate long distance electron transfer between electroactive partners and provide a favourable environment for the growth of syntrophic electroactive microbes chen et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 yin and wu 2019 for example gac had been proven to stimulate ethanol metabolism and methane ch4 production in a diet defined co culture liu et al 2012 biochar which has high conductivity 1 0 100 0 s m has also been widely used to boost ad performance klüpfel et al 2014 shekhar bose et al 2021 sun et al 2017 however due to the low number of electron transfer sites on the surface of carbon based cms and the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps surrounding the cells the issue about electron capture between the cell surface and the surface of carbon based cms become non negligible song et al 2019 yang et al 2020 further complex organic matter cannot be directly decomposed via the diet pathway even in the presence of carbon based cms peng et al 2018 suggesting the high selectivity of these cms mediator diet for substrates for example zhao et al 2017a reported that although diet can be established with the help of gac the poor hydrolysis acidification of complex organic matter significantly weakens the positive effects of diet therefore the direct use of carbon based cms to improve the ad of complex organic wastes remains limited iron based cms can usually achieve short distance electron transfer between electroactive microbes due to their high conductivity and relatively small sizes yin and wu 2019 in addition studies have reported that fe species can serve as active sites for carbon based cms and enhance carbon based cms conductivity thereby boosting the performance of carbon based cms amended ad system song et al 2019 sun et al 2021 expect for iron based cms itself as a conductive medium some nanoscale iron based cms can exist in the eps layer to further enhance the electron transfer ability of eps yang et al 2020 moreover iron based cms such as zero valent iron zvi are capable of participating in some key enzyme synthesis reactions creating a more favourable environment for anaerobic biological processes by decreasing the oxidation reduction potential orp thereby directly stimulating the hydrolysis acidification of complex organic matter in sludge feng et al 2014 these observations suggest that introducing iron species into carbon based cms can improve their electron transfer ability and simultaneously enhance sludge hydrolysis acidification to increase the availability of substrates for diet based syntrophic metabolism thereby improving the effect of carbon based cms on the digestion performance of sludge liu et al 2021 sun et al 2021 prepared gac loaded with nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi using a co precipitation method and reported that the cumulative ch4 production of the 1000 mg l as synthesised gac nzvi digester was 14 29 higher than that of the control moreover the composite fe3o4 sludge carbon synthesised using an impregnation method increased ch4 production from 8 04 to 17 50 ml d during anaerobic treatment of azo dye wastewater zhuang et al 2020 further indicating that the introduction of composite cms is a promising method for improving ch4 production in ad however the composite cms applied in the ad system usually have to undergo cumbersome preparatory processes e g solid liquid separation and an energy consuming drying process and high preparation cost e g an expensive reducing agent which significantly restrict their practical application also the composite cms are widely used in the ad of wastewater but their role in the ad of was is still unclear therefore it is particularly important to prepare the green fe c composite cms and deeply reveal their effects on the ad of was in this paper we propose a simple and sustainable ball milling carbonisation approach to synthesising green composite cms called magnetic straw based biochar msbc from straw and fecl3 6h2o under solvent free conditions moreover the effects of the green msbc on the ad of sludge are explored the objectives of this study are to 1 prepare and characterise fe c composite cms with a low chemical footprint 2 investigate the effects of as synthesised composite cms on the conversion of complex organic matter into ch4 during the ad process 3 explore the influence of as synthesised composite cms on electron transfer capacities 4 illustrate the key enzymes activities and microbial community structure changes in response to msbc addition as well as the specific promotion mechanisms of msbc on the ad of sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterisation of msbc msbc was synthesised using the ball milling carbonisation method summarised in scheme s1 supplementary materials sm in brief 10 g rice straw and 10 g fecl3 6h2o were mixed via ball milling at 300 rpm min for 2 min followed by a pause for 20 min this process was repeated six times next the mixture of rice straw and fecl3 6h2o was carbonised in a tube furnace under nitrogen conditions at a pyrolysis temperature of 850 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min yielding the magnetic straw based biochar called msbc a straw based biochar sbc was also prepared to explore how its properties are changed by

substrates and inoculum the inoculum sludge was collected from a mesophilic semi continuous reactor that exhibited stable long term performance in our laboratory the was used in this study was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china and stored at 4 c the characteristics of the was and the seed sludge are listed in table s1 sm 2 3 batch experimental design 2 3 1 effects of msbc on hydrolysis acidification the batch experiments were executed in a series of 500 ml serum bottles with working volumes of 400 ml to study the effects of msbc on hydrolysis acidification 50 mm of 2 bromoethane sulfonate bes was first mixed with inoculum sludge to eliminate methanogens from the ad process in each individual batch inoculum sludge and waste activated sludge

reactors were sealed and incubated in an air batch shaker at 37 1 c with controlled stirring at 100 rpm 2 3 2 effects of msbc on whole ad to study the effects of msbc on whole ad another experiment was conducted under the same conditions as the hydrolysis acidification experiment but without the initial bes addition in addition bottles only containing the same amount of inoculum as the control were conducted as blank group and the methane generation from the blank group is shown in figure s1 sm the ad process was allowed to continue until no gas was produced in the anaerobic system all reactors were tested in triplicate a schematic of the equipment is shown in scheme s2 sm during the digestion the biogas generated from each batch was collected into an aluminium foil gas collecting

protein and polysaccharides were characterised using the above mentioned methods the protocols to determine the concentration of cyt c and the ets of sludge are detailed in the text s6 sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 micro morphology main composition and electron transfer capacity of msbc the sem images and main element mappings of the as synthesised msbc are shown in fig 1 with 5 00 kx magnification and figure s2 with 1 00 kx magnification sm respectively as shown in fig s2 sm the as synthesised msbc has an irregular structure with an uneven surface and c o and fe are evenly distributed on its surface suggesting the successful homogeneous introduction of iron species the eds analyses also support the introduction of iron figure s2 sm which shows that the surface of the as synthesised msbc is composed 41 41 of carbon 23 41 of oxygen and 35 13 of iron it has been reported that the homogeneous introduction of iron species can enhance the surface active sites song et al 2019 which indicates that the surface active sites of msbc were improved in addition to further observe the physical structure of the as synthesised msbc high magnification sem was conducted as shown in fig 1 a the as synthesised msbc had a graphene oxide like flake shape suggesting that an intrinsic property with high electrical conductivity was established in msbc dai et al 2019 more importantly the corresponding element mapping results confirmed the encapsulation of spherical fe clusters in the biochar similar structures were also found by song et al 2019 and dai et al 2019 who demonstrated that fe embedding improves the conductivity of the biochar and simultaneously strengthens the stability of the fe species fig 1 b e the xrd spectra of the msbc is shown in fig s3 sm the significant diffraction peaks at 44 67 65 62 and 82 35 in the xrd pattern of msbc were attributed to the 110 200 and 211 reflections of fe jcpds 06 0696 respectively confirming that the iron in the msbc composite mainly exists in the form of zvi in the xrd pattern of the single iron species with ball milling carbonisation treatment the diffraction peaks at 24 09 33 27 35 57 40 84 49 41 and 53 94 were indexed as the 012 104 110 113 024 and 116 reflections of fe2o3 jcpds card no 99 0060 rather than of zvi figure s4 sm these results imply that the reduction from fecl3 6h2o to zvi can be mainly attributed to the reaction between fecl3 6h2o and the straw during the preparatory process significantly the formed zvi which was prepared using the inexpensive and simple process is an excellent additive for accelerating hydrolysis acidification of complex organic matter feng et al 2014 the chemical states of the main elements in the as prepared msbc were determined by xps as shown in fig 2 a the xps spectrum of the c1s shows four contributions the c c in graphite c o c o and o c o located at peaks of 284 0 285 0 287 0 and 290 0 ev respectively the presence of c o c o and o c o species indicates that the carbon fractions of the obtained msbc had a structure similar to that of oxygen rich graphene oxide rather than that of pure graphene which is supported by the chemical states of o1s in the msbc fig 2 b an noteworthy phenomenon from fig 2 b is that the relative proportion of c o c o groups in the o1s spectrum of the msbc was approximately 2 33 times higher than that in the o1s spectrum of the sbc implying the increased ketonic c o groups formed by oxidation of c o with the participation of fe species during the preparatory process table s2 sm it has been reported that the functional group c o was conducive to enhancing the electroactivity wang et al 2021 providing further evidence that the msbc has a higher electroactivity than the sbc in addition the order of the carbon fraction is positively correlated with electron transfer liu et al 2020 and the order of the carbon fraction in the msbc was also enhanced according to the results of raman spectrum fig s5 sm it can thus be inferred that the msbc has a high electron transfer capability which is proved by the results of the cv tests figure s6 sm the current peaks and integral areas of the cv curves of the msbc 0 10 ma 0 14 v ma were significantly larger than those of the sbc 0 016 ma 0 010 v ma however according to the above mentioned results and discussions it can be proposed that the simultaneous oxidation of c o to c o groups with a reduction of fe3 species to fe0 during the carbothermal process can result in the formation of the green magnetic biochar i e the msbc which has a special structure with a high electron transfer capacity this special structure has great potential to enhance interspecies electron transfer between anaerobes during the ad process 3 2 effects of msbc on the hydrolysis acidification of sludge to investigate the effects of the msbc on the hydrolysis acidification of sludge the changes in the soluble organic concentrations i e the concentrations of vfas soluble proteins and soluble polysaccharides at different fermentation times with and without the as synthesised msbc were explored fig 3 highlights the variations in the concentrations of soluble protein soluble polysaccharide as well as vfa contents and compositions over time with and without the as synthesised msbc as shown in fig 3 a due to the effects of the msbc the soluble protein concentration decreased during the fermentation process with the maximum reduction from 595 to 452 mg l occurring on day 20 whereas the soluble polysaccharide content did not change significantly remarkably with msbc addition the concentrations of the vfas always increased with the maximum increase occurring on day 6 these results indicate that although the msbc cannot improve the organic solubilisation it can enhance the degradation of complex organic matter and its acidification this finding is also supported by xu et al 2021 who proposed that the pretreatment for enhancing ad should not focus solely on the initial organic solubilisation of sludge acetate propionate iso butyrate n butyrate iso valeric and n valeric were the main vfa components during the period of fermentation as shown in fig 3 b the compositions and concentrations of the vfas generated during hydrolysis acidification were evidently changed by the effects of the msbc msbc addition significantly increased the yield of total vfas during the whole hydrolysis acidification process significantly the highest vfa content in the control group 2158 mg l and msbc group 2463 mg l occurred on day 9 and day 6 respectively indicating that the hydrolysis acidification rate was accelerated by the effect of the msbc for individual vfas acetate and propionate dominated the hydrolysis acidification of sludge it is noteworthy that on day 20 the concentrations of acetate in the control and msbc groups were 1152 87 and 1491 53 mg l respectively whereas the proportion of propionate decreased from 18 70 to 16 85 due to the effect of the msbc it is clear that the propionic type fermentation process which mainly produces propionic acid occurs at an orp of about 280 mv whereas the acetic type and butyric type fermentations which produce acetate and butyric acid as the main products tend to occur at a more negative orp ren et al 2007 wang et al 2006 the msbc may stimulate the generation of acetate and decrease the accumulation of propionate by reducing the orp which can presumably be attributed to the fe species i e fe0 of the msbc this result agrees with the findings of feng et al 2014 who also found that adding zvi led to more acetate and less propionate generation during the hydrolysis acidification phase of sludge to sum up there are two reasonable explanations for the strengthening of the hydrolysis acidification of sludge by the msbc first fe species of msbc can improve hydrolysis acidification related enzyme activities fig 10 by serving as trace metal for microbial metabolism choong et al 2016 wei et al 2018 and the degree of hydrolysis acidification can be enhanced thereby resulting in the increase of simple and available substrates i e acetate for methanogenesis second fe species of msbc can act as micronutrients for growth of hydrolysis acidification bacteria wei et al 2018 and simultaneously the biochar of the composites can act as physical carriers for facilitating microbial growth during the whole biological process qiu et al 2019 resulting in an increase of the functional hydrolysis acidification bacteria population fig 11 3 3 effects of msbc on the whole ad process 3 3 1 effects of msbc on organic solubilisation hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis fig 4 shows the changes in the content of soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide with and without msbc addition during the whole ad process as shown in fig 4 the soluble protein concentrations in the control group were always higher than those in the msbc group during the whole ad process and the highest value of soluble protein concentration in the control group was about twice that in the msbc group however the soluble polysaccharide concentrations changed insignificantly after msbc addition these results are consistent with the previously discussed finding that msbc may not improve organic solubilisation fig 3 a vfas are important intermediate products in the conversion of organic matter to ch4 interestingly fig 5 shows that during the whole ad process with msbc addition the vfa concentrations did not increase significantly but decreased on day 3 this result seems to contradict the results shown in fig 3 which shows that the vfa concentrations increased significantly with msbc addition a possible explanation is that the results in fig 3 is from the effects of the msbc on hydrolysis acidification in which the methanogenic process is artificially inhibited and thereby the vfas cannot be used resulting in a high concentration in the msbc group here the msbc can effectively accelerate the consumption of vfas for methanogenesis thus decreasing vfa concentrations during the whole ad process for example on day 3 the maximum cumulative vfa content decreased from 94 59 to 82 69 mg l with msbc addition which is consistent with reported results that the systematic acidification due to vfa accumulation was alleviated by biochar addition jiang et al 2020 it is also noteworthy that the vfa concentrations slightly increased on day 5 after msbc addition likely because the hydrolysis of protein in sludge was enhanced by msbc addition the larger quantity of low molecule weight organic matter generated by the decomposition of protein needed more time for conversion to vfas resulting in a slight increase in vfa concentrations of the msbc group on day 5 this result is consistent with the findings of xu et al 2018 who also found that due to the enhanced hydrolysis of the organic matter in sludge the maximum vfa concentration in the experimental group appeared at later time than in the control group during methanogenic fermentation the above results indicate that not only the hydrolysis acidification of sludge but also the conversion of intermediate products to ch4 could be improved by msbc addition fig 6 shows the net cumulative ch4 production values from the control and msbc group samples during the whole ad process the net cumulative ch4 production from the msbc group was consistently higher than that from the control group after 5 days the maximum net cumulative ch4 production from the msbc group was about 241 68 ml g vs which was 45 36 higher than that of the control group 166 26 ml g vs indicating that msbc addition can significantly enhance methane production during ad of sludge to further understand the effects of msbc on methanogenesis the modified gompertz equation was used to fit the experimental data from the control and the msbc groups and the corresponding kinetic parameters are presented in table s3 sm a good match is seen between the fitting curves and the experimental values the fitting results showed that msbc addition improved the maximum methane production rate rmax from 12 69 to 16 58 ml g vs d indicating that the msbc not only improved the ch4 yield but also enhanced the ch4 production rate which is also consistent with the findings of other studies that cms can significantly improve the ch4 production performance hassaneen et al 2020 lim et al 2020 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 moreover it is noteworthy that the composition of biogas was also changed by the msbc fig s7 sm that is the ch4 content in biogas from the msbc group was always slightly higher than that from the control group presumably because the ch4 production pathway was changed by msbc addition in general co2 reduction based methanogenesis can improve the proportion of ch4 in biogas via the iiht and diet pathways rotaru et al 2014 thus it can be inferred that the msbc can improve co2 reduction based methanogenesis by enhancing electron transfer during the ad process assuming that the increased vfas are completely bioconverted into methane the theoretical biochemical methane production can be increased by about 60 ml ch4 calculated by the theoretical biochemical methane potential of 380 ml ch4 g cod under 25 c at 1 atm that is maximum theoretical net cumulative ch4 production from the msbc group can be increased to 658 54 ml ch4 598 54 60 ml ch4 or 182 93 ml ch4 g vs 166 26 16 67 ml ch4 g vs only by enhancing hydrolysis acidification of sludge however as shown in fig 6 with the effect of msbc the maximum net cumulative ch4 production from ad of sludge was 241 68 ml ch4 g vs 182 93 ml ch4 g vs which suggests that the enhancement of hydrolysis acidification could be a major but not the only contributor for improving methane production with the addition of msbc this finding further suggests that msbc may not only enhance the hydrolysis acidification of sludge but also improve the syntrophic methanogenesis which is presumably attributed to the improvement of metabolic activity of methanogens and the enhancement of electron transfer between syntrophic microbes figs 7 10 s9 s10 3 3 2 effects of msbc on the electron transfer mechanisms of ad the electron transfer process is essential to ch4 production in the ad process li et al 2018 although many studies have demonstrated that cms acting as the electron medium can significantly enhance the extracellular electron transfer eet pathway few studies have focused simultaneously on both intracellular electron transfer iet and the eet pathway during the ad process to elucidate the effects of the msbc on the whole electron transfer chain performance of the anaerobic biological process the int ets activity hydrogenase activity cyt c concentrations and electrochemical performance were determined for sludge samples at the end of the whole ad process fig 7 shows the changes in int ets activity hydrogenase activity and cyt c concentrations the ets exists in all respiring anaerobes and its activities are generally regarded as an important parameter for measuring iet relevant metabolic activities including cell respiration and redox reactions catalysed by dehydrogenase blenkinsopp and lock 1992 trevors et al 1982 as shown in fig 7 ets activities increased by 49 15 in the msbc group in comparison with the control group which indicates that the iet activities of the ad process were enhanced by msbc addition a result that is also supported by cheng et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 a reasonable explanation is that the fe species of the msbc can be potentially absorbed by bacterial cells thereby enhancing the intracellular electron exchange between redox mediators such as nadh and nad cheng et al 2020 and resulting in the increase of int ets activities more importantly it has been reported that an increase in iet can result in the transfer of more electrons from the increased oxidation of the electron donor to the eet pathway and thus potentially enhance the eet efficiency li et al 2018 to further explore the effect of the msbc on the eet of the ad process the electrochemical performance and conductivity of sludge samples were measured with an electrochemical workstation a pair of symmetric peaks at 0 1 v and 0 5 v were observed in the cv curves at a scan rate of 50 mv s fig s8 sm which could be used to quantitatively determine the capacity of the eet between the biomass and the electrode yuan et al 2011 fig 8 depicts the statistical analyses of changes in the electron transfer i e electron acceptor capacity eac electron donor capacity edc and etc which were calculated from the cv curves during the ad process the average eac edc and etc of the msbc group were higher than those of the control group indicating that the msbc can improve the eet of the ad in addition the conductivity of sludge in the msbc group also increased by 56 57 in comparison with that in the control group fig s9 sm indicating a faster eet rate triggered by msbc iiht and diet are the two dominant pathways used by anaerobes to complete eet between fermentative bacteria and methanogens which converts organic matter to ch4 in the ad process the hydrogenase is responsible for catalysing the evolution of the hydrogen generated from fermentative bacteria in the iiht process guss et al 2009 diet does not require h2 as an electron carrier nor does it require the participation of hydrogenase therefore the activity of hydrogenase can be used to distinguish between the iiht and diet pathways fig 7 shows that with msbc addition the activity of hydrogenase decreased by 3 04 suggesting that the msbc could not effectively enhance methanogenesis via the iiht pathway however fig 7 shows that the cyt c concentrations of the msbc group were 1 45 times higher than those of the control group cyt c a group of redox proteins is generally located in the intermembrane space of cells and participates in the eet pathway especially diet between syntrophic microorganisms summers et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 thus it is a reasonable hypothesis that the msbc can strengthen the diet pathway by increasing the cyt c concentration this hypothesis is also supported by yang et al 2020 who found that gac mno2 accelerated eet by stimulating the secretion of cyt c most microorganisms are surrounded by eps and do not directly interact with the external environment the electron transfer between bacteria and methanogens apparently pass through the eps layer and the presence of the eps layer can affect diet between anaerobes xiao and zhao 2017 the electro activities and compositions of eps were measured to further explore the effect of the msbc on potential eet mechanisms the greater values of the etc of eps in the msbc group a 2 53 increase suggests that a faster eet was stimulated by msbc addition fig s10 sm the compositions of different eps layers in the control and msbc groups are summarised in fig 9 the protein concentration of tightly bound eps tb eps in the msbc group was 2 40 mg g vs which is 21 49 higher than that in the control group it is well known that proteins e g cyt c as the dominant constituent of stimulated eps can participate in diet yang et al 2020 thus it can be inferred that the msbc can enhance the electro activities of eps by triggering the secretion of electroactive substances i e cyt c during the ad process however the protein content of soluble eps sb eps decreased by 28 56 in comparison with that of the control group and the trend was similar for the soluble protein content of sludge sample a plausible explanation is that some electroactive secretions triggered by the msbc can remain only in the tb eps layer while some proteins of the sb eps layer can be accelerated degradation with msbc addition resulting in an increased protein content in the tb eps layer and a decreased protein content in the sb eps layer however in all of the sb eps loosely bound lb eps and tb eps layers there were no significant differences in polysaccharide concentrations between the msbc and the control groups 3 3 3 effects of msbc on the activity of key enzymes and the microbial community it is well known that protease is capable of catalysing the hydrolysis of proteins to amino acids feng et al 2014 the acid forming enzymes such as ak pta bk and ptb further catalyse small sized organic matter converting it to vfas in particular pta and ptb are responsible for decomposing acetyl coa and butyryl coa to acetyl and butyryl phosphate respectively which are further converted to acetate and butyrate under the action of ak and bk respectively feng et al 2009 and these process can generate atp by substrate level phosphorylation for subsequent methanogenesis smith and ingram smith 2007 the activities of these key enzymes in the control and msbc groups are summarised in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the activity of protease in the msbc group was 65 54 higher than that in the control group indicating that the msbc can improve the activity of protease and this is an important reason for the excellent hydrolysis performance of proteins in the msbc group in addition in comparison with the control group the acid forming related ak pta bk and ptb activities in the msbc group were increased by 11 60 37 50 31 29 and 44 67 respectively these results further prove that the msbc enhanced the hydrolysis acidification of sludge fig 3 b by improved relevant enzymes activities thereby providing more simple and available substrates for methanogenesis the increasing enzyme activity i e protease ak pta bk and ptb could be ascribed to the fe species in msbc that can provide necessary trace elements for enzyme synthesis or stimulate the expression of enzyme genes tian et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 moreover the cof420 could represent the methanogenic activity because it is not only the most likely but also possibly the only candidate enzyme for creating an electrochemical gradient to drive atp synthesis when methanogens generate energy during growth on acetate smith and ingram smith 2007 and with the effect of msbc the activity of cof420 was increased by 34 21 indicating that the msbc is capable of strengthening methanogenesis during the whole ad process which also confirms that the msbc enhanced net cumulative methane production from sludge to evaluate the effects of the msbc on the microbial community structure the microbial diversity and microbial community constituents of ad were analysed by high throughput sequencing the microbial alpha diversity measurements are shown in table s4 sm all samples exhibited high coverage levels of over 0 99 which was sufficient to capture most of the microbial diversity with regard to bacterial communities in comparison with the control group the lower shannon and higher simpson indexes were found in the msbc group indicating that the msbc decreased bacterial diversity in ad however the differences in the average values of both the shannon and simpson indices at the archaeal otu level were insignificant between the control and the msbc groups suggesting that the msbc had a negligible effect on archaeal species diversity moreover at both the archaeal otu level and bacterial otu level the average values of both the ace index and the chao index were lower in the msbc group than in the control group suggesting that the msbc can reduce the richness of both bacterial and archaeal species a reasonable explanation is that the msbc enriched some functional microorganisms and increased their relative abundance resulting in low species richness this result can also be corroborated by an analysis of the changes in the bacterial and archaeal community structure fig 11 shows the changes in microbial community structure in the control and msbc groups as shown in fig 11 a the bacterial communities at the phylum level in both groups mainly comprised acetothermia proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidota a notable result evident from fig 11 a is that the average proportions of the dominant phyla acetothermia and proteobacteria respectively increased from 10 5 and 14 0 to 18 1 and 15 4 after adding the msbc indicating a significant positive effect of the msbc addition on the abundances of these two phyla acetothermia which accounted for the largest average proportion in both the control and msbc groups has been reported to play important functional roles in consuming peptides amino acids and simple sugars to produce acetate but have limited capacities for extracellular hydrolysis of polysaccharides kadnikov et al 2019 it is thus plausible that the msbc can enhance protein degradation by increasing the relative abundance of acetothermia during the ad process which is consistent with the enhanced hydrolysis acidification performance of sludge fig 3 this phenomenon may also explain the lower soluble protein concentrations and unchanged soluble polysaccharides of the msbc group in comparison with the control group fig 4 after msbc addition the abundance of proteobacteria the second most dominant species also increased by 10 proteobacteria has been reported to serve as an essential consumer of glucose and long chain vfas ariesyady et al 2007 xu et al 2018 and most of the well known electroactive bacteria e g geobacter and shewanella species belong to the proteobacteria phylum lovley et al 2004 zhou et al 2014 accordingly the msbc may strengthen syntrophic metabolism of simple organic matter via triggering diet between proteobacteria phylum and electroactive methanogens fig 11 b also demonstrates that at the genus level g norank c acetothermiia g norank o aminicenantales thermovirga and g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 were the dominant bacterial genera in both the control and msbc groups significantly as shown in fig 11 b the average percentages of g norank c acetothermiia thermovirga and g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 were higher in the msbc group than in the control group 18 1 vs 10 5 4 2 vs 3 3 and 3 6 vs 2 7 respectively indicating that the msbc evidently increased the relative abundances of these genera although the g norank c acetothermiia with the highest relative abundance had not been clearly ranked its phylum acetothermia has been reported to perform acetate type fermentation kadnikov et al 2019 youssef et al 2019 suggesting that the msbc can improve acetate production and stimulate acetotrophic methanogenesis also the enriched g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 was reported to be functionally important in the hydrolysis of proteins mei et al 2020 further indicating that the msbc improved the protein degradation of sludge by enriching the genera g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 in addition thermovirga are capable of metabolising amino acids with the reduction of elemental sulphur and it has the potential ability to transfer electrons to the other extracellular electron acceptors he et al 2020 it is thus plausible that the msbc enriched electroactive bacteria and facilitated diet based syntrophic metabolism as shown in fig 11 c archaea community analysis at the genus level indicates that the methanogens with the highest relative abundance in both the control and msbc groups were methanosaeta followed by the genera candidatus methanofastidiosum methanobacterium and methanolinea methanosaeta the well known absolutely acetoclastic methanogens i e methanosaeta accounted for 56 2 in the msbc group which was significantly higher than that in the control group 45 6 this result suggests that msbc could improve acetoclastic methanogenesis the enhanced methanosaeta related acetoclastic methanogenesis can be attributed to two aspects first it has been reported that cof420 is not only the most likely but also possibly the only candidate enzyme for creating an electrochemical gradient to drive atp synthesis when methanosaeta generate energy during growth on acetate smith and ingram smith 2007 consequently the enhanced cof420 activity improved the methanosaeta related acetate dependent metabolism second the improvement of hydrolysis acidification performance at an early stage can provide more acetate for stimulating acetoclastic methanogenesis in addition previous studies have reported that methanosaeta is an electroactive methanogen and is capable of producing ch4 from co2 by performing diet rotaru et al 2014 combining that methanosaeta is the only electroactive methanogens enriched by msbc it thus is a reasonable hypothesis that msbc may stimulate diet between methanosaeta and electroactive bacteria such as thermovirga during the whole ad process which is consistent with the findings of he et al 2020 who have found that biochar stimulated syntrophic methanogenesis which might mainly be performed by abundant thermovirga and methanosaeta in contrast the relative abundance of h2 dependent methylotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum and hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium decreased significantly with msbc addition from 35 5 to 26 3 and 7 0 to 5 9 respectively these results indicate that the msbc increases the ch4 content in biogas by enhancing diet based rather than iiht based co2 reduction methanogenesis 3 4 possible mechanisms of the improvement in ad due to msbc and future implications the proposed mechanisms of the enhancement in sludge s ad performance due to the msbc are depicted in fig 12 the msbc as the conductive additive improves the hydrolysis acidification efficiency and the syntrophic metabolism rate for higher sludge digestion performance in particular the msbc can improve iet and some key enzyme activities related to the hydrolysis acidification of sludge these positive effects significantly improve the hydrolysis acidification of sludge thereby generating more available substrates for subsequent methanogenesis with regard to the methanogenic syntrophic metabolism is an essential process for ch4 generation and eet between syntrophic microorganisms plays a key role in the efficiency of syntrophic metabolism the results of the cyt c concentrations hydrogenase f420 activities and electrochemical performance of sludge and eps demonstrated that the msbc boosted eet by weakening iiht and strengthening the diet pathway thus enhancing co2 dependent methanogenesis and increasing the ch4 content in biogas which can also be further proved by the enrichment of electroactive bacteria and archaea such as thermovirga and methanosaeta however although the msbc can enhance diet based co2 dependent methanogenesis it wasn t the unique contributor for msbc improving sludge ad performance it is concluded that msbc can enrich the methanosaeta and effectively enhance acetoclastic methanogenesis due to the promotion of acetate production via enhancing hydrolysis acidification cof420 activity and changing the electron transfer pathway from iiht to diet previous studies on the application of cms to enhance ad of sludge have mainly focused on the establishment of the diet pathway lei et al 2019 liu et al 2021 wan et al 2021 yun et al 2021 unlike these studies this study comprehensively investigated the mechanism by which the msbc influences ad of sludge and highlighted that the enhancement of hydrolysis acidification and establishment of a more favourable anaerobic environment for acetoclastic methanogenesis are two non negligible reasons for methane production by the msbc not just due to the diet based reinforcement on co2 dependent methanogenesis pathway moreover it should be noted that sludges with different solid contents will lead to different degrees of acid accumulation in the face of different degrees of acid accumulation the role of diet pathway in strengthening ad with msbc may also be different therefore future work is required to evaluate the effects of msbc on the ad of sludges with varying solid content which will provide some important reference for the ad of other perishable organic wastes 4 conclusions a novel green composite cm with high conductivity and stability was successfully synthesised using the ball milling carbonisation approach it was concluded that with the addition of the green msbc composite the ad of sludge was enhanced for example the production of vfas increased by 14 13 and the ch4 yield significantly increased by 45 36 in addition the ch4 content in biogas was also slightly improved with msbc addition in the whole ad process according to the results of further research the underlying mechanism of ad enhancement by the msbc can enhance the activities of key enzymes such as protease ak pta bk ptb and cof420 including the hydrolysis acidification related enzymes and the methanogenesis related enzymes which could promote the generation efficiency of acetate and improve the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway thereby resulting in an enrichment of acetoclastic methanogens i e methanosaeta moreover co2 reduction based methanogenesis was also upgraded owing to the enhancement of eet and the increase of cyt c by msbc which provides a more favourable environment for the growth of methanosaeta the positive effects of the msbc on sludge digestion can thus be ascribed to the enhancement of hydrolysis acidification and the efficient syntrophic metabolism between acidification bacteria and methanogens i e methanosaeta declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgment this work was

15846,anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was is usually limited by the low generation efficiency of methane the addition of composite conductive materials cms is a promising strategy to enhance ad performance in this study a new green magnetic straw based biochar msbc was synthesised by a simple ball milling carbonisation method and its effects on ad performance of sludge were investigated experimental results showed that the as synthesised msbc had an intrinsic graphene oxide like structure with fe species serving as electroactive sites these characteristics translate into a high electron transfer et capability after adding msbc the volatile fatty acid production and methane yield were significantly increased by 14 13 and 45 36 respectively analysis of the changes in the et system activities hydrogenase activities cyt c concentrations and the electron transfer capacity of the sludge sample with and without the msbc revealed that the msbc enhanced intracellular et and changed the extracellular et pathway from indirect interspecies hydrogen transfer to direct interspecies electron transfer diet which would be responsible for increasing methane production and proportion in the biogas however further analyses of key enzyme activities and the microbial community indicated that the msbc reinforces the methanogenesis pathway by creating a favourable environment i e by enhancing hydrolysis acidification and diet based co2 reduction for acetoclastic methanogens these findings however are expected to provide an important reference for developing cms application in ad graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge biodegradation magnetic straw based biochar enzyme activity methane production electron transfer 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment produces large amounts of waste activated sludge was for example by the end of 2020 the yield of sludge in china surpassed 50 0 million tonnes year calculated with an water content of 80 and the global yield is predicted to reach 103 0 million tonnes year by 2025 xu et al 2021 was is rich in complex organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides which pose environmental risks if not disposed of properly with the increasing global demand for energy organic matter in was is widely regarded as a potential source of renewable energy anaerobic digestion ad is an economical and effective method for resource and energy recovery from sludge baek et al 2021 in general the ad process comprises four successive steps namely hydrolysis acidification acetogenesis and methanogenesis that require the actions of diverse microbes to be coordinated li et al 2021 however the implementation of ad in sludge has long been limited by the poor syntrophic metabolism of the microbes during ad process interspecies hydrogen transfer iht in which organic matter oxidising bacteria that require an electron acceptor reduce h to generate hydrogen h2 and methanogens utilise h2 as electron donors has been considered the main interspecies electron transfer pathway for achieving syntrophic metabolism zhao et al 2017b however syntrophic metabolism via iht becomes thermodynamically unfavourable when the h2 partial pressure exceeds a quite low threshold 10 4 to 10 5 atm resulting in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas and the further suppression of methanogens wang et al 2021 direct interspecies electron transfer diet which is performed by conductive pili or c type cytochromes to connect microorganisms electrically is regarded a more effective interspecies electron exchange pathway for syntrophic metabolism than iht baek et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014 2012 notably the establishment of diet can not only strengthen co2 reduction based methanogenesis but also provide a more favourable environment for the growth of acetoclastic methanogens which can potentially enhance acetoclastic methanogenesis for example it has been reported that with the augmentation of diet both the mrna encoding enzymes involved in co2 reduction pathway methanogenesis and the abundance of acetate dependent methanogens can be enhanced wang et al 2018 recent studies have shown that conductive materials cms can establish electrical connections between syntrophic partners to facilitate the diet process in general cms are mainly divided into carbon based cms e g biochar granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth graphite graphene and iron based cms e g magnetite jiang et al 2020 li et al 2018 mei et al 2018 qi et al 2021 yin et al 2018 carbon based cms which have a large surface area and high stability and conductivity are prone to facilitate long distance electron transfer between electroactive partners and provide a favourable environment for the growth of syntrophic electroactive microbes chen et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 yin and wu 2019 for example gac had been proven to stimulate ethanol metabolism and methane ch4 production in a diet defined co culture liu et al 2012 biochar which has high conductivity 1 0 100 0 s m has also been widely used to boost ad performance klüpfel et al 2014 shekhar bose et al 2021 sun et al 2017 however due to the low number of electron transfer sites on the surface of carbon based cms and the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps surrounding the cells the issue about electron capture between the cell surface and the surface of carbon based cms become non negligible song et al 2019 yang et al 2020 further complex organic matter cannot be directly decomposed via the diet pathway even in the presence of carbon based cms peng et al 2018 suggesting the high selectivity of these cms mediator diet for substrates for example zhao et al 2017a reported that although diet can be established with the help of gac the poor hydrolysis acidification of complex organic matter significantly weakens the positive effects of diet therefore the direct use of carbon based cms to improve the ad of complex organic wastes remains limited iron based cms can usually achieve short distance electron transfer between electroactive microbes due to their high conductivity and relatively small sizes yin and wu 2019 in addition studies have reported that fe species can serve as active sites for carbon based cms and enhance carbon based cms conductivity thereby boosting the performance of carbon based cms amended ad system song et al 2019 sun et al 2021 expect for iron based cms itself as a conductive medium some nanoscale iron based cms can exist in the eps layer to further enhance the electron transfer ability of eps yang et al 2020 moreover iron based cms such as zero valent iron zvi are capable of participating in some key enzyme synthesis reactions creating a more favourable environment for anaerobic biological processes by decreasing the oxidation reduction potential orp thereby directly stimulating the hydrolysis acidification of complex organic matter in sludge feng et al 2014 these observations suggest that introducing iron species into carbon based cms can improve their electron transfer ability and simultaneously enhance sludge hydrolysis acidification to increase the availability of substrates for diet based syntrophic metabolism thereby improving the effect of carbon based cms on the digestion performance of sludge liu et al 2021 sun et al 2021 prepared gac loaded with nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi using a co precipitation method and reported that the cumulative ch4 production of the 1000 mg l as synthesised gac nzvi digester was 14 29 higher than that of the control moreover the composite fe3o4 sludge carbon synthesised using an impregnation method increased ch4 production from 8 04 to 17 50 ml d during anaerobic treatment of azo dye wastewater zhuang et al 2020 further indicating that the introduction of composite cms is a promising method for improving ch4 production in ad however the composite cms applied in the ad system usually have to undergo cumbersome preparatory processes e g solid liquid separation and an energy consuming drying process and high preparation cost e g an expensive reducing agent which significantly restrict their practical application also the composite cms are widely used in the ad of wastewater but their role in the ad of was is still unclear therefore it is particularly important to prepare the green fe c composite cms and deeply reveal their effects on the ad of was in this paper we propose a simple and sustainable ball milling carbonisation approach to synthesising green composite cms called magnetic straw based biochar msbc from straw and fecl3 6h2o under solvent free conditions moreover the effects of the green msbc on the ad of sludge are explored the objectives of this study are to 1 prepare and characterise fe c composite cms with a low chemical footprint 2 investigate the effects of as synthesised composite cms on the conversion of complex organic matter into ch4 during the ad process 3 explore the influence of as synthesised composite cms on electron transfer capacities 4 illustrate the key enzymes activities and microbial community structure changes in response to msbc addition as well as the specific promotion mechanisms of msbc on the ad of sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterisation of msbc msbc was synthesised using the ball milling carbonisation method summarised in scheme s1 supplementary materials sm in brief 10 g rice straw and 10 g fecl3 6h2o were mixed via ball milling at 300 rpm min for 2 min followed by a pause for 20 min this process was repeated six times next the mixture of rice straw and fecl3 6h2o was carbonised in a tube furnace under nitrogen conditions at a pyrolysis temperature of 850 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min yielding the magnetic straw based biochar called msbc a straw based biochar sbc was also prepared to explore how its properties are changed by

reactors were sealed and incubated in an air batch shaker at 37 1 c with controlled stirring at 100 rpm 2 3 2 effects of msbc on whole ad to study the effects of msbc on whole ad another experiment was conducted under the same conditions as the hydrolysis acidification experiment but without the initial bes addition in addition bottles only containing the same amount of inoculum as the control were conducted as blank group and the methane generation from the blank group is shown in figure s1 sm the ad process was allowed to continue until no gas was produced in the anaerobic system all reactors were tested in triplicate a schematic of the equipment is shown in scheme s2 sm during the digestion the biogas generated from each batch was collected into an aluminium foil gas collecting

and discussion 3 1 micro morphology main composition and electron transfer capacity of msbc the sem images and main element mappings of the as synthesised msbc are shown in fig 1 with 5 00 kx magnification and figure s2 with 1 00 kx magnification sm respectively as shown in fig s2 sm the as synthesised msbc has an irregular structure with an uneven surface and c o and fe are evenly distributed on its surface suggesting the successful homogeneous introduction of iron species the eds analyses also support the introduction of iron figure s2 sm which shows that the surface of the as synthesised msbc is composed 41 41 of carbon 23 41 of oxygen and 35 13 of iron it has been reported that the homogeneous introduction of iron species can enhance the surface active sites song et al 2019 which indicates that the surface active sites of msbc were improved in addition to further observe the physical structure of the as synthesised msbc high magnification sem was conducted as shown in fig 1 a the as synthesised msbc had a graphene oxide like flake shape suggesting that an intrinsic property with high electrical conductivity was established in msbc dai et al 2019 more importantly the corresponding element mapping results confirmed the encapsulation of spherical fe clusters in the biochar similar structures were also found by song et al 2019 and dai et al 2019 who demonstrated that fe embedding improves the conductivity of the biochar and simultaneously strengthens the stability of the fe species fig 1 b e the xrd spectra of the msbc is shown in fig s3 sm the significant diffraction peaks at 44 67 65 62 and 82 35 in the xrd pattern of msbc were attributed to the 110 200 and 211 reflections of fe jcpds 06 0696 respectively confirming that the iron in the msbc composite mainly exists in the form of zvi in the xrd pattern of the single iron species with ball milling carbonisation treatment the diffraction peaks at 24 09 33 27 35 57 40 84 49 41 and 53 94 were indexed as the 012 104 110 113 024 and 116 reflections of fe2o3 jcpds card no 99 0060 rather than of zvi figure s4 sm these results imply that the reduction from fecl3 6h2o to zvi can be mainly attributed to the reaction between fecl3 6h2o and the straw during the preparatory process significantly the formed zvi which was prepared using the inexpensive and simple process is an excellent additive for accelerating hydrolysis acidification of complex organic matter feng et al 2014 the chemical states of the main elements in the as prepared msbc were determined by xps as shown in fig 2 a the xps spectrum of the c1s shows four contributions the c c in graphite c o c o and o c o located at peaks of 284 0 285 0 287 0 and 290 0 ev respectively the presence of c o c o and o c o species indicates that the carbon fractions of the obtained msbc had a structure similar to that of oxygen rich graphene oxide rather than that of pure graphene which is supported by the chemical states of o1s in the msbc fig 2 b an noteworthy phenomenon from fig 2 b is that the relative proportion of c o c o groups in the o1s spectrum of the msbc was approximately 2 33 times higher than that in the o1s spectrum of the sbc implying the increased ketonic c o groups formed by oxidation of c o with the participation of fe species during the preparatory process table s2 sm it has been reported that the functional group c o was conducive to enhancing the electroactivity wang et al 2021 providing further evidence that the msbc has a higher electroactivity than the sbc in addition the order of the carbon fraction is positively correlated with electron transfer liu et al 2020 and the order of the carbon fraction in the msbc was also enhanced according to the results of raman spectrum fig s5 sm it can thus be inferred that the msbc has a high electron transfer capability which is proved by the results of the cv tests figure s6 sm the current peaks and integral areas of the cv curves of the msbc 0 10 ma 0 14 v ma were significantly larger than those of the sbc 0 016 ma 0 010 v ma however according to the above mentioned results and discussions it can be proposed that the simultaneous oxidation of c o to c o groups with a reduction of fe3 species to fe0 during the carbothermal process can result in the formation of the green magnetic biochar i e the msbc which has a special structure with a high electron transfer capacity this special structure has great potential to enhance interspecies electron transfer between anaerobes during the ad process 3 2 effects of msbc on the hydrolysis acidification of sludge to investigate the effects of the msbc on the hydrolysis acidification of sludge the changes in the soluble organic concentrations i e the concentrations of vfas soluble proteins and soluble polysaccharides at different fermentation times with and without the as synthesised msbc were explored fig 3 highlights the variations in the concentrations of soluble protein soluble polysaccharide as well as vfa contents and compositions over time with and without the as synthesised msbc as shown in fig 3 a due to the effects of the msbc the soluble protein concentration decreased during the fermentation process with the maximum reduction from 595 to 452 mg l occurring on day 20 whereas the soluble polysaccharide content did not change significantly remarkably with msbc addition the concentrations of the vfas always increased with the maximum increase occurring on day 6 these results indicate that although the msbc cannot improve the organic solubilisation it can enhance the degradation of complex organic matter and its acidification this finding is also supported by xu et al 2021 who proposed that the pretreatment for enhancing ad should not focus solely on the initial organic solubilisation of sludge acetate propionate iso butyrate n butyrate iso valeric and n valeric were the main vfa components during the period of fermentation as shown in fig 3 b the compositions and concentrations of the vfas generated during hydrolysis acidification were evidently changed by the effects of the msbc msbc addition significantly increased the yield of total vfas during the whole hydrolysis acidification process significantly the highest vfa content in the control group 2158 mg l and msbc group 2463 mg l occurred on day 9 and day 6 respectively indicating that the hydrolysis acidification rate was accelerated by the effect of the msbc for individual vfas acetate and propionate dominated the hydrolysis acidification of sludge it is noteworthy that on day 20 the concentrations of acetate in the control and msbc groups were 1152 87 and 1491 53 mg l respectively whereas the proportion of propionate decreased from 18 70 to 16 85 due to the effect of the msbc it is clear that the propionic type fermentation process which mainly produces propionic acid occurs at an orp of about 280 mv whereas the acetic type and butyric type fermentations which produce acetate and butyric acid as the main products tend to occur at a more negative orp ren et al 2007 wang et al 2006 the msbc may stimulate the generation of acetate and decrease the accumulation of propionate by reducing the orp which can presumably be attributed to the fe species i e fe0 of the msbc this result agrees with the findings of feng et al 2014 who also found that adding zvi led to more acetate and less propionate generation during the hydrolysis acidification phase of sludge to sum up there are two reasonable explanations for the strengthening of the hydrolysis acidification of sludge by the msbc first fe species of msbc can improve hydrolysis acidification related enzyme activities fig 10 by serving as trace metal for microbial metabolism choong et al 2016 wei et al 2018 and the degree of hydrolysis acidification can be enhanced thereby resulting in the increase of simple and available substrates i e acetate for methanogenesis second fe species of msbc can act as micronutrients for growth of hydrolysis acidification bacteria wei et al 2018 and simultaneously the biochar of the composites can act as physical carriers for facilitating microbial growth during the whole biological process qiu et al 2019 resulting in an increase of the functional hydrolysis acidification bacteria population fig 11 3 3 effects of msbc on the whole ad process 3 3 1 effects of msbc on organic solubilisation hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis fig 4 shows the changes in the content of soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide with and without msbc addition during the whole ad process as shown in fig 4 the soluble protein concentrations in the control group were always higher than those in the msbc group during the whole ad process and the highest value of soluble protein concentration in the control group was about twice that in the msbc group however the soluble polysaccharide concentrations changed insignificantly after msbc addition these results are consistent with the previously discussed finding that msbc may not improve organic solubilisation fig 3 a vfas are important intermediate products in the conversion of organic matter to ch4 interestingly fig 5 shows that during the whole ad process with msbc addition the vfa concentrations did not increase significantly but decreased on day 3 this result seems to contradict the results shown in fig 3 which shows that the vfa concentrations increased significantly with msbc addition a possible explanation is that the results in fig 3 is from the effects of the msbc on hydrolysis acidification in which the methanogenic process is artificially inhibited and thereby the vfas cannot be used resulting in a high concentration in the msbc group here the msbc can effectively accelerate the consumption of vfas for methanogenesis thus decreasing vfa concentrations during the whole ad process for example on day 3 the maximum cumulative vfa content decreased from 94 59 to 82 69 mg l with msbc addition which is consistent with reported results that the systematic acidification due to vfa accumulation was alleviated by biochar addition jiang et al 2020 it is also noteworthy that the vfa concentrations slightly increased on day 5 after msbc addition likely because the hydrolysis of protein in sludge was enhanced by msbc addition the larger quantity of low molecule weight organic matter generated by the decomposition of protein needed more time for conversion to vfas resulting in a slight increase in vfa concentrations of the msbc group on day 5 this result is consistent with the findings of xu et al 2018 who also found that due to the enhanced hydrolysis of the organic matter in sludge the maximum vfa concentration in the experimental group appeared at later time than in the control group during methanogenic fermentation the above results indicate that not only the hydrolysis acidification of sludge but also the conversion of intermediate products to ch4 could be improved by msbc addition fig 6 shows the net cumulative ch4 production values from the control and msbc group samples during the whole ad process the net cumulative ch4 production from the msbc group was consistently higher than that from the control group after 5 days the maximum net cumulative ch4 production from the msbc group was about 241 68 ml g vs which was 45 36 higher than that of the control group 166 26 ml g vs indicating that msbc addition can significantly enhance methane production during ad of sludge to further understand the effects of msbc on methanogenesis the modified gompertz equation was used to fit the experimental data from the control and the msbc groups and the corresponding kinetic parameters are presented in table s3 sm a good match is seen between the fitting curves and the experimental values the fitting results showed that msbc addition improved the maximum methane production rate rmax from 12 69 to 16 58 ml g vs d indicating that the msbc not only improved the ch4 yield but also enhanced the ch4 production rate which is also consistent with the findings of other studies that cms can significantly improve the ch4 production performance hassaneen et al 2020 lim et al 2020 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 moreover it is noteworthy that the composition of biogas was also changed by the msbc fig s7 sm that is the ch4 content in biogas from the msbc group was always slightly higher than that from the control group presumably because the ch4 production pathway was changed by msbc addition in general co2 reduction based methanogenesis can improve the proportion of ch4 in biogas via the iiht and diet pathways rotaru et al 2014 thus it can be inferred that the msbc can improve co2 reduction based methanogenesis by enhancing electron transfer during the ad process assuming that the increased vfas are completely bioconverted into methane the theoretical biochemical methane production can be increased by about 60 ml ch4 calculated by the theoretical biochemical methane potential of 380 ml ch4 g cod under 25 c at 1 atm that is maximum theoretical net cumulative ch4 production from the msbc group can be increased to 658 54 ml ch4 598 54 60 ml ch4 or 182 93 ml ch4 g vs 166 26 16 67 ml ch4 g vs only by enhancing hydrolysis acidification of sludge however as shown in fig 6 with the effect of msbc the maximum net cumulative ch4 production from ad of sludge was 241 68 ml ch4 g vs 182 93 ml ch4 g vs which suggests that the enhancement of hydrolysis acidification could be a major but not the only contributor for improving methane production with the addition of msbc this finding further suggests that msbc may not only enhance the hydrolysis acidification of sludge but also improve the syntrophic methanogenesis which is presumably attributed to the improvement of metabolic activity of methanogens and the enhancement of electron transfer between syntrophic microbes figs 7 10 s9 s10 3 3 2 effects of msbc on the electron transfer mechanisms of ad the electron transfer process is essential to ch4 production in the ad process li et al 2018 although many studies have demonstrated that cms acting as the electron medium can significantly enhance the extracellular electron transfer eet pathway few studies have focused simultaneously on both intracellular electron transfer iet and the eet pathway during the ad process to elucidate the effects of the msbc on the whole electron transfer chain performance of the anaerobic biological process the int ets activity hydrogenase activity cyt c concentrations and electrochemical performance were determined for sludge samples at the end of the whole ad process fig 7 shows the changes in int ets activity hydrogenase activity and cyt c concentrations the ets exists in all respiring anaerobes and its activities are generally regarded as an important parameter for measuring iet relevant metabolic activities including cell respiration and redox reactions catalysed by dehydrogenase blenkinsopp and lock 1992 trevors et al 1982 as shown in fig 7 ets activities increased by 49 15 in the msbc group in comparison with the control group which indicates that the iet activities of the ad process were enhanced by msbc addition a result that is also supported by cheng et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 a reasonable explanation is that the fe species of the msbc can be potentially absorbed by bacterial cells thereby enhancing the intracellular electron exchange between redox mediators such as nadh and nad cheng et al 2020 and resulting in the increase of int ets activities more importantly it has been reported that an increase in iet can result in the transfer of more electrons from the increased oxidation of the electron donor to the eet pathway and thus potentially enhance the eet efficiency li et al 2018 to further explore the effect of the msbc on the eet of the ad process the electrochemical performance and conductivity of sludge samples were measured with an electrochemical workstation a pair of symmetric peaks at 0 1 v and 0 5 v were observed in the cv curves at a scan rate of 50 mv s fig s8 sm which could be used to quantitatively determine the capacity of the eet between the biomass and the electrode yuan et al 2011 fig 8 depicts the statistical analyses of changes in the electron transfer i e electron acceptor capacity eac electron donor capacity edc and etc which were calculated from the cv curves during the ad process the average eac edc and etc of the msbc group were higher than those of the control group indicating that the msbc can improve the eet of the ad in addition the conductivity of sludge in the msbc group also increased by 56 57 in comparison with that in the control group fig s9 sm indicating a faster eet rate triggered by msbc iiht and diet are the two dominant pathways used by anaerobes to complete eet between fermentative bacteria and methanogens which converts organic matter to ch4 in the ad process the hydrogenase is responsible for catalysing the evolution of the hydrogen generated from fermentative bacteria in the iiht process guss et al 2009 diet does not require h2 as an electron carrier nor does it require the participation of hydrogenase therefore the activity of hydrogenase can be used to distinguish between the iiht and diet pathways fig 7 shows that with msbc addition the activity of hydrogenase decreased by 3 04 suggesting that the msbc could not effectively enhance methanogenesis via the iiht pathway however fig 7 shows that the cyt c concentrations of the msbc group were 1 45 times higher than those of the control group cyt c a group of redox proteins is generally located in the intermembrane space of cells and participates in the eet pathway especially diet between syntrophic microorganisms summers et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 thus it is a reasonable hypothesis that the msbc can strengthen the diet pathway by increasing the cyt c concentration this hypothesis is also supported by yang et al 2020 who found that gac mno2 accelerated eet by stimulating the secretion of cyt c most microorganisms are surrounded by eps and do not directly interact with the external environment the electron transfer between bacteria and methanogens apparently pass through the eps layer and the presence of the eps layer can affect diet between anaerobes xiao and zhao 2017 the electro activities and compositions of eps were measured to further explore the effect of the msbc on potential eet mechanisms the greater values of the etc of eps in the msbc group a 2 53 increase suggests that a faster eet was stimulated by msbc addition fig s10 sm the compositions of different eps layers in the control and msbc groups are summarised in fig 9 the protein concentration of tightly bound eps tb eps in the msbc group was 2 40 mg g vs which is 21 49 higher than that in the control group it is well known that proteins e g cyt c as the dominant constituent of stimulated eps can participate in diet yang et al 2020 thus it can be inferred that the msbc can enhance the electro activities of eps by triggering the secretion of electroactive substances i e cyt c during the ad process however the protein content of soluble eps sb eps decreased by 28 56 in comparison with that of the control group and the trend was similar for the soluble protein content of sludge sample a plausible explanation is that some electroactive secretions triggered by the msbc can remain only in the tb eps layer while some proteins of the sb eps layer can be accelerated degradation with msbc addition resulting in an increased protein content in the tb eps layer and a decreased protein content in the sb eps layer however in all of the sb eps loosely bound lb eps and tb eps layers there were no significant differences in polysaccharide concentrations between the msbc and the control groups 3 3 3 effects of msbc on the activity of key enzymes and the microbial community it is well known that protease is capable of catalysing the hydrolysis of proteins to amino acids feng et al 2014 the acid forming enzymes such as ak pta bk and ptb further catalyse small sized organic matter converting it to vfas in particular pta and ptb are responsible for decomposing acetyl coa and butyryl coa to acetyl and butyryl phosphate respectively which are further converted to acetate and butyrate under the action of ak and bk respectively feng et al 2009 and these process can generate atp by substrate level phosphorylation for subsequent methanogenesis smith and ingram smith 2007 the activities of these key enzymes in the control and msbc groups are summarised in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the activity of protease in the msbc group was 65 54 higher than that in the control group indicating that the msbc can improve the activity of protease and this is an important reason for the excellent hydrolysis performance of proteins in the msbc group in addition in comparison with the control group the acid forming related ak pta bk and ptb activities in the msbc group were increased by 11 60 37 50 31 29 and 44 67 respectively these results further prove that the msbc enhanced the hydrolysis acidification of sludge fig 3 b by improved relevant enzymes activities thereby providing more simple and available substrates for methanogenesis the increasing enzyme activity i e protease ak pta bk and ptb could be ascribed to the fe species in msbc that can provide necessary trace elements for enzyme synthesis or stimulate the expression of enzyme genes tian et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 moreover the cof420 could represent the methanogenic activity because it is not only the most likely but also possibly the only candidate enzyme for creating an electrochemical gradient to drive atp synthesis when methanogens generate energy during growth on acetate smith and ingram smith 2007 and with the effect of msbc the activity of cof420 was increased by 34 21 indicating that the msbc is capable of strengthening methanogenesis during the whole ad process which also confirms that the msbc enhanced net cumulative methane production from sludge to evaluate the effects of the msbc on the microbial community structure the microbial diversity and microbial community constituents of ad were analysed by high throughput sequencing the microbial alpha diversity measurements are shown in table s4 sm all samples exhibited high coverage levels of over 0 99 which was sufficient to capture most of the microbial diversity with regard to bacterial communities in comparison with the control group the lower shannon and higher simpson indexes were found in the msbc group indicating that the msbc decreased bacterial diversity in ad however the differences in the average values of both the shannon and simpson indices at the archaeal otu level were insignificant between the control and the msbc groups suggesting that the msbc had a negligible effect on archaeal species diversity moreover at both the archaeal otu level and bacterial otu level the average values of both the ace index and the chao index were lower in the msbc group than in the control group suggesting that the msbc can reduce the richness of both bacterial and archaeal species a reasonable explanation is that the msbc enriched some functional microorganisms and increased their relative abundance resulting in low species richness this result can also be corroborated by an analysis of the changes in the bacterial and archaeal community structure fig 11 shows the changes in microbial community structure in the control and msbc groups as shown in fig 11 a the bacterial communities at the phylum level in both groups mainly comprised acetothermia proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidota a notable result evident from fig 11 a is that the average proportions of the dominant phyla acetothermia and proteobacteria respectively increased from 10 5 and 14 0 to 18 1 and 15 4 after adding the msbc indicating a significant positive effect of the msbc addition on the abundances of these two phyla acetothermia which accounted for the largest average proportion in both the control and msbc groups has been reported to play important functional roles in consuming peptides amino acids and simple sugars to produce acetate but have limited capacities for extracellular hydrolysis of polysaccharides kadnikov et al 2019 it is thus plausible that the msbc can enhance protein degradation by increasing the relative abundance of acetothermia during the ad process which is consistent with the enhanced hydrolysis acidification performance of sludge fig 3 this phenomenon may also explain the lower soluble protein concentrations and unchanged soluble polysaccharides of the msbc group in comparison with the control group fig 4 after msbc addition the abundance of proteobacteria the second most dominant species also increased by 10 proteobacteria has been reported to serve as an essential consumer of glucose and long chain vfas ariesyady et al 2007 xu et al 2018 and most of the well known electroactive bacteria e g geobacter and shewanella species belong to the proteobacteria phylum lovley et al 2004 zhou et al 2014 accordingly the msbc may strengthen syntrophic metabolism of simple organic matter via triggering diet between proteobacteria phylum and electroactive methanogens fig 11 b also demonstrates that at the genus level g norank c acetothermiia g norank o aminicenantales thermovirga and g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 were the dominant bacterial genera in both the control and msbc groups significantly as shown in fig 11 b the average percentages of g norank c acetothermiia thermovirga and g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 were higher in the msbc group than in the control group 18 1 vs 10 5 4 2 vs 3 3 and 3 6 vs 2 7 respectively indicating that the msbc evidently increased the relative abundances of these genera although the g norank c acetothermiia with the highest relative abundance had not been clearly ranked its phylum acetothermia has been reported to perform acetate type fermentation kadnikov et al 2019 youssef et al 2019 suggesting that the msbc can improve acetate production and stimulate acetotrophic methanogenesis also the enriched g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 was reported to be functionally important in the hydrolysis of proteins mei et al 2020 further indicating that the msbc improved the protein degradation of sludge by enriching the genera g norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 in addition thermovirga are capable of metabolising amino acids with the reduction of elemental sulphur and it has the potential ability to transfer electrons to the other extracellular electron acceptors he et al 2020 it is thus plausible that the msbc enriched electroactive bacteria and facilitated diet based syntrophic metabolism as shown in fig 11 c archaea community analysis at the genus level indicates that the methanogens with the highest relative abundance in both the control and msbc groups were methanosaeta followed by the genera candidatus methanofastidiosum methanobacterium and methanolinea methanosaeta the well known absolutely acetoclastic methanogens i e methanosaeta accounted for 56 2 in the msbc group which was significantly higher than that in the control group 45 6 this result suggests that msbc could improve acetoclastic methanogenesis the enhanced methanosaeta related acetoclastic methanogenesis can be attributed to two aspects first it has been reported that cof420 is not only the most likely but also possibly the only candidate enzyme for creating an electrochemical gradient to drive atp synthesis when methanosaeta generate energy during growth on acetate smith and ingram smith 2007 consequently the enhanced cof420 activity improved the methanosaeta related acetate dependent metabolism second the improvement of hydrolysis acidification performance at an early stage can provide more acetate for stimulating acetoclastic methanogenesis in addition previous studies have reported that methanosaeta is an electroactive methanogen and is capable of producing ch4 from co2 by performing diet rotaru et al 2014 combining that methanosaeta is the only electroactive methanogens enriched by msbc it thus is a reasonable hypothesis that msbc may stimulate diet between methanosaeta and electroactive bacteria such as thermovirga during the whole ad process which is consistent with the findings of he et al 2020 who have found that biochar stimulated syntrophic methanogenesis which might mainly be performed by abundant thermovirga and methanosaeta in contrast the relative abundance of h2 dependent methylotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum and hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium decreased significantly with msbc addition from 35 5 to 26 3 and 7 0 to 5 9 respectively these results indicate that the msbc increases the ch4 content in biogas by enhancing diet based rather than iiht based co2 reduction methanogenesis 3 4 possible mechanisms of the improvement in ad due to msbc and future implications the proposed mechanisms of the enhancement in sludge s ad performance due to the msbc are depicted in fig 12 the msbc as the conductive additive improves the hydrolysis acidification efficiency and the syntrophic metabolism rate for higher sludge digestion performance in particular the msbc can improve iet and some key enzyme activities related to the hydrolysis acidification of sludge these positive effects significantly improve the hydrolysis acidification of sludge thereby generating more available substrates for subsequent methanogenesis with regard to the methanogenic syntrophic metabolism is an essential process for ch4 generation and eet between syntrophic microorganisms plays a key role in the efficiency of syntrophic metabolism the results of the cyt c concentrations hydrogenase f420 activities and electrochemical performance of sludge and eps demonstrated that the msbc boosted eet by weakening iiht and strengthening the diet pathway thus enhancing co2 dependent methanogenesis and increasing the ch4 content in biogas which can also be further proved by the enrichment of electroactive bacteria and archaea such as thermovirga and methanosaeta however although the msbc can enhance diet based co2 dependent methanogenesis it wasn t the unique contributor for msbc improving sludge ad performance it is concluded that msbc can enrich the methanosaeta and effectively enhance acetoclastic methanogenesis due to the promotion of acetate production via enhancing hydrolysis acidification cof420 activity and changing the electron transfer pathway from iiht to diet previous studies on the application of cms to enhance ad of sludge have mainly focused on the establishment of the diet pathway lei et al 2019 liu et al 2021 wan et al 2021 yun et al 2021 unlike these studies this study comprehensively investigated the mechanism by which the msbc influences ad of sludge and highlighted that the enhancement of hydrolysis acidification and establishment of a more favourable anaerobic environment for acetoclastic methanogenesis are two non negligible reasons for methane production by the msbc not just due to the diet based reinforcement on co2 dependent methanogenesis pathway moreover it should be noted that sludges with different solid contents will lead to different degrees of acid accumulation in the face of different degrees of acid accumulation the role of diet pathway in strengthening ad with msbc may also be different therefore future work is required to evaluate the effects of msbc on the ad of sludges with varying solid content which will provide some important reference for the ad of other perishable organic wastes 4 conclusions a novel green composite cm with high conductivity and stability was successfully synthesised using the ball milling carbonisation approach it was concluded that with the addition of the green msbc composite the ad of sludge was enhanced for example the production of vfas increased by 14 13 and the ch4 yield significantly increased by 45 36 in addition the ch4 content in biogas was also slightly improved with msbc addition in the whole ad process according to the results of further research the underlying mechanism of ad enhancement by the msbc can enhance the activities of key enzymes such as protease ak pta bk ptb and cof420 including the hydrolysis acidification related enzymes and the methanogenesis related enzymes which could promote the generation efficiency of acetate and improve the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway thereby resulting in an enrichment of acetoclastic methanogens i e methanosaeta moreover co2 reduction based methanogenesis was also upgraded owing to the enhancement of eet and the increase of cyt c by msbc which provides a more favourable environment for the growth of methanosaeta the positive effects of the msbc on sludge digestion can thus be ascribed to the enhancement of hydrolysis acidification and the efficient syntrophic metabolism between acidification bacteria and methanogens i e methanosaeta declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgment this work was

15847,rational design of cross sectional microstructure in ceramic membranes has shown to improve membrane filtration efficacy without affecting rejection performance in this work we adopted 3d spray coating technique to generate multi layered membrane layers on macro porous flat sheet ceramic supports the thickness of each layer was controlled by spray coating cycles and a gradient membrane layer was rationalized by successively coating three ceramic slurries containing alumina powders of gradually refined particle sizes followed by co sintering gradient membrane layers on both sides of the various sized flat sheet ceramic supports were fabricated compared to the non gradient counterpart the gradient membranes showed both higher pure water flux at the same tmp and lower membrane resistance which clearly evidenced the benefits of gradient profile in the membrane layer further their performance in aerobic membrane bioreactors aembr was comparably studied for the first time the treatment performance was not significantly affected by the types of membranes used while the gradient membrane showed better filtration performance i e a slower rise in tmp although the fouling mechanisms were revealed to be similar the fouling layer in the gradient membrane was composed of a higher percentage of smaller foulants compared to that of the non gradient counterpart the observed differences were closely correlated to the larger internal pore structure in the gradient membrane the present work provides a feasible 3d spray coating technique for the fabrication of gradient flat sheet ceramic membranes and clarifies the benefits in aembr for domestic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane additive manufacturing gradient microstructure aerobic membrane bioreactor membrane fouling mechanism 1 introduction membrane processes have been known as one of the most energy efficient and effective technologies for sustainable water reclamation wastewater treatment and reuse asif and zhang 2021 warsinger et al 2018 yin et al 2016 among them aerobic membrane bioreactors aembrs with the integration of membrane filtration and aerobic activated sludge treatment process is capable of complete biomass retention and consistently high quality effluent production chen et al 2016 xie et al 2015 yue et al 2015 which has been widely regarded as a promising technology for wastewater treatment albeit at an energy cost in the membrane filtration process it is the interactions between the membrane surface and feed solution that largely govern the treatment performance zhao et al 2018 therefore there is need to carefully rationalize the physicochemical properties of filtration membranes fan et al 2018 nunes et al 2020 due to the high mechanical strength outstanding chemical resistance and good hydrophilicity ceramic membranes are increasingly preferred over the polymeric counterparts especially when used in harsh conditions with aggressive and corrosive chemicals lópez et al 2020 liu et al 2019 in spite of these advantages membrane fouling is still a largely unresolved issue in ceramic membranes when applied in wastewater treatment meng et al 2017 yue et al 2018 with the foulants deposited within the pores and on the surfaces of ceramic membranes fluid movement becomes impeded thereby giving rise to an increase in the transmembrane pressure at constant flux or the decline in permeate flux at constant pressure methods to reduce the membrane fouling of ceramic membranes include pre treatment of the feed suspensions deng et al 2019 guo et al 2020 li et al 2020a optimisation of the operating conditions such as operating flux solids retention time or hydraulic retention time ouyang and liu 2009 and surface modification of ceramic membranes gu et al 2020a 2020b among them surface modification of ceramic membranes has been widely adopted to minimise foulant attachment mustafa et al 2016 2014 appropriately modified membrane surfaces can be effective in the short term while their stability would be suspect especially when a fouling layer is formed or a chemical cleaning is conducted compared with the surface modifications microstructure engineering of intrinsically robust ceramic membranes would be more durable and thus be more promising in realizing the long term antifouling for wastewater treatment however due to the brittleness and hardness of ceramic materials and the limitation in conventional fabrication process for them it would be rather challenging to deliberately regulate the pore microstructure of ceramic membranes by these traditional techniques fortunately with the recent advances in nanotechnology and additive manufacturing techniques attempts have been increasingly made to develop ceramic membranes with newly structural features till now ceramic membranes with holy interlayer fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 2020 2021 interlayer free cho et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 gradient interlayer ng et al 2020 and surface patterns lyu et al 2020 ng et al 2022 have been reported these recently developed ceramic membranes generally showed improvements in water permeability because of the reduced filtration resistance or and increased surface area among them ceramic membranes with gradient microstructure showed notable improvements in both water flux and fouling alleviation ng et al 2020 the gradient microstructure refers to the gradually narrowed pore size from the substrate to the top layer which is produced by the successive deposition of gradually refined ceramic powders however a couple of drawbacks and limitations in previous work need to be addressed for scalable fabrication and practical application of ceramic membranes for example the ceramic suspensions were prepared at low temperature 4 c and several rounds of high speed spin coating 4000 rpm were required as a result the thickness of each layer could be hardly controlled besides the spin coating method was largely suitable to prepare small sized and single sided ceramic membranes although the dip coating method is advantageous in forming a membrane layer on both sides of flat sheet ceramic supports li et al 2020b 2019 it is not reliable to directly produce multi layer layers since the dip coating process relies largely on the capillary force generated by the porous ceramic substrate generally these multi layered ceramic membrane layers are prepared by repeatedly coating sintering of each layer zou et al 2020 and several cycles of the coating sintering process are thus required which is apparently both time and energy consuming therefore it would be of considerable value to explore the cost efficient and scalable construction of gradient layers in ceramic membranes 3d spray coating is a subfamily of additive manufacturing and an advanced spray coating technique wei et al 2017 zou et al 2019 it can generate layered structures with a relatively high degree of controllability and reproducibility due to the programmed coating process in this study we therefore adopted the novel 3d spray coating technique to build the multi layered ceramic membranes on macro porous ceramic supports after that we have assessed the performances of these gradient ceramic membranes in laboratory scale submerged aembrs for wastewater treatment which has rarely been reported the aims of this work are to determine i whether the treatment efficacy will be significantly affected by the gradient profile in ceramic membranes ii the differences in membrane fouling rate between the gradient and non gradient ceramic membranes and iii whether there is any difference in fouling mechanism between the gradient and non gradient ceramic membranes our study showed that the treatment performance in aembrs was not significantly affected by the membrane types while the membrane fouling rate of the gradient ceramic membranes was significantly slowed down to less than half compared to the non gradient ceramic membranes to the best of our knowledge this is the first direct proof of the advantages of the gradient ceramic membranes in aembrs for wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication of gradient profile ceramic membranes commercial alumina powders with different average particle sizes d 50 1 7 μm d 50 0 83 μm and d 50 0 4 μm were purchased from sumitomo chemical co ltd japan and used without any purification alumina powders 20 wt were dispersed in nitric acid aqueous solution ph 1 5 sigma aldrich singapore by successive treatments of magnetic stirring 10 min and ultrasonicating 30 min methyl cellulose solution 2 wt sigma aldrich singapore as the binder was then added followed by continuously stirring at room temperature for 2 h during the stirring process the dispersion was isolated in vacuum to remove the bubbles after that a stable dispersion was obtained commercially available macro porous ceramic supports were cleaned in water using ultrasonic treatment 15 min twice and dried at 110 c overnight the microstructural characteristics of the microporous ceramic supports are shown in figure s1 for the 3d spray coating process as illustrated in fig 1 a the as prepared alumina dispersion was loaded into the syringe and the mass loading sprayed out from the nozzle was controlled by the squeezing speed i e 1 5 ml min the movement of spray nozzle was programmed on the surface of ceramic supports with a fixed distance of h 20 mm other processing parameters including the squeezing speed of the syringe f the moving speed of spray nozzle v and the distance between each line d were fixed at 1 5 ml min 25 mm s and 5 mm respectively table 1 while the thickness of each layer was tailored by the coating cycles n as illustrated in fig 1 b given that the top layer of commercial microfiltration ceramic membranes used in aembr applications jin et al 2013 is composed of alumina particles with the particle size in the range of 300 500 nm figure s2 alumina powders with a comparable particle size e g 400 nm should be used as the top layer in this way the pore size of the prepared membranes would be similar to that of the commercial ones and the results can thus be directly valuable and comparable to practical application based on our previous work ng et al 2020 herein the gradient g membranes were prepared by repeatedly spray coating the suspensions with different alumina powders of 1600 nm 830 nm and 400 nm in particle sizes successively for each type of alumina powders the thickness of the coating layer as a function of coating cycles was established as can been seen in figure s3 the thickness of coating layer increased linearly with the coating cycles suggesting the good controllability of the 3d spray coating technique further the integrity of the membrane layer was examined by looking into the pore size distribution and the pure water flux as a function of transmembrane pressure aiming at avoiding the large pores and getting a high linear relationship between the pure water flux and tmp in this regard the minimized cycling number of each layer was presented in table 2 for comparison purpose non gradient ng membranes were prepared by spray coating alumina suspension with the finest alumina powders i e 400 nm and 6 times of coating cycles were required to obtain a comparable thickness to that of the g membranes table 2 compared with the traditional spray coating method wei et al 2017 zou et al 2019 the 3d spray coating technique as an emerging additive manufacturing process enables the continuous preparation of relatively large sized membrane layers in this work we adopted such an advanced technique to prepare the flat sheet ceramic membranes by successively coating the membrane layers on the substrate surface fig 1 c the well controlled downward deposition process enabled the construction of steadily gradient coating layer which is however rather challenging by using other conventional coating methods such as dip coating and spin coating ng et al 2020 multichannel flat sheet ceramic membranes with g and ng structures on both sides were fabricated by subsequent co firing at 1400 c for 2 h with a ramping rate of 1 c min 2 2 membrane characterisation scanning electron microscopy sem supra300 zeiss germany was used to examine the microstructure of the starting alumina powders ceramic porous supports and the as prepared ceramic membranes the pore size distribution was measured by

et al 2019 briefly pure water was prepared by filtering ultrapure water milli q millipore australia through 0 02 μm filters and used as prepared membrane samples were cleaned via ultrasonication at 42 khz for 10 min three times in pure water this was followed by a pre filtration step with pure water for 10 min at a pressure of 100 kpa a constant pressure of 100 kpa in the dead end filtration was maintained by dinitrogen gas weight of the permeate and the corresponding permeation time of 10 min were recorded for the calculation of pwf membrane resistance was determined in a similar manner with pressure varied from 50 kpa to 200 kpa with the corresponding fluxes recorded all tests took place at 25 c 2 3 aerobic membrane bioreactor aembr setup and operation two identical 5 l aembrs were used to test the differences in performance between g and ng membranes each ceramic membrane with an effective surface area of 0 008 m2 was submerged between two baffle plates below which an air diffuser was installed to provide aeration and blend the mixed liquor ph 7 0 0 2 the aembrs were operated at room temperature 30 3 c with constant aeration of 1 2 0 2 l min inoculum was obtained from a local water reclamation plant ulu pandan water reclamation plant singapore with a mixed liquor concentration of 3 4 g l solid retention time was 10 days with desludging occurring 4 times a day hydraulic retention time was 7 h with domestic wastewater after primary sedimentation obtained from a local water reclamation plant ulu pandan water reclamation plant singapore as the feed source a subcritical flux of 30 lmh was maintained by means of a peristaltic pump at an operation cycle of 9 min suction with 1 min relaxation no backwash was applied during the relaxation the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored by a digital pressure gauge smc zse80f and logged every 1 h by means of a data logger the cutoff tmp was set at 30 kpa before the membrane was deemed as fouled and a chemical cleaning was then conducted the fouled membrane was cleaned ex situ with sequential backwash 45 lmh using sodium hypochloride 0 5 wt and citric acid 2 wt for 4 h in each sequence the cleaned membranes were then rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water until its pwf recovery was above 90 when returned into the mbrs the next filtration run in an aembr then began the time taken for the membrane to reach its cutoff tmp was termed as the filtration period for each type of membrane a total number of 30 filtration periods was conducted in this study sacrificial membranes were used to maintain the activated sludge at the working operating conditions during the membrane cleaning process and the overall operating period of each mbr was over 300 days 2 4 physico chemical analyses mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured according to the standard methods for water and wastewater baird 2017 chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by the 5220d closed reflux colorimetric method in the standard methods baird 2017 protein and carbohydrate concentrations in the soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps were quantified by the lowry s method fr et al 1995 shen et al 2013 and the dubois method dubois et al 1956 respectively a total of 77 samples were collected from each mbr in this study and t test was used to determine the significance of any difference between g and ng membranes liquid chromatography organic carbon detector lc ocd doc lab germany was used to identify and quantify the organic matters in the fouling layers resistance in series model was used to determine the cake layer and pore blocking resistances of the fouled membranes a total of 77 samples were collected from each mbr in this study and t test was used to determine the significance of any difference between g and ng membranes a total of 30 samples were collected from the fouling layer 30 filtration cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 microstructure sem images of the ceramic support and the three alumina powders are presented in fig 2 a and fig 2 b d respectively after the successive coating of the three alumina powders with the average size of 1 7 μm 0 83 μm and 0 4 μm on the ceramic support fig 2 e gradient g membranes can be obtained followed by co sintering at 1400 c for 2 h as can be observed in the cross sectional sem images fig 2 f h clear boundaries can be observed at the interfaces between adjacent layers including the one between the first layer and the support fig 2 f as well the penetration has been completely avoided this feature is an essential foundation for highly permeable ceramic membranes since the penetration of coating layer on the sublayer would largely increase the innate membrane resistance cho et al 2020 zou et al 2018 according to the sem image fig 2 i the thickness of layer i layer ii and layer iii was measured to be about 22 3 μm 14 6 μm and 9 5 μm respectively as has been demonstrated previously zou et al 2020 a membrane layer of 40 μm in thickness is required to fully cover the rough surface of the porous supports and a reliable filtration characteristic can thus be delivered for comparison non gradient membranes with a comparable membrane thickness 39 3 μm were prepared by coating the finest alumina powders on the microporous supports fig 3 a b however a severe penetration layer can be observed in the non gradient membrane fig 3 a since the particle size was much smaller than the pore size of macro porous supports according to the h p equation jiang et al 2022 which quantitively describes the relationship between the membrane resistance and microstructure characteristics such as open porosity and pore size the membrane resistance will increase with the decrease in pore size and open porosity the penetration layer would narrow the pore size and decrease the porosity in the sublayer and the membrane resistance would be increased therefore it would be desirable to build the gradient porous microstructure in ceramic membranes in which the penetration can be avoided due to the same type of alumina powders used in the top layer both g and ng membranes showed identical porous surface microstructure fig 3 c and 3 e and both were crack free fig 3 d and 3 f dual sided flat sheet ceramic membranes typically seen in commercial applications were generally prepared by dip coating chen et al 2016 which is however not applicable for the efficient preparation of gradient membranes in contrast the 3d spray coating technique developed in this work was highly adaptable first the up downward spray coating process ensured that the coating layers were confined on the surface through layer by layer deposition second the programmable 3d spray coating was capable of fabricating large sized membrane layer through the combined movements of the platform x axis and the spray nozzle y axis as an example gradient ceramic membranes in the sizes of 25 mm by 25 mm and 70 mm by 70 mm were successfully produced this suggests that 3d spray coating technique is promising for the fabrication of large sized gradient membranes for commercial applications 3 1 2 pure water flux and membrane resistance ceramic membranes with the dimensions of 25 mm 25 mm and 70 mm 70 mm were fabricated as shown in fig 4 a the pure water flux of the g membranes was much higher 1 6 times than that of the ng membranes both sized membranes showed the same trend which suggested the ability of the 3d spray coating process to fabricate large sized membranes the membrane resistance of both membranes was evaluated by measuring the pure water flux at different tmps as shown in fig 4 b the g membranes showed comparatively lower membrane resistances compared to those ng counterparts regardless of the size the results as indicated by higher pure water flux at the same tmp and lower membrane resistance clearly evidenced the advantages of g membranes smaller differences in pure water flux and membrane resistance were observed in the g membranes suggesting that the 3d spray coating technique are more suitable in fabricating g membranes in terms of reproducibility 3 3 aembr treatment performance two aembrs were identically operated for over 300 days with membrane types interchanged between the two reactors after each fouling cycle to eliminate any minute physical differences in each reactor that could affect the performance evaluation tmp of the aembrs showed that the g membrane consistently fouled more slowly than the ng counterpart figure s4 the average filtration periods of the gradient and non gradient membranes were 10 2 1 0 days and 4 6 0 6 days respectively fig 5 the longer filtration period of gradient membrane was over two times that of the non gradient counterpart and the difference was statistically significant t test p value 1 8 10 30 this result demonstrated the effectiveness of having a gradient profile in the cross section of a ceramic membrane compared to those non gradient ones which have been widely used this observation is compounded by a lower initial tmp value in the gradient membrane since both membrane types were operated at identical constant flux conditions the gradient membrane with a lower membrane resistance fig 4 b would present a lower initial tmp value this meant that compared to the non gradient counterpart the gradient membrane had a larger difference between the cut off tmp and the initial pressure as such the longer filtration period should be largely related to the lower initial tmp and the lower r m of the gradient membrane gradient profile or asymmetric pore structure similarly showed higher permeability and lower fouling rate compared to homogeneous membranes fallahianbijan et al 2021 further corresponding to our observation the rates of membrane fouling regardless of the lower initial tmp were slower in asymmetric membranes compared to the homogeneous membranes membrane fouling rates were calculated to be 2 8 0 4 kpa day and 6 8 0 8 kpa day for g and ng membranes respectively these results consistently showed that a properly designed pore structure was essential to enhance the filtration fan et al 2018 and these gradient membranes were beneficial in this aspect more importantly the newly developed 3d spray coating process showed good scalability in fabricating such gradient ceramic membranes which would be vital for scale up and eventual commercialization the successful application of a membrane in an mbr does not lie in the fouling rate alone it is equally important for the treatment efficiency to be comparable to that of conventional membranes in this aspect we have compared the cod removals between the two types of membranes table 3 the cod removal efficiency was 93 in both gradient and non gradient membranes both types of membranes were equally effective in physically separating solids in the activated sludge from the treated supernatant this was because of the similar pore sizes found in the active filtration layer top layer of the membrane 100 200 nm figure s5 also the mlvss to mlss ratios in both aembrs were 0 8 which indicated that the membrane type had no impact on healthy bacterial growth a more comprehensive comparison of performance parameters can be found in table s1 the combination of these parameters suggested that the gradient membrane had no impact on the overall treatment performance which was essentially biological based coupled with the beneficial effect of gradient membranes conferred on fouling reduction the results implied that gradient membranes would be more effectively when applied in aembrs for wastewater treatment 3 4 fouling characterisation membrane fouling has commonly been linked to the presence of organics in an mbr ng and ng 2010 in which proteinaceous and carbonaceous compounds are generally the most important organic foulants both these compounds can be found in smp and eps although it is still not clear which one is the dominant player towards membrane fouling arabi and nakhla 2008 lin et al 2009 protein and carbohydrate concentrations in smp and eps were not affected by the membrane types used in the present work table 4 this observation was not unexpected since these parameters are typically affected by operating conditions such as hydraulic retention time solids retention time aeration or the type of feedstock used which were all identical between the aembrs operated in this study furthermore both membrane types were fabricated with identical materials especially that of the surface layer which was in direct contact to the mixed liquor as such the differences in fouling rate could only be attributed to the differences in pore structure between the two membranes this meant that understanding the differences in the fouling layers was crucial in elucidating the fouling mechanisms of the two membranes furthermore the particle size distribution of the activated sludge in both aembrs showed no significant difference between each other figure s6 and as such floc size could be discounted as a possible factor that influenced differences in fouling profiles in our study resistances of the fouled membranes at 30 kpa were determined using the resistance in series ris model fouling resistances of the cake layer hydraulically reversible r r and of the pore blocking foulants hydraulically irreversible r ir appeared to be marginally different between the two membranes fig 6 t tests conducted between r ir and r r of the two membranes during the 30 filtration cycles n 30 however showed that their differences were significant p value r ir 2 0 10 8 p value r r 2 5 10 7 such differences were previously explained by the pore constriction in gradient membranes which was more severe in this work because of the larger internal voids that could trap a large quantity of particles ng et al 2020 resulting in a comparatively higher r ir also the larger interconnected voids in gradient structure could lent to the lower tmp and slower fouling development since fluid could flow around in case of any pore blockage ho and zydney 2001 therefore a trade off between ease of membrane cleaning and longer operating period should be reached and regular backwash could further reduce hydraulically irreversible foulants in the gradient membranes it will be of interest to determine how routine membrane cleaning with the occasional recovery cleaning steps practiced in full scale mbrs would affect the fouling rate and resistances of the fouled membrane proteins and carbohydrates are recognised as the two main foulants in mbrs meng et al 2017 further analysis of the foulant composition showed that proteinaceous compounds constituted 64 3 and 68 4 in the fouling layers of gradient and non gradient membranes respectively figure s7 the similarities in foulant composition suggested that fouling mechanisms were not significantly different between the two membrane types because of the identical materials used rather membrane fouling was delayed as the pore structure of the gradient membrane allowed for better fluid flow across the membrane layer a comparison of fouling mechanism of different foulants and particle sizes between gradient and non gradient membranes showed that the fouling development proceeded from pore blocking to cake layer formation which was largely dependent on the particle size particularly the transition between pore blocking and cake filtration was not observed when foulants were larger than the surface pores of the membrane ng et al 2020 it is recognised that more information on the foulant composition can be obtained if hydraulically reversible and hydraulically irreversible foulants were analysed separated however because both membranes were fabricated of the same material it was unlikely that there would be differences in the foulant composition lc ocd analyses of the foulants further corroborated the proposed fouling mechanism in the gradient membrane five groups of organic compounds namely biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight lmw neutrals and lmw acids of molecular weights 20 000 da 1 000 da 300 450 da 350 da and 350 da respectively were represented for the analysis fig 7 larger foulants of 1 000 da biopolymers and humic substances were found to constitute 55 9 in the fouling layer of non gradient membrane while they constituted only 47 4 in the gradient counterpart conversely greater amounts of low molecular weight compounds were found in the gradient membrane compared to those found in the non gradient membrane foulants of smaller sizes can easily pass through the larger surface pores of both membranes however these foulants were about to block internal pores more effectively in the non gradient membranes thereby resulting in a faster tmp rise this was a direct result of the difference in pore structure of the two membranes on the other hand these smaller foulants were also able to adhere to the internal surfaces of the gradient membrane where the larger internal voids allowed the fluid to flow around these foulants therefore resulting in a slower tmp increase the temporal effect of membrane fouling would have to be considered as well with larger internal voids the gradient membrane would allow for a gradual accumulation of these small foulants over time although it was slower before achieving the same cutoff tmp of 30 kpa for both membrane types as schematically illustrated in fig 8 because of the larger internal pore structure and the longer filtration period experienced by the gradient membrane before cleaning smaller particles and organics with lower molecular weights would have a greater runway to accumulate within the fouling layer ng et al 2020 irreversible pore blocking was found to be a direct consequence of smaller particles in the fouling layer in which smaller particles tended to fill the gaps in the larger internal pores of both the fouling and membrane structures wang et al 2021 besides the interaction between these accumulated smaller foulants and the surface of these larger internal voids should be strong enough as such it was natural that a higher percentage of smaller foulants were found in gradient membranes nevertheless the fouling mechanisms of both membranes were similar albeit retarded in the gradient membrane which effectively demonstrated that a gradient ceramic membrane was beneficial in aembr for wastewater treatment 4 conclusions 3d spray coating technique with high controllability and scalability was developed to fabricate gradient ceramic membranes and their performance in aembrs for treating domestic wastewater were comprehensively assessed 1 scalability of the 3d spray coating technique to fabricate gradient ceramic membranes was successfully demonstrated 2 gradient membranes at various scales showed markedly higher pure water flux and lower membrane resistance compared to the non gradient counterpart 3 treatment performance was not affected by the membrane type used while the gradient membrane showed better filtration performance with a slower tmp rise 4 fouling mechanisms were similar between the two membrane types but a retarded fouling was observed in case of using the gradient membrane 5 foulant composition from the gradient membrane showed a higher percentage of smaller foulants compared to the non gradient counterpart the longer filtration exposure with larger internal pore structure may have allowed more smaller foulants to have attached internally this work clearly demonstrated the benefits of

15847,rational design of cross sectional microstructure in ceramic membranes has shown to improve membrane filtration efficacy without affecting rejection performance in this work we adopted 3d spray coating technique to generate multi layered membrane layers on macro porous flat sheet ceramic supports the thickness of each layer was controlled by spray coating cycles and a gradient membrane layer was rationalized by successively coating three ceramic slurries containing alumina powders of gradually refined particle sizes followed by co sintering gradient membrane layers on both sides of the various sized flat sheet ceramic supports were fabricated compared to the non gradient counterpart the gradient membranes showed both higher pure water flux at the same tmp and lower membrane resistance which clearly evidenced the benefits of gradient profile in the membrane layer further their performance in aerobic membrane bioreactors aembr was comparably studied for the first time the treatment performance was not significantly affected by the types of membranes used while the gradient membrane showed better filtration performance i e a slower rise in tmp although the fouling mechanisms were revealed to be similar the fouling layer in the gradient membrane was composed of a higher percentage of smaller foulants compared to that of the non gradient counterpart the observed differences were closely correlated to the larger internal pore structure in the gradient membrane the present work provides a feasible 3d spray coating technique for the fabrication of gradient flat sheet ceramic membranes and clarifies the benefits in aembr for domestic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membrane additive manufacturing gradient microstructure aerobic membrane bioreactor membrane fouling mechanism 1 introduction membrane processes have been known as one of the most energy efficient and effective technologies for sustainable water reclamation wastewater treatment and reuse asif and zhang 2021 warsinger et al 2018 yin et al 2016 among them aerobic membrane bioreactors aembrs with the integration of membrane filtration and aerobic activated sludge treatment process is capable of complete biomass retention and consistently high quality effluent production chen et al 2016 xie et al 2015 yue et al 2015 which has been widely regarded as a promising technology for wastewater treatment albeit at an energy cost in the membrane filtration process it is the interactions between the membrane surface and feed solution that largely govern the treatment performance zhao et al 2018 therefore there is need to carefully rationalize the physicochemical properties of filtration membranes fan et al 2018 nunes et al 2020 due to the high mechanical strength outstanding chemical resistance and good hydrophilicity ceramic membranes are increasingly preferred over the polymeric counterparts especially when used in harsh conditions with aggressive and corrosive chemicals lópez et al 2020 liu et al 2019 in spite of these advantages membrane fouling is still a largely unresolved issue in ceramic membranes when applied in wastewater treatment meng et al 2017 yue et al 2018 with the foulants deposited within the pores and on the surfaces of ceramic membranes fluid movement becomes impeded thereby giving rise to an increase in the transmembrane pressure at constant flux or the decline in permeate flux at constant pressure methods to reduce the membrane fouling of ceramic membranes include pre treatment of the feed suspensions deng et al 2019 guo et al 2020 li et al 2020a optimisation of the operating conditions such as operating flux solids retention time or hydraulic retention time ouyang and liu 2009 and surface modification of ceramic membranes gu et al 2020a 2020b among them surface modification of ceramic membranes has been widely adopted to minimise foulant attachment mustafa et al 2016 2014 appropriately modified membrane surfaces can be effective in the short term while their stability would be suspect especially when a fouling layer is formed or a chemical cleaning is conducted compared with the surface modifications microstructure engineering of intrinsically robust ceramic membranes would be more durable and thus be more promising in realizing the long term antifouling for wastewater treatment however due to the brittleness and hardness of ceramic materials and the limitation in conventional fabrication process for them it would be rather challenging to deliberately regulate the pore microstructure of ceramic membranes by these traditional techniques fortunately with the recent advances in nanotechnology and additive manufacturing techniques attempts have been increasingly made to develop ceramic membranes with newly structural features till now ceramic membranes with holy interlayer fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 2020 2021 interlayer free cho et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 gradient interlayer ng et al 2020 and surface patterns lyu et al 2020 ng et al 2022 have been reported these recently developed ceramic membranes generally showed improvements in water permeability because of the reduced filtration resistance or and increased surface area among them ceramic membranes with gradient microstructure showed notable improvements in both water flux and fouling alleviation ng et al 2020 the gradient microstructure refers to the gradually narrowed pore size from the substrate to the top layer which is produced by the successive deposition of gradually refined ceramic powders however a couple of drawbacks and limitations in previous work need to be addressed for scalable fabrication and practical application of ceramic membranes for example the ceramic suspensions were prepared at low temperature 4 c and several rounds of high speed spin coating 4000 rpm were required as a result the thickness of each layer could be hardly controlled besides the spin coating method was largely suitable to prepare small sized and single sided ceramic membranes although the dip coating method is advantageous in forming a membrane layer on both sides of flat sheet ceramic supports li et al 2020b 2019 it is not reliable to directly produce multi layer layers since the dip coating process relies largely on the capillary force generated by the porous ceramic substrate generally these multi layered ceramic membrane layers are prepared by repeatedly coating sintering of each layer zou et al 2020 and several cycles of the coating sintering process are thus required which is apparently both time and energy consuming therefore it would be of considerable value to explore the cost efficient and scalable construction of gradient layers in ceramic membranes 3d spray coating is a subfamily of additive manufacturing and an advanced spray coating technique wei et al 2017 zou et al 2019 it can generate layered structures with a relatively high degree of controllability and reproducibility due to the programmed coating process in this study we therefore adopted the novel 3d spray coating technique to build the multi layered ceramic membranes on macro porous ceramic supports after that we have assessed the performances of these gradient ceramic membranes in laboratory scale submerged aembrs for wastewater treatment which has rarely been reported the aims of this work are to determine i whether the treatment efficacy will be significantly affected by the gradient profile in ceramic membranes ii the differences in membrane fouling rate between the gradient and non gradient ceramic membranes and iii whether there is any difference in fouling mechanism between the gradient and non gradient ceramic membranes our study showed that the treatment performance in aembrs was not significantly affected by the membrane types while the membrane fouling rate of the gradient ceramic membranes was significantly slowed down to less than half compared to the non gradient ceramic membranes to the best of our knowledge this is the first direct proof of the advantages of the gradient ceramic membranes in aembrs for wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication of gradient profile ceramic membranes commercial alumina powders with different average particle sizes d 50 1 7 μm d 50 0 83 μm and d 50 0 4 μm were purchased from sumitomo chemical co ltd japan and used without any purification alumina powders 20 wt were dispersed in nitric acid aqueous solution ph 1 5 sigma aldrich singapore by successive treatments of magnetic stirring 10 min and ultrasonicating 30 min methyl cellulose solution 2 wt sigma aldrich singapore as the binder was then added followed by continuously stirring at room temperature for 2 h during the stirring process the dispersion was isolated in vacuum to remove the bubbles after that a stable dispersion was obtained commercially available macro porous ceramic supports were cleaned in water using ultrasonic treatment 15 min twice and dried at 110 c overnight the microstructural characteristics of the microporous ceramic supports are shown in figure s1 for the 3d spray coating process as illustrated in fig 1 a the as prepared alumina dispersion was loaded into the syringe and the mass loading sprayed out from the nozzle was controlled by the squeezing speed i e 1 5 ml min the movement of spray nozzle was programmed on the surface of ceramic supports with a fixed distance of h 20 mm other processing parameters including the squeezing speed of the syringe f the moving speed of spray nozzle v and the distance between each line d were fixed at 1 5 ml min 25 mm s and 5 mm respectively table 1 while the thickness of each layer was tailored by the coating cycles n as illustrated in fig 1 b given that the top layer of commercial microfiltration ceramic membranes used in aembr applications jin et al 2013 is composed of alumina particles with the particle size in the range of 300 500 nm figure s2 alumina powders with a comparable particle size e g 400 nm should be used as the top layer in this way the pore size of the prepared membranes would be similar to that of the commercial ones and the results can thus be directly valuable and comparable to practical application based on our previous work ng et al 2020 herein the gradient g membranes were prepared by repeatedly spray coating the suspensions with different alumina powders of 1600 nm 830 nm and 400 nm in particle sizes successively for each type of alumina powders the thickness of the coating layer as a function of coating cycles was established as can been seen in figure s3 the thickness of coating layer increased linearly with the coating cycles suggesting the good controllability of the 3d spray coating technique further the integrity of the membrane layer was examined by looking into the pore size distribution and the pure water flux as a function of transmembrane pressure aiming at avoiding the large pores and getting a high linear relationship between the pure water flux and tmp in this regard the minimized cycling number of each layer was presented in table 2 for comparison purpose non gradient ng membranes were prepared by spray coating alumina suspension with the finest alumina powders i e 400 nm and 6 times of coating cycles were required to obtain a comparable thickness to that of the g membranes table 2 compared with the traditional spray coating method wei et al 2017 zou et al 2019 the 3d spray coating technique as an emerging additive manufacturing process enables the continuous preparation of relatively large sized membrane layers in this work we adopted such an advanced technique to prepare the flat sheet ceramic membranes by successively coating the membrane layers on the substrate surface fig 1 c the well controlled downward deposition process enabled the construction of steadily gradient coating layer which is however rather challenging by using other conventional coating methods such as dip coating and spin coating ng et al 2020 multichannel flat sheet ceramic

coating of the three alumina powders with the average size of 1 7 μm 0 83 μm and 0 4 μm on the ceramic support fig 2 e gradient g membranes can be obtained followed by co sintering at 1400 c for 2 h as can be observed in the cross sectional sem images fig 2 f h clear boundaries can be observed at the interfaces between adjacent layers including the one between the first layer and the support fig 2 f as well the penetration has been completely avoided this feature is an essential foundation for highly permeable ceramic membranes since the penetration of coating layer on the sublayer would largely increase the innate membrane resistance cho et al 2020 zou et al 2018 according to the sem image fig 2 i the thickness of layer i layer ii and layer iii was measured to be about 22 3 μm 14 6 μm and 9 5 μm respectively as has been demonstrated previously zou et al 2020 a membrane layer of 40 μm in thickness is required to fully cover the rough surface of the porous supports and a reliable filtration characteristic can thus be delivered for comparison non gradient membranes with a comparable membrane thickness 39 3 μm were prepared by coating the finest alumina powders on the microporous supports fig 3 a b however a severe penetration layer can be observed in the non gradient membrane fig 3 a since the particle size was much smaller than the pore size of macro porous supports according to the h p equation jiang et al 2022 which quantitively describes the relationship between the membrane resistance and microstructure characteristics such as open porosity and pore size the membrane resistance will increase with the decrease in pore size and open porosity the penetration layer would narrow the pore size and decrease the porosity in the sublayer and the membrane resistance would be increased therefore it would be desirable to build the gradient porous microstructure in ceramic membranes in which the penetration can be avoided due to the same type of alumina powders used in the top layer both g and ng membranes showed identical porous surface microstructure fig 3 c and 3 e and both were crack free fig 3 d and 3 f dual sided flat sheet ceramic membranes typically seen in commercial applications were generally prepared by dip coating chen et al 2016 which is however not applicable for the efficient preparation of gradient membranes in contrast the 3d spray coating technique developed in this work was highly adaptable first the up downward spray coating process ensured that the coating layers were confined on the surface through layer by layer deposition second the programmable 3d spray coating was capable of fabricating large sized membrane layer through the combined movements of the platform x axis and the spray nozzle y axis as an example gradient ceramic membranes in the sizes of 25 mm by 25 mm and 70 mm by 70 mm were successfully produced this suggests that 3d spray coating technique is promising for the fabrication of large sized gradient membranes for commercial applications 3 1 2 pure water flux and membrane resistance ceramic membranes with the dimensions of 25 mm 25 mm and 70 mm 70 mm were fabricated as shown in fig 4 a the pure water flux of the g membranes was much higher 1 6 times than that of the ng membranes both sized membranes showed the same trend which suggested the ability of the 3d spray coating process to fabricate large sized membranes the membrane resistance of both membranes was evaluated by measuring the pure water flux at different tmps as shown in fig 4 b the g membranes showed comparatively lower membrane resistances compared to those ng counterparts regardless of the size the results as indicated by higher pure water flux at the same tmp and lower membrane resistance clearly evidenced the advantages of g membranes smaller differences in pure water flux and membrane resistance were observed in the g membranes suggesting that the 3d spray coating technique are more suitable in fabricating g membranes in terms of reproducibility 3 3 aembr treatment performance two aembrs were identically operated for over 300 days with membrane types interchanged between the two reactors after each fouling cycle to eliminate any minute physical differences in each reactor that could affect the performance evaluation tmp of the aembrs showed that the g membrane consistently fouled more slowly than the ng counterpart figure s4 the average filtration periods of the gradient and non gradient membranes were 10 2 1 0 days and 4 6 0 6 days respectively fig 5 the longer filtration period of gradient membrane was over two times that of the non gradient counterpart and the difference was statistically significant t test p value 1 8 10 30 this result demonstrated the effectiveness of having a gradient profile in the cross section of a ceramic membrane compared to those non gradient ones which have been widely used this observation is compounded by a lower initial tmp value in the gradient membrane since both membrane types were operated at identical constant flux conditions the gradient membrane with a lower membrane resistance fig 4 b would present a lower initial tmp value this meant that compared to the non gradient counterpart the gradient membrane had a larger difference between the cut off tmp and the initial pressure as such the longer filtration period should be largely related to the lower initial tmp and the lower r m of the gradient membrane gradient profile or asymmetric pore structure similarly showed higher permeability and lower fouling rate compared to homogeneous membranes fallahianbijan et al 2021 further corresponding to our observation the rates of membrane fouling regardless of the lower initial tmp were slower in asymmetric membranes compared to the homogeneous membranes membrane fouling rates were calculated to be 2 8 0 4 kpa day and 6 8 0 8 kpa day for g and ng membranes respectively these results consistently showed that a properly designed pore structure was essential to enhance the filtration fan et al 2018 and these gradient membranes were beneficial in this aspect more importantly the newly developed 3d spray coating process showed good scalability in fabricating such gradient ceramic membranes which would be vital for scale up and eventual commercialization the successful application of a membrane in an mbr does not lie in the fouling rate alone it is equally important for the treatment efficiency to be comparable to that of conventional membranes in this aspect we have compared the cod removals between the two types of membranes table 3 the cod removal efficiency was 93 in both gradient and non gradient membranes both types of membranes were equally effective in physically separating solids in the activated sludge from the treated supernatant this was because of the similar pore sizes found in the active filtration layer top layer of the membrane 100 200 nm figure s5 also the mlvss to mlss ratios in both aembrs were 0 8 which indicated that the membrane type had no impact on healthy bacterial growth a more comprehensive comparison of performance parameters can be found in table s1 the combination of these parameters suggested that the gradient membrane had no impact on the overall treatment performance which was essentially biological based coupled with the beneficial effect of gradient membranes conferred on fouling reduction the results implied that gradient membranes would be more effectively when applied in aembrs for wastewater treatment 3 4 fouling characterisation membrane fouling has commonly been linked to the presence of organics in an mbr ng and ng 2010 in which proteinaceous and carbonaceous compounds are generally the most important organic foulants both these compounds can be found in smp and eps although it is still not clear which one is the dominant player towards membrane fouling arabi and nakhla 2008 lin et al 2009 protein and carbohydrate concentrations in smp and eps were not affected by the membrane types used in the present work table 4 this observation was not unexpected since these parameters are typically affected by operating conditions such as hydraulic retention time solids retention time aeration or the type of feedstock used which were all identical between the aembrs operated in this study furthermore both membrane types were fabricated with identical materials especially that of the surface layer which was in direct contact to the mixed liquor as such the differences in fouling rate could only be attributed to the differences in pore structure between the two membranes this meant that understanding the differences in the fouling layers was crucial in elucidating the fouling mechanisms of the two membranes furthermore the particle size distribution of the activated sludge in both aembrs showed no significant difference between each other figure s6 and as such floc size could be discounted as a possible factor that influenced differences in fouling profiles in our study resistances of the fouled membranes at 30 kpa were determined using the resistance in series ris model fouling resistances of the cake layer hydraulically reversible r r and of the pore blocking foulants hydraulically irreversible r ir appeared to be marginally different between the two membranes fig 6 t tests conducted between r ir and r r of the two membranes during the 30 filtration cycles n 30 however showed that their differences were significant p value r ir 2 0 10 8 p value r r 2 5 10 7 such differences were previously explained by the pore constriction in gradient membranes which was more severe in this work because of the larger internal voids that could trap a large quantity of particles ng et al 2020 resulting in a comparatively higher r ir also the larger interconnected voids in gradient structure could lent to the lower tmp and slower fouling development since fluid could flow around in case of any pore blockage ho and zydney 2001 therefore a trade off between ease of membrane cleaning and longer operating period should be reached and regular backwash could further reduce hydraulically irreversible foulants in the gradient membranes it will be of interest to determine how routine membrane cleaning with the occasional recovery cleaning steps practiced in full scale mbrs would affect the fouling rate and resistances of the fouled membrane proteins and carbohydrates are recognised as the two main foulants in mbrs meng et al 2017 further analysis of the foulant composition showed that proteinaceous compounds constituted 64 3 and 68 4 in the fouling layers of gradient and non gradient membranes respectively figure s7 the similarities in foulant composition suggested that fouling mechanisms were not significantly different between the two membrane types because of the identical materials used rather membrane fouling was delayed as the pore structure of the gradient membrane allowed for better fluid flow across the membrane layer a comparison of fouling mechanism of different foulants and particle sizes between gradient and non gradient membranes showed that the fouling development proceeded from pore blocking to cake layer formation which was largely dependent on the particle size particularly the transition between pore blocking and cake filtration was not observed when foulants were larger than the surface pores of the membrane ng et al 2020 it is recognised that more information on the foulant composition can be obtained if hydraulically reversible and hydraulically irreversible foulants were analysed separated however because both membranes were fabricated of the same material it was unlikely that there would be differences in the foulant composition lc ocd analyses of the foulants further corroborated the proposed fouling mechanism in the gradient membrane five groups of organic compounds namely biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight lmw neutrals and lmw acids of molecular weights 20 000 da 1 000 da 300 450 da 350 da and 350 da respectively were represented for the analysis fig 7 larger foulants of 1 000 da biopolymers and humic substances were found to constitute 55 9 in the fouling layer of non gradient membrane while they constituted only 47 4 in the gradient counterpart conversely greater amounts of low molecular weight compounds were found in the gradient membrane compared to those found in the non gradient membrane foulants of smaller sizes can easily pass through the larger surface pores of both membranes however these foulants were about to block internal pores more effectively in the non gradient membranes thereby resulting in a faster tmp rise this was a direct result of the difference in pore structure of the two membranes on the other hand these smaller foulants were also able to adhere to the internal surfaces of the gradient membrane where the larger internal voids allowed the fluid to flow around these foulants therefore resulting in a slower tmp increase the temporal effect of membrane fouling would have to be considered as well with larger internal voids the gradient membrane would allow for a gradual accumulation of these small foulants over time although it was slower before achieving the same cutoff tmp of 30 kpa for both membrane types as schematically illustrated in fig 8 because of the larger internal pore structure and the longer filtration period experienced by the gradient membrane before cleaning smaller particles and organics with lower molecular weights would have a greater runway to accumulate within the fouling layer ng et al 2020 irreversible pore blocking was found to be a direct consequence of smaller particles in the fouling layer in which smaller particles tended to fill the gaps in the larger internal pores of both the fouling and membrane structures wang et al 2021 besides the interaction between these accumulated smaller foulants and the surface of these larger internal voids should be strong enough as such it was natural that a higher percentage of smaller foulants were found in gradient membranes nevertheless the fouling mechanisms of both membranes were similar albeit retarded in the gradient membrane which effectively demonstrated that a gradient ceramic membrane was beneficial in aembr for wastewater treatment 4 conclusions 3d spray coating technique with high controllability and scalability was developed to fabricate gradient ceramic membranes and their performance in aembrs for treating domestic wastewater were comprehensively assessed 1 scalability of the 3d spray coating technique to fabricate gradient ceramic membranes was successfully demonstrated 2 gradient membranes at various scales showed markedly higher pure water flux and lower membrane resistance compared to the non gradient counterpart 3 treatment performance was not affected by the membrane type used while the gradient membrane showed better filtration performance with a slower tmp rise 4 fouling mechanisms were similar between the two membrane types but a retarded fouling was observed in case of using the gradient membrane 5 foulant composition from the gradient membrane showed a higher percentage of smaller foulants compared to the non gradient counterpart the longer filtration exposure with larger internal pore structure may have allowed more smaller foulants to have attached internally this work clearly demonstrated the benefits of

15848,the stress responses of sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge to polyethylene pe microplastic exposure were revealed for the first time in this study a lab scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed reactor was continuously operated with different concentrations of pe microplastics in the feed 20 100 and 500 microplastic particles mps l exposure to low levels of pe microplastics i e 20 mps l had a limited effect on srb consortia whereas higher levels of pe microplastics imposed apparent physiological stresses on srb consortia despite this the overall reactor performance i e chemical oxygen demand removal and sulfate conversion was less affected by prolonged exposure to pe microplastics moreover as the concentration of pe microplastics increased the srb consortia promoted the production of extracellular polymeric substances to a greater extent especially the secretion of proteins as a result protective effects against the cytotoxicity of pe microplastics were provided batch experiments further demonstrated that leaching additives from pe microplastics including acetyl tri n butyl citrate and bisphenol a concentrations up to 5 μg g sludge exerted only a minor effect on the activity of srb consortia additionally microbial community analysis revealed active and potentially efficient sulfate reducers at different operational stages our results provide insight into the stress responses of srb sludge under pe microplastic exposure and suggested that srb consortia can gradually adapt to and resist high levels of pe microplastics these findings may promote a better understanding of the stable operation of srb sludge systems under specific environmental stimuli for practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate reducing

versatility stability and low cost wright and kelly 2017 global plastic production reached 320 million tons in 2018 and continues to increase alimi et al 2018 however less than half of the plastic is consigned to landfills or recycled rochman et al 2013 consequently approximately 200 million tons of plastic waste are generated annually borrelle et al 2020 through mechanical disintegration biodegradation and photooxidation these plastic waste can be progressively fragmented into smaller pieces with diameters less than 5 mm hereafter referred to as microplastics and tend to accumulate in the environment particularly marine habitats marris 2014 as most microplastics are initially buoyant in seawater studies have shown that the concentration of microplastics in the sea surface layer was in the range of 0 to 8 7 mps l hidalgo ruz et al 2012 on the other hand facing severe shortage of fresh water seawater for toilet flushing is encouraged in coastal communities li et al 2018 liu et al 2019b however this in turn leads to an increase in salinity of sewage especially increased sulfate so4 2 concentrations ca 500 1000 mg l and has adverse effects on conventional activated sludge systems hao et al 2014 lau et al 2006 in recent years several novel sulfur based biological processes have been developed to overcome this challenge the anaerobic sulfate reducing process so4 2 sulfide s2 serves as the first line of biological treatment and has been successfully implemented in a full scale application of saline sewage treatment in hong kong wu et al 2016 despite a lack of empirical confirmation the microplastics in the seawater used for toilet flushing inevitably enter the sulfate reducing process and remain in the sludge for long periods because of their strong hydrophobicity mahon et al 2017 moreover domestic wastewater often functions as a vital source of microplastics due to the intensive use of personal care and cleansing products long et al 2019 wang et al 2020a and microplastics are frequently detected in the influents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps mai et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the occurrence of microplastics in the wastewater treatment processes is of significant concern because they provide potential pathways for the transport of micropollutants and pathogens duis and coors 2016 galafassi et al 2021 in addition as microplastics migrate over time their constituent monomers and plastic additives e g acetyl tri n butyl citrate atbc diethylhexyl phthalate dehp and bisphenol a bpa may leak out harm the physiological functions of microorganisms and further affect wastewater treatment performance kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 wei et al 2019b it has been documented that the majority of microplastics in seawater and wwtps consist of polyethylene pe the most widely used polyolefin cheung et al 2018 tsang et al 2017 wang et al 2020a for example statistically 44 6 of microplastics were identified as pe in the seawater of hong kong tsang et al 2017 and pe accounted for 4 51 of microplastics detected in the wwtps sun et al 2019 therefore large quantities of pe microplastics inevitably exist in the anaerobic sulfate reducing system for the treatment of seawater toilet flushing sewage thus acting on srb consortia the presence of pe microplastics can exert different and sometimes paradoxical effects on the microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment a recent study reported that pe microplastics reduced bacterial viability during anaerobic digestion by inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production wei et al 2019a in contrast no significant effects were observed on the activity of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria denitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms after exposure to a series of pe microplastic concentrations 50 10 000 microplastic particles mps l in a lab scale study liu et al 2019a a previous study even showed enhancements in nitrification and denitrification rates via altering microbial community composition and function upon exposure of sedimentary microbial communities to pe microplastics seeley et al 2020 however whether the presence of pe microplastics affects the performance of sulfate reducing systems and how the sulfate reducing bacteria srb consortia respond remains largely unknown therefore this study aimed to investigate the stress responses of srb sludge to pe microplastic exposures a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor was continuously operated with synthetic wastewater containing different levels of pe microplastics as the feed the overall reactor performance including so4 2 reduction and organic removal and physiological responses of the srb consortia were monitored shifts in the microbial community structure were investigated using a high throughput sequencing approach in addition batch experiments were performed to reveal the effects of different chemical additives leached from pe microplastics on the srb consortia these findings provide important guidance for the stable operation of srb sludge systems in engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation before the setup methanogenic sludge from a municipal wwtp in guangzhou china was adapted to laboratory conditions for the selective enrichment of srb consortia the srusb reactor working

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed to confirm their composition fig s1 as described previously shim et al 2017 the concentration of pe microplastics was calculated by converting the number of pe microplastics to the mass density 0 961 g cm3 timed volume average diameter of 100 μm during reactor operation the wastewater temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 5 c using

were quality filtered and processed using the fastp program version 0 14 1 available at https github com opengene fastp based on the workflow provided online more details on the processing of the raw sequence data can be found in the si 2 4 batch experiment the effect of the leaching additives including bpa and atbc at four different concentration levels 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 5 0 µg g on the srb consortia was evaluated separately through batch experiments fresh srb enriched sludge was washed three times with a 10 mm sterile phosphate buffer ph 7 2 to remove impurities and transferred into nitrogen gas flushed stoppered serum bottles working volume of 500 ml at an initial concentration of 2 0 0 2 g ss l the composition of the synthetic wastewater used in the batch experiment was the

followed by duncan s multiple range tests performed using the spss software version 20 0 ibm ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the results of reactor performance are shown in fig 1 at stage i day 0 30 the control stage without addition of pe microplastic to the feed the average cod and so4 2 removal efficiency was 90 8 2 6 and 28 4 5 0 respectively the average sulfate reduction rate srr calculated as q1 m3 d δso4 2 mg l volume m3 of the srusb reactor was 0 91 kg so4 2 m3 d which was lower than that in the sulfidogenic up flow biofilm reactor with succinic acid and yeast extract as the carbon source virpiranta et al 2022 this may be due to different cod so4 2 ratios and carbon sources there were no significant changes in cod and so4 2 removal efficiency 94 3 2 3 and 29 3 4 0 respectively after exposure to 20 pe mps l relative to stage i a further increase in pe microplastics concentration to 100 mps l led to a gradual decrease in the so4 2 removal efficiency from 37 2 at day 50 to 17 6 at day 59 this indicates that the srb consortia may be compromised during the shock load of pe microplastics and therefore the reactor performance however the so4 2 removal efficiency gradually recovered after day 59 and despite the high concentration level of pe microplastics 100 and 500 mps l the average so4 2 removal efficiency at stage iii and iv reached 28 8 6 3 and 26 0 2 5 respectively 95 4 1 8 and 96 3 0 9 for cod removal respectively neither of which exhibited significant differences from stage i the production profile of dissolved hydrogen sulfide showed a trend similar to that of so4 2 removal fig s2 and no other conversion products from so4 2 including so3 2 and s2o3 2 were detected the effluent ph and redox potential over the four stages were stable at 7 5 to 8 0 and 350 to 400 mv respectively which were in the normal range chang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the above results suggest that the srb consortia have the potential to adapt to tolerating and growing in the presence of pe microplastics and the performance of srb sludge systems would be less affected by pe microplastics from a short term perspective in contrast the activity of methanogens and thus methane production was inhibited upon exposure to pe microplastics wei et al 2019a whereas the promotion of nitrifier and denitrifier activities was observed by seeley et al 2020 in light of the fact that different microbial consortia respond differently to pe microplastic exposure subsequent studies were performed to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying tolerance of srb consortia to pe microplastics 3 2 intracellular ros level and ldh protein amount the highly reactive groups on the surface of microplastics can react with oxygen even at submicromolar levels to generate ros including exogenous and mitochondrial produced ros jeong et al 2016 lei et al 2018 wei et al 2019a whereas excess formation of ros is responsible for cell damage and apoptosis xia et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 a compared to stage i three weeks of exposure to pe microplastics at 20 mps l did not induce significant intracellular ros accumulation whereas the ros level significantly increased by 197 1 and 189 2 upon exposure to 100 and 500 pe mps l respectively numerous studies have shown that following exposure to toxicants including microplastics intracellular ros production reduces biomass viability adversely affecting the overall performance of biological wastewater treatment processes mu and chen 2011 zhang et al 2020 for example the presence of pe microplastics with concentrations of 100 and 200 particles g total solids significantly inhibits the anaerobic digestion process by inducing intracellular ros overproduction wei et al 2019a despite the clear enhancement of ldh amount released by cells at 100 mps l no significant changes were observed in the ldh amount under exposure to pe microplastics when compared to the stage i fig 2 b proving that pe microplastics did not overly stress srb consortia and disrupt their cell integrity one possible interpretation is that srb consortia have an excellent ros detoxification system because of the widespread expression of genes involved in anti oxidative stress e g rubredoxin like protein and putative rubrerythrin genes zhou et al 2010 further ongoing studies are exploring the underlying regulatory mechanisms including enzymatic and non enzymatic involved in the adaptation of the srb consortia to pe microplastics live and dead staining assays showed that 29 2 of dead cells were detected at stage i in addition more cell death was induced at 20 mps l 31 5 of dead cells and 100 mps l 35 7 of dead cells while the percentage of dead cells slightly decreased to 34 6 at 500 pe mps l fig 3 which was in accordance with the changes in the levels of intracellular ros and ldh protein the above results help to explain fluctuations in reactor performance after the addition of pe microplastics and provide further evidence that the srb consortia can gradually adapt to high levels of pe microplastics by regulating their antioxidant defense systems to scavenge the microplastic induced ros 3 3 composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps is crucial for maintaining the stability of microbial aggregates by protecting them from toxic external stimuli henriques and love 2007 the eps composition including total ps pn and edna content in the srb sludge was quantified to reveal how the srb consortia responded to pe microplastics as presented in fig 4 a compared to stage i the ps content in eps showed a significant reduction at stage ii while it was significantly increased by 120 9 and 61 1 at stage iii iv respectively in contrast the composition of eps was dominated by pn for all sludge samples after the addition of pe microplastics and the pn content increased significantly with increasing of pe microplastic concentrations many studies have reported that the increased secretion of pn in eps can significantly increase the sludge particle size lin et al 2019 yan et al 2015 yu et al 2009 meanwhile fluorescence microscope images of the sludge samples fig 3 showed that the microbial aggregation became bigger in size therefore excessive excretion of eps led to the increase in the sludge particle size fig s3 it has been conclusively demonstrated that ps plays an important role in facilitating cell to cell adhesion and binding exocellular enzymes whereas pn often serves as a protective barrier and structural constituent fulaz et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 as has been observed in many wastewater treatment systems such as aerobic granular sludge and biofilm matrix fang et al 2002 yang et al 2013 the preferential production of pn over ps in eps is thought to be linked to a self protection strategy of bacteria against toxins he et al 2017 in this study the increased amount of eps especially pn might help to bridge cells together in clusters and largely protect the srb consortia from suffering the toxicity caused by pe microplastics the pn ps ratio ratio of pn content to ps content in eps is an indicator reflecting the development of microbial aggregates wang et al 2018 a relatively high pn ps ratio is conducive to internal microstructure and biomass retention zhao et al 2013 interestingly in the present study the pn ps ratio increased significantly from 2 3 stage i to 4 3 stage ii decreased sharply to 2 1 stage iii and finally recovered to 3 2 stage iv it can be speculated that when initially exposed to pe microplastics at 20 mps l the srb consortia could quickly adjust to the changing microenvironments and secrete more eps by actively reorienting their metabolic machinery to increase the probability of survival despite a further enhancement in eps secretion at stage iii exposure to pe microplastics at 100 mps l led to more pronounced damage or even death of the srb consortia probably due to their unbalanced ros metabolism and secondary impairment in the detoxification systems this is also supported by the observations shown in fig 2 and fig 3 that the intercellular ros level dead cell percentage and edna content ca 1 6 mg g vss fig 4 a reached their maximum values at stage iii however the ability of srb consortia to survive and thrive under extremely adverse conditions stress factors such as low or high temperatures strong acids and toxic metals has been well documented in previous studies florentino et al 2017 gil garcia et al 2018 hao et al 2014 sahinkaya et al 2007 zeng et al 2019 as mentioned earlier the srb consortia were able to gradually adapt to and resist the stresses induced by high levels of pe microplastics as such the recovery of the pn ps ratio at stage iv contributed to the evidence of the resilience of srb consortia moreover the significant decrease in the ps content at stage iv compared to stage iii could be ascribed to enhanced microbial growth which resulted in a decreased food to microorganism f m ratio and consumption of storage carbohydrates maqbool et al 2017 in our study the biomass concentrations were 23 7 16 0 15 6 and 19 3 g of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss l and the f m ratio were 0 067 0 100 0 103 and 0 083 kg cod kg mlss d over the four stages respectively the growth of microorganisms first decreased and then increased which further determined that the srb consortia could gradually adapt to high levels of pe microplastics 3 4 leaching additives from pe microplastics leaching additives from microplastics have been demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting the growth metabolism and reproduction of bacteria li et al 2016 wei et al 2019b in the present study as the influent concentration of pe microplastics increased the atbc and bpa concentrations in the srb sludge increased significantly from 0 026 0 007 and 0 062 0 014 μg g on day 30 stage i to 1 287 0 129 and 0 990 0 133 μg g on day 90 stage iv respectively fig 5 a this result was consistent with the findings of wei et al 2019a and liu et al 2019c who demonstrated that pe microplastics served as a persistent source of atbc and bpa contamination in aquatic environments during the operation of the srusb reactor no other additives including dehp and irgafos 168 phosphate were detected batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of leaching additives from pe microplastics i e atbc and bpa on so4 2 and cod removal in the srb sludge system over the incubation period 120 h when compared to the control groups 0 μg g no significant changes were observed in the removal of so4 2 p 0 983 0 998 fig 5 and cod p 1 000 fig s4 after exposure to different concentrations of atbc or bpa indicating that the presence of atbc or bpa did not affect the performance of srb sludge atbc has been approved by the u s food and drug administration as a plastic additive or even as a food additive due to its nontoxicity suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 previous studies also demonstrated that atbc exhibited no or minor cytotoxicity against microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment e g anaerobic methanogens wei et al 2019a which agree to our results on the other hand bpa is considered to be an estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical with adverse health and environmental consequence effects li et al 2012 recent studies have found that the reduction in methane and hydrogen production is associated with the leaching of bpa from polyvinyl chloride microplastics during the anaerobic digestion of waste sludge wei et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 bpa was also found to inhibit the activity of heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria li et al 2015 in contrast srb consortia exhibited higher resistance to bpa exposure our previous studies confirmed that relative to activated sludge and methanogenic sludge srb consortia showed a better ability to biodegrade and detoxify many xenobiotic compounds in which cytochrome p450 enzymes played an important role jia et al 2018 2019 cytochrome p450 enzymes have also been shown to catalyze the first step in two bpa degradation pathways wang et al 2020b moreover tsuchida et al 2011 provided direct evidence that srb consortia can biodegrade and utilize bpa as a carbon source to produce h2s these findings may explain why the performance of srb sludge was less affected by different concentrations of bpa during batch experiments as well as during the operation of the srusb reactor 3 5 shifts in bacterial community structure the bacterial community structure of the srb sludge from the srusb reactor over the four operational stages was analyzed using high throughput sequencing the summary statistics of the α diversity are presented in table 1 after exposure to pe microplastics at 20 mps l stage ii the richness estimators including observed species and chao 1 decreased significantly when compared to stage i whereas the diversity of the srb consortia including shannon and simpson indices did not significantly differ between the two operational stages nevertheless as the level of pe microplastics was further increased to 100 mps l stage iii and 500 mps l stage iv all α diversity indices exhibited no significant differences as compared to that at stage ii there has been some controversy over the impact of pe microplastics on the α diversity of microbial communities in wastewater treatment for example wei et al 2019a reported that pe microplastics did not significantly affect the α diversity of anaerobic digestion sludge in a constant temperature incubator 37 1 c with only a change in the concentration of pe microplastics in contrast wang et al 2022 observed that pe microplastics decreased species richness but increased the microbial community diversity in exoelectrogenic biofilms at room temperature similarly our results indicate that the bacterial species present in the srusb reactor become fewer but more evenly distribute after exposure to pe microplastics which provide further evidence for the ability of the srb consortia to adapt to high levels of pe microplastics the compositional similarity of the bacterial community was evaluated by principal coordinate analysis and adonis analysis and the results demonstrated that pe microplastics induced marked changes r2 0 591 p 0 002 in the bacterial community structure of the srb sludge between the different operational stages fig s5 the most abundant phylum within the bacterial community in all sludge samples were bacteroidetes accounting for over 30 followed by either proteobacteria or chloroflexi with an additional seven identified phyla each constituting 5 fig s6 furthermore heat maps with the 15 most abundant bacterial genera and mostly reported srb genera were generated using the morpheus online software available in https software broadinstitute org morpheus fig 6 as depicted in fig 6 a it was evident that microbial community structures at the genus level were largely divergent across the operational stages leptolinea and longilinea were the two predominant genera in all analyzed samples which is in accordance with observations in many other anaerobic wastewater treatment systems dinh et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 compared to stage i the relative abundance of genera such as leptolinea longilinea desulfobacter lentimicrobium jgi 0 000 079 d21 and geobacter decreased whereas those of acinetobacter desulfomonile chlorobium and thauera increased at stage ii further increases in pe microplastic concentrations 100 and 500 mps l resulted in an apparently increased relative abundance of acinetobacter geobacter sva0081 sediment group and desulforhabdus compared to stage ii suggesting their possible ability to cope with high levels of pe microplastics in particular acinetobacter a pollutant resistant genus that is capable of degrading bpa noszczynska et al 2021 was enriched in the srb sludge after addition of pe microplastics and its relative abundance increased significantly from 0 6 at stage i to 4 2 at stage iv 1 5 at stage ii and 2 0 at stage iii the enriched acinetobacter may help degrade bpa and enhance the resistance of srb consortia to the cytotoxic effects caused by pe microplastics the dominant srb genus in stage i belonged to desulfobacter accounting for 2 4 of the total community fig 6 b however after exposure to pe microplastics the srb community shifted to desulfomonile dominance at stages ii iii 1 46 and 1 35 respectively and to sva0081 sediment group dominance 1 59 at stage iv the sva0081 sediment group genus is ubiquitous and abundant in brackish marine and freshwater environments jantharadej et al 2021 although these bacteria were not culturable their potential ecological roles and interactions with the pe microplastics deserve further investigation as to other sulfate reducers the relative abundance of desulforhabdus and desulfococcus increased significantly from stage i to stage iv in contrast genera such as desulfatirhabdium smithella desulfofustis desulfoprunum and desulfuromonas showed the opposite results with gradually declining relative abundances in the present study although prolonged pe microplastic exposure triggered dramatic shifts in the srb community structure the total average relative abundances of the mostly reported srb genera did not show significant changes between different operational stages stage i 6 7 stage ii 6 2 stage iii 6 8 stage iv 8 0 p 0 407 therefore our results suggested that srb consortia could maintain their function in so4 2 reduction when exposed to pe microplastics through the succession of community structures 4 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the stress responses of srb sludge upon exposure to different concentrations of pe microplastics in a continuously operated srusb reactor the following conclusions were drawn 1 three different concentrations of pe microplastics were tested and none had significant effects on the overall reactor performance although so4 2 conversion was temporarily suppressed after exposure to pe microplastics at 100 mps l 2 with increased concentrations of pe microplastics srb consortia promoted the production of eps to a greater degree especially the secretion of pn which might help mitigate the potential cytotoxicity of pe microplastics 3 after the addition of pe microplastics dose dependent levels of leached chemical additives including atbc and bpa were detected in the srusb reactor furthermore batch experiments showed that the activity of srb consortia was less affected by exposure to atbc or bpa 4 the total relative abundances of srb genera did not show significant changes between different operational stages whereas the genera desulfomonile and sva0081 sediment group were active and potentially efficient sulfate reducers when exposed to high concentrations of pe microplastics declaration of competing interest the authors

15848,the stress responses of sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge to polyethylene pe microplastic exposure were revealed for the first time in this study a lab scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed reactor was continuously operated with different concentrations of pe microplastics in the feed 20 100 and 500 microplastic particles mps l exposure to low levels of pe microplastics i e 20 mps l had a limited effect on srb consortia whereas higher levels of pe microplastics imposed apparent physiological stresses on srb consortia despite this the overall reactor performance i e chemical oxygen demand removal and sulfate conversion was less affected by prolonged exposure to pe microplastics moreover as the concentration of pe microplastics increased the srb consortia promoted the production of extracellular polymeric substances to a greater extent especially the secretion of proteins as a result protective effects against the cytotoxicity of pe microplastics were provided batch experiments further demonstrated that leaching additives from pe microplastics including acetyl tri n butyl citrate and bisphenol a concentrations up to 5 μg g sludge exerted only a minor effect on the activity of srb consortia additionally microbial community analysis revealed active and potentially efficient sulfate reducers at different operational stages our results provide insight into the stress responses of srb sludge under pe microplastic exposure and suggested that srb consortia can gradually adapt to and resist high levels of pe microplastics these findings may promote a better understanding of the stable operation of srb sludge systems under specific environmental stimuli for practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate reducing

versatility stability and low cost wright and kelly 2017 global plastic production reached 320 million tons in 2018 and continues to increase alimi et al 2018 however less than half of the plastic is consigned to landfills or recycled rochman et al 2013 consequently approximately 200 million tons of plastic waste are generated annually borrelle et al 2020 through mechanical disintegration biodegradation and photooxidation these plastic waste can be progressively fragmented into smaller pieces with diameters less than 5 mm hereafter referred to as microplastics and tend to accumulate in the environment particularly marine habitats marris 2014 as most microplastics are initially buoyant in seawater studies have shown that the concentration of microplastics in the sea surface layer was in the range of 0 to 8 7 mps l hidalgo ruz et al 2012 on the other hand facing severe shortage of fresh water seawater for toilet flushing is encouraged in coastal communities li et al 2018 liu et al 2019b however this in turn leads to an increase in salinity of sewage especially increased sulfate so4 2 concentrations ca 500 1000 mg l and has adverse effects on conventional activated sludge systems hao et al 2014 lau et al 2006 in recent years several novel sulfur based biological processes have been developed to overcome this challenge the anaerobic sulfate reducing process so4 2 sulfide s2 serves as the first line of biological treatment and has been successfully implemented in a full scale application of saline sewage treatment in hong kong wu et al 2016 despite a lack of empirical confirmation the microplastics in the seawater used for toilet flushing inevitably enter the sulfate reducing process and remain in the sludge for long periods because of their strong hydrophobicity mahon et al 2017 moreover domestic wastewater often functions as a vital source of microplastics due to the intensive use of personal care and cleansing products long et al 2019 wang et al 2020a and microplastics are frequently detected in the influents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps mai et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the occurrence of microplastics in the wastewater treatment processes is of significant concern because they provide potential pathways for the transport of micropollutants and pathogens duis and coors 2016 galafassi et al 2021 in addition as microplastics migrate over time their constituent monomers and plastic additives e g acetyl tri n butyl citrate atbc diethylhexyl phthalate dehp and bisphenol a bpa may leak out harm the physiological functions of microorganisms and further affect wastewater treatment performance kiani et al 2018 luo et al 2018 wei et al 2019b it has been documented that the majority of microplastics in seawater and wwtps consist of polyethylene pe the most widely used polyolefin cheung et al 2018 tsang et al 2017 wang et al 2020a for example statistically 44 6 of microplastics were identified as pe in the seawater of hong kong tsang et al 2017 and pe accounted for 4 51 of microplastics detected in the wwtps sun et al 2019 therefore large quantities of pe microplastics inevitably exist in the anaerobic sulfate reducing system for the treatment of seawater toilet flushing sewage thus acting on srb consortia the presence of pe microplastics can exert different and sometimes paradoxical effects on the microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment a recent study reported that pe microplastics reduced bacterial viability during anaerobic digestion by inducing intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production wei et al 2019a in contrast no significant effects were observed on the activity of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria denitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms after exposure to a series of pe microplastic concentrations 50 10 000 microplastic particles mps l in a lab scale study liu et al 2019a a previous study even showed enhancements in nitrification and denitrification rates via altering microbial community composition and function upon exposure of sedimentary microbial communities to pe microplastics seeley et al 2020 however whether the presence of pe microplastics affects the performance of sulfate reducing systems and how the sulfate reducing bacteria srb consortia respond remains largely unknown therefore this study aimed to investigate the stress responses of srb sludge to pe microplastic exposures a sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor was continuously operated with synthetic wastewater containing different levels of pe microplastics as the feed the overall reactor performance including so4 2 reduction and organic removal and physiological responses of the srb consortia were monitored shifts in the microbial community structure were investigated using a high throughput sequencing approach in addition batch experiments were performed to reveal the effects of different chemical additives leached from pe microplastics on the srb consortia these findings provide important guidance for the stable operation of srb sludge systems in engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation before the setup methanogenic sludge from a municipal wwtp in guangzhou china was adapted to laboratory conditions for the selective enrichment of srb consortia the srusb reactor working volume of 1 0 l made of polymethyl methacrylate was seeded with 650 ml of srb enriched sludge 20 0 0 4 g suspended solids ss l the hydraulic retention time was set to 6 h and the solids retention time was maintained at approximately 25 d the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater based on the characteristics of the domestic effluent using seawater for toilet flushing 400 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l 800 mg so4 2 l ph 7 0 0 5 see table s1 for details additionally operation of the reactor was divided into four stages based on the different pe microplastic concentrations in the feed 0 20 100 and 500 mps l the synthetic wastewater was prepared daily the used concentrations were based on previously reported pe microplastic concentrations in marine environments and wwtps influents cai et al 2018 mai et al 2019 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2020a the pe microplastics procured from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china were spherical in shape with an average diameter of 100 μm and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed to confirm their composition fig s1 as described previously shim et al 2017 the concentration of pe microplastics was calculated by converting the number of pe microplastics to the mass density 0 961 g cm3 timed volume average diameter of 100 μm during reactor operation the wastewater temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 5 c using a water bath and the influent ph was controlled at 7 0 0 1 the effluent ph and redox potential were monitored using a portable ph meter and redox probe mettler toledo giessen germany but were not controlled 2 2 sample collection and analytical methods influent and effluent water samples from the srusb reactor were collected daily and immediately analyzed the so4 2 sulphite so3 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 in water samples were measured using an ion chromatograph equipped with an ionpac as23 analytical column dionex ics 900 ca usa after 0 22 μm filtration the concentrations of cod and dissolved hydrogen sulfide including h2s aq hs and s2 were determined as per apha standard methods apha 2005 sludge samples were withdrawn from the reactor at the end of each operational stage to determine the particle size distribution extracellular polymeric substance eps contents intracellular ros levels lactate dehydrogenase ldh protein amounts and cell viability the particle size distribution in the sludge was measured using laser diffractometry mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps fractions in the sludge were extracted by centrifugation 3500 rpm 4 c 15 min and heat extraction methods li and yang 2007 respectively total polysaccharide ps protein pn and extracellular dna edna contents in eps calculated as the sum of these three parameters in loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps were quantified using the phenol sulfuric acid lowry and fluorometric methods hoefer dyna quant 200 amersham biosciences respectively zhang et al 2018 zhang

dehydrogenase ldh protein amounts as an indicator of cell membrane integrity were estimated using the dinitrophenylhydrazine microplate method ldh assay kit leagene biotechnology beijing china in

protocol the leaching additives from the pe microplastics atbc dehp irgafos 168 phosphate and bpa that remained in the reactor were quantified at the end of each operational stage briefly samples including liquid and sludge were collected from the reactor after being thorough mixing followed by lyophilization and soxhlet extraction with dichloromethane for 6 h the extracts were then analyzed

sludge samples were collected from the reactor at the beginning and end of each operational stage for molecular analysis the samples were lyophilized and used for dna extraction in triplicate with the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was stored at 20 c until downstream analysis the v4 v5 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified using primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragtt 3 he et al 2020 each primer set was linked to a 12 bp barcode sequence pcr amplification was performed in a 50 μl reaction system containing 25 μl of premix ex taq takara dalian china 1 μl of each primer 10 100 ng of template dna and distilled water the thermal cycling conditions were as follows initial denaturation under 95 c for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 30 s under 95 c 45 s under 55 c and 90 s under 72 c and an extension under 72 c for 10 min the barcoded pcr products were subjected to 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and further purified using the gel extraction kit omega bio tek norcross usa sequencing libraries were prepared using the nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs hitchin uk sequencing was then performed on an illumina nova6000 platform to produce 2 250 bp long paired end sequences raw and paired end sequences were quality filtered and processed using the fastp program version 0 14 1 available at https github com opengene fastp based on the workflow provided online more details on the processing of the raw sequence data can be found in the si 2 4 batch experiment the effect of the leaching additives including bpa and atbc at four different concentration levels 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 5 0 µg g on the srb consortia was evaluated separately through batch experiments fresh srb enriched sludge was washed three times with a 10 mm sterile phosphate buffer ph 7 2 to remove impurities and transferred into nitrogen gas flushed stoppered serum bottles working volume of 500 ml at an initial concentration of 2 0 0 2 g ss l the composition of the synthetic wastewater used in the batch experiment was the same as that mentioned above details in table s1 stock solutions of bpa and atbc were then dispensed into serum bottles and incubated with test sludge and synthetic wastewater for 120 h under magnetic stirring during incubation 2 ml aliquots of the mixed liquor were periodically withdrawn and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was further filtered through 0 22 µm syringe filters and used to determine the cod and so4 2 concentrations each batch experiment was conducted in triplicates 2 5 statistical analysis unless stated otherwise data are presented as mean standard deviation sd of triplicate experiments and the threshold for statistical significance was set at 0 05 within sample diversity α diversity of the sludge microbial community including observed species chao 1 richness estimator and shannon and simpson indices was calculated using the qiime pipeline in addition all obtained results were statistically evaluated using one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range tests performed using the spss software version 20 0 ibm ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the results of reactor performance are shown in fig 1 at stage i day 0 30 the control stage without addition of pe microplastic to the feed the average cod and so4 2 removal efficiency was 90 8 2 6 and 28 4 5 0 respectively the average sulfate reduction rate srr calculated as q1 m3 d δso4 2 mg l volume m3 of the srusb reactor was 0 91 kg so4 2 m3 d which was lower than that in the sulfidogenic up flow biofilm reactor with succinic acid and yeast extract as the carbon source virpiranta et al 2022 this may be due to different cod so4 2 ratios and carbon sources there were no significant changes in cod and so4 2 removal efficiency 94 3 2 3 and 29 3 4 0 respectively after exposure to 20 pe mps l relative to stage i a further increase in pe microplastics concentration to 100 mps l led to a gradual decrease in the so4 2 removal efficiency from 37 2 at day 50 to 17 6 at day 59 this indicates that the srb consortia may be compromised during the shock load of pe microplastics and therefore the reactor performance however the so4 2 removal efficiency gradually recovered after day 59 and despite the high concentration level of pe microplastics 100 and 500 mps l the average so4 2 removal efficiency at stage iii and iv reached 28 8 6 3 and 26 0 2 5 respectively 95 4 1 8 and 96 3 0 9 for cod removal respectively neither of which exhibited significant differences from stage i the production profile of dissolved hydrogen sulfide showed a trend similar to that of so4 2 removal fig s2 and no other conversion products from so4 2 including so3 2 and s2o3 2 were detected the effluent ph and redox potential over the four stages were stable at 7 5 to 8 0 and 350 to 400 mv respectively which were in the normal range chang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the above results suggest that the srb consortia have the potential to adapt to tolerating and growing in the presence of pe microplastics and the performance of srb sludge systems would be less affected by pe microplastics from a short term perspective in contrast the activity of methanogens and thus methane production was inhibited upon exposure to pe microplastics wei et al 2019a whereas the promotion of nitrifier and denitrifier activities was observed by seeley et al 2020 in light of the fact that different microbial consortia respond differently to pe microplastic exposure subsequent studies were performed to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying tolerance of srb consortia to pe microplastics 3 2 intracellular ros level and ldh protein amount the highly reactive groups on the surface of microplastics can react with oxygen even at submicromolar levels to generate ros including exogenous and mitochondrial produced ros jeong et al 2016 lei et al 2018 wei et al 2019a whereas excess formation of ros is responsible for cell damage and apoptosis xia et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 a compared to stage i three weeks of exposure to pe microplastics at 20 mps l did not induce significant intracellular ros accumulation whereas the ros level significantly increased by 197 1 and 189 2 upon exposure to 100 and 500 pe mps l respectively numerous studies have shown that following exposure to toxicants including microplastics intracellular ros production reduces biomass viability adversely affecting the overall performance of biological wastewater treatment processes mu and chen 2011 zhang et al 2020 for example the presence of pe microplastics with concentrations of 100 and 200 particles g total solids significantly inhibits the anaerobic digestion process by inducing intracellular ros overproduction wei et al 2019a despite the clear enhancement of ldh amount released by cells at 100 mps l no significant changes were observed in the ldh amount under exposure to pe microplastics when compared to the stage i fig 2 b proving that pe microplastics did not overly stress srb consortia and disrupt their cell integrity one possible interpretation is that srb consortia have an excellent ros detoxification system because of the widespread expression of genes involved in anti oxidative stress e g rubredoxin like protein and putative rubrerythrin genes zhou et al 2010 further ongoing studies are exploring the underlying regulatory mechanisms including enzymatic and non enzymatic involved in the adaptation of the srb consortia to pe microplastics live and dead staining assays showed that 29 2 of dead cells were detected at stage i in addition more cell death was induced at 20 mps l 31 5 of dead cells and 100 mps l 35 7 of dead cells while the percentage of dead cells slightly decreased to 34 6 at 500 pe mps l fig 3 which was in accordance with the changes in the levels of intracellular ros and ldh protein the above results help to explain fluctuations in reactor performance after the addition of pe microplastics and provide further evidence that the srb consortia can gradually adapt to high levels of pe microplastics by regulating their antioxidant defense systems to scavenge the microplastic induced ros 3 3 composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps is crucial for maintaining the stability of microbial aggregates by protecting them from toxic external stimuli henriques and love 2007 the eps composition including total ps pn and edna content in the srb sludge was quantified to reveal how the srb consortia responded to pe microplastics as presented in fig 4 a compared to stage i the ps content in eps showed a significant reduction at stage ii while it was significantly increased by 120 9 and 61 1 at stage iii iv respectively in contrast the composition of eps was dominated by pn for all sludge samples after the addition of pe microplastics and the pn content increased significantly with increasing of pe microplastic concentrations many studies have reported that the increased secretion of pn in eps can significantly increase the sludge particle size lin et al 2019 yan et al 2015 yu et al 2009 meanwhile fluorescence microscope images of the sludge samples fig 3 showed that the microbial aggregation became bigger in size therefore excessive excretion of eps led to the increase in the sludge particle size fig s3 it has been conclusively demonstrated that ps plays an important role in facilitating cell to cell adhesion and binding exocellular enzymes whereas pn often serves as a protective barrier and structural constituent fulaz et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 as has been observed in many wastewater treatment systems such as aerobic granular sludge and biofilm matrix fang et al 2002 yang et al 2013 the preferential production of pn over ps in eps is thought to be linked to a self protection strategy of bacteria against toxins he et al 2017 in this study the increased amount of eps especially pn might help to bridge cells together in clusters and largely protect the srb consortia from suffering the toxicity caused by pe microplastics the pn ps ratio ratio of pn content to ps content in eps is an indicator reflecting the development of microbial aggregates wang et al 2018 a relatively high pn ps ratio is conducive to internal microstructure and biomass retention zhao et al 2013 interestingly in the present study the pn ps ratio increased significantly from 2 3 stage i to 4 3 stage ii decreased sharply to 2 1 stage iii and finally recovered to 3 2 stage iv it can be speculated that when initially exposed to pe microplastics at 20 mps l the srb consortia could quickly adjust to the changing microenvironments and secrete more eps by actively reorienting their metabolic machinery to increase the probability of survival despite a further enhancement in eps secretion at stage iii exposure to pe microplastics at 100 mps l led to more pronounced damage or even death of the srb consortia probably due to their unbalanced ros metabolism and secondary impairment in the detoxification systems this is also supported by the observations shown in fig 2 and fig 3 that the intercellular ros level dead cell percentage and edna content ca 1 6 mg g vss fig 4 a reached their maximum values at stage iii however the ability of srb consortia to survive and thrive under extremely adverse conditions stress factors such as low or high temperatures strong acids and toxic metals has been well documented in previous studies florentino et al 2017 gil garcia et al 2018 hao et al 2014 sahinkaya et al 2007 zeng et al 2019 as mentioned earlier the srb consortia were able to gradually adapt to and resist the stresses induced by high levels of pe microplastics as such the recovery of the pn ps ratio at stage iv contributed to the evidence of the resilience of srb consortia moreover the significant decrease in the ps content at stage iv compared to stage iii could be ascribed to enhanced microbial growth which resulted in a decreased food to microorganism f m ratio and consumption of storage carbohydrates maqbool et al 2017 in our study the biomass concentrations were 23 7 16 0 15 6 and 19 3 g of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss l and the f m ratio were 0 067 0 100 0 103 and 0 083 kg cod kg mlss d over the four stages respectively the growth of microorganisms first decreased and then increased which further determined that the srb consortia could gradually adapt to high levels of pe microplastics 3 4 leaching additives from pe microplastics leaching additives from microplastics have been demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting the growth metabolism and reproduction of bacteria li et al 2016 wei et al 2019b in the present study as the influent concentration of pe microplastics increased the atbc and bpa concentrations in the srb sludge increased significantly from 0 026 0 007 and 0 062 0 014 μg g on day 30 stage i to 1 287 0 129 and 0 990 0 133 μg g on day 90 stage iv respectively fig 5 a this result was consistent with the findings of wei et al 2019a and liu et al 2019c who demonstrated that pe microplastics served as a persistent source of atbc and bpa contamination in aquatic environments during the operation of the srusb reactor no other additives including dehp and irgafos 168 phosphate were detected batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of leaching additives from pe microplastics i e atbc and bpa on so4 2 and cod removal in the srb sludge system over the incubation period 120 h when compared to the control groups 0 μg g no significant changes were observed in the removal of so4 2 p 0 983 0 998 fig 5 and cod p 1 000 fig s4 after exposure to different concentrations of atbc or bpa indicating that the presence of atbc or bpa did not affect the performance of srb sludge atbc has been approved by the u s food and drug administration as a plastic additive or even as a food additive due to its nontoxicity suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 previous studies also demonstrated that atbc exhibited no or minor cytotoxicity against microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment e g anaerobic methanogens wei et al 2019a which agree to our results on the other hand bpa is considered to be an estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical with adverse health and environmental consequence effects li et al 2012 recent studies have found that the reduction in methane and hydrogen production is associated with the leaching of bpa from polyvinyl chloride microplastics during the anaerobic digestion of waste sludge wei et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 bpa was also found to inhibit the activity of heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria li et al 2015 in contrast srb consortia exhibited higher resistance to bpa exposure our previous studies confirmed that relative to activated sludge and methanogenic sludge srb consortia showed a better ability to biodegrade and detoxify many xenobiotic compounds in which cytochrome p450 enzymes played an important role jia et al 2018 2019 cytochrome p450 enzymes have also been shown to catalyze the first step in two bpa degradation pathways wang et al 2020b moreover tsuchida et al 2011 provided direct evidence that srb consortia can biodegrade and utilize bpa as a carbon source to produce h2s these findings may explain why the performance of srb sludge was less affected by different concentrations of bpa during batch experiments as well as during the operation of the srusb reactor 3 5 shifts in bacterial community structure the bacterial community structure of the srb sludge from the srusb reactor over the four operational stages was analyzed using high throughput sequencing the summary statistics of the α diversity are presented in table 1 after exposure to pe microplastics at 20 mps l stage ii the richness estimators including observed species and chao 1 decreased significantly when compared to stage i whereas the diversity of the srb consortia including shannon and simpson indices did not significantly differ between the two operational stages nevertheless as the level of pe microplastics was further increased to 100 mps l stage iii and 500 mps l stage iv all α diversity indices exhibited no significant differences as compared to that at stage ii there has been some controversy over the impact of pe microplastics on the α diversity of microbial communities in wastewater treatment for example wei et al 2019a reported that pe microplastics did not significantly affect the α diversity of anaerobic digestion sludge in a constant temperature incubator 37 1 c with only a change in the concentration of pe microplastics in contrast wang et al 2022 observed that pe microplastics decreased species richness but increased the microbial community diversity in exoelectrogenic biofilms at room temperature similarly our results indicate that the bacterial species present in the srusb reactor become fewer but more evenly distribute after exposure to pe microplastics which provide further evidence for the ability of the srb consortia to adapt to high levels of pe microplastics the compositional similarity of the bacterial community was evaluated by principal coordinate analysis and adonis analysis and the results demonstrated that pe microplastics induced marked changes r2 0 591 p 0 002 in the bacterial community structure of the srb sludge between the different operational stages fig s5 the most abundant phylum within the bacterial community in all sludge samples were bacteroidetes accounting for over 30 followed by either proteobacteria or chloroflexi with an additional seven identified phyla each constituting 5 fig s6 furthermore heat maps with the 15 most abundant bacterial genera and mostly reported srb genera were generated using the morpheus online software available in https software broadinstitute org morpheus fig 6 as depicted in fig 6 a it was evident that microbial community structures at the genus level were largely divergent across the operational stages leptolinea and longilinea were the two predominant genera in all analyzed samples which is in accordance with observations in many other anaerobic wastewater treatment systems dinh et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 compared to stage i the relative abundance of genera such as leptolinea longilinea desulfobacter lentimicrobium jgi 0 000 079 d21 and geobacter decreased whereas those of acinetobacter desulfomonile chlorobium and thauera increased at stage ii further increases in pe microplastic concentrations 100 and 500 mps l resulted in an apparently increased relative abundance of acinetobacter geobacter sva0081 sediment group and desulforhabdus compared to stage ii suggesting their possible ability to cope with high levels of pe microplastics in particular acinetobacter a pollutant resistant genus that is capable of degrading bpa noszczynska et al 2021 was enriched in the srb sludge after addition of pe microplastics and its relative abundance increased significantly from 0 6 at stage i to 4 2 at stage iv 1 5 at stage ii and 2 0 at stage iii the enriched acinetobacter may help degrade bpa and enhance the resistance of srb consortia to the cytotoxic effects caused by pe microplastics the dominant srb genus in stage i belonged to desulfobacter accounting for 2 4 of the total community fig 6 b however after exposure to pe microplastics the srb community shifted to desulfomonile dominance at stages ii iii 1 46 and 1 35 respectively and to sva0081 sediment group dominance 1 59 at stage iv the sva0081 sediment group genus is ubiquitous and abundant in brackish marine and freshwater environments jantharadej et al 2021 although these bacteria were not culturable their potential ecological roles and interactions with the pe microplastics deserve further investigation as to other sulfate reducers the relative abundance of desulforhabdus and desulfococcus increased significantly from stage i to stage iv in contrast genera such as desulfatirhabdium smithella desulfofustis desulfoprunum and desulfuromonas showed the opposite results with gradually declining relative abundances in the present study although prolonged pe microplastic exposure triggered dramatic shifts in the srb community structure the total average relative abundances of the mostly reported srb genera did not show significant changes between different operational stages stage i 6 7 stage ii 6 2 stage iii 6 8 stage iv 8 0 p 0 407 therefore our results suggested that srb consortia could maintain their function in so4 2 reduction when exposed to pe microplastics through the succession of community structures 4 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the stress responses of srb sludge upon exposure to different concentrations of pe microplastics in a continuously operated srusb reactor the following conclusions were drawn 1 three different concentrations of pe microplastics were tested and none had significant effects on the overall reactor performance although so4 2 conversion was temporarily suppressed after exposure to pe microplastics at 100 mps l 2 with increased concentrations of pe microplastics srb consortia promoted the production of eps to a greater degree especially the secretion of pn which might help mitigate the potential cytotoxicity of pe microplastics 3 after the addition of pe microplastics dose dependent levels of leached chemical additives including atbc and bpa were detected in the srusb reactor furthermore batch experiments showed that the activity of srb consortia was less affected by exposure to atbc or bpa 4 the total relative abundances of srb genera did not show significant changes between different operational stages whereas the genera desulfomonile and sva0081 sediment group were active and potentially efficient sulfate reducers when exposed to high concentrations of pe microplastics declaration of competing interest the authors

15849,micron scale resolution can help to reliably identify true taxon taxon interactions in complex microbial communities despite widespread recognition of the critical role of metabolic interactions in anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox system performance no studies have examined microbial interactions at the micron scale in anammox consortia to fill this gap we extensively sampled totally 242 samples the consortia of a lab scale anammox reactor at different length scales including bulk scale cm macro scale 300 500 µm and micron scale 70 100 µm we firstly observed evident micron scale heterogeneity in anammox consortia with the relative abundance of anammox bacteria fluctuated greatly across individual clusters 2 0 79 3 indicating that the biotic interactions play a significant role in the assembly of anammox communities under well controlled and well mixed condition importantly by mapping the spatial associations in anammox consortia at micron scale we demonstrated that the conserved co associations for anammox bacteria were restricted to three different brocadia species over time and their co associations with heterotrophs were random implying that there was no statistically significant symbiotic interaction between anammox bacteria and other heterotrophic populations further metagenomic binning revealed that the quorum sensing with secondary messenger c di gmp potentially holding on the conservative metabolic cooperation among brocadia species these results shed new light on the social behavior of the anammox community overall delineating of biological structures at micron scale opens a new way of monitoring the microbial spatial structure and interactions paving the way for improved community engineering of biotreatment systems graphical abstract

datta 2016 cell cell distances are short enough inside micron scale cell aggregates for diffusible metabolites to be collected from adjacent cells rather than losing to the environment cordero and datta 2016 ebrahimi et al 2019 metcalfe et al 2021 simultaneously various network model algorithms have been proposed to infer microbial interaction networks from microbial community data faust and raes 2012 ma et al 2016 yuan et al 2021a according to these correlation based methods positive relationship imply a cooperative connection whereas negative relationship indicate a competitive interaction faust and raes 2012 these inference methods however are constrained by the fundamental mismatch between the interaction derived spatial scale micrometers and those of traditional microbial community samples millimeters to centimeters armitage and jones 2019 cordero and datta 2016 additionally most complex microbial communities exhibit significant fine scale heterogeneity armitage and jones 2019 kuroda et al 2016 leventhal et al 2018 probandt et al 2018 as such traditional larger scale or bulk samples only provide average information over thousands of subcommunities but information on heterogeneity and spatial context are scarce cordero and datta 2016 shi et al 2021 therefore species interaction estimated from large scale samples is most likely due to responses to abiotic factors e g ph or oxygen rather than true biotic interactions cordero and datta 2016 and even produce over fitting microbial interaction networks fig 1 a røder et al 2020 despite of the power to reveal in situ spatial locations of interacting partners the low throughput limitation long assay time as well as the incapability to distinguish close related species hampered the application of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish in fully elucidate the inter species cooperation in a complex microbial community geva zatorsky et al 2015 shi et al 2020 therefore to estimate microbial interactions it is important to move beyond macroscale analysis and focus on micron scale spatial patterns with enough throughput and statistical associations darch et al 2018 røder et al 2020 sheth et al 2019 meta omics analysis will aid in the interpretation of microbial interactions inferred using network model approaches ponomarova and patil 2015 metagenomic analysis can decipher functional palettes of microbial community and the allocation of tasks among them which can further reveal syntrophic as well as competition relationships within microbial community ponomarova and patil 2015 sung et al 2017 transcriptomics are frequently utilized in conjunction with metagenomics to deduce what metabolic potential is active and to confirm true metabolic interaction network blasche et al 2021 lawson et al 2017 for instance the integrated metagenomics and metabolite analyzes pinpointed synergistic interactions in a bisphenol a bpa degrading microbial community where the cross feeding between bpa degrading sphingonomas species and intermediate users pseudomonas sp enhanced bpa biodegradation yu et al 2019 together integration of meta omics analysis and network model methods at micron scale level will be particularly beneficial for revealing microbial interactions in complex microbial communities understanding microbial interactions in bioengineering process is critical for improving and optimizing system stability and performance yu et al 2019 the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process whereby nitrite directly oxidize ammonium to nitrogen gas anaerobically has attracted much attention as an energy saving alternative to the traditional biological nitrogen removal technology kuenen 2008 2020 previous studies have stated that autotrophic nitrifying and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria are omnipresent in anammox enrichment cultures and the pervasive metabolic interactions between anammox and heterotrophs facilitate the overall system performance huo et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 however these microbial interactions proposed in anammox consortia were mainly inferred based on the metabolic complementary or redundant pathways between potential partners of the bulk scale community samples with few of them being validated using in situ micron scale spatial information by fish xie et al 2017 as of now the micron scale microbial interaction network for the anammox community or even the microbiome of any engineered biosystem has not been investigated in a high throughput manner which evidently restricted our understanding of microbial interactions underpinning the community effectiveness during biological wastewater treatment taken together in this study we successfully built spatial association networks of anammox consortia in a sequencing batch reactor sbr at micron scale 70 100 µm level the mechanism of metabolic interactions within anammox consortia was further explored combining metagenomic binning and functional annotation we aimed to reveal 1 the level of micron scale spatial heterogeneity of anammox community 2 whether anammox bacteria have conservative interaction partners with in the anammox community over time and 3 the phylogenetic and functional divergency of these conserved partners this study will deepen our understanding of the spatial organization and ecological interaction network of anammox consortia allowing for mechanistic analysis of ecological processes associated with community assembly or succession furthermore the experimental protocols and analytical procedures developed in this work will pave the way for future research on micron scale microbial interactions in both engineered and natural environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up of the anammox reactor a lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with working volume of 4 0 l was operated at 36 1 c for 75 days with an initial volatile suspended solid vss of 0 18 g l fig s1 the seed anammox biomass was taken from an sbr with stable anammox performance zhao et al 2018 it was first pulverized and sieved through 100 mesh nylon filter 150 μm and washed with 1 pbs three times before inoculation the influent of the sbr reactor was synthetic wastewater described previously van de graaf et al 1996 the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the influent was stepwise increased from 50 to 80 mg l the reactor was strictly anaerobic influent ph was maintained at 6 8 8 3 and the hydraulic retention time was set at 24 h the influent and effluent were collected every three days for nh4 n no2 n and no3 n measurement according to the standard method of the american public health association apha 1998 during the operation of the reactor two bulk samples were harvested on the days 5 t1 and 60 t2 for dna extraction and sequencing analysis 2 2 single micron cluster separation and dna extraction we collected triplicated bulk scale cm samples and micron scale 70 100 μm single clusters at both t1 and t2 time points while macro scale 300 500 µm single cluster samples were collected only at t2 time point for bulk samples 500 mg of biomass was collected from the reactor centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant total genomic dna of bulk samples was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s protocol for micron scale 70 100 µm single cluster samples anammox biomass were placed in a stainless steel vial along with an 8 mm stainless steel bead and sealed with a stainless steel cap the vial was transferred to a bead beater jxfstprp 64 jingxin china where it was subjected to beating for 30 s the 1 pbs was added to the vial and vortexed and clusters in pbs were then removed and washed three times with pbs by centrifugation 1 min at 5000 g clusters were then resuspended in pbs and subjected to size selection clusters were pass through the 100 µm and 70 µm cell strainer biologix sequentially to obtain 70 100 µm clusters clusters were then resuspended in 1 1 pbs ethanol mixture and subjected to hand sorting for single clusters single clusters were randomly hand sorted using an eppendorf 2 5 μl pipette under digital microscope t007 shenzhen supereyes co ltd on a clean bench and each single cluster was then transferred into a sterile pcr tube fig 1b we initially collected 70 and 210 micron scale clusters at t1 and t2 time points respectively to sample macro scale 300 500 µm single clusters anammox biomass was grinded and pass through the 500 and 300 µm nylon filter sequentially to obtain 300 500 µm clusters and washed with 1x pbs three times with pbs by centrifugation 1 min at 5000 g single clusters were randomly hand sorted using an eppendorf 1 ml pipette on a clean bench and each single cluster was then collected in a sterile pcr tube similarly 80 macro scale clusters were initially aimed at t2 time point table s2 blank control without single cluster was also set up in all assays the rnaisoplus takara biotechnology was used to extract dna of single cluster the dna extraction method of micron scale and macro scale single cluster was shown in supplementary method 2 3 pcr and 16s rrna gene analysis universal bacterial primers 515f and 806r targeting the v4 region were used to amplify the 16s rrna gene of the genomic dna the detail information of pcr procedure was shown in supplementary method the extracted and purified pcr products were sequenced on an illumina novaseq platform at beijing novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd yielding 250 bp paired end reads using the default parameters in the qiime1 software package the sequencing reads were demultiplexed and quality filtered to eliminate low quality sequences caporaso et al 2010 and chimeric sequences were further identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same otus by matching the representative sequences of each otu to the silva 132 database taxonomy annotation was examined quast et al 2012 in this study the anammox community is defined as the whole microbial community in the anammox reactor while the anammox bacteria community is defined as the microbial community composed only of anammox bacteria all the sequence reads were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under the accession number prjna789415 samn24108848 samn24108854 2 4 metagenome sequencing assembly and binning the extracted total genomic dna of bulk samples at t1 time point was used for metagenome shotgun sequencing the detail information of metagenome sequencing assembly binning and functional annotation can be found in supplementary method the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the accession number prjna789668 samn24146403 2 5 ecological niche of otus given that there was great spatial heterogeneity in complex microbial community armitage and jones 2019 we employed ecological niche index to classify each otu even in a well mixed reactor we categorized otus as either generalist common taxa or specialist based on their frequency of occurrence among the micron scale clusters by employing permutation algorithms of ecolutils r package salazar 2019 niche breadth was further used to validate the difference between generalists and specialists levins 1968 details about the estimation of ecological niche are provided in supplementary method 2 6 statistical methods we calculated the coefficient of variation defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean for each order based on its relative abundance among micron macro scale clusters analysis of similarity anosim statistics clarke 1993 was performed to test the significance of differences in the bacterial community by classification using the vegan r package to determine pairwise associations otus with relative abundance great than 0 1 in at least 20 of clusters were retained for the co occurrence analysis a significant association between two species was determined if the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ 0 6 and p value 0 001 barberán et al 2012 network visualization and topological characteristic calculation were conducted using the gephi software bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 spatial heterogeneity of anammox consortia at micron scale in total we assigned 3716 245 high quality filtered sequences to 533 otus to ensure the comparability among samples we rarified all samples to 5000 sequences and obtained sequence data for 242 samples collected at two different enrichment stages of the anammox reactor t1 at day 5 and t2 at day 60 including 6 bulk scale 1 cm samples 166 micron scale 70 100 µm and 70 macro scale 300 500 µm samples fig 2 a and table s2 the number of otus ranged from 62 to 310 across 242 samples the overall anammox community was dominated by otu1048 anammox bacteria brocadia fulgida with a mean relative abundance of 34 52 followed by otu1 rhodocyclaceae 14 70 and otu2 rhodocyclaceae 11 09 figs 2a and s2 all anammox bacteria otus were affiliated to the genera brocadia and jettenia with otu1048 brocadia fulgida and otu13 jettenia sp accounting for 91 8 and 2 4 of total anammox bacteria respectively figs s3 and s4 additionally the relative abundance of anammox bacteria significantly increased over time while the predominant heterotrophic bacteria betaproteobacteria rhodocyclales sc i 84 and burkholderiales exhibited an opposite pattern fig s5 the mean relative abundances of anammox bacteria were respectively 29 9 41 2 and 35 8 in samples t1 micron t2 micron and t2 macro which was comparable to that of bulk samples of t1 26 5 and t2 39 6 such anammox bacteria prevalence consistency between bulk sample and selected micron scale macro scale clusters suggested the representativeness and randomness of manually picked single clusters which was fundamental for reliable correlation network construction to reveal the micron scale heterogeneity of anammox consortia the community composition of single clusters was profiled fig 2a evident micron scale heterogeneity could be observed as the community compositions were not uniform in individual clusters the relative abundance of anammox bacteria fluctuated greatly across micron scale clusters ranging from as low as 2 0 to as high as 79 3 fig s3 the coefficient of variation was respectively 0 56 and 0 39 in t1 micron and t2 micron clusters fig 2c other dominant populations within the anammox community average relative abundance 0 05 showed even greater fluctuation in relative abundance with coefficients of variation reaching as high as 2 79 for nb1 j spp in t1 micron clusters and 6 15 for acidimicrobiales in t2 micron clusters additionally the richness of t1 micron clusters average otus sd 169 5 42 9 was significantly higher than that of t2 micron clusters average otus sd 107 0 21 4 fig 2b mann whitney u test p 0 001 suggesting a decreased community richness in anammox consortia along time of incubation the richness of t2 macro clusters average otus sd 138 0 23 5 was significantly higher than that of t2 micron clusters which corresponded with earlier studies of anammox reactors chen et al 2020 large clusters contain more distinctly microenvironments due to the chemical concentration gradients de weirdt and van de wiele 2015 røder et al 2020 thus supporting the inhabiting of more species together these findings consolidated the notion that like many other microbiomes leventhal et al 2018 probandt et al 2018 sheth et al 2019 the micron scale community of anammox reactor exhibits higher than expected level of heterogeneity which cannot be captured by commonly used bulk sample studies next we explored how the length scale might influence the delineating of spatial heterogeneity by comparing micron scale 70 100 µm and macro scale 300 500 µm community compositions at the t2 time point noteworthy was that the coefficient of variation for the dominant orders across micron scale clusters was significantly higher than that of macro scale communities fig 3 a wilcoxon test p 0 001 to avoid the biases caused by sampling scale disparity we have compared the coefficient of variation of between macro scale community and three micron scale subcommunities at the t2 time point fig s6 the three micron scale communities also show a significant higher coefficient of variation in relative abundances than the macro scale community there were only minor differences between the macro t2 and micron t2 communities fig 3b aonsim r 0 125 p 0 001 a similar trend was observed when comparing macro scale communities and bulk scale communities with bulk t2 communities exhibiting the smallest coefficient of variation in relative abundances fig 3a wilcoxon test p 0 001 further beta diversity analysis also showed that community differentiation within micron scale clusters was higher than that of macro scale samples fig 3c mann whitney u test p 10 9 these results indicated that bulk scale and macro scale investigation on anammox consortia would lose important spatial information and can only provide information with average properties of taxa 3 2 spatial association networks of anammox consortia at micron scale after confirming the spatial heterogeneity of anammox consortia we next investigated microbial co occurrences patterns within micron scale spatial communities to reduce random noise otus with relative abundance greater than 0 1 in at least 20 of clusters were retained for the co occurrence analysis we respectively obtained 65 45 and 59 otus in t1 micron t2 micron and t2 macro clusters for subsequent analysis t2 micron and t2 macro clusters shared 41 otus with 18 otus observed only in t2 macro clusters such as otu19 ignavibacteriaceae and otu 49 drc31 t1 micron and t2 micron clusters shared 39 otus with 26 otus found in t1 micron clusters but not in t2 micron such as otu64 hyphomicrobium otu417 thauera and otu313 comamonadaceae fig 4 a three co occurrence networks fig 4b d and table s3 were respectively built using t2 macro t2 micron and t1 micron otus to reveal the effect of spatial resolution micron vs macro and incubation time t1 vs t2 on the spatial organization in anammox consortia worth to note is that the number of t2 micron clusters was evidently larger than that of t1 micron therefore to avoid the biases caused by sampling scale disparity we construct co occurrence networks of three subsamples of t2 micron clusters each containing 40 42 and 46 clusters respectively since principally consistent co occurrence patterns were observed between subsamples and entire set of t2 micron clusters fig s7 we used the network constructed from the entire set of t2 micron clusters when comparing network topological features compared to t2 macro network the t2 micron network harbored a simple co occurrence pattern displaying only positive correlations only intra genus associations were observed among anammox bacteria where dominant otus otus 1048 759 824 and 1059 of brocadia genus were tightly connected with each other with average correlation coefficient of 0 73 fig 4c in contrast the macro scale clusters exhibited a denser network consisting of both positive and negative correlations fig 4b apart from the positive co occurrences between three abundant anammox bacteria otus 1048 759 and 824 of brocadia genus inter genus association between anammox bacteria and other populations were also observed for example both otu1048 and otu759 showed negative associations with otu42 nitrosomonadaceae and otu40 gemmatimonadetes at macro scale of note two low abundant anammox bacteria otu6 and otu13 exhibited positive associations with otu49 drc31 and otu19 ignavibacteriaceae at macro scale respectively fig 4b we further investigate the succession of spatial co occurrence networks over time t1 vs t2 at micron resolution the network constructed from t1 micron clusters had 37 nodes and 61 edges while the t2 micron network showed a dramatically simplified topology with 10 nodes and 8 edges the top 5 high degree nodes in t1 micron network include anammox bacteria of otu1048 and otu759 otu313 comamonadaceae otu64 hyphomicrobium and otu417 thauera fig 4d noteworthy is that the last three taxa were vanished in t2 micron network fig 4c importantly the conservation of positive co occurrences among a subset of three anammox bacteria affiliated to the brocadia genus otus 1048 759 and 824 was validated by profiling the succession of spatial co occurrence networks across time suggesting that these spatial co occurrences were robust at micron scales over time of note these three anammox bacteria showed negative co associations with high degree nodes such as otus 313 64 and 48 in t1 micron network whereas these co occurrences vanished in t2 micron network 3 3 generalists and specialists in anammox consortia at micron scale to further reveal the micron scale anammox community succession we investigated the ecological niche changing of each otus in anammox consortia across time otus in t1 micron and t2 micron clusters were categorized as either generalist common taxa or specialist based on occurrence frequency by employing permutation algorithms of ecolutils a total of 67 and 66 otus were respectively identified as generalists of t1 micron and t2 micron communities the generalist populations accounted for more than 90 of the entire communities fig 5 a rhodocyclales and brocadiales were the dominant generalists together accounting for about 60 of entire communities of both time points there were 63 and 121 otus respectively classified as specialists of t1 micron and t2 micron communities these specialists only accounted for 1 4 and 2 5 of t1 micron and t2 micron communities respectively the niche breadth index value was further calculated to confirm the distinction between generalists and specialists generalists clearly had a greater niche breadth and appeared in more clusters than specialists fig 5b of note three different anammox bacteria otus 1048 759 and 824 affiliated to brocadia genus were generalist all the time whereas the anammox bacteria otu13 affiliated to jettenia genus changed from common taxa to specialist over time fig 6 furthermore otu417 and otu313 shifted from generalist to common taxa despite their relatively high degree of association with other otus in the co occurrence network of t1 micron clusters table s4 3 4 anammox consortia metagenomic insights to decipher potential functional profile of anammox consortia we performed metagenome sequencing of t1 time point bulk sample after assembly and binning 50 metagenome assembled genomes mags completeness 70 and contamination 10 were obtained parks et al 2015 accounting for 65 3 of the total quality filtered reads the recovered 50 mags were mainly affiliated to phyla proteobacteria 11 mags planctomycetota 11 mags chloroflexota 7 mags bacteroidota 7 mags and myxococcota 4 mags table s5 based on phylogenetic analysis three mags were classified as anammox species fig 7 a namely amx1 brocadia sapporoensis amx2 brocadia fulgida and amx3 jettenia caeni metagenomics reflected that these three anammox bacteria possessed synthetic or regulatory genes rpfb and rpfg of bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp fig 7b c which was an important signal messenger of quorum sensing qs in anammox culture guo et al 2017 despite the fact that the predicted proteins of qs genes shared the same pfam domains in brocadia and jettenia the disordered regions and signal peptides of the predicted proteins differed fig 7b c 4 discussion 4 1 bulk scale analysis losing spatial information of anammox consortia metabolic interactions between cells influence the composition of microbial communities and as a result their function in ecosystems faust and raes 2012 microbial community data are often subjected to co occurrence network analysis with the goal of deciphering microbial interactions within microbiota faust and raes 2012 ma et al 2016 yuan et al 2021a recently some studies have challenged current correlation based methods for inferring ecological interactions armitage and jones 2019 freilich et al 2018 røder et al 2020 most current approaches do not account heterogeneity and just provide average information of bulk sample that composed of substantial individual microhabitats patches which can obscure the signal of microbial interactions due to simpson s paradox context dependence and nonlinear averaging phenomena armitage and jones 2019 as a result identifying and characterizing spatial heterogeneity may provide a better and more precise understanding of microbial interactions of anammox consortia at the appropriate scale previous studies have shown that most multi species microbial communities are spatially structured and exhibit marked heterogeneity at fine scale as evidenced by studies of sediment gut and wastewater treatment system kuroda et al 2016 leventhal et al 2018 probandt et al 2018 sheth et al 2019 analogously we discovered that the anammox community at the order level and within a single timepoint varied significantly among distinct clusters at micron scale despite the fact that the external incubation environment was uniform and well mixed theoretically both stochastic such as dispersion limitation and deterministic such as environmental conditions and biotic interactions processes operate simultaneously in shaping community structure resulting in community dissimilarity across space or time bahram et al 2018 zhou and ning 2017 because there is considerable mixing in anammox system bacteria should not be limited by mobility across patches and dispersal limitation should be negligible leventhal et al 2018 yuan et al 2021b as such the great spatial variability in the community compositions of anammox consortia indicated that the biotic interactions play a significant role in the assembly of communities under well controlled and well mixed condition leventhal et al 2018 chemical concentration gradients e g nutrients and shear stress derived microenvironments may have also contributed to the heterogeneity of the anammox community røder et al 2020 importantly our findings demonstrated that variability in community compositions at the macro scale was considerably smaller than at the micron scale with the average coefficient of variation for bulk t2 samples being even an order of magnitude lower than that of micron t2 these results indicated that traditional microbiome profiling methodologies are confined to macroscopic population assessments and miss out on significant underlying spatial information røder et al 2020 sheth et al 2019 therefore to better understand the microbial interactions in anammox consortia it is crucial to move beyond macro scale analysis and focus on micron scale resolution of microbial biogeography 4 2 micron scale biogeography revealed no statistically significant symbiotic interactions between anammox bacteria and other populations bulk scale spatial structure might provide untrue interaction networks of multi species microbial communities armitage and jones 2019 previous studies based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomics found that ignavibacteria and anaerolineae had universal metabolic interactions with anammox bacteria by catabolizing extracellular peptides and scavenging detritus produced by anammox bacteria while anammox bacteria also provided essential b vitamins to these partners lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 these relationships were discovered among macro scale 300 500 µm clusters in our investigation as well which involved two distinct anammox bacteria otu13 and otu6 however because otu13 and otu6 took just a tiny fraction 4 6 of anammox bacteria the possibility that these interactions benefited to system performance was low furthermore these macro scale co occurrences vanished at the micron scale that otu 19 ignavibacteriaceae and otu 49 drc31 were not detected in t2 micron clusters such disappearance of co occurrence pattern at micron scale 70 100 µm indicated that these heterotrophic bacteria were likely spatially apart from anammox bacteria for at least 100 µm which was larger than the proved distance a few microns to tens of microns required for effective metabolite diffusion across cooperative cells kvich et al 2020 van tatenhove pel et al 2021b thus previously observed interaction between anammox bacteria and these two heterotrophic bacteria lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 while could be occasionally captured by fish signal kindaichi et al 2007 xie et al 2017 may suffer from a lack of support based on micron scale spatial information with statistical rigor therefore we posit that the macro scale co occurrence network analysis is a poor predictor of microbial interactions in anammox consortia another intriguing question is whether there were conserved ecological interactions partners of anammox bacteria across different stages of bioreactor t1 and t2 while the complexity of co occurrence networks in anammox consortia decreased substantially over time some robust co occurrences or lack of co occurrences were observed for instance species of rhodocyclales otu 1 and otu 2 which were among the most abundant taxa in the consortia consistently lacked co occurrences with other taxa and thus randomly assorted in mixed patches of anammox consortia sheth et al 2019 despite the fact that rhodocyclales and anammox bacteria were previously thought to be symbiotic interaction partners feng et al 2019 lawson et al 2017 no statistically significant spatial co associations between these two dominant populations was observed instead the conserved positive correlations for anammox bacteria were restricted to three different brocadia species otus 1048 759 and 824 at micron scale in our anammox reactor over incubation time furthermore due to the bulk macro scale nature of previous studies it is difficult to quantify whether external metabolite exchange between potential cooperators was successful rather than exploited by other bacteria cordero et al 2012 ebrahimi et al 2019 van tatenhove pel et al 2021a the general lack of reliable correlations between anammox bacteria and heterotrophic cooperators namely ignavibacteria anaerolineae and rhodocyclales lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 combined with our observation of stable intra genus interaction of anammox bacteria strongly indicates that those heterotrophic bacteria may simply act as waste scavengers assisting in scavenging detritus and peptides generated by anammox bacteria pollak et al 2021 rather than as cooperative partners regulating anammox metabolism and assembly on the other hand the ecological basis for the conservative spatial association among the genus brocadia could be twofold first the positive co occurrences of these three brocadia species may imply similar responses to optimal conditions for anammox bacteria growth nevertheless the otu1048 brocadia fulgida has a low substrate affinity preferring nh4 and no2 rich environments and high growth rate identified as an r strategist whereas the otu759 and otu824 brocadia sp 40 have high substrate affinities and low growth rates identified as k strategists lotti et al 2014 oshiki et al 2016 resulting the dominance of otu1048 in the anammox system operated at relatively high nh4 and no2 loading rates second since prior investigations had shown that bacteria co occurred at the micron scale were almost always mutually beneficial or even inseparable syntrophic partners haroon et al 2013 metcalfe et al 2021 the conservative positive correlations also reflected a tendency for inter species cooperation among these brocadia species previous research has confirmed that anammox activity was highly dependent on the cell density with a minimum cell density of 1010 1011 cells ml required to obtain a detectable anammox activity strous et al 1999 suggesting that quorum sensing qs played a critical role in stimulating anammox community aggregation and activity guo et al 2017 tang et al 2018 numerous studies have proven that signal messenger c di gmp is an important qs regulator for metabolic cooperation by controlling the exchange of amino acids and sugars to boost anammox activity and protect against environmental stresses guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in this study the same typical c di gmp synthetic pathway was discovered in brocadia genomes amx1 and amx2 which provided the foundation of qs based cooperation between different brocadia species flemming et al 2016 tan et al 2014 as a result we speculate that the three brocadia species aggregated and formed micron scale spatial co associations to minimize signaling molecule gradients tan et al 2014 within the consortia additionally the disordered regions and signal peptides of c di gmp synthetase differed between brocadia and jettenia genera suggested an incompatible c di gmp based qs threshold or pathway in these two genera dosztányi et al 2010 käll et al 2004 which was also observed by previous research based on comparative genomic analysis guo et al 2021 such differentiation of qs pathway may contribute to the assembly of anammox bacteria that no spatial co association could be observed between the brocadia and jettenia genera 4 3 ecological and metabolic machinery driving the community assembly of anammox consortia the two months incubation of anammox bioreactor has clearly altered the ecological niche of numerous heterotrophic bacteria with the number of specialists doubled over time notably with the exception of anammox bacteria the prevalence of high degree nodes in the t1 micron network decreased dramatically over time as did the niche breadth of the majority of them eventually leading to their extinction from the t2 micron network due to the lack of external organic carbon substrates and the limited amount of organic detritus produced by anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 the niches of the frequently detected heterotrophic bacteria otu41 ignavibacteriaceae and otu417 thauera lawson et al 2017 in anammox consortia narrowed over time eventually washing them out of the autotrophic system meanwhile the otu313 comamonadaceae otu48 anaerolineae and otu64 hyphomicrobium which are capable of nitrite reduction lawson et al 2017 rathnayake et al 2018 were washed out probably as a result of the competitive stress from anammox bacteria consolidating the importance of homogenous selection in determining the microbial composition dynamics over time yu et al 2021 this phenomenon was comparable to the biofilm ecosystem that numerous species were extinct due to resource competition yuan et al 2021b these observations suggest that intense selection pressure and interspecies competition resulted in a simple and cooperative network in our anammox consortia 5 conclusions by mapping the biogeography of anammox consortia at micron scale 70 100 µm we discovered that anammox community showed great spatial heterogeneity and demonstrated conserved co associations among three different brocadia species over time whereas previously reported microbial interactions between dominated anammox bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were not observed metagenomics revealed that c di gmp based quorum sensing potentially holding on the conservative cooperation among different brocadia species the severe selection pressure and interspecies competition in our anammox consortia resulted in a simple and cooperative network over time our study demonstrates the first delineation of spatial structure in anammox consortia with micron scale resolution contributing to an improved understanding of the social behavior of the anammox community additionally we should acknowledge limitation here in this study first considering the microbial community succession over time because only two time point data were utilized the conclusions of anammox consortia co occurrence patterns were not universal to derive general and meaningful findings future research should include numerous time dependent samples second measuring the microbial community at the micron scale helps to improve the sensitivity in detecting spatial associations among taxa armitage and jones 2019 however subcommunities remained within micron scale flocs whose heterogeneity would hamper the discovery of taxa spatial associations and interspecific interactions using correlation based techniques given that the metabolic interactions of complex communities are complicated and poorly understood further optimization of our protocols is required for their use in deciphering microbial interactions when integrated with approaches that investigate the active fractions of microbial communities couradeau et al 2019 our method has the potential to aid in the comprehension of interspecies interactions in complex communities in natural environments such as soil and sediment at the micron scale furthermore our method could be combined with whole genome amplification to capture function profiles of single biomass cluster at micron scale allowing us to investigate microbial interactions at the functional level credit authorship contribution statement liming chen visualization investigation formal

15849,micron scale resolution can help to reliably identify true taxon taxon interactions in complex microbial communities despite widespread recognition of the critical role of metabolic interactions in anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox system performance no studies have examined microbial interactions at the micron scale in anammox consortia to fill this gap we extensively sampled totally 242 samples the consortia of a lab scale anammox reactor at different length scales including bulk scale cm macro scale 300 500 µm and micron scale 70 100 µm we firstly observed evident micron scale heterogeneity in anammox consortia with the relative abundance of anammox bacteria fluctuated greatly across individual clusters 2 0 79 3 indicating that the biotic interactions play a significant role in the assembly of anammox communities under well controlled and well mixed condition importantly by mapping the spatial associations in anammox consortia at micron scale we demonstrated that the conserved co associations for anammox bacteria were restricted to three different brocadia species over time and their co associations with heterotrophs were random implying that there was no statistically significant symbiotic interaction between anammox bacteria and other heterotrophic populations further metagenomic binning revealed that the quorum sensing with secondary messenger c di gmp potentially holding on the conservative metabolic cooperation among brocadia species these results shed new light on the social behavior of the anammox community overall delineating of biological structures at micron scale opens a new way of monitoring the microbial spatial structure and interactions paving the way for improved community engineering of biotreatment systems graphical abstract

datta 2016 cell cell distances are short enough inside micron scale cell aggregates for diffusible metabolites to be collected from adjacent cells rather than losing to the environment cordero and datta 2016 ebrahimi et al 2019 metcalfe et al 2021 simultaneously various network model algorithms have been proposed to infer microbial interaction networks from microbial community data faust and raes 2012 ma et al 2016 yuan et al 2021a according to these correlation based methods positive relationship imply a cooperative connection whereas negative relationship indicate a competitive interaction faust and raes 2012 these inference methods however are constrained by the fundamental mismatch between the interaction derived spatial scale micrometers and those of traditional microbial community samples millimeters to centimeters armitage and jones 2019 cordero and datta 2016 additionally most complex microbial communities exhibit significant fine scale heterogeneity armitage and jones 2019 kuroda et al 2016 leventhal et al 2018 probandt et al 2018 as such traditional larger scale or bulk samples only provide average information over thousands of subcommunities but information on heterogeneity and spatial context are scarce cordero and datta 2016 shi et al 2021 therefore species interaction estimated from large scale samples is most likely due to responses to abiotic factors e g ph or oxygen rather than true biotic interactions cordero and datta 2016 and even produce over fitting microbial interaction networks fig 1 a røder et al 2020 despite of the power to reveal in situ spatial locations of interacting partners the low throughput limitation long assay time as well as the incapability to distinguish close related species hampered the application of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish in fully elucidate the inter species cooperation in a complex microbial community geva zatorsky et al 2015 shi et al 2020 therefore to estimate microbial interactions it is important to move beyond macroscale analysis and focus on micron scale spatial patterns with enough throughput and statistical associations darch et al 2018 røder et al 2020 sheth et al 2019 meta omics analysis will aid in the interpretation of microbial interactions inferred using network model approaches ponomarova and patil 2015 metagenomic analysis can decipher functional palettes of microbial community and the allocation of tasks among them which can further reveal syntrophic as well as competition relationships within microbial community ponomarova and patil 2015 sung et al 2017 transcriptomics are frequently utilized in conjunction with metagenomics to deduce what metabolic potential is active and to confirm true metabolic interaction network blasche et al 2021 lawson et al 2017 for instance the integrated metagenomics and metabolite analyzes pinpointed synergistic interactions in a bisphenol a bpa degrading microbial community where the cross feeding between bpa degrading sphingonomas species and intermediate users pseudomonas sp enhanced bpa biodegradation yu et al 2019 together integration of meta omics analysis and network model methods at micron scale level will be particularly beneficial for revealing microbial interactions in complex microbial communities understanding microbial interactions in bioengineering process is critical for improving and optimizing system stability and performance yu et al 2019 the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process whereby nitrite directly oxidize ammonium to nitrogen gas anaerobically has attracted much attention as an energy saving alternative to the traditional biological nitrogen removal technology kuenen 2008 2020 previous studies have stated that autotrophic nitrifying and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria are omnipresent in anammox enrichment cultures and the pervasive metabolic interactions between anammox and heterotrophs facilitate the overall system performance huo et al 2020 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 however these microbial interactions proposed in anammox consortia were mainly inferred based on the metabolic complementary or redundant pathways between potential partners of the bulk scale community samples with few of them being validated using in situ micron scale spatial information by fish xie et al 2017 as of now the micron scale microbial interaction network for the anammox community or even the microbiome of any engineered biosystem has not been investigated in a high throughput manner which evidently restricted our understanding of microbial interactions underpinning the community effectiveness during biological wastewater treatment taken together in this study we successfully built spatial association networks of anammox consortia in a sequencing batch reactor sbr at micron scale 70 100 µm level the mechanism of metabolic interactions within anammox consortia was further explored combining metagenomic binning and functional annotation we aimed to reveal 1 the level of micron scale spatial heterogeneity of anammox community 2 whether anammox bacteria have conservative interaction partners with in the anammox community over time and 3 the phylogenetic and functional divergency of these conserved partners this study will deepen our understanding of the spatial organization and ecological interaction network of anammox consortia allowing for mechanistic analysis of ecological processes associated with community assembly or succession furthermore the experimental protocols and analytical procedures developed in this work will pave the way for future research on micron scale microbial interactions in both engineered and natural environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up of the anammox reactor a lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with working volume of 4 0 l was operated at 36 1 c for 75 days with an initial volatile suspended solid vss of 0 18 g l fig s1 the seed anammox biomass was taken from an sbr with stable anammox performance zhao et al 2018 it was first pulverized and sieved through 100 mesh nylon filter 150 μm and washed with 1 pbs three times before inoculation the influent of the sbr reactor was synthetic wastewater described previously van de graaf et al 1996 the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the influent was stepwise increased from 50 to 80 mg l the reactor was strictly anaerobic influent ph was maintained at 6 8 8 3 and the hydraulic retention time was set at 24 h the influent and effluent were collected every three days for nh4 n no2 n and no3 n measurement according to the standard method of the american public health association apha 1998 during the operation of the reactor two bulk samples were harvested on the days 5 t1 and 60 t2 for dna extraction and sequencing analysis 2 2 single micron cluster separation and dna extraction we collected triplicated bulk scale cm samples and micron scale 70 100 μm single clusters at both t1 and t2 time points while macro scale 300 500 µm single cluster samples were collected only at t2 time point for bulk samples 500 mg of biomass was collected from the reactor centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min to remove the supernatant total genomic dna of bulk samples was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp bio solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s protocol for micron scale 70 100 µm single cluster samples anammox biomass were placed in a stainless steel vial along with an 8 mm stainless steel bead and sealed with a stainless steel cap the vial was transferred to a bead beater jxfstprp 64 jingxin china where it was subjected to beating for 30 s the 1 pbs was added to the vial and vortexed and clusters in pbs were then removed and washed three times with pbs by centrifugation 1 min at 5000 g clusters were then resuspended in pbs and subjected to size selection clusters were pass through the 100 µm and 70 µm cell strainer biologix sequentially to obtain 70 100 µm clusters clusters were then resuspended in 1 1 pbs ethanol mixture and subjected to hand sorting for single clusters single clusters were randomly hand sorted using an eppendorf 2 5 μl pipette under digital microscope t007 shenzhen supereyes co ltd on a clean bench and each single cluster was then transferred into a sterile pcr tube fig 1b we initially collected 70 and 210 micron scale clusters at t1 and t2 time points respectively to sample macro scale 300 500 µm single clusters anammox biomass was grinded and pass through the 500 and 300 µm nylon filter sequentially to obtain 300 500 µm clusters and washed with 1x pbs three times with pbs by centrifugation 1 min at 5000 g single clusters were randomly hand sorted using an eppendorf 1 ml pipette on a clean bench and each single cluster was then collected in a sterile pcr tube similarly 80 macro scale clusters were initially aimed at t2 time point table s2 blank control without single cluster was also set up in all assays the rnaisoplus takara biotechnology was used to extract dna of single cluster the dna extraction method of micron scale and macro scale single cluster was shown in supplementary method 2 3 pcr and 16s rrna gene analysis universal bacterial primers 515f and 806r targeting the v4 region were used to amplify the 16s rrna gene of the genomic dna the detail information of pcr procedure was shown in supplementary method the extracted and purified pcr products were sequenced on an illumina novaseq platform at beijing novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd yielding 250 bp paired end reads using the default parameters in the qiime1 software package the sequencing reads were demultiplexed and quality filtered to eliminate low quality sequences caporaso et al 2010 and chimeric sequences were further identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same otus by matching the representative sequences of each otu to the silva 132 database taxonomy annotation was examined quast et al 2012 in this study the anammox community is defined as the whole microbial community in the anammox reactor while the anammox bacteria community is defined as the microbial community composed only of anammox bacteria all the sequence reads were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under the accession number prjna789415 samn24108848 samn24108854 2 4 metagenome sequencing assembly and binning the extracted total genomic dna of bulk samples at t1 time point was used for metagenome shotgun sequencing the detail information of metagenome sequencing assembly binning and functional annotation can be found in supplementary method the raw reads were deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the accession number prjna789668 samn24146403 2 5 ecological niche of otus given that there was great spatial heterogeneity in complex microbial community armitage and jones 2019 we employed ecological niche index to classify each otu even in a well mixed reactor we categorized otus as either generalist common taxa or specialist based on their frequency of occurrence among the micron scale clusters by employing permutation algorithms of ecolutils r package salazar 2019 niche breadth was further used to validate the difference between generalists and specialists levins 1968 details about the estimation of ecological niche are provided in supplementary method 2 6 statistical methods we calculated the coefficient of variation defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean for each order based on its relative abundance among micron macro scale clusters analysis of similarity anosim statistics clarke 1993 was performed to test the significance of differences in the bacterial community by classification using the vegan r package to determine pairwise associations otus with relative abundance great than 0 1 in at least 20 of clusters were retained for the co occurrence analysis a significant association between two species was determined if the spearman s correlation coefficient ρ 0 6 and p value 0 001 barberán et al 2012 network visualization and topological characteristic calculation were conducted using the gephi software bastian et al 2009 3 results 3 1 spatial heterogeneity of anammox consortia at micron scale in total we assigned 3716 245 high quality filtered sequences to 533 otus to ensure the comparability among samples we rarified all samples to 5000 sequences and obtained sequence data for 242 samples collected at two different enrichment stages of the anammox reactor t1 at day 5 and t2 at day 60 including 6 bulk scale 1 cm samples 166 micron scale 70 100 µm and 70 macro scale 300 500 µm samples fig 2 a and table s2 the number of otus ranged from 62 to 310 across 242 samples the overall anammox community was dominated by otu1048 anammox bacteria brocadia fulgida with a mean relative abundance of 34 52 followed by otu1 rhodocyclaceae 14 70 and otu2 rhodocyclaceae 11 09 figs 2a and s2 all anammox bacteria otus were affiliated to the genera brocadia and jettenia with otu1048 brocadia fulgida and otu13 jettenia sp accounting for 91 8 and 2 4 of total anammox bacteria respectively figs s3 and s4 additionally the relative abundance of anammox bacteria significantly increased over time while the predominant heterotrophic bacteria betaproteobacteria rhodocyclales sc i 84 and burkholderiales exhibited an opposite pattern fig s5 the mean relative abundances of anammox bacteria were respectively 29 9 41 2 and 35 8 in samples t1 micron t2 micron and t2 macro which was comparable to that of bulk samples of t1 26 5 and t2 39 6 such anammox bacteria prevalence consistency between bulk sample and selected micron scale macro scale clusters suggested the representativeness and randomness of manually picked single clusters which was fundamental for reliable correlation network construction to reveal the micron scale heterogeneity of anammox consortia the community composition of single clusters was profiled fig 2a evident micron scale heterogeneity could be observed as the community compositions were not uniform in individual clusters the relative abundance of anammox bacteria fluctuated greatly across micron scale clusters ranging from as low as 2 0 to as high as 79 3 fig s3 the coefficient of variation was respectively 0 56 and 0 39 in t1 micron and t2 micron clusters fig 2c other dominant populations within the anammox community average relative abundance 0 05 showed even greater fluctuation in relative abundance with coefficients of variation reaching as high as 2 79 for nb1 j spp in t1 micron clusters and 6 15 for acidimicrobiales in t2 micron clusters additionally the richness of t1 micron clusters average otus sd 169 5 42 9 was significantly higher than that of t2 micron clusters average otus sd 107 0 21 4 fig 2b mann whitney u test p 0 001 suggesting a decreased community richness in anammox consortia along time of incubation the richness of t2 macro clusters average otus sd 138 0 23 5 was significantly higher than that of t2 micron clusters which corresponded with earlier studies of anammox reactors chen et al 2020 large clusters contain more distinctly microenvironments due to the chemical concentration gradients de weirdt and van de wiele 2015 røder et al 2020 thus supporting the inhabiting of more species together these findings consolidated the notion that like many other microbiomes leventhal et al 2018 probandt et al 2018 sheth et al 2019 the micron scale community of anammox reactor exhibits higher than expected level of heterogeneity which cannot be captured by commonly used bulk sample studies next we explored how the length scale might influence the delineating of spatial heterogeneity by comparing micron scale 70 100 µm and macro scale 300 500 µm community compositions at the t2 time point noteworthy was that the coefficient of variation for the dominant orders across micron scale clusters was significantly higher than that of macro scale communities fig 3 a wilcoxon test p 0 001 to avoid the biases caused by sampling scale disparity we have compared the coefficient of variation of between macro scale community and three micron scale subcommunities at the t2 time point fig s6 the three micron scale communities also show a significant higher coefficient of variation in relative abundances than the macro scale community there were only minor differences between the macro t2 and micron t2 communities fig 3b aonsim r 0 125 p 0 001 a similar trend was observed when comparing macro scale communities and bulk scale communities with bulk t2 communities exhibiting the smallest coefficient of variation in relative abundances fig 3a wilcoxon test p 0 001 further beta diversity analysis also showed that community differentiation within micron scale clusters was higher than that of macro scale samples fig 3c mann whitney u test p 10 9 these results indicated that bulk scale and macro scale investigation on anammox consortia would lose important spatial information and can only provide information with average properties of taxa 3 2 spatial association networks of anammox consortia at micron scale after confirming the spatial heterogeneity of anammox consortia we next investigated microbial co occurrences patterns within micron scale spatial communities to reduce random noise otus with relative abundance greater than 0 1 in at least 20 of clusters were retained for the co occurrence analysis we respectively obtained 65 45 and 59 otus in t1 micron t2 micron and t2 macro clusters for subsequent analysis t2 micron and t2 macro clusters shared 41 otus with 18 otus observed only in t2 macro clusters such as otu19 ignavibacteriaceae and otu 49 drc31 t1 micron and t2 micron clusters shared 39 otus with 26 otus found in t1 micron clusters but not in t2 micron such as otu64 hyphomicrobium otu417 thauera and otu313 comamonadaceae fig 4 a three co occurrence networks fig 4b d and table s3 were respectively built using t2 macro t2 micron and t1 micron otus to reveal the effect of spatial resolution micron vs macro and incubation time t1 vs t2 on the spatial organization in anammox consortia worth to note is that the number of t2 micron clusters was evidently larger than that of t1 micron therefore to avoid the biases caused by sampling scale disparity we construct co occurrence networks of three subsamples of t2 micron clusters each containing 40 42 and 46 clusters respectively since principally consistent co occurrence patterns were observed between subsamples and entire set of t2 micron clusters fig s7 we used the network constructed from the entire set of t2 micron clusters when comparing network topological features compared to t2 macro network the t2 micron network harbored a simple co occurrence pattern displaying only positive correlations only intra genus associations were observed among anammox bacteria where dominant otus otus 1048 759 824 and 1059 of brocadia genus were tightly connected with each other with average correlation coefficient of 0 73 fig 4c in contrast the macro scale clusters exhibited a denser network consisting of both positive and negative correlations fig 4b apart from the positive co occurrences between three abundant anammox bacteria otus 1048 759 and 824 of brocadia genus inter genus association between anammox bacteria and other populations were also observed for example both otu1048 and otu759 showed negative associations with otu42 nitrosomonadaceae and otu40 gemmatimonadetes at macro scale of note two low abundant anammox bacteria otu6 and otu13 exhibited positive associations with otu49 drc31 and otu19 ignavibacteriaceae at macro scale respectively fig 4b we further investigate the succession of spatial co occurrence networks over time t1 vs t2 at micron resolution the network constructed from t1 micron clusters had 37 nodes and 61 edges while the t2 micron network showed a dramatically simplified topology with 10 nodes and 8 edges the top 5 high degree nodes in t1 micron network include anammox bacteria of otu1048 and otu759 otu313 comamonadaceae otu64 hyphomicrobium and otu417 thauera fig 4d noteworthy is that the last three taxa were vanished in t2 micron network fig 4c importantly the conservation of positive co occurrences among a subset of three anammox bacteria affiliated to the brocadia genus otus 1048 759 and 824 was validated by profiling the succession of spatial co occurrence networks across time suggesting that these spatial co occurrences were robust at micron scales over time of note these three anammox bacteria showed negative co associations with high degree nodes such as otus 313 64 and 48 in t1 micron network whereas these co occurrences vanished in t2 micron network 3 3 generalists and specialists in anammox consortia at micron scale to further reveal the micron scale anammox community succession we investigated the ecological niche changing of each otus in anammox consortia across time otus in t1 micron and t2 micron clusters were categorized as either generalist common taxa or specialist based on occurrence frequency by employing permutation algorithms of ecolutils a total of 67 and 66 otus were respectively identified as generalists of t1 micron and t2 micron communities the generalist populations accounted for more than 90 of the entire communities fig 5 a rhodocyclales and brocadiales were the dominant generalists together accounting for about 60 of entire communities of both time points there were 63 and 121 otus respectively classified as specialists of t1 micron and t2 micron communities these specialists only accounted for 1 4 and 2 5 of t1 micron and t2 micron communities respectively the niche breadth index value was further calculated to confirm the distinction between generalists and specialists generalists clearly had a greater niche breadth and appeared in more clusters than specialists fig 5b of note three different anammox bacteria otus 1048 759 and 824 affiliated to brocadia genus were generalist all the time whereas the anammox bacteria otu13 affiliated to jettenia genus changed from common taxa to specialist over time fig 6 furthermore otu417 and otu313 shifted from generalist to common taxa despite their relatively high degree of association with other otus in the co occurrence network of t1 micron clusters table s4 3 4 anammox consortia metagenomic insights to decipher potential functional profile of anammox consortia we performed metagenome sequencing of t1 time point bulk sample after assembly and binning 50 metagenome assembled genomes mags completeness 70 and contamination 10 were obtained parks et al 2015 accounting for 65 3 of the total quality filtered reads the recovered 50 mags were mainly affiliated to phyla proteobacteria 11 mags planctomycetota 11 mags chloroflexota 7 mags bacteroidota 7 mags and myxococcota 4 mags table s5 based on phylogenetic analysis three mags were classified as anammox species fig 7 a namely amx1 brocadia sapporoensis amx2 brocadia fulgida and amx3 jettenia caeni metagenomics reflected that these three anammox bacteria possessed synthetic or regulatory genes rpfb and rpfg of bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp fig 7b c which was an important signal messenger of quorum sensing qs in anammox culture guo et al 2017 despite the fact that the predicted proteins of qs genes shared the same pfam domains in brocadia and jettenia the disordered regions and signal peptides of the predicted proteins differed fig 7b c 4 discussion 4 1 bulk scale analysis losing spatial information of anammox consortia metabolic interactions between cells influence the composition of microbial communities and as a result their function in ecosystems faust and raes 2012 microbial community data are often subjected to co occurrence network analysis with the goal of deciphering microbial interactions within microbiota faust and raes 2012 ma et al 2016 yuan et al 2021a recently some studies have challenged current correlation based methods for inferring ecological interactions armitage and jones 2019 freilich et al 2018 røder et al 2020 most current approaches do not account heterogeneity and just provide average information of bulk sample that composed of substantial individual microhabitats patches which can obscure the signal of microbial interactions due to simpson s paradox context dependence and nonlinear averaging phenomena armitage and jones 2019 as a result identifying and characterizing spatial heterogeneity may provide a better and more precise understanding of microbial interactions of anammox consortia at the appropriate scale previous studies have shown that most multi species microbial communities are spatially structured and exhibit marked heterogeneity at fine scale as evidenced by studies of sediment gut and wastewater treatment system kuroda et al 2016 leventhal et al 2018 probandt et al 2018 sheth et al 2019 analogously we discovered that the anammox community at the order level and within a single timepoint varied significantly among distinct clusters at micron scale despite the fact that the external incubation environment was uniform and well mixed theoretically both stochastic such as dispersion limitation and deterministic such as environmental conditions and biotic interactions processes operate simultaneously in shaping community structure resulting in community dissimilarity across space or time bahram et al 2018 zhou and ning 2017 because there is considerable mixing in anammox system bacteria should not be limited by mobility across patches and dispersal limitation should be negligible leventhal et al 2018 yuan et al 2021b as such the great spatial variability in the community compositions of anammox consortia indicated that the biotic interactions play a significant role in the assembly of communities under well controlled and well mixed condition leventhal et al 2018 chemical concentration gradients e g nutrients and shear stress derived microenvironments may have also contributed to the heterogeneity of the anammox community røder et al 2020 importantly our findings demonstrated that variability in community compositions at the macro scale was considerably smaller than at the micron scale with the average coefficient of variation for bulk t2 samples being even an order of magnitude lower than that of micron t2 these results indicated that traditional microbiome profiling methodologies are confined to macroscopic population assessments and miss out on significant underlying spatial information røder et al 2020 sheth et al 2019 therefore to better understand the microbial interactions in anammox consortia it is crucial to move beyond macro scale analysis and focus on micron scale resolution of microbial biogeography 4 2 micron scale biogeography revealed no statistically significant symbiotic interactions between anammox bacteria and other populations bulk scale spatial structure might provide untrue interaction networks of multi species microbial communities armitage and jones 2019 previous studies based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomics found that ignavibacteria and anaerolineae had universal metabolic interactions with anammox bacteria by catabolizing extracellular peptides and scavenging detritus produced by anammox bacteria while anammox bacteria also provided essential b vitamins to these partners lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 these relationships were discovered among macro scale 300 500 µm clusters in our investigation as well which involved two distinct anammox bacteria otu13 and otu6 however because otu13 and otu6 took just a tiny fraction 4 6 of anammox bacteria the possibility that these interactions benefited to system performance was low furthermore these macro scale co occurrences vanished at the micron scale that otu 19 ignavibacteriaceae and otu 49 drc31 were not detected in t2 micron clusters such disappearance of co occurrence pattern at micron scale 70 100 µm indicated that these heterotrophic bacteria were likely spatially apart from anammox bacteria for at least 100 µm which was larger than the proved distance a few microns to tens of microns required for effective metabolite diffusion across cooperative cells kvich et al 2020 van tatenhove pel et al 2021b thus previously observed interaction between anammox bacteria and these two heterotrophic bacteria lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 while could be occasionally captured by fish signal kindaichi et al 2007 xie et al 2017 may suffer from a lack of support based on micron scale spatial information with statistical rigor therefore we posit that the macro scale co occurrence network analysis is a poor predictor of microbial interactions in anammox consortia another intriguing question is whether there were conserved ecological interactions partners of anammox bacteria across different stages of bioreactor t1 and t2 while the complexity of co occurrence networks in anammox consortia decreased substantially over time some robust co occurrences or lack of co occurrences were observed for instance species of rhodocyclales otu 1 and otu 2 which were among the most abundant taxa in the consortia consistently lacked co occurrences with other taxa and thus randomly assorted in mixed patches of anammox consortia sheth et al 2019 despite the fact that rhodocyclales and anammox bacteria were previously thought to be symbiotic interaction partners feng et al 2019 lawson et al 2017 no statistically significant spatial co associations between these two dominant populations was observed instead the conserved positive correlations for anammox bacteria were restricted to three different brocadia species otus 1048 759 and 824 at micron scale in our anammox reactor over incubation time furthermore due to the bulk macro scale nature of previous studies it is difficult to quantify whether external metabolite exchange between potential cooperators was successful rather than exploited by other bacteria cordero et al 2012 ebrahimi et al 2019 van tatenhove pel et al 2021a the general lack of reliable correlations between anammox bacteria and heterotrophic cooperators namely ignavibacteria anaerolineae and rhodocyclales lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 combined with our observation of stable intra genus interaction of anammox bacteria strongly indicates that those heterotrophic bacteria may simply act as waste scavengers assisting in scavenging detritus and peptides generated by anammox bacteria pollak et al 2021 rather than as cooperative partners regulating anammox metabolism and assembly on the other hand the ecological basis for the conservative spatial association among the genus brocadia could be twofold first the positive co occurrences of these three brocadia species may imply similar responses to optimal conditions for anammox bacteria growth nevertheless the otu1048 brocadia fulgida has a low substrate affinity preferring nh4 and no2 rich environments and high growth rate identified as an r strategist whereas the otu759 and otu824 brocadia sp 40 have high substrate affinities and low growth rates identified as k strategists lotti et al 2014 oshiki et al 2016 resulting the dominance of otu1048 in the anammox system operated at relatively high nh4 and no2 loading rates second since prior investigations had shown that bacteria co occurred at the micron scale were almost always mutually beneficial or even inseparable syntrophic partners haroon et al 2013 metcalfe et al 2021 the conservative positive correlations also reflected a tendency for inter species cooperation among these brocadia species previous research has confirmed that anammox activity was highly dependent on the cell density with a minimum cell density of 1010 1011 cells ml required to obtain a detectable anammox activity strous et al 1999 suggesting that quorum sensing qs played a critical role in stimulating anammox community aggregation and activity guo et al 2017 tang et al 2018 numerous studies have proven that signal messenger c di gmp is an important qs regulator for metabolic cooperation by controlling the exchange of amino acids and sugars to boost anammox activity and protect against environmental stresses guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in this study the same typical c di gmp synthetic pathway was discovered in brocadia genomes amx1 and amx2 which provided the foundation of qs based cooperation between different brocadia species flemming et al 2016 tan et al 2014 as a result we speculate that the three brocadia species aggregated and formed micron scale spatial co associations to minimize signaling molecule gradients tan et al 2014 within the consortia additionally the disordered regions and signal peptides of c di gmp synthetase differed between brocadia and jettenia genera suggested an incompatible c di gmp based qs threshold or pathway in these two genera dosztányi et al 2010 käll et al 2004 which was also observed by previous research based on comparative genomic analysis guo et al 2021 such differentiation of qs pathway may contribute to the assembly of anammox bacteria that no spatial co association could be observed between the brocadia and jettenia genera 4 3 ecological and metabolic machinery driving the community assembly of anammox consortia the two months incubation of anammox bioreactor has clearly altered the ecological niche of numerous heterotrophic bacteria with the number of specialists doubled over time notably with the exception of anammox bacteria the prevalence of high degree nodes in the t1 micron network decreased dramatically over time as did the niche breadth of the majority of them eventually leading to their extinction from the t2 micron network due to the lack of external organic carbon substrates and the limited amount of organic detritus produced by anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 the niches of the frequently detected heterotrophic bacteria otu41 ignavibacteriaceae and otu417 thauera lawson et al 2017 in anammox consortia narrowed over time eventually washing them out of the autotrophic system meanwhile the otu313 comamonadaceae otu48 anaerolineae and otu64 hyphomicrobium which are capable of nitrite reduction lawson et al 2017 rathnayake et al 2018 were washed out probably as a result of the competitive stress from anammox bacteria consolidating the importance of homogenous selection in determining the microbial composition dynamics over time yu et al 2021 this phenomenon was comparable to the biofilm ecosystem that numerous species were extinct due to resource competition yuan et al 2021b these observations suggest that intense selection pressure and interspecies competition resulted in a simple and cooperative network in our anammox consortia 5 conclusions by mapping the biogeography of anammox consortia at micron scale 70 100 µm we discovered that anammox community showed great spatial heterogeneity and demonstrated conserved co associations among three different brocadia species over time whereas previously reported microbial interactions between dominated anammox bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were not observed metagenomics revealed that c di gmp based quorum sensing potentially holding on the conservative cooperation among different brocadia species the severe selection pressure and interspecies competition in our anammox consortia resulted in a simple and cooperative network over time our study demonstrates the first delineation of spatial structure in anammox consortia with micron scale resolution contributing to an improved understanding of the social behavior of the anammox community additionally we should acknowledge limitation here in this study first considering the microbial community succession over time because only two time point data were utilized the conclusions of anammox consortia co occurrence patterns were not universal to derive general and meaningful findings future research should include numerous time dependent samples second measuring the microbial community at the micron scale helps to improve the sensitivity in detecting spatial associations among taxa armitage and jones 2019 however subcommunities remained within micron scale flocs whose heterogeneity would hamper the discovery of taxa spatial associations and interspecific interactions using correlation based techniques given that the metabolic interactions of complex communities are complicated and poorly understood further optimization of our protocols is required for their use in deciphering microbial interactions when integrated with approaches that investigate the active fractions of microbial communities couradeau et al 2019 our method has the potential to aid in the comprehension of interspecies interactions in complex communities in natural environments such as soil and sediment at the micron scale furthermore our method could be combined with whole genome amplification to capture function profiles of single biomass cluster at micron scale allowing us to investigate microbial interactions at the functional level credit authorship contribution statement liming chen visualization investigation formal
