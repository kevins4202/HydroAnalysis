855,the effects of land use and land cover lulc change on environmental systems across the land surface s critical zone are highly uncertain often making prediction and risk management decision difficult in a series of numerical experiments with an integrated hydrologic model overland flow generation is quantified for both present day and forest thinning scenarios a typhoon storm event in a watershed near the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant is used as an example application in which the interplay between lulc change and overland flow generation is important given that sediment bound radionuclides may cause secondary contamination via surface water transport results illustrate the nonlinearity of the integrated system spanning from the deep groundwater to the atmosphere and provide quantitative tools when determining the tradeoffs of different risk mitigation strategies keywords land use land cover change risk management watershed hydrology critical zone erosion fukushima dai ichi 1 introduction human impacts on the terrestrial land surface are difficult to quantify but estimates of lands transformed by anthropogenic activities range between one third and one half of earth s surface vitousek et al 1997 land use and land cover lulc changes evolve over time in response to socio economic conditions and demand with the most common transformations resulting from agricultural activities urbanization and deforestation because changes in land cover inherently affect the physical biological and geochemical properties of an area often other environmental systems such as water balance are affected e g schiling et al 2008 in order to accurately determine the effect of lulc changes on a given system interdisciplinary and holistic approaches must be taken because of the tight coupling between system components in hydrologic assessments recent work shows the connection across the critical zone of the earth s surface ranging from deep groundwater systems to the top of the vegetation canopy brooks et al 2015 while a number of studies have been conducted to illustrate how lulc change impact hydrologic responses carlson and arthur 2000 lahmer et al 2001 scanlon et al 2005 wang et al 2013 quantitatively determining how lulc changes affect the spatially distributed water energy budget across the critical zone in coupled systems is difficult this difficulty is especially enhanced in systems where competing processes are often characterized by different physics e g defries and eshleman 2004 predicting the effects of lulc changes across all components of the water energy balance is important for planning and management purposes particularly when making land use and water resource decisions in the last decade the use of process based integrated hydrologic numerical models for prediction purposes has become increasingly advanced e g see paniconi and putti 2015 and references therein table 1 summarizes an example subset of integrated hydrologic studies and the progression of the simulator s capabilities to include more water energy budget components it should be noted that although an increasing number of models are capable of simulating processes spanning across the entire critical zone the level of complexity of each model vary dramatically this is especially true for some of the land based processes varying from analytical and lumped parameter approaches to complex physically based numerical schemes also note that the scale and resolution of integrated watershed simulations substantially varies depending on the capability of the model in this study coupled surface and groundwater land surface and atmospheric processes are jointly considered by using an integrated hydrologic model explicitly coupled to a land surface model in order to predict how lulc changes affect hydrologic budgets and flows emphasis in this study is placed on the quantification and spatial distribution of overland flow of generation as it plays an important role in sediment and contaminant transport e g julien and simmons 1985 prosser and rustomji 2000 as described in section 3 of generation is simulated in an example watershed with the objective to i determine the temporal dynamics of of generation and the lulc types most susceptible to of generation and thus erosion and sediment contamination due to storm events ii quantify the impact of lulc management decisions on i including the impact on the water energy budget and iii demonstrate a methodology to provide decision makers with quantitative predictive metrics regarding the impact of future storm events on of dynamics and the associated risks 2 study site in this work we utilize the example of sediment bound radionuclide transport resulting from the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident as an example of the potential interplay between lulc change hydrologic changes in the critical zone and of generation this problem requires the use of an integrated hydrologic model to explore whole system changes including the critical zone due to proposed lulc changes near fdnpp to mitigate risks following the accident a representative watershed in the fukushima prefecture is used to model the impact of these potential changes across the critical zone which may be important given connections between groundwater to surface water during storm events and the presence of dense vegetation that may play an important role in the hydrologic budget of the system simulation of this watershed is not intended to model exact hydrologic conditions which would require further site specific data integration but rather is meant to explore the processes and dynamics that could be important in decision making in 2011 a magnitude 9 1 earthquake off the eastern coast of japan triggered a tsunami which eventually resulted in the explosion of multiple reactors at the fdnpp and the subsequent atmospheric deposition of radionuclides mostly concentrated over a large area greater than 30 km radially north to northwest of the plant widespread radionuclide contamination of cesium 137 137cs a by product of the nuclear fission reaction covered a large area within a 30 km radius of the plant making decontamination efforts difficult since the accident decontamination efforts have been focused on areas where human exposure is highest including villages and roadsides here high pressure washing of non porous surfaces and the excavation of topsoil are the most common approaches to decontamination miyahara et al 2015 however these decontaminated regions only account for a small fraction of the area contaminated by the accident due to the fdnpp s proximity to forested areas and the abundance of forestland within the fukushima prefecture today approximately 95 of the on land fallout now resides within the upper 5 cm of forest soils where 137cs is strongly sorbed to the porous media hashimoto et al 2012 matsunaga et al 2013 nakanishi et al 2014 it s important to note that given the majority of the contamination exists in near surface soils the transport of 137cs is mostly a physical erosion problem where the location of of generation is an important indicator of where 137cs may begin to migrate because contamination is so widespread several decontamination strategies have been proposed as an alternative to a complete restriction of the contaminated forests which would have serious implications for the local forestry industry tourism and local communities and are currently being tested for effectiveness approaches such as trunk washing branch trimming felling and the removal of litter and humus layers vary dramatically in terms of their ability to reduce the dose rate studies conducted by the japan atomic energy agency show that individual tree removal was found to be the most effective in reducing 100 of cesium exposure miyahara et al 2015 although more observational data is needed forest thinning may be an attractive option to reduce the exposure of 137cs in fukushima watersheds to date few decontamination efforts of the forests have been put into place due to the expansive areas high waste volumes and high associated costs of decontamination thus tradeoffs between tree removal and the potential for 137cs mobilization by surface water or groundwater transport when forest thinning is implemented remains highly uncertain baseline predictive studies are necessary to determine how these contaminated forests will respond hydrologically over time particularly in the presence of generally high precipitation seasons in japan the tsuyu including high intensity typhoon events known to occur on an annual basis in this region nagao et al 2013 average precipitation in this region exceeds 200 mm of precipitation per year with the wettest months being june through october if decontamination efforts are put into place a primary concern is secondary contamination which involves a decontaminated region becoming re contaminated as water and sediments move over time predictive studies will be useful to assess the likelihood of secondary contamination particularly by factoring in the effects of parameters such as lulc type and topography in the fukushima prefecture these types of studies may aid farmers and other residents in determining optimal relocation areas in the watershed that are least susceptible to secondary contamination in this work we assess both baseline conditions and decontamination i e risk management scenarios in a representative watershed southwest of the fdnpp see fig 1 following the accident this region was in the exclusion area deemed unsafe for residential and agricultural use although the area is characterized by 96 deciduous and evergreen forestland small plots of residential land rice paddy and other crops are interspersed within the dense forests based on the mandatory evacuation following the accident the small communities of farmers and forest loggers were forced to abandon their lands predictive studies such as those described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 will be useful in determining the risks associated with both no mitigation and decontamination efforts given that there are tradeoffs between 1 removing contaminated trees as a source of 137cs and 2 the potential for more erosion and thus transport of 137cs 3 methodology 3 1 parameterization of the numerical model the integrated hydrologic model parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 maxwell 2013 is used to solve the coupled flow of saturated and variably saturated groundwater and overland surface water in the fukushima watershed the three dimensional richards equation is solved in the subsurface allowing for both the vertical and lateral flow of groundwater in both saturated and variably saturated environments and the two dimensional kinematic wave approximation is used to solve surface water flow kollet and maxwell 2006 a full description of the model physics can be found in the aforementioned references parflow was designed for massively parallel computer environments kollet et al 2010 and for highly resolved numerical simulations e g siirila woodburn and maxwell 2015 siirila woodburn et al 2015 thus parflow is an excellent candidate where high spatial resolution and temporal data are available meteorological forcing is incorporated in the numerical model via integration with the land model common land model clm clm calculates a coupled water energy balance at every surface cell of the domain dai et al 2003 and incorporates spatially distributed vegetative processes by including specified land use types land cover is differentiated into seven types from remote sensing data acquired by the advanced visible and near infrared radiometer avnir 2 onboard the advanced land observation satellite takahaski et al 2013 parameters such as leaf dimensions rooting distribution leaf and stem area index reflectance and transmittance are incorporated into the simulations via the international geosphere biosphere program igbp database of standard land use types further details can be found in oleson et al 2010 and references therein parameterization for the rice paddy land classification is based on the crop igbp classification type but was modified for stem area index and displacement height based on observational data hussain et al 2014 as described in table 2 it is assumed that the initial condition of the rice paddy fields are not under flooded i e growing conditions through this integrated setup parflow is used to simulate the entire critical zone of the watershed from the top of the forest canopy and surrounding atmosphere to regions of deep saturated groundwater the spatial extent of the modeled watershed is shown in fig 1 approximately 8 2 km by 6 8 km by 21 m in the x y and z directions respectively high resolution numerical discretization is used to characterize the complex topography of this steep grade predominantly forested region horizontal cell resolution is the same in the x and y directions equivalent to 12 4 m vertical cell resolution increases with depth ranging from 0 3 m at the land surface to 10 m at the deepest portion of the model see table 2 the model domain is comprised of five layers which constitute two subsurface stratified units see table 2 subsurface parameterization is based on field campaigns conducted by the japan atomic energy agency in this watershed given that laterally heterogeneous subsurface porous media would complicate the evaluation of how spatially distributed lulc changes at the surface impact the water energy budget and generation of of only vertical heterogeneity of subsurface media is considered the only subsurface properties varied by lulc types were those related to rooting parameters results may or may not be sensitive to other subsurface properties such as permeability which may be correlated to lulc type the impact of subsurface parameters correlated with lulc is reserved for future work the spatial resolution of the watershed model is highly resolved 1 8 million cells simulations were performed on a national energy research scientific computing center nersc supercomputer edison a digital elevation model dem of the watershed in conjunction with the r watershed tool in the gis platform grass was used to process the terrain shown in fig 1 following maxwell 2013 a terrain following grid was used to generate the model domain mesh including the slope of each cell rivers are not enforced in the model rather they develop naturally during the initial simulations given the topography of the region a number of tests were conducted to ensure water routes at the land surface in a realistic fashion confirming the accuracy of the kinematic wave approximation for all faces of the watershed boundary except at the land surface no flow boundaries are placed sufficiently far from the watershed border such that they do not significantly impact the results at the land surface clm is driven by an hourly time series of atmospheric observational data a 48 hour high intensity rainfall event occurring during typhoon roke september 20 21 2011 is used as a representative storm event where of would likely generate in areas usually only characterized by groundwater flow hourly atmospheric forcing wind temperature radiation precipitation humidity and atmospheric pressure data was measured at nearby japan meteorological agency meteorological met stations shirakawa and fukushima both within 50 km of the site and are used as forcing during this time period of the simulation before the aforementioned 48 hour simulations can be performed an initial condition of the three dimensional pressure head field or so called spin up of the watershed condition needs to be established in this study a completely saturated model is allowed to drain while an average precipitation minus actual evapotranspiration p et forcing typical of the local climate is applied at the land surface once the distribution of water is nearly static and realistic i e in accordance with observations the final pressure field from this preliminary simulation is used as the initial condition for any subsequent simulations in the fukushima watershed spin up simulation inflow approximately equals outflow within a margin of less than 1 error to ensure a dynamic equilibrium was reached although very few data of simulated stream flow values within different tributaries of the watershed are available a comparison of post spin up simulated stream flow and observed stream flow is made to ensure reasonably good agreement and realistic hydrologic conditions within the watershed 3 2 baseline simulations in order to establish the hydrologic response before any modifications are made to land cover the present day characterization of land use type fig 1 is simulated using the 48 hour high intensity rainfall forcing these simulations are hereafter referred to as the base case changes in groundwater and surface water gw and sw respectively storage are calculated as a function of time 1 s t o r a g e g w i 1 i n x n y n z s a t i ψ i s s i d x d y d z 2 s t o r a g e s w i 1 i n x n y n z ψ i d x d y where i is the cell number within the entire domain in eq 1 and is the cell number within the surface layer of the domain in eq 2 ψ is pressure head m sat is the saturation ss is the specific storage nx ny nz are the number of cells in the x y and z dimensions respectively and dx dy dz are the cell dimensions in the x y and z dimensions respectively sw runoff is calculated via 3 r u n o f f s w a v where a m2 is the discharge area of the cell and v m h is the discharge velocity solved using manning equation 4 v ψ 2 3 s n where s is the slope defined utilizing a digital elevation map dem of the region and n is the manning coefficient m1 3 s cumulative areas of the land surface exhibiting non negligible of defined here as pressure head greater than 1 mm are tracked as a function of time where regions of new of are distinguished from those that already exhibited surface water flow prior to the onset of the 48 hour rainfall forcing the extent and magnitudes of new of areas are especially important metrics as they can be used as an indicator of where spatially and at what intensity erosion may occur other factors contributing to the development of erosive rills or gullies e g soil cohesion rainfall intensity etc are beyond this scope of this work new of cumulative area and the associated relative percentages of lulc type are also calculated as a function of time finally differing magnitudes of evapotranspiration et are also compared to determine the contribution of this component of the water energy budget 3 3 risk management simulations in order to assess the impact of forest thinning on overland flow three cases of deforestation varying in magnitude are simulated forest cover is reduced by factors of 25 50 and 75 by randomly replacing land cover areas characterized by either evergreen or deciduous forest with bare soil these numerical experiments are meant to mimic the felling of individual tress exhibiting high radioactivity and the subsequent alteration of the land fig 2 b d shows the resulting land cover distribution for the three risk management scenarios including color coded pie diagrams showing the breakdown of lulc type for each scenario similar to the base case simulation outlined in section 3 2 water budget and of metrics are calculated as a function of time during the 48 hour storm event for the three forest thinning scenarios forest thinning ft results are discussed relative to the base case bc simulation as a percent difference pd via 5 p d x f t x b c x b c 100 where x is the output metric of interest while the methodology presented here is general and may be applicable to any lulc change we focus specifically on the effects of forest thinning that is randomly distributed through the watershed other approaches such as targeted logging the recruitment of other vegetation types in place of removed trees or the hypothetical relocation of urban and agricultural lands are reserved for the topic of future studies 4 results 4 1 baseline simulations after the spin up condition is reached simulated stream flow values within different tributaries within the watershed were compared with observational data and show reasonably good agreement although observational data is sparse simulated stream flow at the spin up condition is within approximately 15 of observed stream flow a lack of observational groundwater elevation data inhibits direct comparisons with simulated results however many studies have shown that the water table in natural environments follows the topographic relief where historically groundwater tables are conceptualized as subdued replicas of topography king 1899 hubbert 1940 toth 1963 beven and kirby 1979 as shown in fig 3 the distribution of water after the spin up condition has been reached shows such realistic patterns these realistic patterns are one of the advantages of the integrated hydrologic modeling approach and the risk management simulations performed with this model given that the relative depth of the groundwater table to the land surface will likely play an important role on the generation of of fig 4 shows the evolution of groundwater and surface water storage storagegw and storagesw respectively and surface water runoff runoffsw during the 48 hour simulation dashed lines are color coded to indicate the initial condition of each metric at the beginning of the 48 hour simulation i e at the end of the spin up simulation the magnitude of the precipitation forcing signal is shown at the top of fig 4 for reference also note that the sw storage and runoff metrics are plotted in log space varying over several orders of magnitude during the 48 hour simulation whereas gw storage is plotted linearly exemplifying less sensitivity to the rainfall event while all three metrics generally increase as the precipitation continues over time storagesw and runoffsw fluctuate with changes in the precipitation signal sometimes decreasing with time whereas the storagegw metric stays nearly flat during these decreases the sw metrics peak at hour 43 rapidly decreasing toward pre simulation conditions as the precipitation signal trends towards zero in contrast peak storagegw is slightly delayed and decreases more gradually towards pre simulation conditions the sensitivity of sw metrics suggests flow at the land surface in the fukushima watershed is very dynamic and validates intuitive differences in the movement of water at the land surface versus in porous media the general rise in trend of the storagegw metric also highlights the inter connected nature of the system s groundwater and surface water components this rise in the storagegw metric could be indicative of water rising to the land surface and contributing to of generation and important consideration in this context fig 5 a shows a time series of the cumulative area of new of as defined in section 3 2 for each lulc type recall that the new of metric is of specific importance as it acts as an indicator of areas that are susceptible to erosion and or contaminant transport during the storm event as a result of their sheer quantity deciduous and evergreen forest covers are the land types that exhibit the highest area of new of given that base case simulations utilize the present day land use conditions composed of 96 forest cover land type this is not an unexpected result however when the areas characterized by new of are normalized by the relative abundance of each lulc type in the model domain the susceptibility of each lulc type is more apparent fig 5b shows this relative susceptibility by representing the percentage opposed to magnitude of each lulc area characterized by new of as a function of time the simulation results indicate that during the entire 48 hour storm signal the lulc type characterized by the most new of and therefore the most susceptible to renewed contaminant transport due to the rainfall event of the seven lulc types are rice paddies other crops also demonstrate high sensitivity to the increase in precipitation especially during light to moderate precipitation see 48 hour precipitation signal on top of fig 4 for reference then as precipitation moves towards its peak the amount of new of in urban lands increases to a percentage similar to that of paddy lands also note in fig 5b that non anthopogenically altered land types deciduous evergreen and grass are generally the least susceptible to new of during the rainfall event and that the bare soil land type that in general tends to show less susceptibility also demonstrates high fluctuations in percentages as the precipitation signal changes as discussed in further detail below these results are indicative of the complex dynamics between processes at the land surface that mitigate the movement of water between surface water groundwater and the atmosphere even though the percentage of lulc with new of increases towards 70 at the peak precipitation intensity a portion of the most susceptible land cover types remain free of of throughout the storm to determine where the 30 of the most susceptible lulc types paddy and crop are in relation to other spatial factors within the watershed e g topography and location to river the locations are plotted in fig 6 paddy and crop lulc are shown as blue and orange colors respectively and are projected onto the watershed elevation map shown in gray scale fig 6a shows the of pressure head at the beginning of the simulation t 0 h and fig 6b shows the of pressure head at the peak of the precipitation signal t 43 h both shown in blue scale a second color scale of of pressure head is used in fig 6b to highlight paddy and crop regions where new of is generated at the peak of the rainfall event shown in green scale in fig 6b paddy and crop regions not colored in green reflect the location of these land types least susceptible to of generation i e those not affected by new of generation close inspection of fig 6b shows these areas correspond primarily to paddy and crop land in higher elevations hill crests or in some cases hillsides adjacent to stream generating valleys overall it is difficult to decipher a strong correlation between a single parameter and regions least susceptible to new of illustrating the need for high resolution mechanistic models to determine the highest risk locations within a watershed this difficulty is further demonstrated in fig 7 at the peak of the storm t 43 h here the correlation of pressure head slope and elevation of regions characterized by new of gray points and those regions least susceptible to new of as orange or blue points are shown in fig 7a and 7b for crop and paddy respectively again although trends are visible no single parameter can be linked with the greatest risk to of generation susceptibility less susceptible lands can be thought of as being optimal for agriculture development where re contamination of cesium via overland flow is less likely however as shown in fig 6a the majority of present day paddy and croplands correspond to locations along or near the major streams where water is easily accessible and additionally where valley slopes are less steep and most amenable to agricultural activities thus a tradeoff must ultimately be made in terms of the negative impacts resulting from higher susceptibility of of generation and the topographic advantages for agricultural activities while the spatial locations of new of generation are important the magnitude of pressure head increase is also an essential metric given that it acts as an indicator of potential adverse processes that can occur within the watershed such as erosion and contaminant transport fig 8 a shows a time series of the domain averaged pressure head of new of cells differentiated by lulc type fig 8a shows that the pressure head of new of cells is similar for all lulc with the exception of the rice paddies which has nearly double the pressure head of new of cells of the other six lulc types this stark difference is important given that the higher the depth of ponded water at the land surface the more potential for erosion patterns such as sheet flow to evolve and rills to form as described with the use of fig 6 rice paddies may be most susceptible to higher surface water flow during the storm event due to the proximity to rivers within valleys and at lower elevations which may also be attributed to the higher pressure head in these areas of course location may not be the only contributing factor when considering that each lulc type is characterized by varying land cover properties such as albedo for vegetative lulc the ability to store and transmit water is also distinct for each lulc type to assess the impact of the lulc properties on the water energy balance fig 8b shows the domain averaged et of new of cells specific examination of new of cells is purposeful to understand how changes in this component of the water energy budget affected those areas posing the greatest risk here et is defined as the total amount of water leaving the land surface in the gas phase including 1 ground evaporation 2 canopy evaporation and 3 plant transpiration for all vegetative lulc types all types excluding urban and bare soil et is composed almost entirely of canopy evaporation during the 48 hour storm plant transpiration only occurs during two short mid day windows in the simulation results not shown and contributes an order of a magnitude less than canopy evaporation to overall et similarly ground evaporation for the vegetative lulc is nearly zero except towards the end of the simulation once precipitation ends contributing very little to the overall value of et as shown in fig 8b the vegetative lulc types which exhibit the highest average et of new of cells evergreen deciduous and rice paddy are those that correspond to high leaf and stem area index and low leaf reflectance these conditions correspond to those that allow for the most absorption of solar energy and et the urban lulc et is also generally high corresponding to low albedo recall that the parameterization of the paddy lulc type is based on the generic crop land type with the exception of a higher stem area index and crop displacement height following literature values see section 3 1 therefore the fact that the crop and paddy lulc types exhibit such different et values possibly demonstrates the sensitivity of these parameters in the land surface model however as already shown in fig 8a rice paddies are associated with the wettest conditions and are not moisture limited thus providing the greatest availability of water for et to occur the fact that rice paddies demonstrate high et and are therefore losing more water via this pathway may be somewhat counter intuitive when one considers that more ponded water is predicted to occur at these cells this result illustrates the true erosive potential in the rice paddy lulc types given that new of pressure head is shown to be high despite more predicted et to occur in these areas 4 2 risk management simulations fig 9 shows the changes in water balance for the risk management forest thinning scenarios relative to the base case simulation results shown in fig 4 percent differences pd are compared for the three forest thinning scenarios 25 50 75 see key the pd metric quantifies the percent change from the base case for example a 10 pd for storage means that the forest thinning management scenario results in a 10 increase in storage when compared to the base case these results illustrate how lulc changes affect both the groundwater and surface water hydrologic budgets but at some points in time the effect of lulc change occurs nonlinearly in other words the 75 reduction in forestland cover does not always result in three times the impact as the 25 forest reduction scenario specifically this nonlinearity is observed most notably for the surface water runoff metric runoffsw as the storm intensifies to aid the reader in identifying this non linearity fig 10 shows ratios of the pd shown in fig 9a for runoffsw if the system behaved in a perfectly linear fashion the ratio of pd 50 to pd 25 would be a constant value of 2 0 similarly the ratio of pd 75 to pd 25 would be a constant value of 3 0 the results also illustrate how substantial impacts on sw flow via both quantities of runoff and storage are impacted when deforestation lulc changes are implemented the pd for surface water runoff runoffsw and storage storagesw are as high as 18 for forests with a high amount of forest thinning fig 9a and b brown lines potentially allowing for more erosion and contaminant transport to occur recall however that the managed forest thinning not only results in an increase in more potential contamination but also a smaller source of radionuclides in the system to be transported for most of the storm event the pd of the sw budgets remain under 5 for the lower forest thinning scenarios 50 and 25 finally while the pd between the forest thinning scenarios and the base case are very low for storagegw 0 3 fig 9c relative to the large volume of water present in the groundwater system in the base case scenario see fig 4 a distinct increase during the storm event is noted particularly when forest thinning is highest to quantify exactly how much more new of is generated because forestland in the watershed was decreased the pd of the forest thinning scenarios and the base case is calculated for new of areas the same trends discussed in section 4 1 with regards to the different lulc types were observed in the risk management simulations and are not shown here unlike the previous base case metric for new of area which differentiated lulc type fig 5 results are shown in fig 11 for total new of area inclusive of all lulc types the evolution of the total new of area pd is shown in fig 11 for the three different reductions in forestland 25 50 75 see key again nonlinear behavior is noteworthy as discussed in the water budget analysis fig 9 a substantial increase in new of area is observed to be as high as 30 greater than the base case scenario occurring in the time leading up to the peak storm intensity smaller pd peaks occur when the precipitation signal top panel of fig 4 trends towards zero during these points in time in the base case simulation the amount of new of decreases in contrast at these points of time in the forest thinning scenarios the amount of new of remains constant these relative differences a decrease in new of in the base case simulation and constant new of in the forest thinning scenarios result in different contrasting behavior that is most apparent when the storm lessens in intensity at this time the system begins to rebound resulting in these peaks in fig 11 again note that the only differences between the base case simulation and the forest thinning simulations is a higher percentage of bare soil in the watershed and less forestlands a plausible explanation to explain why the base case and forest thinning simulations differ so dramatically during these rebound times is that the forests possess the ability to capture and or remove water that would otherwise result in surface water via processes such as canopy interception and evapotranspiration thus more bare soil represents a loss of these pathways that would allow surface water to be diverted from the land surface although fig 11 shows the pd results for total new of areas the statistics for total new of pressure heads and the associated volume of new of were calculated and demonstrate very similar behavior to the results shown in fig 11 5 discussion our simulations results show that certain lulc types are most susceptible to new of generation during high intensity storm events which is in agreement with previous studies that show that the degree to which land use influences stormwater is greatest when precipitation volumes are high e g niehoff et al 2002 in the example simulated watershed in the fukushima prefecture results showed that the paddy and crop lulc types are the most susceptible to new of generation and thus erosion this is consistent with results from experimental land use plots in the region that show farmlands to yield the highest amount of erosion during storm events yoshimura et al 2015 experimental results by yoshimura and co authors also show that soil erosion increases exponentially with decreases in vegetation cover indicating that vegetation cover is a crucial factor in the mitigation of cesium transport the prediction of cesium removal with the use of the model presented here could be improved with the integration of concentration discharge relationships as more of this type of data becomes available as demonstrated in section 4 1 the non anthropogenically altered land types that also exhibit high vegetation cover in comparison to the other land use types i e deciduous evergreen and grass land use types are the least susceptible to of generation and also exhibit high values of et recall that while high et is one component of a region s susceptibility to of generation this mechanism alone does not indicate how susceptible a region is to of during a storm event if it were rice paddies would be less susceptible to of generation than our simulation results suggest as shown with the use of our three dimensional watershed simulations of generation is a complex phenomenon which is dependent on the spatially intricate flow patterns within a network of coupled hill slopes and valleys furthermore in field campaigns the extent of upslope overland flow networks has been shown to increase in size with precipitation intensity gomi et al 2008 gomi et al also showed that complex terrain in three dimensions such as small scale surface depressions also contribute to spatial variability of surface water ponding thus the susceptibility of a parcel of land to of generation must be determined with joint consideration of location and land cover properties while the risk management forest thinning simulations reveal somewhat intuitive changes in the water budget metrics quantified see fig 9 the dynamics and non linearity of the system are important to consider in a larger context for example increases in storagegw are important in erosion and contaminant transport assessment given that dunne flow or saturation excess flow from groundwater systems may play an important role in determining of generation at the watershed scale e g bayabil et al 2010 in cases where storagegw increase a soil column may saturate if the precipitation rate is less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity once the soil column becomes completely saturated water leaves to the subsurface and becomes overland flow thus understanding the complex three dimensional subsurface flow pathways in conjunction with transport times to downhill regions of saturated groundwater are important if prediction of regions of dunne of generation is desired the complex three dimensional dynamics of the watershed including the contribution of groundwater to surface water and vice versa may be indicative of the non linear dynamics observed in fig 10 when lulc changes are implemented in the simulation experiments in terms of the effects of lulc changes as a risk mitigation strategy careful consideration is needed to determine the tradeoffs between the increased potential for erosion via of flow generation and the benefit of altering the land cover in the example demonstration of the fukushima forest results illustrate how deforestation to reduce the amount of 137cs within the region an important metric for stake holders and decision makers may lead to the potential for increases in erosion and contaminant transport relative to present day conditions although the removal of contaminated forest via forest thinning would substantially reduce the amount of 137cs present within the watershed miyahara et al 2015 our results show that there needs to be joint consideration that forest thinning would also substantially increase the potential mobility of sediments via an increase in of generated in this sense forest thinning may actually be counter productive in terms of remediation and may cause an increase in secondary contamination in order to quantitatively assess this tradeoff more data regarding the amount of 137cs that could be potentially removed with each felled tree is needed for example little data exists on the amount of 137cs stored in evergreen versus deciduous trees and how the removal of one tree type versus the other affects 137cs budgets this may also be important for other types of lulc change such as logging and natural tree mortality the latter has historically resulted in millions of cubic meters of pine tree loss in the last century mamiya 1988 and may be an important mode of lulc change in this region in the future finally because these results reveal the temporal evolution of the implications of risk management decisions comparisons could also be made to other time dependent risk analyses where varying exposure durations or other time sensitive intervals are important in the decision framework e g siirila and maxwell 2012 future work with integrated hydrologic models in three dimensions to determine the effect of lulc changes in the presence of multiple storm events i e where the system retains potentially higher saturation and groundwater levels are also needed given that antecedent moisture conditions on runoff have been linked to higher observed stream flows e g penna et al 2011 6 conclusions land management decisions require interdisciplinary and holistic approaches for prediction considering the unknown effects which lulc changes have on environmental systems across the critical zone the region at the land surface ranging from deep groundwater systems to the top of the vegetation canopy the focus of this work was overland flow generation given that 1 it is considered an important proxy for sediment and contaminant transport and 2 little is known about the relationship between the water energy budget and overland flow generation both the spatial distribution and corresponding magnitudes in the face of lulc changes with the use of parallel high performance computing high resolution integrated hydrologic numerical simulations were used to quantitatively determine how lulc changes affect the spatially distributed water energy budget in coupled systems including the interfaces between surface and groundwater the land surface and the atmosphere a typhoon storm event in a watershed near the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant was used as an example application in which the interplay between lulc change and of generation is important comparisons between present day and three hypothetical forest thinning scenarios reveal the complex interaction between different environmental compartments in the system and how the water energy budget may respond to given decontamination efforts key results include 1 in the base case present day scenario greater sensitivity to surface water metrics in comparison to groundwater metrics during the storm event is observed forest thinning simulations reveal similar results and show as high as an 18 increase in surface water runoff and storage for the cases considered the percentage of forest thinned in the watershed did not scale linearly with the amount of increase in water budget metrics exemplifying the complexity of these multi scale systems 2 regions where overland flow is generated denoted here as new overland flow were quantified for both the base case and forest thinning scenarios given that it can be used as a proxy of where erosion and or contaminant transport may occur while rice paddy and other crops comprise a small percentage of the present day watershed in comparison to forestlands relatively high percentages of these lulc types especially rice paddies are characterized by new of during the storm event the pressure head of newly generated overland flow for rice paddies is nearly double than that of other lulc types parcels of rice paddy and other crops that don t generate new overland flow during the storm event are those that are located in higher elevations hill crests or in some cases hillsides adjacent to stream generating valleys but a single parameter wasn t found to be solely linked to susceptibility this result highlights the need for high resolution integrated models to identify specific high risk locations within a given watershed 3 connections between the land surface and the atmosphere were quantified by comparing the temporal evolution of evapotranspiration for new overland flow areas vegetative lulc exhibit the highest evapotranspiration value corresponding to high leaf and stem area index and low leaf reflectance interestingly the paddy lulc type was characterized by high evapotranspiration despite many parametric similarities to the crop lulc type suggesting that the high availability of water may drive evapotranspiration higher in these regions trends were consistent for the base case and forest thinning scenarios in this regard 4 up to a 30 increase in new of area and volume is observed in the forest thinning risk management scenarios percent differences from the base case are most sensitive when the precipitation signal trends towards zero this is because at this time in the base case the higher percentage of forestland present results in the amount of new overland flow to be relatively small compared to the risk management scenarios amount of new overland flow primarily due to an increased presence of evapotranspiration and canopy interception although the removal of contaminated forest via forest thinning would substantially reduce the amount of 137cs present within the watershed this increase for the potential of erosion may actually be counter productive in terms of remediation causing an increased risk in secondary contamination

855,the effects of land use and land cover lulc change on environmental systems across the land surface s critical zone are highly uncertain often making prediction and risk management decision difficult in a series of numerical experiments with an integrated hydrologic model overland flow generation is quantified for both present day and forest thinning scenarios a typhoon storm event in a watershed near the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant is used as an example application in which the interplay between lulc change and overland flow generation is important given that sediment bound radionuclides may cause secondary contamination via surface water transport results illustrate the nonlinearity of the integrated system spanning from the deep groundwater to the atmosphere and provide quantitative tools when determining the tradeoffs of different risk mitigation strategies keywords land use land cover change risk management watershed hydrology critical zone erosion fukushima dai ichi 1 introduction human impacts on the terrestrial land surface are difficult to quantify but estimates of lands transformed by anthropogenic activities range between one third and one half of earth s surface vitousek et al 1997 land use and land cover lulc changes evolve over time in response to socio economic conditions and demand with the most common transformations resulting from agricultural activities urbanization and deforestation because changes in land cover inherently affect the physical biological and geochemical properties of an area often other environmental systems such as water balance are affected e g schiling et al 2008 in order to accurately determine the effect of lulc changes on a given system interdisciplinary and holistic approaches must be taken because of the tight coupling between system components in hydrologic assessments recent work shows the connection across the critical zone of the earth s surface ranging from deep groundwater systems to the top of the vegetation canopy brooks et al 2015 while a number of studies have been conducted to illustrate how lulc change impact hydrologic responses carlson and arthur 2000 lahmer et al 2001 scanlon et al 2005 wang et al 2013 quantitatively determining how lulc changes affect the spatially distributed water energy budget across the critical zone in coupled systems is difficult this difficulty is especially enhanced in systems where competing processes are often characterized by different physics e g defries and eshleman 2004 predicting the effects of lulc changes across all components of the water energy balance is important for planning and management purposes particularly when making land use and water resource decisions in the last decade the use of process based integrated hydrologic numerical models for prediction purposes has become increasingly advanced e g see paniconi and putti 2015 and references therein table 1 summarizes an example subset of integrated hydrologic studies and the progression of the simulator s capabilities to include more water energy budget components it should be noted that although an increasing number of models are capable of simulating processes spanning across the entire critical zone the level of complexity of each model vary dramatically this is especially true for some of the land based processes varying from analytical and lumped parameter approaches to complex physically based numerical schemes also note that the scale and resolution of integrated watershed simulations substantially varies depending on the capability of the model in this study coupled surface and groundwater land surface and atmospheric processes are jointly considered by using an integrated hydrologic model explicitly coupled to a land surface model in order to predict how lulc changes affect hydrologic budgets and flows emphasis in this study is placed on the quantification and spatial distribution of overland flow of generation as it plays an important role in sediment and contaminant transport e g julien and simmons 1985 prosser and rustomji 2000 as described in section 3 of generation is simulated in an example watershed with the objective to i determine the temporal dynamics of of generation and the lulc types most susceptible to of generation and thus erosion and sediment contamination due to storm events ii quantify the impact of lulc management decisions on i including the impact on the water energy budget and iii demonstrate a methodology to provide decision makers with quantitative predictive metrics regarding the impact of future storm events on of dynamics and the associated risks 2 study site in this work we utilize the example of sediment bound radionuclide transport resulting from the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident as an example of the potential interplay between lulc change hydrologic changes in the critical zone and of generation this problem requires the use of an integrated hydrologic model to explore whole system changes including the critical zone due to proposed lulc changes near fdnpp to mitigate risks following the accident a representative watershed in the fukushima prefecture is used to model the impact of these potential changes across the critical zone which may be important given connections between groundwater to surface water during storm events and the presence of dense vegetation that may play an important role in the hydrologic budget of the system simulation of this watershed is not intended to model exact hydrologic conditions which would require further site specific data integration but rather is meant to explore the processes and dynamics that could be important in decision making in 2011 a magnitude 9 1 earthquake off the eastern coast of japan triggered a tsunami which eventually resulted in the explosion of multiple reactors at the fdnpp and the subsequent atmospheric deposition of radionuclides mostly concentrated over a large area greater than 30 km radially north to northwest of the plant widespread radionuclide contamination of cesium 137 137cs a by product of the nuclear fission reaction covered a large area within a 30 km radius of the plant making decontamination efforts difficult since the accident decontamination efforts have been focused on areas where human exposure is highest including villages and roadsides here high pressure washing of non porous surfaces and the excavation of topsoil are the most common approaches to decontamination miyahara et al 2015 however these decontaminated regions only account for a small fraction of the area contaminated by the accident due to the fdnpp s proximity to forested areas and the abundance of forestland within the fukushima prefecture today approximately 95 of the on land fallout now resides within the upper 5 cm of forest soils where 137cs is strongly sorbed to the porous media hashimoto et al 2012 matsunaga et al 2013 nakanishi et al 2014 it s important to note that given the majority of the contamination exists in near surface soils the transport of 137cs is mostly a physical erosion problem where the location of of generation is an important indicator of where 137cs may begin to migrate because contamination is so widespread several decontamination strategies have been proposed as an alternative to a complete restriction of the contaminated forests which would have serious implications for the local forestry industry tourism and local communities and are currently being tested for effectiveness approaches such as trunk washing branch trimming felling and the removal of litter and humus layers vary dramatically in terms of their ability to reduce the dose rate studies conducted by the japan atomic energy agency show that individual tree removal was found to be the most effective in reducing 100 of cesium exposure miyahara et al 2015 although more observational data is needed forest thinning may be an attractive option to reduce the exposure of 137cs in fukushima watersheds to date few decontamination efforts of the forests have been put into place due to the expansive areas high waste volumes and high associated costs of decontamination thus tradeoffs between tree removal and the potential for 137cs mobilization by surface water or groundwater transport when forest thinning is implemented remains highly uncertain baseline predictive studies are necessary to determine how these contaminated forests will respond hydrologically over time particularly in the presence of generally high precipitation seasons in japan the tsuyu including high intensity typhoon events known to occur on an annual basis in this region nagao et al 2013 average precipitation in this region exceeds 200 mm of precipitation per year with the wettest months being june through october if decontamination efforts are put into place a primary concern is secondary contamination which involves a decontaminated region becoming re contaminated as water and sediments move over time predictive studies will be useful to assess the likelihood of secondary contamination particularly by factoring in the effects of parameters such as lulc type and topography in the fukushima prefecture these types of studies may aid farmers and other residents in determining optimal relocation areas in the watershed that are least susceptible to secondary contamination in this work we assess both baseline conditions and decontamination i e risk management scenarios in a representative watershed southwest of the fdnpp see fig 1 following the accident this region was in the exclusion area deemed unsafe for residential and agricultural use although the area is characterized by 96 deciduous and evergreen forestland small plots of residential land rice paddy and other crops are interspersed within the dense forests based on the mandatory evacuation following the accident the small communities of farmers and forest loggers were forced to abandon their lands predictive studies such as those described in sections 3 2 and 3 3 will be useful in determining the risks associated with both no mitigation and decontamination efforts given that there are tradeoffs between 1 removing contaminated trees as a source of 137cs and 2 the potential for more erosion and thus transport of 137cs 3 methodology 3 1 parameterization of the numerical model the integrated hydrologic model parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 maxwell 2013 is used to solve the coupled flow of saturated and variably saturated groundwater and overland surface water in the fukushima watershed the three dimensional richards equation is solved in the subsurface allowing for both the vertical and lateral flow of groundwater in both saturated and variably saturated environments and the two dimensional kinematic wave approximation is used to solve surface water flow kollet and maxwell 2006 a full description of the model physics can be found in the aforementioned references parflow was designed for massively parallel computer environments kollet et al 2010 and for highly resolved numerical simulations e g siirila woodburn and maxwell 2015 siirila woodburn et al 2015 thus parflow is an excellent candidate where high spatial resolution and temporal data are available meteorological forcing is incorporated in the numerical model via integration with the land model common land model clm clm calculates a coupled water energy balance at every surface cell of the domain dai et al 2003 and incorporates spatially distributed vegetative processes by including specified land use types land cover is differentiated into seven types from remote sensing data acquired by the advanced visible and near infrared radiometer avnir 2 onboard the advanced land observation satellite takahaski et al 2013 parameters such as leaf dimensions rooting distribution leaf and stem area index reflectance and transmittance are incorporated into the simulations via the international geosphere biosphere program igbp database of standard land use types further details can be found in oleson et al 2010 and references therein parameterization for the rice paddy land classification is based on the crop igbp classification type but was modified for stem area index and displacement height based on observational data hussain et al 2014 as described in table 2 it is assumed that the initial condition of the rice paddy fields are not under flooded i e growing conditions through this integrated setup parflow is used to simulate the entire critical zone of the watershed from the top of the forest canopy and surrounding atmosphere to regions of deep saturated groundwater the spatial extent of the modeled watershed is shown in fig 1 approximately 8 2 km by 6 8 km by 21 m in the x y and z directions respectively high resolution numerical discretization is used to characterize the complex topography of this steep grade predominantly forested region horizontal cell resolution is the same in the x and y directions equivalent to 12 4 m vertical cell resolution increases with depth ranging from 0 3 m at the land surface to 10 m at the deepest portion of the model see table 2 the model domain is comprised of five layers which constitute two subsurface stratified units see table 2 subsurface parameterization is based on field campaigns conducted by the japan atomic energy agency in this watershed given that laterally heterogeneous subsurface porous media would complicate the evaluation of how spatially distributed lulc changes at the surface impact the water energy budget and generation of of only vertical heterogeneity of subsurface media is considered the only subsurface properties varied by lulc types were those related to rooting parameters results may or may not be sensitive to other subsurface properties such as permeability which may be correlated to lulc type the impact of subsurface parameters correlated with lulc is reserved for future work the spatial resolution of the watershed model is highly resolved 1 8 million cells simulations were performed on a national energy research scientific computing center nersc supercomputer edison a digital elevation model dem of the watershed in conjunction with the r watershed tool in the gis platform grass was used to process the terrain shown in fig 1 following maxwell 2013 a terrain following grid was used to generate the model domain mesh including the slope of each cell rivers are not enforced in the model rather they develop naturally during the initial simulations given the topography of the region a number of tests were conducted to ensure water routes at the land surface in a realistic fashion confirming the accuracy of the kinematic wave approximation for all faces of the watershed boundary except at the land surface no flow boundaries are placed sufficiently far from the watershed border such that they do not significantly impact the results at the land surface clm is driven by an hourly time series of atmospheric observational data a 48 hour high intensity rainfall event occurring during typhoon roke september 20 21 2011 is used as a representative storm event where of would likely generate in areas usually only characterized by groundwater flow hourly atmospheric forcing wind temperature radiation precipitation humidity and atmospheric pressure data was measured at nearby japan meteorological agency meteorological met stations shirakawa and fukushima both within 50 km of the site and are used as forcing during this time period of the simulation before the aforementioned 48 hour simulations can be performed an initial condition of the three dimensional pressure head field or so called spin up of the watershed condition needs to be established in this study a completely saturated model is allowed to drain while an average precipitation minus actual evapotranspiration p et forcing typical of the local climate is applied at the land surface once the distribution of water is nearly static and realistic i e in accordance with observations the final pressure field from this preliminary simulation is used as the initial condition for any subsequent simulations in the fukushima watershed spin up simulation inflow approximately equals outflow within a margin of less than 1 error to ensure a dynamic equilibrium was reached although very few data of simulated stream flow values within different tributaries of the watershed are available a comparison of post spin up simulated stream flow and observed stream flow is made to ensure reasonably good agreement and realistic hydrologic conditions within the watershed 3 2 baseline simulations in order to establish the hydrologic response before any modifications are made to land cover the present day characterization of land use type fig 1 is simulated using the 48

respectively and dx dy dz are the cell dimensions in the x y and z dimensions respectively sw runoff is calculated via 3 r u n o f f s w a v where a m2 is the discharge area of the cell and v m h is the discharge velocity solved using manning equation 4 v ψ 2 3 s n where s is the slope defined utilizing a digital elevation map dem of the region and n is the manning coefficient m1 3 s cumulative areas of the land surface exhibiting non negligible of defined here as pressure head greater than 1 mm are tracked as a function of time where regions of new of are distinguished from those that already exhibited surface water flow prior to the onset of the 48 hour rainfall forcing the extent and magnitudes of new of areas are especially important metrics as they can be used as an indicator of where spatially and at what intensity erosion may occur other factors contributing to the development of erosive rills or gullies e g soil cohesion rainfall intensity etc are beyond this scope of this work new of cumulative area and the associated relative percentages of lulc type are also calculated as a function of time finally differing magnitudes of evapotranspiration et are also compared to determine the contribution of this component of the water energy budget 3 3 risk management simulations in order to assess the impact of forest thinning on overland flow three cases of deforestation varying in magnitude are simulated forest cover is reduced by factors of 25 50 and 75 by randomly replacing land cover areas characterized by either evergreen or deciduous forest with bare soil these numerical experiments are meant to mimic the felling of individual tress exhibiting high radioactivity and the subsequent alteration of the land fig 2 b d shows the resulting land cover distribution for the three risk management scenarios including color coded pie diagrams showing the breakdown of lulc type for each scenario similar to the base case simulation outlined in section 3 2 water budget and of metrics are calculated as a function of time during the 48 hour storm event for the three forest thinning scenarios forest thinning ft results are discussed relative to the base case bc simulation as a percent difference pd via 5 p d x f t x b c x b c 100 where x is the output metric of interest while the methodology presented here is general and may be applicable to any lulc change we focus specifically on the effects of forest thinning that is randomly distributed through the watershed other approaches such as targeted logging the recruitment of other vegetation types in place of removed trees or the hypothetical relocation of urban and agricultural lands are reserved for the topic of future studies 4 results 4 1 baseline simulations after the spin up condition is reached simulated stream flow values within different tributaries within the watershed were compared with observational data and show reasonably good agreement although observational data is sparse simulated stream flow at the spin up condition is within approximately 15 of observed stream flow a lack of observational groundwater elevation data inhibits direct comparisons with simulated results however many studies have shown that the water table in natural environments follows the topographic relief where historically groundwater tables are conceptualized as subdued replicas of topography king 1899 hubbert 1940 toth 1963 beven and kirby 1979 as shown in fig 3 the distribution of water after the spin up condition has been reached shows such realistic patterns these realistic patterns are one of the advantages of the integrated hydrologic modeling approach and the risk management simulations performed with this model given that the relative depth of the groundwater table to the land surface will likely play an important role on the generation of of fig 4 shows the evolution of groundwater and surface water storage storagegw and storagesw respectively and surface water runoff runoffsw during the 48 hour simulation dashed lines are color coded to indicate the initial condition of each metric at the beginning of the 48 hour simulation i e at the end of the spin up simulation the magnitude of the precipitation forcing signal is shown at the top of fig 4 for reference also note that the sw storage and runoff metrics are plotted in log space varying over several orders of magnitude during the 48 hour simulation whereas gw storage is plotted linearly exemplifying less sensitivity to the rainfall event while all three metrics generally increase as the precipitation continues over time storagesw and runoffsw fluctuate with changes in the precipitation signal sometimes decreasing with time whereas the storagegw metric stays nearly flat during these decreases the sw metrics peak at hour 43 rapidly decreasing toward pre simulation conditions as the precipitation signal trends towards zero in contrast peak storagegw is slightly delayed and decreases more gradually towards pre simulation conditions the sensitivity of sw metrics suggests flow at the land surface in the fukushima watershed is very dynamic and validates intuitive differences in the movement of water at the land surface versus in porous media the general rise in trend of the storagegw metric also highlights the inter connected nature of the system s groundwater and surface water components this rise in the storagegw metric could be indicative of water rising to the land surface and contributing to of generation and important consideration in this context fig 5 a shows a time series of the cumulative area of new of as defined in section 3 2 for each lulc type recall that the new of metric is of specific importance as it acts as an indicator of areas that are susceptible to erosion and or contaminant transport during the storm event as a result of their sheer quantity deciduous and evergreen forest covers are the land types that exhibit the highest area of new of given that base case simulations utilize the present day land use conditions composed of 96 forest cover land type this is not an unexpected result however when the areas characterized by new of are normalized by the relative abundance of each lulc type in the model domain the susceptibility of each lulc type is more apparent fig 5b shows this relative susceptibility by representing the percentage opposed to magnitude of each lulc area characterized by new of as a function of time the simulation results indicate that during the entire 48 hour storm signal the lulc type characterized by the most new of and therefore the most susceptible to renewed contaminant transport due to the rainfall event of the seven lulc types are rice paddies other crops also demonstrate high sensitivity to the increase in precipitation especially during light to moderate precipitation see 48 hour precipitation signal on top of fig 4 for reference then as precipitation moves towards its peak the amount of new of in urban lands increases to a percentage similar to that of paddy lands also note in fig 5b that non anthopogenically altered land types deciduous evergreen and grass are generally the least susceptible to new of during the rainfall event and that the bare soil land type that in general tends to show less susceptibility also demonstrates high fluctuations in percentages as the precipitation signal changes as discussed in further detail below these results are indicative of the complex dynamics between processes at the land surface that mitigate the movement of water between surface water groundwater and the atmosphere even though the percentage of lulc with new of increases towards 70 at the peak precipitation intensity a portion of the most susceptible land cover types remain free of of throughout the storm to determine where the 30 of the most susceptible lulc types paddy and crop are in relation to other spatial factors within the watershed e g topography and location to river the locations are plotted in fig 6 paddy and crop lulc are shown as blue and orange colors respectively and are projected onto the watershed elevation map shown in gray scale fig 6a shows the of pressure head at the beginning of the simulation t 0 h and fig 6b shows the of pressure head at the peak of the precipitation signal t 43 h both shown in blue scale a second color scale of of pressure head is used in fig 6b to highlight paddy and crop regions where new of is generated at the peak of the rainfall event shown in green scale in fig 6b paddy and crop regions not colored in green reflect the location of these land types least susceptible to of generation i e those not affected by new of generation close inspection of fig 6b shows these areas correspond primarily to paddy and crop land in higher elevations hill crests or in some cases hillsides adjacent to stream generating valleys overall it is difficult to decipher a strong correlation between a single parameter and regions least susceptible to new of illustrating the need for high resolution mechanistic models to determine the highest risk locations within a watershed this difficulty is further demonstrated in fig 7 at the peak of the storm t 43 h here the correlation of pressure head slope and elevation of regions characterized by new of gray points and those regions least susceptible to new of as orange or blue points are shown in fig 7a and 7b for crop and paddy respectively again although trends are visible no single parameter can be linked with the greatest risk to of generation susceptibility less susceptible lands can be thought of as being optimal for agriculture development where re contamination of cesium via overland flow is less likely however as shown in fig 6a the majority of present day paddy and croplands correspond to locations along or near the major streams where water is easily accessible and additionally where valley slopes are less steep and most amenable to agricultural activities thus a tradeoff must ultimately be made in terms of the negative impacts resulting from higher susceptibility of of generation and the topographic advantages for agricultural activities while the spatial locations of new of generation are important the magnitude of pressure head increase is also an essential metric given that it acts as an indicator of potential adverse processes that can occur within the watershed such as erosion and contaminant transport fig 8 a shows a time series of the domain averaged pressure head of new of cells differentiated by lulc type fig 8a shows that the pressure head of new of cells is similar for all lulc with the exception of the rice paddies which has nearly double the pressure head of new of cells of the other six lulc types this stark difference is important given that the higher the depth of ponded water at the land surface the more potential for erosion patterns such as sheet flow to evolve and rills to form as described with the use of fig 6 rice paddies may be most susceptible to higher surface water flow during the storm event due to the proximity to rivers within valleys and at lower elevations which may also be attributed to the higher pressure head in these areas of course location may not be the only contributing factor when considering that each lulc type is characterized by varying land cover properties such as albedo for vegetative lulc the ability to store and transmit water is also distinct for each lulc type to assess the impact of the lulc properties on the water energy balance fig 8b shows the domain averaged et of new of cells specific examination of new of cells is purposeful to understand how changes in this component of the water energy budget affected those areas posing the greatest risk here et is defined as the total amount of water leaving the land surface in the gas phase including 1 ground evaporation 2 canopy evaporation and 3 plant transpiration for all vegetative lulc types all types excluding urban and bare soil et is composed almost entirely of canopy evaporation during the 48 hour storm plant transpiration only occurs during two short mid day windows in the simulation results not shown and contributes an order of a magnitude less than canopy evaporation to overall et similarly ground evaporation for the vegetative lulc is nearly zero except towards the end of the simulation once precipitation ends contributing very little to the overall value of et as shown in fig 8b the vegetative lulc types which exhibit the highest average et of new of cells evergreen deciduous and rice paddy are those that correspond to high leaf and stem area index and low leaf reflectance these conditions correspond to those that allow for the most absorption of solar energy and et the urban lulc et is also generally high corresponding to low albedo recall that the parameterization of the paddy lulc type is based on the generic crop land type with the exception of a higher stem area index and crop displacement height following literature values see section 3 1 therefore the fact that the crop and paddy lulc types exhibit such different et values possibly demonstrates the sensitivity of these parameters in the land surface model however as already shown in fig 8a rice paddies are associated with the wettest conditions and are not moisture limited thus providing the greatest availability of water for et to occur the fact that rice paddies demonstrate high et and are therefore losing more water via this pathway may be somewhat counter intuitive when one considers that more ponded water is predicted to occur at these cells this result illustrates the true erosive potential in the rice paddy lulc types given that new of pressure head is shown to be high despite more predicted et to occur in these areas 4 2 risk management simulations fig 9 shows the changes in water balance for the risk management forest thinning scenarios relative to the base case simulation results shown in fig 4 percent differences pd are compared for the three forest thinning scenarios 25 50 75 see key the pd metric quantifies the percent change from the base case for example a 10 pd for storage means that the forest thinning management scenario results in a 10 increase in storage when compared to the base case these results illustrate how lulc changes affect both the groundwater and surface water hydrologic budgets but at some points in time the effect of lulc change occurs nonlinearly in other words the 75 reduction in forestland cover does not always result in three times the impact as the 25 forest reduction scenario specifically this nonlinearity is observed most notably for the surface water runoff metric runoffsw as the storm intensifies to aid the reader in identifying this non linearity fig 10 shows ratios of the pd shown in fig 9a for runoffsw if the system behaved in a perfectly linear fashion the ratio of pd 50 to pd 25 would be a constant value of 2 0 similarly the ratio of pd 75 to pd 25 would be a constant value of 3 0 the results also illustrate how substantial impacts on sw flow via both quantities of runoff and storage are impacted when deforestation lulc changes are implemented the pd for surface water runoff runoffsw and storage storagesw are as high as 18 for forests with a high amount of forest thinning fig 9a and b brown lines potentially allowing for more erosion and contaminant transport to occur recall however that the managed forest thinning not only results in an increase in more potential contamination but also a smaller source of radionuclides in the system to be transported for most of the storm event the pd of the sw budgets remain under 5 for the lower forest thinning scenarios 50 and 25 finally while the pd between the forest thinning scenarios and the base case are very low for storagegw 0 3 fig 9c relative to the large volume of water present in the groundwater system in the base case scenario see fig 4 a distinct increase during the storm event is noted particularly when forest thinning is highest to quantify exactly how much more new of is generated because forestland in the watershed was decreased the pd of the forest thinning scenarios and the base case is calculated for new of areas the same trends discussed in section 4 1 with regards to the different lulc types were observed in the risk management simulations and are not shown here unlike the previous base case metric for new of area which differentiated lulc type fig 5 results are shown in fig 11 for total new of area inclusive of all lulc types the evolution of the total new of area pd is shown in fig 11 for the three different reductions in forestland 25 50 75 see key again nonlinear behavior is noteworthy as discussed in the water budget analysis fig 9 a substantial increase in new of area is observed to be as high as 30 greater than the base case scenario occurring in the time leading up to the peak storm intensity smaller pd peaks occur when the precipitation signal top panel of fig 4 trends towards zero during these points in time in the base case simulation the amount of new of decreases in contrast at these points of time in the forest thinning scenarios the amount of new of remains constant these relative differences a decrease in new of in the base case simulation and constant new of in the forest thinning scenarios result in different contrasting behavior that is most apparent when the storm lessens in intensity at this time the system begins to rebound resulting in these peaks in fig 11 again note that the only differences between the base case simulation and the forest thinning simulations is a higher percentage of bare soil in the watershed and less forestlands a plausible explanation to explain why the base case and forest thinning simulations differ so dramatically during these rebound times is that the forests possess the ability to capture and or remove water that would otherwise result in surface water via processes such as canopy interception and evapotranspiration thus more bare soil represents a loss of these pathways that would allow surface water to be diverted from the land surface although fig 11 shows the pd results for total new of areas the statistics for total new of pressure heads and the associated volume of new of were calculated and demonstrate very similar behavior to the results shown in fig 11 5 discussion our simulations results show that certain lulc types are most susceptible to new of generation during high intensity storm events which is in agreement with previous studies that show that the degree to which land use influences stormwater is greatest when precipitation volumes are high e g niehoff et al 2002 in the example simulated watershed in the fukushima prefecture results showed that the paddy and crop lulc types are the most susceptible to new of generation and thus erosion this is consistent with results from experimental land use plots in the region that show farmlands to yield the highest amount of erosion during storm events yoshimura et al 2015 experimental results by yoshimura and co authors also show that soil erosion increases exponentially with decreases in vegetation cover indicating that vegetation cover is a crucial factor in the mitigation of cesium transport the prediction of cesium removal with the use of the model presented here could be improved with the integration of concentration discharge relationships as more of this type of data becomes available as demonstrated in section 4 1 the non anthropogenically altered land types that also exhibit high vegetation cover in comparison to the other land use types i e deciduous evergreen and grass land use types are the least susceptible to of generation and also exhibit high values of et recall that while high et is one component of a region s susceptibility to of generation this mechanism alone does not indicate how susceptible a region is to of during a storm event if it were rice paddies would be less susceptible to of generation than our simulation results suggest as shown with the use of our three dimensional watershed simulations of generation is a complex phenomenon which is dependent on the spatially intricate flow patterns within a network of coupled hill slopes and valleys furthermore in field campaigns the extent of upslope overland flow networks has been shown to increase in size with precipitation intensity gomi et al 2008 gomi et al also showed that complex terrain in three dimensions such as small scale surface depressions also contribute to spatial variability of surface water ponding thus the susceptibility of a parcel of land to of generation must be determined with joint consideration of location and land cover properties while the risk management forest thinning simulations reveal somewhat intuitive changes in the water budget metrics quantified see fig 9 the dynamics and non linearity of the system are important to consider in a larger context for example increases in storagegw are important in erosion and contaminant transport assessment given that dunne flow or saturation excess flow from groundwater systems may play an important role in determining of generation at the watershed scale e g bayabil et al 2010 in cases where storagegw increase a soil column may saturate if the precipitation rate is less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity once the soil column becomes completely saturated water leaves to the subsurface and becomes overland flow thus understanding the complex three dimensional subsurface flow pathways in conjunction with transport times to downhill regions of saturated groundwater are important if prediction of regions of dunne of generation is desired the complex three dimensional dynamics of the watershed including the contribution of groundwater to surface water and vice versa may be indicative of the non linear dynamics observed in fig 10 when lulc changes are implemented in the simulation experiments in terms of the effects of lulc changes as a risk mitigation strategy careful consideration is needed to determine the tradeoffs between the increased potential for erosion via of flow generation and the benefit of altering the land cover in the example demonstration of the fukushima forest results illustrate how deforestation to reduce the amount of 137cs within the region an important metric for stake holders and decision makers may lead to the potential for increases in erosion and contaminant transport relative to present day conditions although the removal of contaminated forest via forest thinning would substantially reduce the amount of 137cs present within the watershed miyahara et al 2015 our results show that there needs to be joint consideration that forest thinning would also substantially increase the potential mobility of sediments via an increase in of generated in this sense forest thinning may actually be counter productive in terms of remediation and may cause an increase in secondary contamination in order to quantitatively assess this tradeoff more data regarding the amount of 137cs that could be potentially removed with each felled tree is needed for example little data exists on the amount of 137cs stored in evergreen versus deciduous trees and how the removal of one tree type versus the other affects 137cs budgets this may also be important for other types of lulc change such as logging and natural tree mortality the latter has historically resulted in millions of cubic meters of pine tree loss in the last century mamiya 1988 and may be an important mode of lulc change in this region in the future finally because these results reveal the temporal evolution of the implications of risk management decisions comparisons could also be made to other time dependent risk analyses where varying exposure durations or other time sensitive intervals are important in the decision framework e g siirila and maxwell 2012 future work with integrated hydrologic models in three dimensions to determine the effect of lulc changes in the presence of multiple storm events i e where the system retains potentially higher saturation and groundwater levels are also needed given that antecedent moisture conditions on runoff have been linked to higher observed stream flows e g penna et al 2011 6 conclusions land management decisions require interdisciplinary and holistic approaches for prediction considering the unknown effects which lulc changes have on environmental systems across the critical zone the region at the land surface ranging from deep groundwater systems to the top of the vegetation canopy the focus of this work was overland flow generation given that 1 it is considered an important proxy for sediment and contaminant transport and 2 little is known about the relationship between the water energy budget and overland flow generation both the spatial distribution and corresponding magnitudes in the face of lulc changes with the use of parallel high performance computing high resolution integrated hydrologic numerical simulations were used to quantitatively determine how lulc changes affect the spatially distributed water energy budget in coupled systems including the interfaces between surface and groundwater the land surface and the atmosphere a typhoon storm event in a watershed near the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant was used as an example application in which the interplay between lulc change and of generation is important comparisons between present day and three hypothetical forest thinning scenarios reveal the complex interaction between different environmental compartments in the system and how the water energy budget may respond to given decontamination efforts key results include 1 in the base case present day scenario greater sensitivity to surface water metrics in comparison to groundwater metrics during the storm event is observed forest thinning simulations reveal similar results and show as high as an 18 increase in surface water runoff and storage for the cases considered the percentage of forest thinned in the watershed did not scale linearly with the amount of increase in water budget metrics exemplifying the complexity of these multi scale systems 2 regions where overland flow is generated denoted here as new overland flow were quantified for both the base case and forest thinning scenarios given that it can be used as a proxy of where erosion and or contaminant transport may occur while rice paddy and other crops comprise a small percentage of the present day watershed in comparison to forestlands relatively high percentages of these lulc types especially rice paddies are characterized by new of during the storm event the pressure head of newly generated overland flow for rice paddies is nearly double than that of other lulc types parcels of rice paddy and other crops that don t generate new overland flow during the storm event are those that are located in higher elevations hill crests or in some cases hillsides adjacent to stream generating valleys but a single parameter wasn t found to be solely linked to susceptibility this result highlights the need for high resolution integrated models to identify specific high risk locations within a given watershed 3 connections between the land surface and the atmosphere were quantified by comparing the temporal evolution of evapotranspiration for new overland flow areas vegetative lulc exhibit the highest evapotranspiration value corresponding to high leaf and stem area index and low leaf reflectance interestingly the paddy lulc type was characterized by high evapotranspiration despite many parametric similarities to the crop lulc type suggesting that the high availability of water may drive evapotranspiration higher in these regions trends were consistent for the base case and forest thinning scenarios in this regard 4 up to a 30 increase in new of area and volume is observed in the forest thinning risk management scenarios percent differences from the base case are most sensitive when the precipitation signal trends towards zero this is because at this time in the base case the higher percentage of forestland present results in the amount of new overland flow to be relatively small compared to the risk management scenarios amount of new overland flow primarily due to an increased presence of evapotranspiration and canopy interception although the removal of contaminated forest via forest thinning would substantially reduce the amount of 137cs present within the watershed this increase for the potential of erosion may actually be counter productive in terms of remediation causing an increased risk in secondary contamination

856,the fate and transport of soluble contaminants released in natural streams are strongly dependent on the spatial variations of the flow field and of the bed topography these variations are essentially related to the presence of the channel banks and to the planform configuration of the channel large velocity gradients arise near to the channel banks where the flow depth decreases to zero moreover single thread alluvial rivers are seldom straight and usually exhibit meandering planforms and a bed topography that deviates from the plane configuration channel axis curvature and movable bed deformations drive secondary helical currents which enhance both cross sectional velocity gradients and transverse mixing thus crucially influencing longitudinal dispersion the present contribution sets up a rational framework which assuming mild sloping banks and taking advantage of the weakly meandering character often exhibited by natural streams leads to an analytical estimate of the contribution to longitudinal dispersion associated with spatial non uniformities of the flow field the resulting relationship stems from a physics based modeling of the flow in natural rivers and expresses the bend averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient as a function of the relevant hydraulic and morphologic parameters the treatment of the problem is river specific since it relies on an explicit spatial description although linearized of the flow field that establishes in the investigated river comparison with field data available from tracer tests supports the robustness of the

soluble pollutants is a fundamental issue for the efficient management of riverine environments rapidly varying inputs of contaminants such as those associated with accidental spills of toxic chemicals and intermittent discharge from combined sewer overflows as well as temperature variations produced by thermal outflows generate a cloud that spreads longitudinally affecting the fate of the pollutant the classical treatment of longitudinal transport in turbulent flows relies on the study put forward by taylor 1954 for pipe flows and extended to natural channels by fischer 1967 taylor s analysis indicates that far enough from the source in the so called equilibrium region the cross sectionally averaged tracer concentration c satisfies a one dimensional advection diffusion equation embodying a balance between lateral mixing and nonuniform shear flow advection fickian dispersion model under the hypothesis that the velocity field is statistically steady and the investigated channel reach is geometrically homogeneous and extends far inside the equilibrium region the advection diffusion equation prescribes that the variance of c in the along stream direction s increases linearly with time and any skewness introduced by velocity shear close to the contaminant source i e in the advective zone or by the initial distribution of contaminant begins to slowly decay eventually leading at any instant to a gaussian distribution of c s chatwin and allen 1985 the coefficient of apparent diffusivity k governing this behavior usually denoted as dispersion coefficient is much greater than the coefficient for longitudinal diffusion by turbulence alone many engineering and environmental problems concerning the fate and transport of pollutants and nutrients are tackled resorting to the one dimensional advection diffusion approach botter and rinaldo 2003 revelli and ridolfi 2002 rinaldo et al 1991 schnoor 1996 wallis 1994 and therefore require a suitable specification of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient k also within the context of much more refined models developed to account for the formation of steep concentration fronts and elongated tails caused by storage and delayed release of pollutant in dead zones see among many others bencala and walters 1983 czernuszenko et al 1998 and bear and young 1983 a reliable estimate of longitudinal dispersion in the main stream quantified by k is fundamental to properly account for chemical and biological processes acting in different channel regions lees et al 2000 several procedures have so far been proposed to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient from either tracer data rutherford 1994 or velocity measurements at a number of cross sections fischer 1967 these approaches are usually expensive and time consuming the lack of experimental data which characterizes many applications as well as the necessity of specifying k when carrying out preliminary calculations has thus stimulated the derivation of various semi empirical and empirical relationships deng et al 2002 2001 disley et al 2015 etamad shahidi and taghipour 2012 fischer 1967 iwasa and aya 1991 kashefipour and falconer 2002 li et al 2013 liu 1977 noori et al 2017 sahay and dutta 2009 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 seo and cheong 1998 shucksmith et al 2011 wang and huai 2016 zeng and huai 2014 which can be cast in the general form 1 k κ 0 β κ 1 c f u κ 2 b u u where β is the ratio of half channel with b to mean flow depth d u cfu is the friction coefficient u u is the mean value of the cross sectionally averaged flow velocity within the reach of interest and κi i 0 1 2 are suitable constants specified in table 1 note that in table 1 we have just reported the main formulas for sake of completeness a wider list of relationships is given in the supplementary information the empirical parameters that are introduced in these relations to address the complexity embedded in the mixing process still make the quantifying of k a challenging task in many cases the proposed predictor provides only a rough estimate and the discrepancy between the predicted values of k and those determined from tracer tests is quite high among the many reasons responsible for this high scatter one may be the prismatic character assumed as the basis of the fickian solution wang and huai 2016 nevertheless natural channels are usually characterized by a complex bed topography which strongly affects the flow field and hence the longitudinal dispersion guymer 1998 but is only roughly accounted for in the various approaches in addition in some cases a suitable tuning of the empirical parameters is needed in order to achieve a good agreement with the experimental data deng et al 2001 many of the existing expressions for predicting the longitudinal dispersion in rivers have been developed by minimizing the error between predicted and measured through tracer tests dispersion coefficients these relations generally differ in terms of the relevant dimensionless groups determined through dimensional analysis and of the optimization technique e g nonlinear multi regression genetic and population based evolutionary algorithms used to calibrate the coefficients of the predictor disley et al 2015 kashefipour and falconer 2002 noori et al 2017 sahay and dutta 2009 seo and cheong 1998 more recently the dataset provided by the dispersion coefficients measured in the field has been used for training and testing artificial neural networks or bayesian networks alizadeh et al 2017 a less few attempts were devoted to derive analytical relationships by substituting in the triple integral ensuing from fischer analysis of shear flow dispersion the flow field that under the uniform flow assumption establishes in stable straight channels deng et al 2001 and in meandering rivers deng et al 2002 in the present contribution we follow this latter approach which has the advantage of being river specific i e to relate the dispersion coefficient to the shear flow dispersion that actually takes place in the river under investigation the improvement with respect to the contributions by deng et al 2001 2002 is essentially related to the morphodynamics based modelling of the flow that establishes in alluvial rivers in the case of straight rivers rather than using the general hydraulic geometry relationship for stable cross sections we propose a specific treatment of the shear flow effects by dividing the cross section into a central flat bed region and two gently sloping banks computing the flow field therein in the case of meandering rivers the flow field outside the boundary layers that form near to the banks is solved explicitly although in a linearised way accounting parametrically for the secondary flow circulations induced by streamline curvatures and computing the bed topography by solving the two dimensional sediment balance equation the aim of the present contribution is thus to develop physics based analytic predictions of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient accounting for the cross sectional morphology occurring in alluvial rivers more specifically we intend to relate the estimates of k to the relevant hydraulic geometric and sedimentologic parameters flow discharge bed slope representative sediment size bank geometry governing the steady flow in an alluvial river first we apply to the flow field which establishes in sinuous movable bed channels the perturbative procedure developed by smith 1983 that accounts for the fast variations of concentration induced across the section by irregularities in channel geometry and the presence of bends this methodology introducing a reference system moving downstream with the contaminant cloud and using a multiple scale perturbation technique allows the derivation of a dispersion equation relating entirely to shear flow dispersion the along channel changes in the cross sectionally averaged concentration next we take advantage of the weakly meandering character of many natural rivers to clearly separate the contributions to longitudinal dispersion provided by the various sources of nonuniformities at the leading order of approximation corresponding to the case of a straight channel we consider the differential advection related to the presence of channel banks solving the flow field by means of a rational perturbation scheme tubino and colombini 1992 at the first order of approximation we introduce the correction to k due to the presence of bends by using the hydro morphodynamic model of frascati and lanzoni 2013 the proposed methodology is finally validated through the comparison with the tracer test data collected in almost straight and in meandering rivers among others we consider the dataset provided by godfrey and frederick 1970 which includes detailed measurements of flow depth longitudinal velocity and the temporal evolution of the tracer concentration at different cross sections as well as estimates of k based on the method of moments these concentration data are here reanalyzed by considering the chatwin s method chatwin 1980 which indicates if and where a fickian model likely applies and the routing method based on the hayami solution rutherford 1994 we anticipate that the proposed framework provides estimates of k that are in reasonable good agreement with the values computed from tracer tests the paper is organized as follows the mathematical problem is formulated in section 2 with particular emphasis on the typical temporal and spatial scales which allow to set up a rational perturbative framework and eventually determine the overall structure of the dispersion coefficient in alluvial channels the analytical solutions of the depth averaged flow field used to compute k are described in section 3 the comparison with available field data is reported in section 4 while section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the results finally section 6 summarizes the concluding remarks 2 formulation of the problem we consider the behavior of a passive non reactive contaminant which e g due to an accidental spill is suddenly released in an alluvial channel with a compact cross section and in general a meandering planform the river cross section bed is assumed to vary slowly in the transverse direction as the banks are approached this assumption allows for solving the flow field by adopting a closure model of turbulence in which the turbulent viscosity ν t is a function of the local flow condition see section 3 1 the channel has fixed banks a constant free surface width 2b a longitudinal mean slope s and conveys a constant discharge q hereafter a star superscript will be used to denote dimensional variables the reach averaged value of the flow depth is d u the corresponding cross section area is a u 2 b d u while the cross sectionally averaged mean velocity is u u q a u the erodible channel bed is assumed to be made up of a uniform cohesionless sediment with grain size d g r density ρs and immersed relative density δ ρ s ρ ρ with ρ the water density moreover we denote by β b d u the half width to depth ratio u f u g d u s 1 2 the friction velocity with g the gravitational constant and c f u u f u u u 2 the friction coefficient these two latter quantities are influenced by the bed configuration which can be either plane or covered by bedforms such as ripples and dunes depending on the dimensionless grain size d g r d g r d u and the shields parameter τ u u f u 2 δ g d g r 2 1 the 2 d dimensionless advection diffusion equation the problem can be conveniently studied introducing the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate system s n z shown in fig 1 a where s is the longitudinal curvilinear coordinate coinciding with the channel axis n is the horizontal coordinate normal to s and z is the upward directed axis the two dimensional advection diffusion equation for the depth

longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity and k s and k n are longitudinal and transverse mixing coefficients which account for the combined effect of vertical variations of velocity and turbulent diffusion moreover hs is a metric coefficient arising from the curvilinear character of the longitudinal coordinate defined as 3 h s 1 n r 1 ν n c where r s is the local radius of curvature of the channel axis assumed to be positive when the center of curvature lies along the negative n axis ν b r 0 is the curvature ratio n n b is the dimensionless transverse coordinate c r 0 r is the dimensionless channel curvature and r 0 is twice the minimum value of r within the meandering reach in meandering channels the cross sectionally averaged concentration undergoes relatively small and rapidly changing gradients associated with the spatial variations of the flow field along the bends and a slower evolution due to longitudinal dispersion in order to deal with the fast concentration changes acting at the meander scale it proves convenient to introduce a pseudo lagrangian volume following coordinate ξ which travels downstream with the contaminant cloud and accounts for the fact that the cross sectionally averaged velocity q a is not constant along the channel smith 1983 this coordinate is defined as 4 ξ 1 a u 0 s a d s u u t where the integral on the right side is the water volume from the origin of the coordinate system to the generic coordinate s while 5 a b b d d n a b b h s d d n clearly a and a can vary along s as a consequence of the variations of section geometry induced by the bed topography that establishes in the meandering channel the derivation chain rule implies that 6 s s a ξ t t u u ξ where a a a u consequently for an observer moving with velocity u u i e with the advected pollutant cloud the dilution of the concentration associated with longitudinal dispersion is accounted for by the coordinate ξ and occurs at a length scale comparable with the length of the contaminant cloud l c it then results that c c s n ξ t and eq 2 can be rewritten as 7 d u c s h s d v c n n k n h s d c n d h s u u a u c ξ h s d c t s k s d h s c s a k s d h s c ξ a ξ

processes longitudinal dispersion differential advection and transverse mixing that govern the concentration dynamics of the pollutant cloud in order to ensure that they are well separated fischer 1967 smith 1983 we introduce the small parameter 10 ϵ k n u b u u and recall the relationships usually adopted to predict the transverse and longitudinal mixing coefficients k n u and k u the rate of transverse mixing is determined by turbulent diffusion quantified by the depth averaged transverse eddy diffusivity e t and vertical variations in the transverse velocity quantified by the transverse dispersion coefficient k t rutherford 1994 both coefficients scale as u f u d u and consequently the transverse mixing coefficient can be expressed as 11 k n u e t k t u f u d u recalling that u f u d

rutherford 1994 on the other hand for large rivers the transverse dispersion coefficient kt has been related to the mean flow velocity and the channel width through a relation of the form smeithlov 1990 12 k t 1 3520 u u u f u 2 b d u 1 38 observing that the ratio c f u β attains values of order o 10 2 and o 10 3 in gravel and sandy rivers hey and thorne 1986 parker 2004 it results that the parameter ϵ is indeed small according to the semi empirical relationship developed by fischer et al 1979 k u 0 044 b u u 2 u f u d u this functional dependence is confirmed by the dispersion data reported by rutherford 1994 indicating that the dimensionless ratio k u b u u mostly falls in the range 0 14 36 with mean 4 4 and standard deviation 5 0 we can then write 13 k n u k u k n k t 0 044 c f u β 2 ϵ 2 consequently t 1 t 0 ϵ and t 2 t 0 ϵ 2 provided that b l c ϵ 2 that is the contaminant cloud has reached a length of order of hundred of meters or kilometers depending on the width of the channel section this result implies that the three time scales are well separated i e t 0 t 1 t 2 in other words the longitudinal dispersion operates on a timescale much slower than the timescale characterizing transverse mixing which in turn is much faster than nonuniform advection fischer 1967 smith 1983 the derivation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient takes advantage of the small character of the parameter ϵ ensuring the separation of the three timescales substituting the dimensionless variables 8 and 9 into eq 7 we obtain 14 l c ϵ d h s a u c ξ ϵ 2 h s d c t ϵ 2 γ s ϵ a ξ γ ϵ k s d h s c s a k s d h s c ξ where the differential operator l reads 15 l γ d u s h s v n n h s d k n n the additional parameter γ ϵ l c l arises because of the presence of two spatial scales the spatial variations of c associated with longitudinal dispersion at the scale of the contaminant cloud are described by the slow variable ξ whereas the comparatively small and rapidly changing variations in concentration across the flow associated with stream meandering are accounted for through the fast variables s n the parameter γ describes the relative importance of transverse mixing which tends to homogenize the contaminant concentration and nonuniform transport at the bend scale which on the contrary enhances concentration gradients it is readily observed that γ ϵ 1 λ 2 π where the dimensionless meander wavenumber λ 2 π b l typically ranges between 0 1 and 0 3 leopold et al 1964 the product γϵ then turns out of order o 10 2 and hence gives rise to higher order terms in the perturbation analysis described in the next section 2 2 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient the presence of different spatial and temporal scales can be handled employing a multiple scale

the depth averaged i e two dimensional continuity equation written in dimensionless form reads 20 u d s h s v d n 0 we integrate 17 across the section and find that c 0 does not depend on s n and hence it is not affected by the fluctuations induced by flow meandering eq 18 suggests a solution of the form c 1 g 1 s n c 0 ξ with g 1 a function describing the nonuniform distribution across the

that the arbitrary constant embedded in gi does not actually depend on s we are now ready to derive the advection diffusion equation governing the evolution of the cross sectionally averaged

that g 1 n 0 at the channel banks where the normal component of the contaminant flux vanishes and g 1 0 before proceeding further some observations on the expression 24 are worthwhile in accordance with fischer 1967 the contribution to longitudinal dispersion provided by vertical variations of the velocity profile embodied by the terms of 14 containing ks is of minor importance longitudinal dispersion is essentially governed by shear flow dispersion induced by the nonuniform distribution across the section of both the contaminant concentration accounted for through the function g 1 s n and the flow field quantified by d h s u a this latter term however differs from the much simpler term 1 u that would arise in the classical treatment pursued by fischer 1967 as a consequence of the fact that here the mean flow velocity can in general vary along the channel as accounted for through the volume following coordinate ξ in addition it is important to observe that the bend averaged coefficient k is always positive while in the presence of river reaches characterized by rapid longitudinal variations of the flow field the coefficient k can also attain negative values thus favoring spurious instabilities smith 1983 finally it is useful to relate the local and the bend averaged dispersion coefficients k and k to the local dispersion coefficient d that arises when considering only the fast coordinate s decomposing the concentration c and velocity u as the sum of their cross sectionally averaged values c u plus the corresponding fluctuations c u the classical one dimensional

configuration the problem can be faced by taking advantage of the fact that the curvature ratio ν appearing in 3 is typically a small parameter ranging in the interval 0 1 0 2 leopold et al 1964 this evidence is widely used to describe the flow field in meandering channels seminara 2006 and to model their long term evolution frascati and lanzoni 2010 2013 it implies that the flow field and the bed

contribution k 0 corresponds to the classical solution obtained by fischer 1967 it accounts for dispersion effects which arise in a straight uniform flow as a consequence of the transverse gradients experienced by u 0 and the concentration distribution in the bank regions fig 1 note that neglecting these effects is equivalent to set u 0 d 0 1 such that k 0 0 it is also easy to demonstrate that the o ν correction k 1 is identically zero indeed a 1 0 and the various integrals involve products of even 1 u 0 d 0 g 10 and odd d 1 u 1 g 11 n functions that integrated across a symmetrical section yield a zero contribution finally the o ν 2 term k 2 includes the effects of the near bank velocity and concentration gradients mainly represented by the first integral on the right hand side of eq 33 and those due to the complex structure of the flow field the bed topography and the spatial distribution of the concentration induced by the meandering stream the former contribution to k 2 is likely of minor importance when dealing with wide and shallow sections i e with large β as often occurs in alluvial rivers and in the following will be neglected in order to keep the model at the lower level of complexity in fact as it will be seen in the next section the solution of the flow field in a meandering channel is available in closed form only by neglecting the boundary layers that form near to the banks frascati and lanzoni 2013 the functions g 1i s n i 0 1 that describe the cross sectional distribution of c are obtained by solving the partial differential equations that arise by

is in general given by the sum of a homogeneous solution common to any order of approximation and a particular solution related to the forcing term f 1i the homogeneous solution can be written in term of fourier series and generally depends on the transverse distribution of concentration at the injection section however in the case of a sudden release of contaminant treated here it tends to decrease exponentially with the coordinate s and hence vanishes far downstream of the input section smith 1983 this condition is equivalent to impose that the o ϵ and o ϵ2 pollutant fluxes vanish 1 1 d u g i d n 0 for i 1 2 as required in the derivation of eq 23 finally note that for the uniform flow in a straight channel the along channel gradient of g 10 is identically zero and 34 yields the

any contribution to k 0 3 depth averaged flow field in alluvial channels the characteristics of the steady flow that establishes in alluvial channels are determined by the form of the cross section and the planform configuration of the channel the governing two dimensional equations of mass and momentum conservation are in general obtained by depth averaging the corresponding three dimensional equations and by accounting for the dynamic effects of secondary flows induced by curvature and of the boundary layers that form near to the channel banks the complexity of the problem prevents the derivation of general solutions in closed form also numerical solutions are non straightforward owing to the difficulty of modeling secondary circulations bolla pittaluga and seminara 2011 however the governing equations can be linearized in the presence of gently sloping channel banks and meandering channels with wide and long bends such that the flow field can be solved by perturbing the uniform flow solution in terms of two small parameters δ and ν we resort just to these solutions which have the pratical advantage to explicitily account although in a simplified form for the effects exerted on the base flow field by the bank shape and the channel axis curvature we then estimate analytically the longitudinal dispersion coefficient through 31 and 33 in the following we first derive the cross sectional distribution of the longitudinal velocity u 0 in a straight channel with gently sloping banks small δ next we briefly recall the structure of u 1 in wide and long meander bends small ν with either an arbitrary or a regular distribution of the channel axis curvature 3 1 straight channels the uniform turbulent flow field that establishes throughout a cross section of a straight channel can be conveniently studied introducing the local orthogonal coordinate system s σ ζ where s is the longitudinal in this case straight coordinate directed downstream σ is the transverse curvilinear coordinate aligned along the cross section profile with origin at the channel axis and ζ is the coordinate normal to the bed pointing upward see fig 1c the curvilinear nature of σ is accounted for through the metric coefficient 39 h σ 1 ζ cos φ 2 d 0 σ 2 cos φ 1 d 0 σ 2 with d 0 σ the local value of the flow depth φ the angle that the vertical forms with ζ and d z d 0 cos φ the flow depth measured normally to the bed fig 1 the uniform character of the flow implies that on average the flow characteristics do not vary in time and along the direction s hence denoting by u σ ζ the corresponding component of the velocity the longitudinal momentum equation averaged over the turbulence reads appendix a 40 s h σ g σ ν t h σ u σ ζ ν t h σ u ζ 0 where ν t is the eddy viscosity used to express the turbulent reynolds stresses through the boussinesq eddy viscosity approximation in general the channel cross section is assumed to consists of fig 1c i a central region of width 2 b c and constant depth depth d c and ii two bank regions each one characterized by a width b b c and wetted perimeter p 0 in natural channels the flow depth is usually much smaller than the wetted perimeter and consequently the dimensionless parameter 41 δ d u p 0 b c is small we will take advantage of this for solving eq 40 to this aim we introduce the scaling 42 ζ ζ d z σ σ σ p 0 b c d 0 d 0

bed do not intersect each other it is possible to express the dimensionless eddy viscosity νt as 47 ν t ζ u f d z n ζ the simplest model for the function n ζ is that introduced by engelund 1974 whereby n 1 13 in the following we will adopt this scheme which allows for an analytical solution of the problem and as shown by tubino and colombini 1992 leads to results that agree both qualitatively and quantitatively with those obtained with a more accurate model for the function n ζ under the assumption of a constant n a slip condition has to be imposed at the bed such that 48 u ζ

see appendix a integrating u along the normal ζ to the bed the local value u 0 σ of the depth averaged longitudinal velocity results 51 u 0 u 00 δ 2 u 01 o δ 4 where u 00 is a function of the local flow depth d 0 σ and the relative grain roughness dgr while u 01 depends also on d 0 σ i e the local slope and 2 d 0 σ 2 appendix a the cross sectional distribution of u 0 needed to compute the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is then determined by specifying the relative bed roughness dgr and more importantly the across section distribution of the flow depth d 0 σ in the absence of experimental data we need to describe the bank geometry here we propose to handle empirically the problem assuming a transverse distribution of the flow depth of the form 52 d 0 σ d c e r f β f 1 σ σ 1 1 with βf a shape parameter measuring the steepness of the banks note that according to 52 erf βf should be equal to 1 in order to ensure that d 0 0 d c the latter requirement is fulfilled only asymptotically for βf tending to infinity for this reason in the following we will consider only values of β f e r f 1 0 999 2 32675 corresponding to d c d 0 0 0 999 d c note also that βf is related to the parameter δβc through the relation 53 δ β c 1 e r f 1 0 999 β f 2 where β c b c d u and having assumed d 0 b c 0 999 d c as βf increases also δβc increases resulting in progressively steeper cross sections fig 2 a note that increasing values of δ imply higher bank slopes in the limit of β f 2 32675 it results δβc 0 corresponding to b c 0 no central region while as βf the classical rectangular cross sectional configuration p 0 0 is recovered fig 2a interestingly the distributions of u f1 σ shown in fig 2b indicate an increase of the friction velocity uf with respect to the uniform flow in the steeper portion of the bank and a corresponding decrease in the part of the bank adjacent to the central region this trend due to the longitudinal momentum transfer from the center of the cross section where flow velocities are higher to the banks implies that the channel can transport sediments even though the bank toes are stable note also that u f1 σ vanishes towards the center of the cross section where the bottom is flat and at the outer bank boundary where d 0 tends to zero 3 2 meandering channels the flow field that takes place in a meandering channel with a compact cross section is strictly related to the secondary flow circulations driven by the curvature of streamlines and the deformation of the channel bed which generally exhibits larger scours in the correspondence of the outer bank of a bend seminara 2006 although numerical models have the advantage to overcome the restrictions affecting theoretical analyses e g linearity or weak non linearity simplified geometry they still require a large computational effort to correctly include the effects of secondary helical flow and to reproduce the bed topography of movable bed channels bolla pittaluga and seminara 2011 eke et al 2014 that is why linearized models have been widely adopted to investigate the physics of river meandering seminara 2006 the long term evolution of alluvial rivers bogoni et al 2017 frascati and lanzoni 2009 howard 1992 and the possible existence of a scale invariant behavior frascati and lanzoni 2010 these models owing to their analytical character not only provide insight on the basic mechanisms operating in the process under investigation but also allow to develop relatively simple engineering tools which can be profitably used for practical purposes in the following we refer to the linearized hydro morphodynamic model developed by frascati and lanzoni 2013 that in the most general case can manage also mild along channel variations of the cross section width the model is based on the two dimensional depth averaged shallow water equations written in the curvilinear coordinates s n and owing to the large aspect ratio β usually observed in natural rivers neglects the presence of the near bank boundary layers the flow equations ensuring the conservation of mass and momentum and embedding a suitable parametrization of the secondary flow circulations are coupled with the two dimensional sediment balance equation complemented with the relation describing the rate of sediment transport the solution of the resulting set of partial differential equations takes advantage of the fact that in natural channels the curvature ratio ν is small ranging in the interval 0 1 0 2 and assume that flow and topography perturbations originating from deviations of the channel planform from the straight one are small enough to allow for linearization in the case of a constant width rectangular section for which d c d u the dimensionless flow

its derivation and implementation while all the coefficients needed to compute u 1 and d 1 are reported in the supplementary information it is worthwhile to note that the relevant dimensionless parameters geometric hydraulic and sedimentological needed as input data to the model are the width to depth ratio β the dimensionless grain size dgr and the shields parameter for the uniform flow conditions τ u the expressions 54 are used to compute the forcing term f 11 needed to solve the boundary value problem 34 for g 11 note that by substituting 54 into 38 yields g 10 0 owing to the neglecting of bank effects the particular solution of 34 is obtained by writing the forcing term as f 11 p s q n i e separating the variables through fourier series and by introducing the appropriate green function morse and feshbach 1953 we obtain 57 g 11 s n 1 γ m 0 1 m 1 cos μ 2 m 1 n 1 0 s s 0 p m s χ e μ 2 m 1 2 χ γ d χ where μ m m π 2 58 p m s 2 m c 2 1 m c s u c m s and s 0 denotes the position of the injection section by assumption the length scale over which the contaminant cloud has evolved l c is well in excess of the transverse mixing distance u 0 b 2 k n consequently the position s 0 of the injection section can be set arbitrarily far upstream taking s 0 physically this is equivalent to assume that the solution depends only on values of p s χ upstream of s over a diffusion length scale indeed the integral with respect to the dummy variable χ decays as exp μ m 2 χ γ and hence depends on the values of p closest to s the solution 57 is in general valid for an arbitrary although slowly varying spatial distribution of the channel axis curvature it takes a particularly simple form in the schematic case of a regular sequence of meanders with the axis curvature described by the sine generated curve c s e 2 π ı s c c leopold et al 1964 where i is the imaginary unit and c c denotes complex conjugate in this case the flow field reads blondeaux and seminara 1985

the outer flow that takes place in a movable bed in fact pushes the thread of high velocity towards the outside bank unlike in the fixed bed case where the predicted thread of high velocities is

conjugate 4 comparison with tracer field data 4 1 the considered dataset in order to test the validity of the proposed theory we need information not only on the dispersion coefficient and the average hydrodynamic properties of the considered river reach but also on the planform shape of the channel on the geometry of the cross sections and possibly on the cross sectional velocity distribution despite the numerous tracer experiments carried out on river dispersion mcquivey and keefer 1974 nordin and sabol 1974 seo and cheong 1998 yotsukura et al 1970 only a few report also this type of information in particular the data collected by godfrey and frederick 1970 include the time distribution of the local tracer concentration c at a number of monitoring sections and the cross section distributions of the flow depth d n and of the vertical profiles of the longitudinal velocity u n z this dataset therefore provides all the information needed to assess the robustness of the present modeling framework in each test a radiotracer gold 198 was injected in a line source across the stream about 15 ml of the tracer a highly concentrated solution of gold chloride in nitric and hydrochloric acid was diluted to a volume of 2 l the injection was made at a uniform rate over a 1 min period the concentration of radionuclide used in each test was proportional to the discharge about 2 6 gbq m 3 s 1 the concentrations near to the stream centerline were observed by a scintillation detector the resolving time for the entire system was found to be 50 s the error due to the resolving time was about 5 10 among the five river reaches considered by godfrey and frederick 1970 three exhibit almost straight planforms the copper creek below gage near gate city va the clinch river above gage hereafter clinch river a g near clinchport va and the clinch river below gage hereafter clinch river b g near speers ferry va the other two river reaches the powell river near sedville tenn and the copper creek above gage near gate city va have meandering planforms this data set has been integrated with the estimates of k obtained from tracer tests carried out in other five straight streams and eight meandering rivers namely the queich sulzbach and kaltenbach rivers noss and lorke 2016 the ohio muskegon st clair and red cedar rivers shen et al 2010 the green duwamish river fischer 1968 the missouri river yotsukura et al 1970 the lesser slave river beltaos and day 1978 and the miljacka river dobran 1982 fig 3 shows the planform configurations of the investigated reaches extracted from topographic maps while the geometrical hydraulic and sedimentologic parameters of each stream are reported in table 2 in particular the curvature ratio ν and the wavenumber λ have been determined from the spatial distribution of channel axis curvature through the automatic extraction procedure described by marani et al 2002 the mean grain size estimates have been obtained on the basis of information available from literature beltaos and day 1978 godfrey and frederick 1970 yotsukura et al 1970 from the usgs national water information system http www waterdata usgs gov nwis or from direct inspection dobran 2007 personal communication in addition to real meandering stream data table 2 reports the laboratory data characterizing the longitudinal dispersion experiment carried out by boxall and guymer 2007 in a flume with a sine generated meandering planform and a sand bed that was artificially fixed by chemical hardening after the initially uniform trapezoidal cross section was shaped by the flow for a given test i we used the data collected by godfrey and frederick 1970 to compute at each monitored cross section j the area a i j and the total wetted perimeter p i j we then used the cross sectional velocity data u i j n z to compute the depth averaged velocity u i j n and the flow discharge q i j all the relevant quantities deduced from the experimental dataset are collected in table 2 reported in the supplementary information in particular the values of the mean slope are those provided directly by godfrey and frederick 1970 while the friction velocities have been estimated under the hypothesis of a locally uniform flow field the dispersion coefficients by godfrey and frederick 1970 have been obtained by applying the method of moments however the presence of a relatively long tail in the temporal distribution of the concentration fig 4 a and the sensitivity of small concentrations to measurement errors limit the accuracy of this method rutherford 1994 for this reason we have recalculated the dispersion coefficients by considering the chatwin s method chatwin 1980 which has also the advantage to give an indication whether a monitoring section is located or not whitin the equilibrium region where a fickian dispersion model can be applied fig 4b shows an example of the application of the method to the tracer data collected in the clinch creeek test t10 the chatwin method introduces the transformed variable c t defined as 62 c t ln c m a x t m a x c t where c c s j t is the temporal distribution of the cross sectionally averaged concentration measured the at jth cross section cmax is the corresponding peak concentration t m a x is the peaking time and the and signs apply for t t m a x and t t m a x respectively in the transformed plane c t a temporal distribution of tracer concentration following a gaussian behavior should plot as a straight line the slope 0 5 q a j k j and the intercept 0 5 s j k j of this line allow one to estimate the dispersion coefficient k j and the cross sectionally averaged velocity q a j the data suggest that for all the sections only the rising limb and the near peak region of the concentration time distribution are approximately linear and hence can be described by a gaussian distribution conversely a departure from the linear trend is evident in the correspondence of the tails indicating a deviation from the fickian behavior the values of k j estimated by considering the linear part of c t for all the data collected by godfrey and frederick 1970 turn out invariably smaller than those calculated according to the method of moments see table 3 of the supplementary information in order to assess the sensitivity of these estimates to the method used to derive them we applied also the routing method based on the hayami solution rutherford 1994 this method provided that the dynamics of the cross sectionally averaged concentration is gaussian takes advantage of the superimposition of effects to determine the temporal distribution of c in a section given the local values of u k and the concentration time curve in an upstream section the resulting solution has the advantage that it can be used to route downstream a given temporal distribution of concentration without invoking the frozen cloud approximation in fact for moderately large values of s and t it gives a concentration profile similar to that provided by the classical taylor solution for all the monitored sections except the first one it is thus possible to estimate the values of u and k which ensure the best agreement between the measured and predicted concentration profiles fig 5 shows the results of the application of the chatwin and hayami methods in some cases the hayami method tends to yield larger values of k possible reasons of this behaviour are the poor fitting of the routed solutions and the significance of the tail due to the entrapment and retarded release of the tracer into dead zones absorption on sediment surfaces hyporheic fluxes nevertheless the most significant differences between the two approaches generally occur in sections where the estimate deviates significantly longer error bars in fig 5a from the average value in the considered river reach i e where the dynamic of the tracer cloud is likely influenced by some localised effects such as irregularities along the channel sides or the channel bed determining the retention of a certain amount of tracer on the other hand the average velocity estimated with the two methods are very similar fig 5b in the following we will consider the estimates of the dispersion coefficients provided by the chatwin method when referring to the measured values of k 4 2 comparison with straight river dispersion data before pursuing a comparison between observed and predicted dispersion coefficients it is worthwhile to test the reliability of the flow field model described in section 3 1 fig 6 shows the cross sectional distribution of the flow depth left panels and depth averaged velocity right panels measured by godfrey and frederick 1970 in six locations along the clinch river b g test t10 the theoretically predicted velocities shown in fig 6 have been obtained either by introducing into equation 51 the observed flow depth or by considering the simplified cross sectional geometry described by eq 52 and selecting the value of βf which better interpolates the measured depth profile the agreement between measured and computed velocity distributions is in general reasonably good correlation coefficient r u 2 0 81 the comparison between the estimates of k obtained from the tracer data of godfrey and frederick 1970 and those predicted by inserting in eq 31 the flow field described by eq 51 are shown in fig 7 a this figure also shows in white squares a comparison between the predicted dispersion coefficients and those estimated from measurements by noss and lorke 2016 and shen et al 2010 for the queich sulzbach kaltenbach and muskegon rivers the theoretical estimates are reasonably good with about 70 of predictions ensuring an error smaller than 30 dotted lines in fig 7a overall the model tends to underestimate the dispersion coefficient for the larger values of k which usually occur in the most distant sections from the injection where the measured concentration profiles are particularly flat in any case the present estimates of k are definitely more accurate than those provided by other predictors available in literature fig 7c as documented by the values of the discrepancy ratio d r l o g k p r e d k m e a s plotted in fig 7b and d to give a visual perception of the goodness of the different models fig 7 shows the data relative to the models displaying the best smaller mean discrepancy ratio and worst larger mean discrepancy ratio performance according to table 1 a figure reporting the predictions of all models is provided in the supplementary information note that the coefficient κ 0 of the formula proposed by deng et al 2001 and reported in table 1 has been here reduced by 1 15 indeed this coefficient was originally determined by introducing a multiplicative empirical constant ψ 15 according to deng et al 2001 in order to achieve a better agreement with the observed dispersion coefficients these coefficients at least in the specific case of the data provided by godfrey and frederick 1970 were calculated through the method of moments that as discussed above tends to overestimate k with respect to the chatwin or the routing methods nevertheless even by reducing the value of κ 0 the predictions of k obtained from the formula by deng et al 2001 are significantly less accurate mean discrepancy ratio d r 0 63 than those resulting from the present theoretical approach d r 0 19 even worse results are attained when considering other predictors see table 1 it is important to stress that the present methodology being physics based does not need the introduction of any fitting parameter the input data are simply the flow discharge the free surface channel width the longitudinal slope the friction velocity strictly associated with the sediment grain size and the type of bed configuration i e plane or dune covered and the cross sectional distribution of the flow depth or alternatively its simplified analytical description eq 52 finally we observe that including the higher order effects that the presence of the channel banks exert on the transverse gradient of u 0 associated to the o δ 2 contribution in eq 51 always leads to improve the estimate of k d r 0 190 instead of 0 188 4 3 comparison with meandering river dispersion data in the case of meandering streams besides q b s u f u additional input information to the present model is the spatial distribution of channel axis curvature these data are used to determine the dimensionless parameters β τ u dgr ν as well as the along channel distribution of the channel axis curvature c s needed to compute the flow field through eqs 55 the expressions of u 1 s n and d 1 s n are then employed to compute f 11 and to solve the problem 34 for g 11 and ultimately to obtain the o ν 2 correction 33 to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in order to test the reliability of the flow field model described in section 3 2 a comparison with the flow depths left panels and depth averaged velocities right panels measured by boxall and guymer 2007 at the apex and the cross over sections of an experimental meandering channel is reported in fig 8 the theoretically predicted velocities have also been compared with the velocity profiles calculated according to smith 1983 for the theoretical flow depth distributions continuos lines on the left panels 63 u d 0 5 u u d u h u where h u is the cross sectional average of d 1 5 the cross sectional shapes predicted by the present model reproduce correctly r d 2 0 90 the topography variations induced by alternating bends possible departures being related to the presence of bedforms not accounted for in the model the overall comparison appears reasonably good also in terms of depth integrated longitudinal velocities r u 2 0 93 and the theoretically predicted profiles yield a better performance with respect to those calculated according to the approximate method proposed by smith 1983 r u 2 0 91 fig 9 a shows the comparison between the bend averaged values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient estimated from the measures carried out by godfrey and frederick 1970 in the copper creek and in the powell river and those predicted by either the leading term k 0 eq 31 entailing a straight channel or by considering also the correction ν 2 k 2 eq 33 accounting for the presence of river bends this correction turns out to pick up the right order of magnitude and on the whole ensures a degree of accuracy greater than that attained when neglecting curvature effects d r 0 32 instead of d r 0 76 as expected when treating the river as straight the predicted values of k 0 are systematically lower than those observed in the field in is worthwhile to note that the points corresponding to cross sections t3 s1 t3 s2 and t4 s1 for which the theory tends in any case to overestimate k are quite close to the injection section and therefore likely fall outside the zone where a fickian dispersion model holds the ability of the present theoretical framework to give robust estimates of k is confirmed by fig 9b reporting the predicted values of k against those resulting from the tracer test data for all the considered meandering streams on the whole the effect of the curvature is to slightly improve the degree of accuracy d r 0 22 instead of 0 29 although sometimes the theoretical coefficients turn out to be lower than those observed in the field this can be partly explained with the fact that the predicted o ν 2 correction does not account for the near bank velocity gradients associated with the presence of a boundary layer and has been obtained on the basis of a linearized treatment of the flow field which tends to underestimate the intensity of both secondary circulations and transverse bed deformations forced by the meandering stream clearly a number of other processes act in the field to make dispersion not entirely fickian contributing to the data scatter we return later on this issue finally note that for the considered set of rivers the results remain basically unaltered dr 0 225 instead of 0 22 when instead of considering the observed spatially varying curvature signal we consider a sequence of regular meanders with maximum curvature equal to the inverse of the mean minimum radius of curvature within the river reach 5 discussion the rational perturbative framework developed in the previous sections based on a suitable scaling of the two dimensional advection diffusion equation and on the introduction of a reference system traveling downstream with the contaminant cloud and accounting for the along channel variability of the cross sectionally averaged velocity provides a clear picture of the processes affecting the spreading of a contaminant in alluvial rivers the velocity gradients that characterize the near bank regions of natural streams where the flow depth progressively vanishes influence the longitudinal dispersion at the leading order of approximation equation 31 corresponding to a straight channel planform secondary circulations driven by centrifugal and topographical effects typical of meandering channels provide a second order correction equation 33 the presence of a secondary helical flow enhances transverse velocity gradients which in turn tend to increase the longitudinal dispersion coefficient on the contrary the increased transverse mixing promoted by secondary currents e g boxall et al 2003 would lead to a reduction of longitudinal dispersion this behavior is summarized in the analytical relation 61 obtained by considering a regular sequence of sine generated bends bend effects are explicitly accounted for through the dependence on ν 2 while the characteristics of the flow field and the bottom topography affect the coefficients bm moreover as observed by fischer 1969 and smith 1983 the ratio γ of cross sectional mixing timescale to longitudinal advection timescale accounts for the frequency of alternating bends along the meandering reach in the case of long enough bends i e such that γ is much smaller than 1 the term 2πγ 2 at the denominator of 61 can be neglected with respect to m 4 on the contrary if γ increases k tends to decrease this is the case of short bends for which the changes in the flow field associated with alternating curves are too fast to allow cross sectional mixing to eliminate concentration gradients fig 10 shows two typical examples of the variations of k as a function of the aspect ratio β for either plane fig 10a or dune covered bed fig 10b in both cases for given values of the dimensionless parameters ν dgr and γ the bend averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases with the shields parameter τ u on the other hand for a given τ u the values of k corresponding to quite different dimensionless grain sizes dgr exhibit a relatively narrow range of variations as shown in fig 10c finally fig 10d demonstrates that k tends to increase significantly when approaching the resonant conditions see e g lanzoni and seminara 2006 nevertheless it must be recalled that the meandering flow field in a neighborhood of the resonant state cannot be described by the linear model adopted here but it would require a weakly nonlinear approach in general the linearized treatment of the flow field set as the basis of the present theoretical framework holds for relatively wide bends small ν long enough meanders to ensure slow longitudinal variations of the flow field small λ small intensity of the centrifugally driven secondary flow a condition met for small values of ν β c f u and small amplitude of bed perturbations with respect to the straight configuration small ν τ u c f u and λ β τ u bolla pittaluga and seminara 2011 frascati and lanzoni 2013 these intrinsic limitation of the theory can partly explain the deviations of the predicted dispersion coefficients from the values estimated from tracer test data other physical processes however concur to the scatter of data the bed configuration predicted by the considered hydro morphodynamic model stems from the imposed flow discharge corresponding to that actually observed during the tracer tests nevertheless this discharge can differ from the formative discharge producing the actual river bed configuration the presence of regulation works and human activities e g sediment mining dredging can modify the bed topography and consequently the structure of the flow field controlling shear flow dispersion finally the presence of bedforms width variations islands and dead zones concurs to a non perfectly fickian behavior enhancing the rate of dispersion and causing the long tails usually observed in concentration time curves the gaussian solution resulting from a fickian approach to dispersion can then be used to describe only the upper portion of the concentration time curves as indicated by the tracer data plotted using chatwin s transformation other approaches are needed to fit entirely these curves such as the transient storage model that accounts for the effects of temporary entrapment and subsequent re entrainment of pollutants cheong and seo 2003 the adoption of a fractional advection dispersion equation deng et al 2004 or the asymptotic treatment of one dimensional solutions from an instantaneous point source hunt 2005 6 conclusions we set a physics based theoretical framework to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient on the basis of the hydro morphodynamic modeling of the flow field and the bed topography that establish in alluvial rivers the rational perturbative framework has been developed on the basis of a suitable scaling of the two dimensional advection diffusion equation and by the introduction of a reference system moving with the contaminant cloud with a velocity that varies according to the river cross sectional geometry this framework provides a clear picture of the processes affecting the spreading of a contaminant in natural streams that can be summarized as follows the longitudinal dispersion dynamics in alluvial rivers is controlled by velocity shear at the banks and secondary circulations driven by centrifugal and topographical effects in particular the helical flow associated to these circulations enhances relatively small and rapidly changing velocity and concentration gradients both in the transverse and in the longitudinal directions which in general lead to an increase of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient nevertheless the planform shapes of meandering channels are usually characterized by relatively small values of the curvature ratio ν implying that the increased transverse mixing also promoted by secondary flows affects the concentration distribution only at higher orders of approximation another consequence of the small values typically attained by ν is the possibility to separate the contribution to shear flow dispersion provided by near bank velocity gradients of the unperturbed straight configuration equation 31 from that induced by streamline curvatures and by the alternating sequence of bars and pools which establishes in the perturbed meandering configuration equation 33 the former contribution can be accounted for analytically for gently sloping channel banks the longitudinal dispersion coefficient averaged over the meander length in order to deal with longitudinal variations of the flow field depends on the relevant bulk hydrodynamic and morphologic dimensionless parameters β dgr τ u λ ν and γ the latter parameter accounting for the ability of cross sectional mixing to adapt to along channel flow changes could lead to a reduction of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the presence of a sequence of relatively short bends eq 61 the comparison with field data obtained from tracer tests indicates that the proposed approach provides robust estimates of the reach averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient the residual scatter can be partly explained by the linearized character of the hydro morphodynamic model used to compute k flow nonlinearities enhancing both transverse mixing and shear flow dispersion induce opposite effects on longitudinal dispersion other possible causes of the departures between predicted and estimated coefficients are associated with the not entirely fickian behavior of the dispersion process whereby the concentration time curves decay more slowly than if they were gaussian

856,the fate and transport of soluble contaminants released in natural streams are strongly dependent on the spatial variations of the flow field and of the bed topography these variations are essentially related to the presence of the channel banks and to the planform configuration of the channel large velocity gradients arise near to the channel banks where the flow depth decreases to zero moreover single thread alluvial rivers are seldom straight and usually exhibit meandering planforms and a bed topography that deviates from the plane configuration channel axis curvature and movable bed deformations drive secondary helical currents which enhance both cross sectional velocity gradients and transverse mixing thus crucially influencing longitudinal dispersion the present contribution sets up a rational framework which assuming mild sloping banks and taking advantage of the weakly meandering character often exhibited by natural streams leads to an analytical estimate of the contribution to longitudinal dispersion associated with spatial non uniformities of the flow field the resulting relationship stems from a physics based modeling of the flow in natural rivers and expresses the bend averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient as a function of the relevant hydraulic and morphologic parameters the treatment of the problem is river specific since it relies on an explicit spatial description although linearized of the flow field that establishes in the investigated river comparison with field data available from tracer tests supports the robustness of the

soluble pollutants is a fundamental issue for the efficient management of riverine environments rapidly varying inputs of contaminants such as those associated with accidental spills of toxic chemicals and intermittent discharge from combined sewer overflows as well as temperature variations produced by thermal outflows generate a cloud that spreads longitudinally affecting the fate of the pollutant the classical treatment of longitudinal transport in turbulent flows relies on the study put forward by taylor 1954 for pipe flows and extended to natural channels by fischer 1967 taylor s analysis indicates that far enough from the source in the so called equilibrium region the cross sectionally averaged tracer concentration c satisfies a one dimensional advection diffusion equation embodying a balance between lateral mixing and nonuniform shear flow advection fickian dispersion model under the hypothesis that the velocity field is statistically steady and the investigated channel reach is geometrically homogeneous and extends far inside the equilibrium region the advection diffusion equation prescribes that the variance of c in the along stream direction s increases linearly with time and any skewness introduced by velocity shear close to the contaminant source i e in the advective zone or by the initial distribution of contaminant begins to slowly decay eventually leading at any instant to a gaussian distribution of c s chatwin and allen 1985 the coefficient of apparent diffusivity k governing this behavior usually denoted as dispersion coefficient is much greater than the coefficient for longitudinal diffusion by turbulence alone many engineering and environmental problems concerning the fate and transport of pollutants and nutrients are tackled resorting to the one dimensional advection diffusion approach botter and rinaldo 2003 revelli and ridolfi 2002 rinaldo et al 1991 schnoor 1996 wallis 1994 and therefore require a suitable specification of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient k also within the context of much more refined models developed to account for the formation of steep concentration fronts and elongated tails caused by storage and delayed release of pollutant in dead zones see among many others bencala and walters 1983 czernuszenko et al 1998 and bear and young 1983 a reliable estimate of longitudinal dispersion in the main stream quantified by k is fundamental to properly account for chemical and biological processes acting in different channel regions lees et al 2000 several procedures have so far been proposed to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient from either tracer data rutherford 1994 or velocity measurements at a number of cross sections fischer 1967 these approaches are usually expensive and time consuming the lack of experimental data which characterizes many applications as well as the necessity of specifying k when carrying out preliminary calculations has thus stimulated the derivation of various semi empirical and empirical relationships deng et al 2002 2001 disley et al 2015 etamad shahidi and taghipour 2012 fischer 1967 iwasa and aya 1991 kashefipour and falconer 2002 li et al 2013 liu 1977 noori et al 2017 sahay and dutta 2009 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 seo and cheong 1998 shucksmith et al 2011 wang and huai 2016 zeng and huai 2014 which can be cast in the general form 1 k κ 0 β κ 1 c f u κ 2 b u u where β is the ratio of half channel with b to mean flow depth d u cfu is the friction coefficient u u is the mean value of the cross sectionally averaged flow velocity within the reach of interest and κi i 0 1 2 are suitable constants specified in table 1 note that in table 1 we have just reported the main formulas for sake of completeness a wider list of relationships is given in the supplementary information the empirical parameters that are introduced in these relations to address the complexity embedded in the mixing process still make the quantifying of k a challenging task in many cases the proposed predictor provides only a rough estimate and the discrepancy between the predicted values of k and those determined from tracer tests is quite high among the many reasons responsible for this high scatter one may be the prismatic character assumed as the basis of the fickian solution wang and huai 2016 nevertheless natural channels are usually characterized by a complex bed topography which strongly affects the flow field and hence the longitudinal dispersion guymer 1998 but is only roughly accounted for in the various approaches in addition in some cases a suitable tuning of the empirical parameters is needed in order to achieve a good agreement with the experimental data deng et al 2001 many of the existing expressions for predicting the longitudinal dispersion in rivers have been developed by minimizing the error between predicted and measured through tracer tests dispersion coefficients these relations generally differ in terms of the relevant dimensionless groups determined through dimensional analysis and of the optimization technique e g nonlinear multi regression genetic and population based evolutionary algorithms used to calibrate the coefficients of the predictor disley et al 2015 kashefipour and falconer 2002 noori et al 2017 sahay and dutta 2009 seo and cheong 1998 more recently the dataset provided by the dispersion coefficients measured in the field has been used for training and testing artificial neural networks or bayesian networks alizadeh et al 2017 a less few attempts were devoted to derive analytical relationships by substituting in the triple integral ensuing from fischer analysis of shear flow dispersion the flow field that under the uniform flow assumption establishes in stable straight channels deng et al 2001 and in meandering rivers deng et al 2002 in the present contribution we follow this latter approach which has the advantage of being river specific i e to relate the dispersion coefficient to the shear flow dispersion that actually takes place in the river under investigation the improvement with respect to the contributions by deng et al 2001 2002 is essentially related to the morphodynamics based modelling of the flow that establishes in alluvial rivers in the case of straight rivers rather than using the general hydraulic geometry relationship for stable cross sections we propose a specific treatment of the shear flow effects by dividing the cross section into a central flat bed region and two gently sloping banks computing the flow field therein in the case of meandering rivers the flow field outside the boundary layers that form near to the banks is solved explicitly although in a linearised way accounting parametrically for the secondary flow circulations induced by streamline curvatures and computing the bed topography by solving the two dimensional sediment balance equation the aim of the present contribution is thus to develop physics based analytic predictions of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient accounting for the cross sectional morphology occurring in alluvial rivers more specifically we intend to relate the estimates of k to the relevant hydraulic geometric and sedimentologic parameters flow discharge bed slope representative sediment size bank geometry governing the steady flow in an alluvial river first we apply to the flow field which establishes in sinuous movable bed channels the perturbative procedure developed by smith 1983 that accounts for the fast variations of concentration induced across the section by irregularities in channel geometry and the presence of bends this methodology introducing a reference system moving downstream with the contaminant cloud and using a multiple scale perturbation technique allows the derivation of a dispersion equation relating entirely to shear flow dispersion the along channel changes in the cross sectionally averaged concentration next we take advantage of the weakly meandering character of many natural rivers to clearly separate the contributions to longitudinal dispersion provided by the various sources of nonuniformities at the leading order of approximation corresponding to the case of a straight channel we consider the differential advection related to the presence of channel banks solving the flow field by means of a rational perturbation scheme tubino and colombini 1992 at the first order of approximation we introduce the correction to k due to the presence of bends by using the hydro morphodynamic model of frascati and lanzoni 2013 the proposed methodology is finally validated through the comparison with the tracer test data collected in almost straight and in meandering rivers among others we consider the dataset provided by godfrey and frederick 1970 which includes detailed measurements of flow depth longitudinal velocity and the temporal evolution of the tracer concentration at different cross sections as well as estimates of k based on the method of moments these concentration data are here reanalyzed by considering the chatwin s method chatwin 1980 which indicates if and where a fickian model likely applies and the routing method based on the hayami solution rutherford 1994 we anticipate that the proposed framework provides estimates of k that are in reasonable good agreement with the values computed from tracer tests the paper is organized as follows the mathematical problem is formulated in section 2 with particular emphasis on the typical temporal and spatial scales which allow to set up a rational perturbative framework and eventually determine the overall structure of the dispersion coefficient in alluvial channels the analytical solutions of the depth averaged flow field used to compute k are described in section 3 the comparison with available field data is reported in section 4 while section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the results finally section 6 summarizes the concluding remarks 2 formulation of the problem we consider the behavior of a passive non reactive contaminant which e g due to an accidental spill is suddenly released in an alluvial channel with a compact cross section and in general a meandering planform the river cross section bed is assumed to vary slowly in the transverse direction as the banks are approached this assumption allows for solving the flow field by adopting a closure model of turbulence in which the turbulent viscosity ν t is a function of the local flow condition see section 3 1 the channel has fixed banks a constant free surface width 2b a longitudinal mean slope s and conveys a constant discharge q hereafter a star superscript will be used to denote dimensional variables the reach averaged value of the flow depth is d u the corresponding cross section area is a u 2 b d u while the cross sectionally averaged mean velocity is u u q a u the erodible channel bed is assumed to be made up of a uniform cohesionless sediment with grain size d g r density ρs and immersed relative density δ ρ s ρ ρ with ρ the water density moreover we denote by β b d u the half width to depth ratio u f u g d u s 1 2 the friction velocity with g the gravitational constant and c f u u f u u u 2 the friction coefficient these two latter quantities are influenced by the bed configuration which can be either plane or covered by bedforms such as ripples and dunes depending on the dimensionless grain size d g r d g r d u and the shields parameter τ u u f u 2 δ g d g r 2 1 the 2 d dimensionless advection diffusion equation the problem can be conveniently studied introducing the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate system s n z shown in fig 1 a where s is the longitudinal curvilinear coordinate coinciding with the channel axis n is the horizontal coordinate normal to s and z is the upward directed axis the two dimensional advection diffusion equation for the depth

longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity and k s and k n are longitudinal and transverse mixing coefficients which account for the combined effect of vertical variations of velocity and turbulent diffusion moreover hs is a metric coefficient arising from the curvilinear character of the longitudinal coordinate defined as 3 h s 1 n r 1 ν n c where r s is the local radius of curvature of the channel axis assumed to be positive when the center of curvature lies along the negative n axis ν b r 0 is the curvature ratio n n b is the dimensionless transverse coordinate c r 0 r is the dimensionless channel curvature and r 0 is twice the minimum value of r within the meandering reach in meandering channels the cross sectionally averaged concentration undergoes relatively small and rapidly changing gradients associated with the spatial variations of the flow field along the bends and a slower evolution due to longitudinal dispersion in order to deal with the fast concentration changes acting at the meander scale it proves convenient to introduce a pseudo lagrangian volume following coordinate ξ which travels downstream with the contaminant cloud and accounts for the fact that the cross sectionally averaged velocity q a is not constant along the channel smith 1983 this coordinate is defined as 4 ξ 1 a u 0 s a d s u u t where the integral on the right side is the water volume from the origin of the coordinate system to the generic coordinate s while 5 a b b d d n a b b h s d d n clearly a and a can vary along s as a consequence of the variations of section geometry induced by the bed topography that establishes in the meandering channel the derivation chain rule implies that 6 s s a ξ t t u u ξ where a a a u consequently for an observer moving with velocity u u i e with the advected pollutant cloud the dilution of the concentration associated with longitudinal dispersion is accounted for by the coordinate ξ and occurs at a length scale comparable with the length of the contaminant cloud l c it then results that c c s n ξ t and eq 2 can be rewritten as 7 d u c s h s d v c n n k n h s d c n d h s u u a u c ξ h s d c t s k s d h s c s a k s d h s c ξ a ξ

processes longitudinal dispersion differential advection and transverse mixing that govern the concentration dynamics of the pollutant cloud in order to ensure that they are well separated fischer 1967 smith 1983 we introduce the small parameter 10 ϵ k n u b u u and recall the relationships usually adopted to predict the transverse and longitudinal mixing coefficients k n u and k u the rate of transverse mixing is determined by turbulent diffusion quantified by the depth averaged transverse eddy diffusivity e t and vertical variations in the transverse velocity quantified by the transverse

rutherford 1994 on the other hand for large rivers the transverse dispersion coefficient kt has been related to the mean flow velocity and the channel width through a relation of the form smeithlov

channel section this result implies that the three time scales are well separated i e t 0 t 1 t 2 in other words the longitudinal dispersion operates on a timescale much slower than the timescale characterizing transverse mixing which in turn is much faster than nonuniform advection fischer 1967 smith 1983 the derivation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient takes advantage of the small character of the parameter ϵ ensuring the separation of the three timescales substituting the dimensionless variables 8 and 9 into eq 7 we obtain 14 l c ϵ d h s a u c ξ ϵ 2 h s d c t ϵ 2 γ s ϵ a ξ γ ϵ

spatial variations of c associated with longitudinal dispersion at the scale of the contaminant cloud are described by the slow variable ξ whereas the comparatively small and rapidly changing variations in concentration across the flow associated with stream meandering are accounted for through the fast variables s n the parameter γ describes the relative importance of transverse mixing which tends to homogenize the contaminant concentration and nonuniform transport at the bend scale which on the contrary enhances concentration gradients it is readily observed that γ ϵ 1 λ 2 π where the dimensionless meander wavenumber λ 2 π b l typically ranges between 0 1 and 0 3 leopold et al 1964 the product γϵ then turns out of order o 10 2 and hence gives rise to higher order terms in the

hence it is not affected by the fluctuations induced by flow meandering eq 18 suggests a solution of the form c 1 g 1 s n c 0 ξ with g 1 a function describing the nonuniform distribution across the section of the contaminant concentration similarly eq 19 indicates that c 2 g 2 s n 2 c 0 ξ 2 the depth averaged concentration then results 21 c s n ξ t c 0 ξ t ϵ g 1 s n c 0 ξ ϵ 2 g 2 s n 2 c 0 ξ 2 o

variations of the flow field described by the functions g 1 and g 2 integrating 21 across the section and along a meander the cross sectionally averaged concentration can be approximated as c c 0 o ϵ

that the arbitrary constant embedded in gi does not actually depend on s we are now ready to derive the advection diffusion equation governing the evolution of the cross sectionally averaged concentration c and the related longitudinal dispersion coefficient we sum together eqs 18 and 19 integrated across the section and along a bend and require that the flux of contaminant vanishes i e 1

that g 1 n 0 at the channel banks where the normal component of the contaminant flux vanishes and g 1 0 before proceeding further some observations on the expression 24 are worthwhile in accordance with fischer 1967 the contribution to longitudinal dispersion provided by vertical variations of the velocity profile embodied by the terms of 14 containing ks is of minor importance longitudinal dispersion is essentially governed by shear flow dispersion induced by the nonuniform distribution across the section of both the contaminant concentration accounted for through the function g 1 s n and the flow field quantified by d h s u a this latter term however differs from the much simpler term 1 u that would arise in the classical treatment pursued by fischer 1967 as a consequence of the fact that here the mean flow velocity can in general vary along the channel as accounted for through the volume following coordinate ξ in addition it is important to observe that the bend averaged coefficient k is always positive while in the presence of river reaches characterized by rapid longitudinal variations of the flow field the coefficient k can also attain negative values thus favoring spurious instabilities smith 1983 finally it is useful to relate the local and the bend averaged dispersion coefficients k and k to the local dispersion coefficient d that arises when considering only the fast coordinate s decomposing the concentration c and velocity u as the sum of their cross sectionally averaged values c u plus the corresponding fluctuations c u the classical one dimensional

and consequently k d and k a 2 d 2 3 structure of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in meandering channels natural channels are seldom straight in the general case of a meandering planform configuration the problem can be faced by taking advantage of the fact that the curvature ratio ν appearing in 3 is typically a small parameter ranging in the interval 0 1 0 2 leopold et al 1964 this evidence is widely used to describe the flow field in meandering channels seminara 2006 and to model their long term evolution frascati and lanzoni 2010 2013 it implies that the flow field and the bed topography of a meandering channel can be determined by studying the relatively small perturbations associated with deviations from a straight channel configuration we then introduce the expansions 28 u s n d s n a s u 0 n d 0 n 1 ν u 1 s n d 1 s n a 1 s ν 2 u 2 s n d 2 s n a 2 s o ν 3 where the unperturbed o ν 0 state corresponds to a straight channel similarly we expand in terms of ν the function g 1 and the dimensionless transverse mixing coefficient kn 29 k n s n g 1 s n k n 0 n g 10 n ν k n 1 s n g 11 s n o ν 2 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in meandering channels is determined by substituting 28 and 29 into 24 and recalling 3 we obtain 30 k k 0 ν k 1 ν 2 k 2 o ν 3 where 31 k 0 1 2 1 1 1 u 0 d 0 g 10 d n 32 k 1 1 2 1 1 1 u 0 d 0 g 11 d 1 g 10 d n 1 2 1 1 n c u 1 u 0 a 1 d 0 g

contribution k 0 corresponds to the classical solution obtained by fischer 1967 it accounts for dispersion effects which arise in a straight uniform flow as a consequence of the transverse gradients experienced by u 0 and the concentration distribution in the bank regions fig 1 note that neglecting these effects is equivalent to set u 0 d 0 1 such that k 0 0 it is also easy to demonstrate that the o ν correction k 1 is identically zero indeed a 1 0 and the various integrals involve products of even 1 u 0 d 0 g 10 and odd d 1 u 1 g 11 n functions that integrated across a symmetrical section yield a zero contribution finally the o ν 2 term k 2 includes the effects of the near bank velocity and concentration gradients mainly represented by the first integral on the right hand side of eq 33 and those due to the complex structure of the flow field the bed topography and the spatial distribution of the concentration induced by the meandering stream the former contribution to k 2 is likely of minor importance when dealing with wide and shallow sections i e with large β as often occurs in alluvial rivers and in the following will be neglected in order to keep the model at the lower level of complexity in fact as it will be seen in the next section the solution of the flow field in a meandering channel is available in closed form only by neglecting the boundary layers that form near to the banks frascati and lanzoni 2013 the functions g 1i s n i 0 1 that describe the cross sectional distribution of c are obtained by solving the partial differential equations that arise by substituting from 28 and 29 into 25 they read 34 γ d 0 u 0 g 1 i s n d 0 k n 0 g 1 i n f 1 i s n i 0 1 and are subject the constraints that g 1 i n 0 at the walls and 35 1 1 d 0 g 1 i d n b 1 i w i t

is in general given by the sum of a homogeneous solution common to any order of approximation and a particular solution related to the forcing term f 1i the homogeneous solution can be written in term of fourier series and generally depends on the transverse distribution of concentration at the injection section however in the case of a sudden release of contaminant treated here it tends to decrease exponentially with the coordinate s and hence vanishes far downstream of the input section smith 1983 this condition is equivalent to impose that the o ϵ and o ϵ2 pollutant fluxes vanish 1 1 d u g i d n 0 for i 1 2 as required in the derivation of eq 23 finally note that for the uniform flow in a straight channel the along channel gradient of g 10 is identically zero and 34 yields the classical relation fischer 1967 1973 rutherford 1994 38 g 10 n 1 n 1 d 0 k n 0 1 n 1 d 0 u 0 1 d n 2 d n 1 α 0 where the constant α 0 allows g 10 to satisfy the integral condition 35 but does not give any contribution to k 0 3 depth averaged flow field in alluvial channels the characteristics of the steady flow that establishes in alluvial channels are determined by the form of the cross section and the planform configuration of the channel the governing two dimensional equations of mass and momentum conservation are in general obtained by depth averaging the corresponding three dimensional equations and by accounting for the dynamic effects of secondary flows induced by curvature and of the boundary layers that form near to the channel banks the complexity of the problem prevents the derivation of general solutions in closed form also numerical solutions are non straightforward owing to the difficulty of modeling secondary circulations bolla pittaluga and seminara 2011 however the governing equations can be linearized in the presence of gently sloping channel banks and meandering channels with wide and long bends such that the flow field can be solved by perturbing the uniform flow solution in terms of two small parameters δ and ν we resort just to these solutions which have the pratical advantage to explicitily account although in a simplified form for the effects exerted on the base flow field by the bank shape and the channel axis curvature we then estimate analytically the longitudinal dispersion coefficient through 31 and 33 in the following we first derive the cross sectional distribution of the longitudinal velocity u 0 in a straight channel with gently sloping banks small δ next we briefly recall the structure of u 1 in wide and long meander bends small ν with either an arbitrary or a regular distribution of the channel axis curvature 3 1 straight channels the uniform turbulent flow field that establishes throughout a cross section of a straight channel can be conveniently studied introducing the local orthogonal coordinate system s σ ζ where s is the longitudinal in this case straight coordinate directed downstream σ is the transverse curvilinear coordinate aligned along the cross section profile with origin at the channel axis and ζ is the coordinate normal to the bed pointing upward see fig 1c the curvilinear nature of σ is accounted for through the metric coefficient 39 h σ 1 ζ cos φ 2 d 0 σ 2 cos φ 1 d 0 σ 2 with d 0 σ the local value of the flow depth φ the angle that the vertical forms with ζ and d z d 0 cos φ the flow depth measured normally to the bed fig 1 the uniform character of the flow implies that on average the flow characteristics do not vary in time and along the direction s hence denoting by u σ ζ the corresponding component of the velocity the longitudinal momentum equation averaged over the turbulence reads appendix a 40 s h σ g σ ν t h σ u σ ζ ν t h σ u ζ 0 where ν t is the eddy viscosity used to express the turbulent reynolds stresses through the boussinesq eddy viscosity approximation in general the channel cross section is assumed to consists of fig 1c i a central region of width 2 b c and constant depth depth d c and ii two bank regions each one characterized by a width b b c and wetted perimeter p 0 in natural channels the flow depth is usually much smaller than the wetted perimeter and consequently the dimensionless parameter 41 δ d u p 0 b c is small we will take advantage of this for solving eq 40 to this aim we introduce the scaling 42 ζ ζ d z σ σ σ p 0 b c d 0 d 0 d u u u u fu 43 ν t ν t d u u fu u f u f u fu where u f g d 0 s 1 2 is the local value of the friction velocity related to the local bed shear stress τ b by the relation u f τ b ρ 1 2 note that having normalized ζ with d z it turns out that 44 ζ 1 d z ζ σ 1 p 0 b c σ ζ f 1 ζ with 45 f 1 1 d 0 d 0 σ 1 δ 2 d 0 2 d 0 σ 2 1 δ 2 d 0 σ 2 substituting 42 and 43 into 40 the dimensionless longitudinal

bed do not intersect each other it is possible to express the dimensionless eddy viscosity νt as 47 ν t ζ u f d z n ζ the simplest model for the function n ζ is that introduced by engelund 1974 whereby n 1 13 in the following we will adopt this scheme which allows for an analytical solution of the problem and as shown by tubino and colombini 1992 leads to results that agree both qualitatively and quantitatively with those obtained with a more accurate model for the function n ζ under the assumption of a constant n a slip condition has to be imposed at the bed such that 48 u ζ

see appendix a integrating u along the normal ζ to the bed the local value u 0 σ of the depth averaged longitudinal velocity results 51 u 0 u 00 δ 2 u 01 o δ 4 where u 00 is a function of the local flow depth d 0 σ and the relative grain roughness dgr while u 01 depends also on d 0 σ i e the local slope and 2 d 0 σ 2 appendix a the cross sectional distribution of u 0 needed to compute the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is then determined by specifying the relative bed roughness dgr and more importantly the across section distribution of the flow depth d 0 σ in the absence of experimental data we need to describe the bank geometry here we propose to handle empirically the problem assuming a transverse distribution of the flow depth of the form 52 d 0 σ d c e r f β f 1 σ σ 1 1 with βf a shape parameter measuring the steepness of the banks note that according to 52 erf βf should be equal to 1 in order to ensure that d 0 0 d c the latter requirement is fulfilled only asymptotically for βf tending to infinity for this reason in the following we will consider only values of β f e r f 1 0 999 2 32675 corresponding to d c d 0 0 0 999 d c note also that βf is related to the parameter δβc through the relation 53 δ β c 1 e r f 1 0 999 β f 2 where β c b c d u and having assumed d 0 b c 0 999 d c as βf increases also δβc increases resulting in progressively steeper cross sections fig 2 a note that increasing values of δ imply higher bank slopes in the limit of β f 2 32675 it results δβc 0 corresponding to b c 0 no central region while as βf the classical rectangular cross sectional configuration p 0 0 is recovered fig 2a interestingly the distributions of u f1 σ shown in fig 2b indicate an increase of the friction velocity uf with respect to the uniform flow in the steeper portion of the bank and a corresponding decrease in the part of the bank adjacent to the central region this trend due to the longitudinal momentum transfer from the center of the cross section where flow velocities are higher to the banks implies that the channel can transport sediments even though the bank toes are stable note also that u f1 σ vanishes towards the center of the cross section where the bottom is flat and at the outer bank boundary where d 0 tends to zero 3 2 meandering channels the flow field that takes place in a meandering channel with a compact cross section is strictly related to the secondary flow circulations driven by the curvature of streamlines and the deformation of the channel bed which generally exhibits larger scours in the correspondence of the outer bank of a bend seminara 2006 although numerical models have the advantage to overcome the restrictions affecting theoretical analyses e g linearity or weak non linearity simplified geometry they still require a large computational effort to correctly include the effects of secondary helical flow and to reproduce the bed topography of movable bed channels bolla pittaluga and seminara 2011 eke et al 2014 that is why linearized models have been widely adopted to investigate the physics of river meandering seminara 2006 the long term evolution of alluvial rivers bogoni et al 2017 frascati and lanzoni 2009 howard 1992 and the possible existence of a scale invariant behavior frascati and lanzoni 2010 these models owing to their analytical character not only provide insight on the basic mechanisms operating in the process under investigation but also allow to develop relatively simple engineering tools which can be profitably used for practical purposes in the following we refer to the linearized hydro morphodynamic model developed by frascati and lanzoni 2013 that in the most general case can manage also mild along channel variations of the cross section width the model is based on the two dimensional depth averaged shallow water equations written in the curvilinear coordinates s n and owing to the large aspect ratio β usually observed in natural rivers neglects the presence of the near bank boundary layers the flow equations ensuring the conservation of mass and momentum and embedding a suitable parametrization of the secondary flow circulations are coupled with the two dimensional sediment balance equation complemented with the relation describing the rate of sediment transport the solution of the resulting set of partial differential equations takes advantage of the fact that in natural channels the curvature ratio ν is small ranging in the interval 0 1 0 2 and assume that flow and topography perturbations originating from deviations of the channel planform from the straight one are small enough to allow for linearization in the case of a constant width rectangular section for which d c d u the dimensionless flow

its derivation and implementation while all the coefficients needed to compute u 1 and d 1 are reported in the supplementary information it is worthwhile to note that the relevant dimensionless parameters geometric hydraulic and sedimentological needed as input data to the model are the width to depth ratio β the dimensionless grain size dgr and the shields parameter for the uniform flow conditions τ u the expressions 54 are used to compute the forcing term f 11 needed to solve the boundary value problem 34 for g 11 note that by substituting 54 into 38 yields g 10 0 owing to the neglecting of bank effects the particular solution of 34 is obtained by writing the forcing term as f 11 p s q n i e separating the variables through fourier series and by introducing the appropriate green function morse and feshbach 1953 we obtain 57 g 11 s n 1 γ m 0 1 m 1 cos μ 2 m 1 n 1 0 s s 0 p m s χ e μ 2 m 1 2 χ γ d χ where μ m m π 2 58 p m s 2 m c 2 1 m c s u c m s and s 0 denotes the position of the injection section by assumption the length scale over which the contaminant cloud has evolved l c is well in excess of the transverse mixing distance u 0 b 2 k n consequently the position s 0 of the injection section can be set arbitrarily far upstream taking s 0 physically this is equivalent to assume that the solution depends only on values of p s χ upstream of s over a diffusion length scale indeed the integral with respect to the dummy variable χ decays as exp μ m 2 χ γ and hence depends on the values of p closest to s the solution 57 is in general valid for an arbitrary although slowly varying spatial distribution of the channel axis curvature it takes a particularly simple form in the schematic case of a regular sequence of meanders with the axis curvature described by the sine generated curve c s e 2 π ı s c c leopold et al 1964 where i is the imaginary unit and c c denotes complex conjugate in this case the flow field reads blondeaux and seminara 1985

conjugate 4 comparison with tracer field data 4 1 the considered dataset in order to test the validity of the proposed theory we need information not only on the dispersion coefficient and the average hydrodynamic properties of the considered river reach but also on the planform shape of the channel on the geometry of the cross sections and possibly on the cross sectional velocity distribution despite the numerous tracer experiments carried out on river dispersion mcquivey and keefer 1974 nordin and sabol 1974 seo and cheong 1998 yotsukura et al 1970 only a few report also this type of information in particular the data collected by godfrey and frederick 1970 include the time distribution of the local tracer concentration c at a number of monitoring sections and the cross section distributions of the flow depth d n and of the vertical profiles of the longitudinal velocity u n z this dataset therefore provides all the information needed to assess the robustness of the present modeling framework in each test a radiotracer gold 198 was injected in a line source across the stream about 15 ml of the tracer a highly concentrated solution of gold chloride in nitric and hydrochloric acid was diluted to a volume of 2 l the injection was made at a uniform rate over a 1 min period the concentration of radionuclide used in each test was proportional to the discharge about 2 6 gbq m 3 s 1 the concentrations near to the stream centerline were observed by a scintillation detector the resolving time for the entire system was found to be 50 s the error due to the resolving time was about 5 10 among the five river reaches considered by godfrey and frederick 1970 three exhibit almost straight planforms the copper creek below gage near gate city va the clinch river above gage hereafter clinch river a g near clinchport va and the clinch river below gage hereafter clinch river b g near speers ferry va the other two river reaches the powell river near sedville tenn and the copper creek above gage near gate city va have meandering planforms this data set has been integrated with the estimates of k obtained from tracer tests carried out in other five straight streams and eight meandering rivers namely the queich sulzbach and kaltenbach rivers noss and lorke 2016 the ohio muskegon st clair and red cedar rivers shen et al 2010 the green duwamish river fischer 1968 the missouri river yotsukura et al 1970 the lesser slave river beltaos and day 1978 and the miljacka river dobran 1982 fig 3 shows the planform configurations of the investigated reaches extracted from topographic maps while the geometrical hydraulic and sedimentologic parameters of each stream are reported in table 2 in particular the curvature ratio ν and the wavenumber λ have been determined from the spatial distribution of channel axis curvature through the automatic extraction procedure described by marani et al 2002 the mean grain size estimates have been obtained on the basis of information available from literature beltaos and day 1978 godfrey and frederick 1970 yotsukura et al 1970 from the usgs national water information system http www waterdata usgs gov nwis or from direct inspection dobran 2007 personal communication in addition to real meandering stream data table 2 reports the laboratory data characterizing the longitudinal dispersion experiment carried out by boxall and guymer 2007 in a flume with a sine generated meandering planform and a sand bed that was artificially fixed by chemical hardening after the initially uniform trapezoidal cross section was shaped by the flow for a given test i we used the data collected by godfrey and frederick 1970 to compute at each monitored cross section j the area a i j and the total wetted perimeter p i j we then used the cross sectional velocity data u i j n z to compute the depth averaged velocity u i j n and the flow discharge q i j all the relevant quantities deduced from the experimental dataset are collected in table 2 reported in the supplementary information in particular the values of the mean slope are those provided directly by godfrey and frederick 1970 while the friction velocities have been estimated under the hypothesis of a locally uniform flow field the dispersion coefficients by godfrey and frederick 1970 have been obtained by applying the method of moments however the presence of a relatively long tail in the temporal distribution of the concentration fig 4 a and the sensitivity of small concentrations to measurement errors limit the accuracy of this method rutherford 1994 for this reason we have recalculated the dispersion coefficients by considering the chatwin s method chatwin 1980 which has also the advantage to give an indication whether a monitoring section is located or not whitin the equilibrium region where a fickian dispersion model can be applied fig 4b shows an example of the application of the method to the tracer data collected in the clinch creeek test t10 the chatwin method introduces the transformed variable c t defined as 62 c t ln c m a x t m a x c t where c c s j t is the temporal distribution of the cross sectionally averaged concentration measured the at jth cross section cmax is the corresponding peak concentration t m a x is the peaking time and the and signs apply for t t m a x and t t m a x respectively in the transformed plane c t a temporal distribution of tracer concentration following a gaussian behavior should plot as a straight line the slope 0 5 q a j k j and the intercept 0 5 s j k j of this line allow one to estimate the dispersion coefficient k j and the cross sectionally averaged velocity q a j the data suggest that for all the sections only the rising limb and the near peak region of the concentration time distribution are approximately linear and hence can be described by a gaussian distribution conversely a departure from the linear trend is evident in the correspondence of the tails indicating a deviation from the fickian behavior the values of k j estimated by considering the linear part of c t for all the data collected by godfrey and frederick 1970 turn out invariably smaller than those calculated according to the method of moments see table 3 of the supplementary information in order to assess the sensitivity of these estimates to the method used to derive them we applied also the routing method based on the hayami solution rutherford 1994 this method provided that the dynamics of the cross sectionally averaged concentration is gaussian takes advantage of the superimposition of effects to determine the temporal distribution of c in a section given the local values of u k and the concentration time curve in an upstream section the resulting solution has the advantage that it can be used to route downstream a given temporal distribution of concentration without invoking the frozen cloud approximation in fact for moderately large values of s and t it gives a concentration profile similar to that provided by the classical taylor solution for all the monitored sections except the first one it is thus possible to estimate the values of u and k which ensure the best agreement between the measured and predicted concentration profiles fig 5 shows the results of the application of the chatwin and hayami methods in some cases the hayami method tends to yield larger values of k possible reasons of this behaviour are the poor fitting of the routed solutions and the significance of the tail due to the entrapment and retarded release of the tracer into dead zones absorption on sediment surfaces hyporheic fluxes nevertheless the most significant differences between the two approaches generally occur in sections where the estimate deviates significantly longer error bars in fig 5a from the average value in the considered river reach i e where the dynamic of the tracer cloud is likely influenced by some localised effects such as irregularities along the channel sides or the channel bed determining the retention of a certain amount of tracer on the other hand the average velocity estimated with the two methods are very similar fig 5b in the following we will consider the estimates of the dispersion coefficients provided by the chatwin method when referring to the measured values of k 4 2 comparison with straight river dispersion data before pursuing a comparison between observed and predicted dispersion coefficients it is worthwhile to test the reliability of the flow field model described in section 3 1 fig 6 shows the cross sectional distribution of the flow depth left panels and depth averaged velocity right panels measured by godfrey and frederick 1970 in six locations along the clinch river b g test t10 the theoretically predicted velocities shown in fig 6 have been obtained either by introducing into equation 51 the observed flow depth or by considering the simplified cross sectional geometry described by eq 52 and selecting the value of βf which better interpolates the measured depth profile the agreement between measured and computed velocity distributions is in general reasonably good correlation coefficient r u 2 0 81 the comparison between the estimates of k obtained from the tracer data of godfrey and frederick 1970 and those predicted by inserting in eq 31 the flow field described by eq 51 are shown in fig 7 a this figure also shows in white squares a comparison between the predicted dispersion coefficients and those estimated from measurements by noss and lorke 2016 and shen et al 2010 for the queich sulzbach kaltenbach and muskegon rivers the theoretical estimates are reasonably good with about 70 of predictions ensuring an error smaller than 30 dotted lines in fig 7a overall the model tends to underestimate the dispersion coefficient for the larger values of k which usually occur in the most distant sections from the injection where the measured concentration profiles are particularly flat in any case the present estimates of k are definitely more accurate than those provided by other predictors available in literature fig 7c as documented by the values of the discrepancy ratio d r l o g k p r e d k m e a s plotted in fig 7b and d to give a visual perception of the goodness of the different models fig 7 shows the data relative to the models displaying the best smaller mean discrepancy ratio and worst larger mean discrepancy ratio performance according to table 1 a figure reporting the predictions of all models is provided in the supplementary information note that the coefficient κ 0 of the formula proposed by deng et al 2001 and reported in table 1 has been here reduced by 1 15 indeed this coefficient was originally determined by introducing a multiplicative empirical constant ψ 15 according to deng et al 2001 in order to achieve a better agreement with the observed dispersion coefficients these coefficients at least in the specific case of the data provided by godfrey and frederick 1970 were calculated through the method of moments that as discussed above tends to overestimate k with respect to the chatwin or the routing methods nevertheless even by reducing the value of κ 0 the predictions of k obtained from the formula by deng et al 2001 are significantly less accurate mean discrepancy ratio d r 0 63 than those resulting from the present theoretical approach d r 0 19 even worse results are attained when considering other predictors see table 1 it is important to stress that the present methodology being physics based does not need the introduction of any fitting parameter the input data are simply the flow discharge the free surface channel width the longitudinal slope the friction velocity strictly associated with the sediment grain size and the type of bed configuration i e plane or dune covered and the cross sectional distribution of the flow depth or alternatively its simplified analytical description eq 52 finally we observe that including the higher order effects that the presence of the channel banks exert on the transverse gradient of u 0 associated to the o δ 2 contribution in eq 51 always leads to improve the estimate of k d r 0 190 instead of 0 188 4 3 comparison with meandering river dispersion data in the case of meandering streams besides q b s u f u additional input information to the present model is the spatial distribution of channel axis curvature these data are used to determine the dimensionless parameters β τ u dgr ν as well as the along channel distribution of the channel axis curvature c s needed to compute the flow field through eqs 55 the expressions of u 1 s n and d 1 s n are then employed to compute f 11 and to solve the problem 34 for g 11 and ultimately to obtain the o ν 2 correction 33 to the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in order to test the reliability of the flow field model described in section 3 2 a comparison with the flow depths left panels and depth averaged velocities right panels measured by boxall and guymer 2007 at the apex and the cross over sections of an experimental meandering channel is reported in fig 8 the theoretically predicted velocities have also been compared with the velocity profiles calculated according to smith 1983 for the theoretical flow depth distributions continuos lines on the left panels 63 u d 0 5 u u d u h u where h u is the cross sectional average of d 1 5 the cross sectional shapes predicted by the present model reproduce correctly r d 2 0 90 the topography variations induced by alternating bends possible departures being related to the presence of bedforms not accounted for in the model the overall comparison appears reasonably good also in terms of depth integrated longitudinal velocities r u 2 0 93 and the theoretically predicted profiles yield a better performance with respect to those calculated according to the approximate method proposed by smith 1983 r u 2 0 91 fig 9 a shows the comparison between the bend averaged values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient estimated from the measures carried out by godfrey and frederick 1970 in the copper creek and in the powell river and those predicted by either the leading term k 0 eq 31 entailing a straight channel or by considering also the correction ν 2 k 2 eq 33 accounting for the presence of river bends this correction turns out to pick up the right order of magnitude and on the whole ensures a degree of accuracy greater than that attained when neglecting curvature effects d r 0 32 instead of d r 0 76 as expected when treating the river as straight the predicted values of k 0 are systematically lower than those observed in the field in is worthwhile to note that the points corresponding to cross sections t3 s1 t3 s2 and t4 s1 for which the theory tends in any case to overestimate k are quite close to the injection section and therefore likely fall outside the zone where a fickian dispersion model holds the ability of the present theoretical framework to give robust estimates of k is confirmed by fig 9b reporting the predicted values of k against those resulting from the tracer test data for all the considered meandering streams on the whole the effect of the curvature is to slightly improve the degree of accuracy d r 0 22 instead of 0 29 although sometimes the theoretical coefficients turn out to be lower than those observed in the field this can be partly explained with the fact that the predicted o ν 2 correction does not account for the near bank velocity gradients associated with the presence of a boundary layer and has been obtained on the basis of a linearized treatment of the flow field which tends to underestimate the intensity of both secondary circulations and transverse bed deformations forced by the meandering stream clearly a number of other processes act in the field to make dispersion not entirely fickian contributing to the data scatter we return later on this issue finally note that for the considered set of rivers the results remain basically unaltered dr 0 225 instead of 0 22 when instead of considering the observed spatially varying curvature signal we consider a sequence of regular meanders with maximum curvature equal to the inverse of the mean minimum radius of curvature within the river reach 5 discussion the rational perturbative framework developed in the previous sections based on a suitable scaling of the two dimensional advection diffusion equation and on the introduction of a reference system traveling downstream with the contaminant cloud and accounting for the along channel variability of the cross sectionally averaged velocity provides a clear picture of the processes affecting the spreading of a contaminant in alluvial rivers the velocity gradients that characterize the near bank regions of natural streams where the flow depth progressively vanishes influence the longitudinal dispersion at the leading order of approximation equation 31 corresponding to a straight channel planform secondary circulations driven by centrifugal and topographical effects typical of meandering channels provide a second order correction equation 33 the presence of a secondary helical flow enhances transverse velocity gradients which in turn tend to increase the longitudinal dispersion coefficient on the contrary the increased transverse mixing promoted by secondary currents e g boxall et al 2003 would lead to a reduction of longitudinal dispersion this behavior is summarized in the analytical relation 61 obtained by considering a regular sequence of sine generated bends bend effects are explicitly accounted for through the dependence on ν 2 while the characteristics of the flow field and the bottom topography affect the coefficients bm moreover as observed by fischer 1969 and smith 1983 the ratio γ of cross sectional mixing timescale to longitudinal advection timescale accounts for the frequency of alternating bends along the meandering reach in the case of long enough bends i e such that γ is much smaller than 1 the term 2πγ 2 at the denominator of 61 can be neglected with respect to m 4 on the contrary if γ increases k tends to decrease this is the case of short bends for which the changes in the flow field associated with alternating curves are too fast to allow cross sectional mixing to eliminate concentration gradients fig 10 shows two typical examples of the variations of k as a function of the aspect ratio β for either plane fig 10a or dune covered bed fig 10b in both cases for given values of the dimensionless parameters ν dgr and γ the bend averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases with the shields parameter τ u on the other hand for a given τ u the values of k corresponding to quite different dimensionless grain sizes dgr exhibit a relatively narrow range of variations as shown in fig 10c finally fig 10d demonstrates that k tends to increase significantly when approaching the resonant conditions see e g lanzoni and seminara 2006 nevertheless it must be recalled that the meandering flow field in a neighborhood of the resonant state cannot be described by the linear model adopted here but it would require a weakly nonlinear approach in general the linearized treatment of the flow field set as the basis of the present theoretical framework holds for relatively wide bends small ν long enough meanders to ensure slow longitudinal variations of the flow field small λ small intensity of the centrifugally driven secondary flow a condition met for small values of ν β c f u and small amplitude of bed perturbations with respect to the straight configuration small ν τ u c f u and λ β τ u bolla pittaluga and seminara 2011 frascati and lanzoni 2013 these intrinsic limitation of the theory can partly explain the deviations of the predicted dispersion coefficients from the values estimated from tracer test data other physical processes however concur to the scatter of data the bed configuration predicted by the considered hydro morphodynamic model stems from the imposed flow discharge corresponding to that actually observed during the tracer tests nevertheless this discharge can differ from the formative discharge producing the actual river bed configuration the presence of regulation works and human activities e g sediment mining dredging can modify the bed topography and consequently the structure of the flow field controlling shear flow dispersion finally the presence of bedforms width variations islands and dead zones concurs to a non perfectly fickian behavior enhancing the rate of dispersion and causing the long tails usually observed in concentration time curves the gaussian solution resulting from a fickian approach to dispersion can then be used to describe only the upper portion of the concentration time curves as indicated by the tracer data plotted using chatwin s transformation other approaches are needed to fit entirely these curves such as the transient storage model that accounts for the effects of temporary entrapment and subsequent re entrainment of pollutants cheong and seo 2003 the adoption of a fractional advection dispersion equation deng et al 2004 or the asymptotic treatment of one dimensional solutions from an instantaneous point source hunt 2005 6 conclusions we set a physics based theoretical framework to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient on the basis of the hydro morphodynamic modeling of the flow field and the bed topography that establish in alluvial rivers the rational perturbative framework has been developed on the basis of a suitable scaling of the two dimensional advection diffusion equation and by the introduction of a reference system moving with the contaminant cloud with a velocity that varies according to the river cross sectional geometry this framework provides a clear picture of the processes affecting the spreading of a contaminant in natural streams that can be summarized as follows the longitudinal dispersion dynamics in alluvial rivers is controlled by velocity shear at the banks and secondary circulations driven by centrifugal and topographical effects in particular the helical flow associated to these circulations enhances relatively small and rapidly changing velocity and concentration gradients both in the transverse and in the longitudinal directions which in general lead to an increase of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient nevertheless the planform shapes of meandering channels are usually characterized by relatively small values of the curvature ratio ν implying that the increased transverse mixing also promoted by secondary flows affects the concentration distribution only at higher orders of approximation another consequence of the small values typically attained by ν is the possibility to separate the contribution to shear flow dispersion provided by near bank velocity gradients of the unperturbed straight configuration equation 31 from that induced by streamline curvatures and by the alternating sequence of bars and pools which establishes in the perturbed meandering configuration equation 33 the former contribution can be accounted for analytically for gently sloping channel banks the longitudinal dispersion coefficient averaged over the meander length in order to deal with longitudinal variations of the flow field depends on the relevant bulk hydrodynamic and morphologic dimensionless parameters β dgr τ u λ ν and γ the latter parameter accounting for the ability of cross sectional mixing to adapt to along channel flow changes could lead to a reduction of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the presence of a sequence of relatively short bends eq 61 the comparison with field data obtained from tracer tests indicates that the proposed approach provides robust estimates of the reach averaged longitudinal dispersion coefficient the residual scatter can be partly explained by the linearized character of the hydro morphodynamic model used to compute k flow nonlinearities enhancing both transverse mixing and shear flow dispersion induce opposite effects on longitudinal dispersion other possible causes of the departures between predicted and estimated coefficients are associated with the not entirely fickian behavior of the dispersion process whereby the concentration time curves decay more slowly than if they were gaussian

857,rivers have been trained for centuries by channel narrowing and straightening this caused important damages to their ecosystems particularly around the bank areas we analyze here the possibility to train rivers in a new way by subdividing their channel in main and ecological channel with a longitudinal training wall the effectiveness of longitudinal training walls in achieving this goal and their long term effects on the river morphology have not been thoroughly investigated yet in particular studies that assess the stability of the two parallel channels separated by the training wall are still lacking this work studies the long term morphological developments of river channels subdivided by a longitudinal training wall in the presence of steady alternate bars this type of bars common in alluvial rivers alters the flow field and the sediment transport direction and might affect the stability of the bifurcating system the work comprises both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations delft3d the results show that a system of parallel channels divided by a longitudinal training wall has the tendency to become unstable an important factor is found to be the location of the upstream termination of the longitudinal wall with respect to a neighboring steady bar the relative widths of the two parallel channels separated by the wall and variable discharge do not substantially change the final evolution of the system keywords longitudinal training wall river morphology river bars channel stability delft3d laboratory experiments 1 introduction many low land rivers are used for inland navigation as for instance the waal de vriend 2015 the elbe elbe promotion centre website the thames british marine federation and environment agency 2013 the mississippi army corps of engineers 2011 important plans to improve inland navigation regard the white nile and nile rivers in sudan nepad agency 2013 as well as the me kong river in vietnam mekong river commission 2016 among others these rivers still present long reaches with natural banks and new interventions should be planned in a way to preserve their most important ecological aspects for this reason it is important to study new training techniques that allow for the co existence of navigation with natural banks without affecting flood water levels the creation of a navigation route often includes channel narrowing this results in a deeper river channel and reduces bar formation duró et al 2015 which is good for navigation river are narrowed by constructing series of groynes along both sides of the river as in the rhine havinga et al 2006 and rhone rivers scerri et al 2015 or by bank protection works especially in urban areas as a result bed degradation occurs in the narrowed reach and upstream in the narrowed reach the water depth increases upstream the water depth tends to remain the same as before the intervention but both bed and water levels decrease as shown by jansen et al 1979 bed degradation is amplified by river shortening another frequent intervention aiming at navigation improvement e g spinewine and zech 2008 moreover maintaining the navigation channel during low flow conditions when bars and other sediment deposits obstruct the navigation route often requires dredging which is in some cases accompanied by dumping of dredged sediment in deep areas mosselman et al 2004 sieben 2009 van vuren et al 2015 without dumping sediment extraction results in important incision processes along the entire river course strengthening the effects of the other interventions aimed at navigation route improvement such as channel narrowing and shortening e g visser et al 1999 de vriend 2015 bed and water level degradation affect intakes and the foundations of structures along the river including the groynes and lower groundwater levels with consequences for floodplain vegetation and agriculture in the area adjacent to the river excessive bed degradation can even cause problems to navigation if rock outcrops appear as along the rhine river between cologne and rees frings et al 2014 another problem related to traditional river training is that banks protected by groynes or by revetments lose their natural value this can be observed in many trained rivers for which the restoration of the riverine environment has become a priority e g schoor et al 1999 however at the same time the restored river should have similar or even increased high flow conveyance e g villada arroyave and crosato 2010 to reduce the probability of floods along its course all these issues show the need to define new more sustainable river management strategies rijke et al 2012 in this paper we study the possibility of obtaining a stable navigation channel minimizing river ecosystem degradation without affecting flood water levels the idea is to create two parallel channels one for navigation and one for ecology which may have the same width or different widths by means of a longitudinal wall the system of parallel channels separated by a longitudinal wall starts with an upstream bifurcation previous work has shown that the stability of bifurcating channels depends on the distribution of flow and sediment at the bifurcation point flokstra 1985 if one branch receives more sediment than the flow can transport it gradually silts up instead if it receives less sediment than its transport capacity its bed is eroded in the latter case with the progression of bed erosion the branch receives increasing amounts of water which intensifies the erosion process wang et al 1995 and at the same time increases deposition in the other branch unbalanced sediment inputs therefore lead to the instability of the system this work focuses on the long term stability of the two channels separated by a longitudinal wall in rivers with steady or slowly migrating alternate bars these bars are common features in alluvial rivers fig 1 steady bars in the river channel close to the bifurcation point permanently alter both the water flow pattern and the sediment transport direction therefore bars are expected to affect the sediment distribution between the two channels with possible consequences for their stability sloff and mosselman 2012 and redolfi et al 2016 the work includes laboratory and numerical investigations the laboratory investigation analyses the morphological evolution of a straight channel with steady alternate bars divided by a longitudinal wall different width ratios and locations of the starting point of the structure with respect to one bar are considered with the aim to define the conditions for obtaining a stable system the numerical investigation carried out using the open source delft3d code analyses the applicability of the technology to real river cases first the most significant flume test is upscaled and simulated to establish whether the numerical model is able to reproduce the processes observed in the laboratory but this time considering a similar system having a real river size then the code is applied to the alpine rhine river adami et al 2016 a natural system that is rather similar to the upscaled one and presents regular alternate bars with low migration rates this part of the study focuses on the effects of variable discharge on the stability of the two channel system on bar formation inside the bifurcating channels and on flow conveyance the work does not include any constructive issues presence of openings wall top level etc that may influence the channel morphological changes and therefore the stability of the system 2 river bars and bifurcations river bars are large sediment deposits that become visible during low flows surrounded by deep areas pools bars can be classified in three main categories forced free and hybrid duró et al 2015 forced bars are local deposits that form due to persistent flow pattern imposed by the channel geometry or by external factors forcing a typical example of forced bars is the point bars inside river bends free bars are large bed undulations that form due an instability phenomenon of alluvial river beds hansen 1967 callander 1969 tubino et al 1999 having a wavelength that compares with the channel width and amplitude that compares with the water depth their number in the river cross section is represented by the mode m engelund 1970 this is the integer of the ratio between the transverse half wavelength of the bars that form in the channel and the channel width m 1 corresponds to a series of bars that alternately form near one side and then the other alternate bars typical of meandering rivers m 2 to central bars and m 2 to multiple bars modes larger than two correspond to a multiple thread channel with more than one bar in the cross section typical of braided rivers fredsøe 1978 parker 1976 crosato and mosselman 2009 free bars normally migrate either in upstream or downstream direction zolezzi and seminara 2001 the mode and the other bar characteristics such as wave length amplitude migration celerity and growth rate depend on flow width to depth ratio shield number and other morphodynamic parameters e g tubino and seminara 1990 in particular bars form only if the width to depth ratio exceeds a critical value and this critical value is larger for larger bar modes engelund 1970 hybrid bars are non migrating bars similar to free bars their existence is due to the interaction of forcing and morphodynamic instability persistent geometric discontinuities of the channel asymmetric narrowing widening and structures which are rather common in rivers act as forcing they fix the location of the bars and impose to them zero celerity and a corresponding wavelength the wavelength of hybrid alternate bars is generally 2 3 times longer than the wavelength of alternate free bars the effects of free migrating bars on bifurcations were studied by bertoldi et al 2009 migrating bars arrive at the bifurcation alternatively on one side and then the other they feed the downstream branches alternatively with a larger and then smaller amount of water and sediment as a result the bifurcation oscillates around an equilibrium or disappears due to closure of one of the branches steady bars permanently affect the sediment transport distribution between the two branches of a bifurcation redolfi et al 2016 this is due to the combination of flow deformation and gravity due to the presence of bars the flow follows a weakly meandering pattern and concentrates in the pools for this the branch closest to the pool receives most discharge and most sediment gravity alters the direction of bed material moving on bar slopes deviating sediment towards the pool talmon et al 1995 finally bars impose a certain curvature to the stream lines producing a weak spiral flow that deflects the sediment moving near the bed this time towards the bar tops struiksma et al 1985 the effects of bars on bifurcation stability depends on the interaction between these phenomena considering that water depth channel width and other variables depend on flow characteristics it can be expected that bars change shape and migration celerity due to discharge variations this was investigated by tubino 1991 on free bars but works studying the effects of varying discharge on the characteristics of hybrid and forced bars are lacking it is likely that also this type of bars changes geometry as a result of flow alterations although to a lesser extent than free bars because the effects of discharge are mitigated by the presence of the forcing however also the effect of geometrical discontinuities depends on discharge this means that we can expect point bar and hybrid bar elongation or shortening due to the increase or decrease of flow discharge this might mean that bars may affect the distribution of sediment and water between bifurcating channels in a different way depending on discharge and thus the hydrograph the morphological evolution of each branch of a bifurcation includes gradual changes of mode and other bar characteristics as a direct consequence of bed elevation and water depth changes we can generally expect bed degradation to contribute to gradual bar suppression decreasing width to depth ratio and bed aggradation to the opposite 3 methodology the method adopted in this study includes both experimental and numerical investigations the experiments were carried out at the laboratory of fluid mechanics of delft university of technology in a 14 4 m long and 0 4 m wide straight flume with a sandy bed presenting steady or slowly migrating alternate bars the longitudinal training wall was reproduced by a thin longitudinal plate which subdivided the original channel in two parallel channels the bifurcation point being the location of the upstream termination of this plate considering that the water and sediment distribution between the parallel channels may depend on the location of the bifurcation with respect to a neighboring steady bar for every experiment two different locations were tested one at the upstream part of a bar and the other one at the downstream part in the pool area different subdivisions were studied to assess the role of relative channel width on the developments timing and system stability be bn 1 5 1 3 and 1 1 being be and bn the widths of the two branches of the bifurcation here named the ecological and the navigation channel respectively the last one corresponds to a subdivision in two parallel channels having the same width additionally extra tests were carried out using different sands to compare to the response of systems with different degrees of sediment suspension also considering that the effects of transverse bed slope on sediment transport are relatively less important for small sediment sizes than for larger sediment sizes chavarrías et al 2013 the formula by crosato and mosselman 2009 was used for the preliminary selection of the morphodynamic characteristics of the laboratory stream the formula allows deriving the mode m of hybrid bars that form in the channel the formation of hybrid alternate bars is expected if the chosen combination of parameters results in m 1 1 m 2 0 17 g b 3 δ d 50 b 3 i c q where m is the bar mode g is the gravity acceleration b is the degree of non linearity of the sediment transport formula as a function of flow velocity b is the channel width i is the longitudinal bed slope δ is the relative submerged sediment density d 50 is the median sediment size c is the chézy coefficient and q is the discharge to allow observing the alternate bars in the 14 m long flume the bar wavelength should not be too long ideally 2 3 bars should be present in the channel to check this the theoretical hybrid bar wavelength was computed using the following equation struiksma et al 1985 2 2 π l p 1 2 λ w b 1 λ w λ s λ w λ s 2 b 3 2 4 1 2 where lp is the hybrid bar wavelength λw is the 2d flow adaptation length λs is the 2d water depth adaptation length 3 λ w h 0 2 c f 4 λ s 1 m π 2 h 0 b h 0 2 f θ 0 in which h 0 is the normal depth cf is the friction factor defined by c f g c 2 f θ0 accounts for the effect of gravity on the direction of sediment transport over transverse bed slopes it is calculated as talmon et al 1995 5 f θ 0 0 85 e θ 0 where e is a calibration coefficient and θ0 is the shields parameter the ratio α λ s λ w is called interaction parameter and is a characteristic of the 2d response of an alluvial channel struiksma et al 1985 eq 2 was derived from a linear model and for this the value of lp provides only a rough estimate of the wavelength of the bars in the final stages of their development nevertheless the formula has been observed to function rather well on experimental settings struiksma and crosato 1989 eq 2 was applied in this study to check the experimental settings with the aim to obtain 2 to 3 bars in the flume bars are expected to alter the subdivision of sediment between the parallel channels in a different way depending on sediment transport mechanism and on transverse bed slope alteration of sediment transport direction considering that both mechanisms depend on sediment size the laboratory investigation includes four extra tests with two different sands sensitivity analysis the numerical simulations consisted of two investigations the first one was meant to assess the capability of the numerical model to reproduce the morphological processes observed in the laboratory the other one was an application of the model to a real river case the first model application simulated the morphological evolution observed in the base case laboratory scenario and consisted of two runs this was done on an upscaled numerical version of the experiments having the same longitudinal bed slope shields parameter width to depth ratio bar mode and 2d interaction parameter kleinhans et al 2010 the two runs differ on the location of the bifurcation point with respect to a steady bar the second model application was meant to simulate the hypothetical implementation of a longitudinal training wall on a real river presenting some similarity with the upscaled case this river is the alpine rhine river adami et al 2016 the analysis focused on the effects of variable discharge analysing the development of bars in the two bifurcating channels special attention was paid on high flow conveyance of the bifurcating system with respect to the original channel in both models the longitudinal training wall was schematized as a thin longitudinal dam assumed infinitely high thus always separating the flow even with the highest discharges table 1 lists the morphodynamic characteristics of the systems reproduced in the laboratory and with the numerical model 4 laboratory investigation 4 1 experimental set up following the method of struiksma and crosato 1989 who imposed an upstream asymmetric flow restriction the formation of hybrid bars was obtained by placing a curved plate 2 5 m downstream of the inlet obstructing 2 3 of the channel width fig 2 the training wall consisted of a longitudinal steel plate placed at a certain distance from the glass side wall separating two parallel channels the length of the steel plate was equal to the theoretical longitudinal wave length of the bars table 1 two starting locations of the training wall with respect to the first steady bar were considered one at the upstream part of the bar and the other one at the next pool the two locations were selected after having obtained an equilibrium bed configuration presenting clear fully formed hybrid alternate bars fig 2 shows the configuration corresponding to be bn 1 3 when the ecological channel is 10 cm wide and the navigation channel 30 cm both water and sediment were recirculated the sediment characteristics are summarized in table 2 the use of sands with different grain sizes allowed studying cases differing in sediment transport mechanism degree of suspension and transverse bed slope alteration of sediment transport direction the latter was expected to be smaller for sediment having smaller size s1 and larger for larger sediment sizes s2 the experimental tests s1 and s2 sensitivity analysis were carried out using the same width ratio as the base case scenario table 3 be bn 1 3 for these tests the upstream asymmetric flow restriction leading to the formation of hybrid alternate bars was obtained by placing a small transverse steel plate instead of a curved plate the total number of performed laboratory tests is 13 see table 3 4 2 data collection and data processing bed level and water level were recorded by 5 laser devices three times a day since lasers can penetrate water the measurements were carried out during the experiment without drying up the channel one laser device measured the water level and the other ones measured the bed level at four locations in transverse direction due to the presence of relatively large dunes and ripples the rough bed level data were filtered to clean out the bar signal the filter used is based on the matlab software processv3 and optimized for bed forms having wavelengths larger than 1 m the filtering procedure reduced the bar amplitude but allowed recognizing the bar geometry pool bar top upstream and downstream parts of a bar bed level data were used to derive the temporal evolution of the averaged difference in bed level between the two parallel channels 6 δ z z e z n in which ze and zn are the bed level in the ecological and the navigation channels respectively averaged over the entire length of the training wall the velocity field was measured using a particle tracking velocimetry ptv 4 3 results of the base case scenario all the tests of the base case scenario started with the same bed topography reference bed topography presenting clear alternate bars which was obtained after 10 days of morphological developments figs 3 and 4 a the flow characteristics after 10 days are summarized in table 1 and the characteristics of the sediment used are given in table 2 base case scenario the first two bars were steady with a wave length of about 3 2 m while the remaining bars were shorter and migrating the two bifurcation points were located 0 8 m and 1 8 m from the upstream boundary respectively in the first case the longitudinal steel plate started in the upstream part of the first steady bar in the second case the longitudinal plate started in the pool in both cases the ecological channel had a width of 10 cm and the navigation channel of 30 cm fig 2 the final configuration of the channel system at the end of the investigations is shown in fig 4 the temporal evolution of averaged bed topography fig 5 shows progressive aggradation of the ecological channel and progressive degradation of the navigation channel if the longitudinal plate started in the upstream part of the bar red line after 10 days the difference in averaged bed elevation between the two channels was δz 1 44 cm and this difference arose mainly due to sediment deposition in the ecological channel the flow velocity in the ecological channel became gradually smaller than in the navigation channel fig 6 a shows the transverse velocity field after 10 days at the end of this experimental test the ecological channel became increasingly deeper and the navigation channel shallower if the longitudinal plate started in the pool fig 5 blue line after 10 days the difference in averaged bed elevation between the two channels was δz 2 6 cm which was mainly due to ecological channel bed erosion the flow velocity in the ecological channel became progressively higher than in the navigation channel fig 6 b shows the transverse velocity field after 10 days at the end of this experimental test 4 4 results of relative width variation changing the width of the parallel channels did not change the trends observed in the base case scenario if the longitudinal plate started in the upstream part of the bar the ecological channel silted up and the navigation channel became deeper the opposite occurred if the longitudinal plate started in the pool this means that the starting point of the longitudinal plate with respect to a steady bar influences the morphological process of the system more than the width distribution between the two channels the latter was found to mainly influence the intensity and the speed of the process the smaller the width ratio was the faster the morphological evolution was fig 7 shows the temporal evolution of the difference in bed elevation between the two channels for all cases after 10 days if the longitudinal plate started in the upstream part of the bar the difference in bed elevation δz was 2 cm for be bn 1 5 case w1 1 46 cm for be bn 1 3 base case b and 0 93 cm for be bn 1 1 case w2 on the contrary when the longitudinal plate started in the pool the results were 3 13 cm 2 6 cm and 2 02 cm respectively these results suggest that the largest width ratio channels having the same width leading to the smallest difference in bed elevation between the two channels may offer the best configuration in term of long term morphology 4 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was meant to qualitatively study the effects of varying sediment on the morphological trends of the system this was done based on the initial trends without reaching morphodynamic equilibrium for this the duration of the sensitivity analysis tests was shorter 3 days for each run the longitudinal plate was placed 10 cm from the right side of the flume be bn 1 3 each run started with a flat bed the forcing offered by a small transverse plate assured that the hybrid bars always formed at the same location duró et al 2015 the characteristics of the physical parameters are listed in table 1 the characteristics of the sediment are listed in table 2 s1 corresponds to the finer sand and s2 to the coarser one 4 5 1 results with finer sediment test s1 in the reference scenario without longitudinal plate hybrid alternate bars with a wavelength of 2 5 m and amplitude of 1 cm became well recognizable after 3 days fig 8 in the subsequent tests the longitudinal plate started either in the upstream part of the second bar or in the pool between the second and the third bar 3 8 m and 5 0 m from the upstream boundary respectively fig 9 shows the evolution of the difference in averaged bed elevation between the two channels case s1 is represented by continuous lines when the longitudinal plate started in the pool the ecological channel became progressively deeper than the main channel and the flow velocity in the ecological channel gradually became larger than in the navigation channel confirming the results of the base case the ecological channel became slightly deeper and slightly conveyed more discharge also in the other test with the longitudinal plate starting in the upstream part of the bar however the results in this case might not be correct due to some discharge oscillations which were recognized only afterwards when the experiment was finished already in any case this result requires further checks 4 5 2 results with coarser sediment test s2 in the reference scenario without a longitudinal wall hybrid alternate bars with a wave length of 8 m were fully formed after 3 days the long wavelength made the experiment particularly difficult because the bars had also a rather small amplitude and this made it impossible to select a clear pool location for the case of the plate starting in the upstream part of a bar the starting point was placed at a distance of 4 4 m from the upstream boundary another starting location was investigated this time close to the first bar top at a distance of 6 7 m from the upstream boundary fig 10 the results are shown in fig 9 dotted lines when the training wall started in the upstream part of a bar the ecological channel bed became gradually higher than the navigation channel bed at the end of day 3 the difference was 0 4 cm mainly due to sediment deposition in the ecological channel at the same time the flow velocity in the ecological channel became smaller than in the navigation channel although the duration of this test was only 72 h 3 days this result shows a clear trend of deposition in the ecological channel confirming the results of the base case for the training wall starting near the bar top the ecological channel slightly aggraded whereas the flow velocity in the two channels remained almost the same this could be a sign of ongoing aggradation or of a balance and should be further investigated 5 numerical investigation 5 1 model description this study constructed two dimensional 2d depth averaged morphodynamic models using the delft3d software one model represented an upscaled version of the experimental flume and the other one a real river case delft3d has a finite difference scheme to solve the three dimensional reynolds equations for incompressible fluid under shallow water approximation and includes a morphodynamic module to account for sediment transport and bed level changes lesser et al 2004 the two models were based on the depth averaged version of the basic equations which was demonstrated to be sufficient to reproduce bars with sufficient accuracy e g defina 2003 schuurman et al 2013 duró et al 2015 singh et al 2017 the influence of the spiral flow in curved reaches was accounted for according to the formulation of struiksma et al 1985 the roughness was represented by a constant chézy coefficient values in table 1 and the bed load transport rate was computed by means of the meyer peter and müller 1984 mpm formula valid for sand and gravel bed rivers the effects of transverse bed slope on sediment transport direction were taken into account according to bagnold s 1966 formulation default in delft3d not considering these effects would result in an un realistic unstable model mosselman and le 2016 the hydrodynamic boundary conditions of the models consisted of downstream water level and upstream discharge in the upscaled model these boundary conditions were constant values whereas in the alpine rhine model they were variable according to the discharge variations the boundary conditions for the sediment component were defined by upstream balanced sediment transport which prevented the bed level from changing at the boundary and downstream free sediment transport condition which may result in bed level changes the lateral banks were fixed and treated as free slip fixed boundaries the time step of the flow was 0 1 min to ensure numerical stability as evaluated by the courant criterion for fluid advection to fully reproduce the interaction between flow and sediment the computations were carried out without any morphological acceleration the longitudinal training wall was schematized as a thin infinitely high and deep dam this ensured that the structure always divides the two channels the length of the wall was equal to the bar wave length and obtained after completion of a reference run a transverse groyne obstructing 2 3 of the width was placed at the right side wall at a certain distance from the upstream boundary to trigger hybrid bars table 4 shows the exact distance and the numerical parameters in both models 5 2 upscaled experiment model setup this numerical simulation aimed at establishing whether a 2d morphodynamic model constructed using the delft3d software provides reliable results when studying the effects of subdividing a straight river channel with alternate bars with a longitudinal training wall the hydraulic and morphology parameters in the upscaled version of the laboratory tests are presented in table 1 the numerical parameters are summarized in table 4 the reference case without longitudinal wall started with a flat bed a transverse groyne located 375 m from the upstream inlet on the right side was used to assure the formation of the hybrid bars as in duró et al 2015 reproducing the effects of the curved plate placed in the flume the results obtained after 10 days of morphological development are shown in fig 11 in this figure the results are plotted from the transverse groyne to the end of the reach the shape of the alternate bars qualitatively resembles the one obtained in the laboratory for the reference case fig 3 with a long steady bar opposite to the groyne and smaller migrating bars more downstream this means that the similarity based on longitudinal slope shield parameter width to depth ratio bar mode interaction parameter table 1 does not result in quantitative geometric similarity but only in qualitative geometric similarity in the same way as in the experiment two locations for the starting point of the longitudinal wall were considered one in the upstream part of the first steady bar and one in the pool opposite to it fig 11 for each location three different width ratios were considered be bn 1 5 1 3 and 1 1 all upscaled experiment scenarios table 5 started from the bed topography shown in fig 11 the computations simulated a period of 10 days 5 3 upscaled experiment model results in the base case scenario b runs when the longitudinal training wall starts from the upstream part of a bar the result shows that the smaller ecological channel silts up fig 12 a the opposite occurs when the training wall starts at a pool location fig 12 b the trends are the same also for different width ratios if the training wall starts in the upstream part of the bar the ecological channel silts up instead if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the ecological channel deepens whereas the navigation channels aggrades as in the experiments also in the numerical simulations the width ratio influences the speed of the process see fig 13 in the same way as in the experimental test fig 7 all the obtained numerical results are similar to the ones obtained in the laboratory supporting the use of the numerical model to study a real river case with variable discharge 5 4 alpine rhine model setup this numerical investigation aimed at studying the effects of variable discharge in a real river case that is rather similar to the upscaled version of the system studied in the laboratory the analysis focused on conveyance capacity and bar formation the selected case study is the upper reach of the alpine rhine river described by adami et al 2016 the characteristics of the system are listed in table 1 the numerical parameters are summarized in table 4 the hydrograph used in this model considered the three discharge levels indicated by adami et al fully wet discharge qfw 381 m3 s fully transporting discharge qft 829 m3 s and critical discharge for bar formation qcr 1845 m3 s the duration of these discharges was derived from fig 2 in adami et al 2016 to roughly describe a typical year fig 14 the model schematized the river reach as straight although the channel presents a slight curvature fig 1 since the model was not meant to reproduce each bar observed in the study reach but to simulate the effects of subdividing the river channel with a longitudinal wall a transverse groyne located 500 m from the upstream boundary was placed at the right side to obtain hybrid bars in the same way as in the upscaled experiment model for this the model was not calibrated but validated in terms of bar mode and bar wave length the reference case without longitudinal wall started with a flat bed the bed topography obtained after 3 years is shown in fig 15 in this figure the bed elevation is plotted from the transverse groyne to the end of the reach the computed steady alternate bar configuration corresponds rather well to the observed one considering that also the celerity of the observed bars in the real river reach is zero or close to zero moreover the computed wave length of the alternate bars is 1500 m which nicely falls within the observed range adami et al 2016 fig 1 two locations for the starting point of the longitudinal wall were considered one in the upstream part of the first steady bar and one in the pool opposite to it only one width ratio was considered be bn 1 3 all the alpine rhine scenarios table 6 started from the bed topography shown in fig 15 each computation simulated a period of 3 years 5 5 alpine rhine model results in general based on the results obtained after 3 years the morphological trends computed for the alpine rhine with variable discharge agree with the results of the laboratory tests and upscaled model when the longitudinal training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar the smaller ecological channel silts up fig 16 the opposite occurs when the training wall starts in a pool location fig 17 fig 16 shows that when the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar under high discharge the ecological channel silts up but both channels remain open fig 16 a whereas with low flow the ecological channel is completely closed and the navigation channel conveys the entire discharge fig 16 b and c when all water flows in the navigation channel smaller and shorter bars are found compared to the reference case downstream of the training wall the bars remain of the same type as in the reference case in this scenario the training wall helps to reduce the hinder of the bars in the navigation channel when the longitudinal training wall starts in the pool between two bars with high discharge the ecological channel conveys almost all water but both channels remain open fig 17 a with the smallest discharge the navigation channel closes and all water flows in the ecological channel fig 17 b and c in this scenario the navigation channel is not functional at all at low water fig 18 shows the longitudinal profiles of water and bed levels in both the ecological and the navigation channel during the highest discharge these results show that the longitudinal training wall does not hamper the flood conveyance during high flows if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar there is a 1 2 m drop of water level in the ecological channel fig 18 a whereas in the navigation channel the water level is almost the same as in the reference case fig 18 b at the downstream end of the training wall there is a slight increasing in water level compared to the reference case 10 cm this could be the influence of the confluence where the parallel channels merge again if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the water level in the ecological channel drops by maximum 50 cm fig 18 c and in the navigation channel by a maximum of 65 cm fig 18 d however near the downstream end of the training wall the water level rises up to 28 cm in this scenario the rise of water level due to the confluence appears more important the effects of using a constant chézy coefficient might have resulted in overestimating the conveyance of the aggrading channel for which the roughness is most likely underestimated at the same time the conveyance of the deepening channel might be slightly underestimated 6 discussion the experiments were carried out on straight channels whereas real rivers present numerous curves the point bars at the inner side of bends may act as steady alternate bars in affecting the distribution of water and sediment between the two parallel channels but river bends also result in spiral flow formation and this might alter the direction of sediment transport for this the presence of river bends might affect the results of this study we therefore recommend studying the effects of a longitudinal training wall in a meandering channel the numerical results were obtained assuming constant hydraulic resistance represented by chézy coefficient however channel deepening might result in smaller hydraulic resistance larger chézy coefficient whereas the channel becoming shallower might result in higher hydraulic resistance smaller chézy coefficient small scale sub grid bedform formation would influence the chézy coefficient as well these effects are not taken into account in the computations moreover due to the alternation of high and low discharges vegetation might colonize the shallow channel during low flow and drastically increase its bed roughness during high flow this can reduce the flood conveyance of the parallel channel system the work considered gravel bed rivers since the laboratory experiments even though sand was used represented a river with gravel bed the characteristics of the laboratory experiments and of the upscaled river are shown in table 1 the subsequent real river case was again a gravel bed river with alternate bars this means that the results are strictly valid only for gravel bed rivers and their applicability on sand bed systems requires further investigation the strategy we propose to train rivers by creating a navigation and ecological channel with a longitudinal wall presents advantages and disadvantages we have shown that the bifurcation created with a longitudinal wall results in an unstable system in which one of the two channels inevitably becomes shallower ideally the ecological channel this channel closes completely only if the discharge is constant with variable discharge it becomes dry at low flows only this would be an advantage for navigation because the flow then concentrates in the other channel increasing the low flow water depth the temporary seasonal closure of the ecological channel however might be a disadvantage for the riverine ecology and this should be further investigated by experts in this field in rivers with hybrid alternate bars rather common in real cases the results show also that if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar the smaller ecological channel experiences sediment deposition and the navigation channel becomes deeper in this case the flood conveyance of the river is not reduced which means that the construction of the longitudinal wall does not increase flood risk in the area adjacent to the river the opposite happens if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the navigation channel silts up and the flood conveyance of the river reduces these results show the importance of well designing the starting point of the longitudinal wall the time scales involved in the processes plays an important role too if the morphological development is slow it could be possible to maintain both channels open by for instance dredging and dumping the deposited sediment from one channel to the other this means that the applicability of the proposed technique requires more research 7 conclusions we studied the possibility of subdividing a river channel in one relatively narrow ecological channel and one navigation channel by means of a longitudinal training wall in the laboratory and by means of numerical simulations we considered channels characterized by the presence of steady alternate bars which are common morphological features hindering river navigation the laboratory experiments show that subdividing a channel presenting steady or slowly migrating alternate bars with a longitudinal training wall might lead to an unstable system in which one of the two parallel channels tends to silt up the results show that the starting point of the longitudinal wall with respect to a bar plays an important role for the morphological evolution of the two channels when the training wall starts at a location in the upstream part of a bar the narrower ecological channel silts up instead when the training wall starts in the pool area between two subsequent bars the same channel deepens and the navigation channel silts up changing the widths of the channels did not change the trends observed in the base case scenario the most stable system is obtained if the longitudinal wall subdivides the river in two equally wide parallel channels changing sediment did not alter the observed trends too with the exception of test s1 finer sediment for which some problems encountered during the experiment did not allow to draw any conclusions for the case starting in the upstream part of a bar one experimental test s2 coarser sediment indicates that a stable system might be obtained if the training wall starts near a bar top but this might not be true with a variable discharge regime and should be further investigated these observations were reproduced numerically in an upscaled version of the laboratory experiments supporting the use of a 2d model based on the numerical code delft3d to investigate this type of systems on a real river case the subsequent use of the code to study the effects of placing a longitudinal training wall in the upper reach of the alpine rhine river described by adami et al 2016 confirms the observed trends and shows that a variable discharge regime does not change the observed trends the conveyance of the channel was studied by comparing the water levels in presence of longitudinal wall with those in a reference scenario without wall the results show that the longitudinal training wall affects high flow water levels only slightly if it starts in the upstream part of a bar in this case a small increase of water level is observed near the downstream end of the longitudinal wall however if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the raise of high flow level near the end of the longitudinal wall is not negligible even if limited acknowledgments this work is sponsored by vietnam international education

857,rivers have been trained for centuries by channel narrowing and straightening this caused important damages to their ecosystems particularly around the bank areas we analyze here the possibility to train rivers in a new way by subdividing their channel in main and ecological channel with a longitudinal training wall the effectiveness of longitudinal training walls in achieving this goal and their long term effects on the river morphology have not been thoroughly investigated yet in particular studies that assess the stability of the two parallel channels separated by the training wall are still lacking this work studies the long term morphological developments of river channels subdivided by a longitudinal training wall in the presence of steady alternate bars this type of bars common in alluvial rivers alters the flow field and the sediment transport direction and might affect the stability of the bifurcating system the work comprises both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations delft3d the results show that a system of parallel channels divided by a longitudinal training wall has the tendency to become unstable an important factor is found to be the location of the upstream termination of the longitudinal wall with respect to a neighboring steady bar the relative widths of the two parallel channels separated by the wall and variable discharge do not substantially change the final evolution of the system keywords longitudinal training wall river morphology river bars channel stability delft3d laboratory experiments 1 introduction many low land rivers are used for inland navigation as for instance the waal de vriend 2015 the elbe elbe promotion centre website the thames british marine federation and environment agency 2013 the mississippi army corps of engineers 2011 important plans to improve inland navigation regard the white nile and nile rivers in sudan nepad agency 2013 as well as the me kong river in vietnam mekong river commission 2016 among others these rivers still present long reaches with natural banks and new interventions should be planned in a way to preserve their most important ecological aspects for this reason it is important to study new training techniques that allow for the co existence of navigation with natural banks without affecting flood water levels the creation of a navigation route often includes channel narrowing this results in a deeper river channel and reduces bar formation duró et al 2015 which is good for navigation river are narrowed by constructing series of groynes along both sides of the river as in the rhine havinga et al 2006 and rhone rivers scerri et al 2015 or by bank protection works especially in urban areas as a result bed degradation occurs in the narrowed reach and upstream in the narrowed reach the water depth increases upstream the water depth tends to remain the same as before the intervention but both bed and water levels decrease as shown by jansen et al 1979 bed degradation is amplified by river shortening another frequent intervention aiming at navigation improvement e g spinewine and zech 2008 moreover maintaining the navigation channel during low flow conditions when bars and other sediment deposits obstruct the navigation route often requires dredging which is in some cases accompanied by dumping of dredged sediment in deep areas mosselman et al 2004 sieben 2009 van vuren et al 2015 without dumping sediment extraction results in important incision processes along the entire river course strengthening the effects of the other interventions aimed at navigation route improvement such as channel narrowing and shortening e g visser et al 1999 de vriend 2015 bed and water level degradation affect intakes and the foundations of structures along the river including the groynes and lower groundwater levels with consequences for floodplain vegetation and agriculture in the area adjacent to the river excessive bed degradation can even cause problems to navigation if rock outcrops appear as along the rhine river between cologne and rees frings et al 2014 another problem related to traditional river training is that banks protected by groynes or by revetments lose their natural value this can be observed in many trained rivers for which the restoration of the riverine environment has become a priority e g schoor et al 1999 however at the same time the restored river should have similar or even increased high flow conveyance e g villada arroyave and crosato 2010 to reduce the probability of floods along its course all these issues show the need to define new more sustainable river management strategies rijke et al 2012 in this paper we study the possibility of obtaining a stable navigation channel minimizing river ecosystem degradation without affecting flood water levels the idea is to create two parallel channels one for navigation and one for ecology which may have the same width or different widths by means of a longitudinal wall the system of parallel channels separated by a longitudinal wall starts with an upstream bifurcation previous work has shown that the stability of bifurcating channels depends on the distribution of flow and sediment at the bifurcation point flokstra 1985 if one branch receives more sediment than the flow can transport it gradually silts up instead if it receives less sediment than its transport capacity its bed is eroded in the latter case with the progression of bed erosion the branch receives increasing amounts of water which intensifies the erosion process wang et al 1995 and at the same time increases deposition in the other branch unbalanced sediment inputs therefore lead to the instability of the system this work focuses on the long term stability of the two channels separated by a longitudinal wall in rivers with steady or slowly migrating alternate bars these bars are common features in alluvial rivers fig 1 steady bars in the river channel close to the bifurcation point permanently alter both the water flow pattern and the sediment transport direction therefore bars are expected to affect the sediment distribution between the two channels with possible consequences for their stability sloff and mosselman 2012 and redolfi et al 2016 the work includes laboratory and numerical investigations the laboratory investigation analyses the morphological evolution of a straight channel with steady alternate bars divided by a longitudinal wall different width ratios and locations of the starting point of the structure with respect to one bar are considered with the aim to define the conditions for obtaining a stable system the numerical investigation carried out using the open source delft3d code analyses the applicability of the technology to real river cases first the most significant flume test is upscaled and simulated to establish whether the numerical model is able to reproduce the processes observed in the laboratory but this time considering a similar system having a real river size then the code is applied to the alpine rhine river adami et al 2016 a natural system that is rather similar to the upscaled one and presents regular alternate bars with low migration rates this part of the study focuses on the effects of variable discharge on the stability of the two channel system on bar formation inside the bifurcating channels and on flow conveyance the work does not include any constructive issues presence of openings wall top level etc that may influence the channel morphological changes and therefore the stability of the system 2 river bars and bifurcations river bars are large sediment deposits that become visible during low flows surrounded by deep areas pools bars can be classified in three main categories forced free and hybrid duró et al 2015 forced bars are local deposits that form due to persistent flow pattern imposed by the channel geometry or by external factors forcing a typical example of forced bars is the point bars inside river bends free bars are large bed undulations that form due an instability phenomenon of alluvial river beds hansen 1967 callander 1969 tubino et al 1999 having a wavelength that compares with the channel width and amplitude that compares with the water depth their number in the river cross section is represented by the mode m engelund 1970 this is the integer of the ratio between the transverse half wavelength of the bars that form in the channel and the channel width m 1 corresponds to a series of bars that alternately form near one side and then the other alternate bars typical of meandering rivers m 2 to central bars and m 2 to multiple bars modes larger than two correspond to a multiple thread channel with more than one bar in the cross section typical of braided rivers fredsøe 1978 parker 1976 crosato and mosselman 2009 free bars normally migrate either in upstream or downstream direction zolezzi and seminara 2001 the mode and the other bar characteristics such as wave length amplitude migration celerity and growth rate depend on flow width to depth ratio shield number and other morphodynamic parameters e g tubino and seminara 1990 in particular bars form only if the width to depth ratio exceeds a critical value and this critical value is larger for larger bar modes engelund 1970 hybrid bars are non migrating bars similar to free bars their existence is due to the interaction of forcing and morphodynamic instability persistent geometric discontinuities of the channel asymmetric narrowing widening and structures which are rather common in rivers act as forcing they fix the location of the bars and impose to them zero celerity and a corresponding wavelength the wavelength of hybrid alternate bars is generally 2 3 times longer than the wavelength of alternate free bars the effects of free migrating bars on bifurcations were studied by bertoldi et al 2009 migrating bars arrive at the bifurcation alternatively on one side and then the other they feed the downstream branches alternatively with a larger and then smaller amount of water and sediment as a result the bifurcation oscillates around an equilibrium or disappears due to closure of one of the branches steady bars permanently affect the sediment transport distribution between the two branches of a bifurcation redolfi et al 2016 this is due to the combination of flow deformation and gravity due to the presence of bars the flow follows a weakly meandering pattern and concentrates in the pools for this the branch closest to the pool receives most discharge and most sediment gravity alters the direction of bed material moving on bar slopes deviating sediment towards the pool talmon et al 1995 finally bars impose a certain curvature to the stream lines producing a weak spiral flow that deflects the sediment moving near the bed this time towards the bar tops struiksma et al 1985 the effects of bars on bifurcation stability depends on the interaction between these phenomena considering that water depth channel width and other variables depend on flow characteristics it can be expected that bars change shape and migration celerity due to discharge variations this was investigated by tubino 1991 on free bars but works studying the effects of varying discharge on the characteristics of hybrid and forced bars are lacking it is likely that also this type of bars changes geometry as a result of flow alterations although to a lesser extent than free bars because the effects of discharge are mitigated by the presence of the forcing however also the effect of geometrical discontinuities depends on discharge this means that we can expect point bar and hybrid bar elongation or shortening due to the increase or decrease of flow discharge this might mean that bars may affect the distribution of sediment and water between bifurcating channels in a different way depending on discharge and thus the hydrograph the morphological evolution of each branch of a bifurcation includes gradual changes of mode and other bar characteristics as a direct consequence of bed elevation and water depth changes we can generally expect bed degradation to contribute to gradual bar suppression decreasing width to depth ratio and bed aggradation to the opposite 3 methodology the method adopted in this study includes both experimental and numerical investigations the experiments were carried out at the laboratory of fluid mechanics of delft university of technology in a 14 4 m long and 0 4 m wide straight flume with a sandy bed presenting steady or slowly migrating alternate bars the longitudinal training wall was reproduced by a thin longitudinal plate which subdivided the original channel in two parallel channels the bifurcation point being the location of the upstream termination of this plate considering that the water and sediment distribution between the parallel channels may depend on the location of the bifurcation with respect to a neighboring steady bar for every experiment two different locations were tested one at the upstream part of a bar and the other one at the downstream part in the pool area different subdivisions were studied to assess the role of relative channel width on the developments timing and system stability be bn 1 5 1 3 and 1 1 being be and bn the widths of the two branches of the bifurcation here named the ecological and the navigation channel respectively the last one corresponds to a subdivision in two parallel channels having the same width additionally extra tests were carried out using different sands to compare to the response of systems with different degrees of sediment suspension also considering that the effects of transverse bed slope on sediment transport are relatively less important for small sediment sizes than for larger sediment sizes chavarrías et al 2013 the formula by crosato and mosselman 2009 was used for the preliminary selection of the morphodynamic characteristics of the laboratory stream the formula allows deriving the mode m of hybrid bars that form in the channel the formation of hybrid alternate bars is expected if the chosen combination of parameters results in m 1 1 m 2 0 17 g b 3 δ d 50 b 3 i c q where m is the bar mode g is the gravity acceleration b is the degree of non linearity of the sediment transport formula as a function of flow velocity b is the channel width i is the longitudinal bed slope δ is the relative submerged sediment density d 50 is the median sediment size c is the chézy coefficient and q is the discharge to allow observing the alternate bars in the 14 m long flume the bar wavelength should not be too long ideally 2 3 bars should be present in the channel to check this the theoretical hybrid bar wavelength was computed using the following equation struiksma et al 1985 2 2 π l p 1 2 λ w b 1 λ w λ s λ w λ s 2 b 3 2 4 1 2 where lp is the hybrid bar wavelength λw is the 2d flow adaptation length λs is the 2d water depth adaptation length 3 λ w h 0 2 c f 4 λ s 1 m π 2 h 0 b h 0 2 f θ 0 in which h 0 is the normal depth cf is the friction factor defined by c f g c 2 f θ0 accounts for the effect of gravity on the direction of sediment transport over transverse bed slopes it is calculated as talmon et al 1995 5 f θ 0 0 85 e θ 0 where e is a calibration coefficient and θ0 is the shields parameter the ratio α λ s λ w is called interaction parameter and is a characteristic of the 2d response of an alluvial channel struiksma et al 1985 eq 2 was derived from a linear model and for this the value of lp provides only a rough estimate of the wavelength of the bars in the final stages of their development nevertheless the formula has been observed to function rather well on experimental settings struiksma and crosato 1989 eq 2 was applied in this study to check the experimental settings with the aim to obtain 2 to 3 bars in the flume bars are expected to alter the subdivision of sediment between the parallel channels in a different way depending on sediment transport mechanism and on transverse bed slope alteration of sediment transport direction considering that both mechanisms depend on sediment size the laboratory investigation includes four extra tests with two different sands sensitivity analysis the numerical simulations consisted of two investigations the first one was meant to assess the capability of the numerical model to reproduce the morphological processes observed in the laboratory the other one was an application of the model to a real river case the first model application simulated the morphological evolution observed in the base case laboratory scenario and consisted of two runs this was done on an upscaled numerical version of the experiments having the same longitudinal bed slope shields parameter width to depth ratio bar mode and 2d interaction parameter kleinhans et al 2010 the two runs differ on the location of the bifurcation point with respect to a steady bar the second model application was meant to simulate the hypothetical implementation of a longitudinal training wall on a real river presenting some similarity with the upscaled case this river is the alpine rhine river adami et al 2016 the analysis focused on the effects of variable discharge analysing the development of bars in the two bifurcating channels special attention was paid on high flow conveyance of the bifurcating system with respect to the original channel in both models the longitudinal training wall was schematized as a thin longitudinal dam assumed infinitely high thus always separating the flow even with the highest discharges table 1 lists the morphodynamic characteristics of the systems reproduced in the laboratory and with the numerical model 4 laboratory investigation 4 1 experimental set up following the method of struiksma and crosato 1989 who imposed an upstream asymmetric flow restriction the formation of hybrid bars was obtained by placing a curved plate 2 5 m downstream of the inlet obstructing 2 3 of the channel width fig 2 the training wall consisted of a longitudinal steel plate placed at a certain distance from the glass side wall separating two parallel channels the length of the steel plate was equal to the theoretical longitudinal wave length of the bars table 1 two starting locations of the training wall with respect to the first steady bar were considered one at the upstream part of the bar and the other one at the next pool the two locations were selected after having obtained an equilibrium bed configuration presenting clear fully formed hybrid alternate bars fig 2 shows the configuration corresponding to be bn 1 3 when the ecological channel is 10 cm wide and the navigation channel 30 cm both water and sediment were recirculated the sediment characteristics are summarized in table 2 the use of sands with different grain sizes allowed studying cases differing in sediment transport mechanism degree of suspension and transverse bed slope alteration of sediment transport direction the latter was expected to be smaller for sediment having smaller size s1 and larger for larger sediment sizes s2 the experimental tests s1 and s2 sensitivity analysis were carried out using the same width ratio as the base case scenario table 3 be bn 1 3 for these tests the upstream asymmetric flow restriction leading to the formation of hybrid alternate bars was obtained by placing a small transverse steel plate instead of a curved plate the total number of performed laboratory tests is 13 see table 3 4 2 data collection and data processing bed level and water level were recorded by 5 laser devices three times a day since lasers can penetrate water the measurements were carried out during the experiment without drying up the channel one laser device measured the water level and the other ones measured the bed level at four locations in transverse direction due to the presence of relatively large dunes and ripples the rough bed level data were filtered to clean out the bar signal the filter used is based on the matlab software processv3 and optimized for bed forms having wavelengths larger than 1 m the filtering procedure reduced the bar amplitude but allowed recognizing the bar geometry pool bar top upstream and downstream parts of a bar bed level data were used to derive the temporal evolution of the averaged difference in bed level between the two parallel channels 6 δ z z e z n in which ze and zn are the bed level in the ecological and the navigation channels respectively averaged over the entire length of the training wall the velocity field was measured using a particle tracking velocimetry ptv 4 3 results of the base case scenario all the tests of the base case scenario started with the same bed topography reference bed topography presenting clear alternate bars which was obtained after 10 days of morphological developments figs 3 and 4 a the flow characteristics after 10 days are summarized in table 1 and the characteristics of the sediment used are given in table 2 base case scenario the first two bars were steady with a wave length of about 3 2 m while the remaining bars were shorter and migrating the two bifurcation points were located 0 8 m and 1 8 m from the upstream boundary respectively in the first case the longitudinal steel plate started in the upstream part of the first steady bar in the second case the longitudinal plate started in the pool in both cases the ecological channel had a width of 10 cm and the navigation channel of 30 cm fig 2 the final configuration of the channel system at the end of the investigations is shown in fig 4 the temporal evolution of averaged bed topography fig 5 shows progressive aggradation of the ecological channel and progressive degradation of the navigation channel if the longitudinal plate started in the upstream part of the bar red line after 10 days the difference in averaged bed elevation between the two channels was δz 1 44 cm and this difference arose mainly due to sediment deposition in the ecological channel the flow velocity in the ecological channel became gradually smaller than in the navigation channel fig 6 a shows the transverse velocity field after 10 days at the end of this experimental test the ecological channel became increasingly deeper and the navigation channel shallower if the longitudinal plate started in the pool fig 5 blue line after 10 days the difference in averaged bed elevation between the two channels was δz 2 6 cm which was mainly due to ecological channel bed erosion the flow velocity in the ecological channel became progressively higher than in the navigation channel fig 6 b shows the transverse velocity field after 10 days at the end of this experimental test 4 4 results of relative width variation changing the width of the parallel channels did not change the trends observed in the base case scenario if the longitudinal plate started in the upstream part of the bar the ecological channel silted up and the navigation channel became deeper the opposite occurred if the longitudinal plate started in the pool this means that the starting point of the longitudinal plate with respect to a steady bar influences the morphological process of the system more than the width distribution between the two channels the latter was found to mainly influence the intensity and the speed of the process the smaller the width ratio was the faster the morphological evolution was fig 7 shows the temporal evolution of the difference in bed elevation between the two channels for all cases after 10 days if the longitudinal plate started in the upstream part of the bar the difference in bed elevation δz was 2 cm for be bn 1 5 case w1 1 46 cm for be bn 1 3 base case b and 0 93 cm for be bn 1 1 case w2 on the contrary when the longitudinal plate started in the pool the results were 3 13 cm 2 6 cm and 2 02 cm respectively these results suggest that the largest width ratio channels having the same width leading to the smallest difference in bed elevation between the two channels may offer the best configuration in term of long term morphology 4 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was meant to qualitatively study the effects of varying sediment on the morphological trends of the system this was done based on the initial trends without reaching morphodynamic equilibrium for this the duration of the sensitivity analysis tests was shorter 3 days for each run the longitudinal plate was placed 10 cm from the right side of the flume be bn 1 3 each run started with a flat bed the forcing offered by a small transverse plate assured that the hybrid bars always formed at the same location duró et al 2015 the characteristics of the physical parameters are listed in table 1 the characteristics of the sediment are listed in table 2 s1 corresponds to the finer sand and s2 to the coarser one 4 5 1 results with finer sediment test s1 in the reference scenario without longitudinal plate hybrid alternate bars with a wavelength of 2 5 m and amplitude of 1 cm became well recognizable after 3 days fig 8 in the subsequent tests the longitudinal plate started either in the upstream part of the second bar or in the pool between the second and the third bar 3 8 m and 5 0 m from the upstream boundary respectively fig 9 shows the evolution of the difference in averaged bed elevation between the two channels case s1 is represented by continuous lines when the longitudinal plate started in the pool the ecological channel became progressively deeper than the main channel and the flow velocity in the ecological channel gradually became larger than in the navigation channel confirming the results of the base case the ecological channel became slightly deeper and slightly conveyed more discharge also in the other test with the longitudinal plate starting in the upstream part of the bar however the results in this case might not be correct due to some discharge oscillations which were recognized only afterwards when the experiment was finished already in any case this result requires further checks 4 5 2 results with coarser sediment test s2 in the reference scenario without a longitudinal wall hybrid alternate bars with a wave length of 8 m were fully formed after 3 days the long wavelength made the experiment particularly difficult because the bars had also a rather small amplitude and this made it impossible to select a clear pool location for the case of the plate starting in the upstream part of a bar the starting point was placed at a distance of 4 4 m from the upstream boundary another starting location was investigated this time close to the first bar top at a distance of 6 7 m from the upstream boundary fig 10 the results are shown in fig 9 dotted lines when the training wall started in the upstream part of a bar the ecological channel bed became gradually higher than the navigation channel bed at the end of day 3 the difference was 0 4 cm mainly due to sediment deposition in the ecological channel at the same time the flow velocity in the ecological channel became smaller than in the navigation channel although the duration of this test was only 72 h 3 days this result shows a clear trend of deposition in the ecological channel confirming the results of the base case for the training wall starting near the bar top the ecological channel slightly aggraded whereas the flow velocity in the two channels remained almost the same this could be a sign of ongoing aggradation or of a balance and should be further investigated 5 numerical investigation 5 1 model description this study constructed two dimensional 2d depth averaged morphodynamic models using the delft3d software one model represented an upscaled version of the experimental flume and the other one a real river case delft3d has a finite difference scheme to solve the three dimensional reynolds equations for incompressible fluid under shallow water approximation and includes a morphodynamic module to account for sediment transport and bed level changes lesser et al 2004 the two models were based on the depth averaged version of the basic equations which was demonstrated to be sufficient to reproduce bars with sufficient accuracy e g defina 2003 schuurman et al 2013 duró et al 2015 singh et al 2017 the influence of the spiral flow in curved reaches was accounted for according to the formulation of struiksma et al 1985 the roughness was represented by a constant chézy coefficient values in table 1 and the bed load transport rate was computed by means of the meyer peter and müller 1984 mpm formula valid for sand and gravel bed rivers the effects of transverse bed slope on sediment transport direction were taken into account according to bagnold s 1966 formulation default in delft3d not considering these effects would result in an un realistic unstable model mosselman and le 2016 the hydrodynamic boundary conditions of the models consisted of downstream water level and upstream discharge in the upscaled model these boundary conditions were constant values whereas in the alpine rhine model they were variable according to the discharge variations the boundary conditions for the sediment component were defined by upstream balanced sediment transport which prevented the bed level from changing at the boundary and downstream free sediment transport condition which may result in bed level changes the lateral banks were fixed and treated as free slip fixed boundaries the time step of the flow was 0 1 min to ensure numerical stability as evaluated by the courant criterion for fluid advection to fully reproduce the interaction between flow and sediment the computations were carried out without any morphological acceleration the longitudinal training wall was schematized as a thin infinitely high and deep dam this ensured that the structure always divides the two channels the length of the wall was equal to the bar wave length and obtained after completion of a reference run a transverse groyne obstructing 2 3 of the width was placed at the right side wall at a certain distance from the upstream boundary to trigger hybrid bars table 4 shows the exact distance and the numerical parameters in both models 5 2 upscaled experiment model setup this numerical simulation aimed at establishing whether a 2d morphodynamic model constructed using the delft3d software provides reliable results when studying the effects of subdividing a straight river channel with alternate bars with a longitudinal training wall the hydraulic and morphology parameters in the upscaled version of the laboratory tests are presented in table 1 the numerical parameters are summarized in table 4 the reference case without longitudinal wall started with a flat bed a transverse groyne located 375 m from the upstream inlet on the right side was used to assure the formation of the hybrid bars as in duró et al 2015 reproducing the effects of the curved plate placed in the flume the results obtained after 10 days of morphological development are shown in fig 11 in this figure the results are plotted from the transverse groyne to the end of the reach the shape of the alternate bars qualitatively resembles the one obtained in the laboratory for the reference case fig 3 with a long steady bar opposite to the groyne and smaller migrating bars more downstream this means that the similarity based on longitudinal slope shield parameter width to depth ratio bar mode interaction parameter table 1 does not result in quantitative geometric similarity but only in qualitative geometric similarity in the same way as in the experiment two locations for the starting point of the longitudinal wall were considered one in the upstream part of the first steady bar and one in the pool opposite to it fig 11 for each location three different width ratios were considered be bn 1 5 1 3 and 1 1 all upscaled experiment scenarios table 5 started from the bed topography shown in fig 11 the computations simulated a period of 10 days 5 3 upscaled experiment model results in the base case scenario b runs when the longitudinal training wall starts from the upstream part of a bar the result shows that the smaller ecological channel silts up fig 12 a the opposite occurs when the training wall starts at a pool location fig 12 b the trends are the same also for different width ratios if the training wall starts in the upstream part of the bar the ecological channel silts up instead if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the ecological channel deepens whereas the navigation channels aggrades as in the experiments also in the numerical simulations the width ratio influences the speed of the process see fig 13 in the same way as in the experimental test fig 7 all the obtained numerical results are similar to the ones obtained in the laboratory supporting the use of the numerical model to study a real river case with variable discharge 5 4 alpine rhine model setup this numerical investigation aimed at studying the effects of variable discharge in a real river case that is rather similar to the upscaled version of the system studied in the laboratory the analysis focused on conveyance capacity and bar formation the selected case study is the upper reach of the alpine rhine river described by adami et al 2016 the characteristics of the system are listed in table 1 the numerical parameters are summarized in table 4 the hydrograph used in this model considered the three discharge levels indicated by adami et al fully wet discharge qfw 381 m3 s fully transporting discharge qft 829 m3 s and critical discharge for bar formation qcr 1845 m3 s the duration of these discharges was derived from fig 2 in adami et al 2016 to roughly describe a typical year fig 14 the model schematized the river reach as straight although the channel presents a slight curvature fig 1 since the model was not meant to reproduce each bar observed in the study reach but to simulate the effects of subdividing the river channel with a longitudinal wall a transverse groyne located 500 m from the upstream boundary was placed at the right side to obtain hybrid bars in the same way as in the upscaled experiment model for this the model was not calibrated but validated in terms of bar mode and bar wave length the reference case without longitudinal wall started with a flat bed the bed topography obtained after 3 years is shown in fig 15 in this figure the bed elevation is plotted from the transverse groyne to the end of the reach the computed steady alternate bar configuration corresponds rather well to the observed one considering that also the celerity of the observed bars in the real river reach is zero or close to zero moreover the computed wave length of the alternate bars is 1500 m which nicely falls within the observed range adami et al 2016 fig 1 two locations for the starting point of the longitudinal wall were considered one in the upstream part of the first steady bar and one in the pool opposite to it only one width ratio was considered be bn 1 3 all the alpine rhine scenarios table 6 started from the bed topography shown in fig 15 each computation simulated a period of 3 years 5 5 alpine rhine model results in general based on the results obtained after 3 years the morphological trends computed for the alpine rhine with variable discharge agree with the results of the laboratory tests and upscaled model when the longitudinal training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar the smaller ecological channel silts up fig 16 the opposite occurs when the training wall starts in a pool location fig 17 fig 16 shows that when the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar under high discharge the ecological channel silts up but both channels remain open fig 16 a whereas with low flow the ecological channel is completely closed and the navigation channel conveys the entire discharge fig 16 b and c when all water flows in the navigation channel smaller and shorter bars are found compared to the reference case downstream of the training wall the bars remain of the same type as in the reference case in this scenario the training wall helps to reduce the hinder of the bars in the navigation channel when the longitudinal training wall starts in the pool between two bars with high discharge the ecological channel conveys almost all water but both channels remain open fig 17 a with the smallest discharge the navigation channel closes and all water flows in the ecological channel fig 17 b and c in this scenario the navigation channel is not functional at all at low water fig 18 shows the longitudinal profiles of water and bed levels in both the ecological and the navigation channel during the highest discharge these results show that the longitudinal training wall does not hamper the flood conveyance during high flows if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar there is a 1 2 m drop of water level in the ecological channel fig 18 a whereas in the navigation channel the water level is almost the same as in the reference case fig 18 b at the downstream end of the training wall there is a slight increasing in water level compared to the reference case 10 cm this could be the influence of the confluence where the parallel channels merge again if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the water level in the ecological channel drops by maximum 50 cm fig 18 c and in the navigation channel by a maximum of 65 cm fig 18 d however near the downstream end of the training wall the water level rises up to 28 cm in this scenario the rise of water level due to the confluence appears more important the effects of using a constant chézy coefficient might have resulted in overestimating the conveyance of the aggrading channel for which the roughness is most likely underestimated at the same time the conveyance of the deepening channel might be slightly underestimated 6 discussion the experiments were carried out on straight channels whereas real rivers present numerous curves the point bars at the inner side of bends may act as steady alternate bars in affecting the distribution of water and sediment between the two parallel channels but river bends also result in spiral flow formation and this might alter the direction of sediment transport for this the presence of river bends might affect the results of this study we therefore recommend studying the effects of a longitudinal training wall in a meandering channel the numerical results were obtained assuming constant hydraulic resistance represented by chézy coefficient however channel deepening might result in smaller hydraulic resistance larger chézy coefficient whereas the channel becoming shallower might result in higher hydraulic resistance smaller chézy coefficient small scale sub grid bedform formation would influence the chézy coefficient as well these effects are not taken into account in the computations moreover due to the alternation of high and low discharges vegetation might colonize the shallow channel during low flow and drastically increase its bed roughness during high flow this can reduce the flood conveyance of the parallel channel system the work considered gravel bed rivers since the laboratory experiments even though sand was used represented a river with gravel bed the characteristics of the laboratory experiments and of the upscaled river are shown in table 1 the subsequent real river case was again a gravel bed river with alternate bars this means that the results are strictly valid only for gravel bed rivers and their applicability on sand bed systems requires further investigation the strategy we propose to train rivers by creating a navigation and ecological channel with a longitudinal wall presents advantages and disadvantages we have shown that the bifurcation created with a longitudinal wall results in an unstable system in which one of the two channels inevitably becomes shallower ideally the ecological channel this channel closes completely only if the discharge is constant with variable discharge it becomes dry at low flows only this would be an advantage for navigation because the flow then concentrates in the other channel increasing the low flow water depth the temporary seasonal closure of the ecological channel however might be a disadvantage for the riverine ecology and this should be further investigated by experts in this field in rivers with hybrid alternate bars rather common in real cases the results show also that if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar the smaller ecological channel experiences sediment deposition and the navigation channel becomes deeper in this case the flood conveyance of the river is not reduced which means that the construction of the longitudinal wall does not increase flood risk in the area adjacent to the river the opposite happens if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the navigation channel silts up and the flood conveyance of the river reduces these results show the importance of well designing the starting point of the longitudinal wall the time scales involved in the processes plays an important role too if the morphological development is slow it could be possible to maintain both channels open by for instance dredging and dumping the deposited sediment from one channel to the other this means that the applicability of the proposed technique requires more research 7 conclusions we studied the possibility of subdividing a river channel in one relatively narrow ecological channel and one navigation channel by means of a longitudinal training wall in the laboratory and by means of numerical simulations we considered channels characterized by the presence of steady alternate bars which are common morphological features hindering river navigation the laboratory experiments show that subdividing a channel presenting steady or slowly migrating alternate bars with a longitudinal training wall might lead to an unstable system in which one of the two parallel channels tends to silt up the results show that the starting point of the longitudinal wall with respect to a bar plays an important role for the morphological evolution of the two channels when the training wall starts at a location in the upstream part of a bar the narrower ecological channel silts up instead when the training wall starts in the pool area between two subsequent bars the same channel deepens and the navigation channel silts up changing the widths of the channels did not change the trends observed in the base case scenario the most stable system is obtained if the longitudinal wall subdivides the river in two equally wide parallel channels changing sediment did not alter the observed trends too with the exception of test s1 finer sediment for which some problems encountered during the experiment did not allow to draw any conclusions for the case starting in the upstream part of a bar one experimental test s2 coarser sediment indicates that a stable system might be obtained if the training wall starts near a bar top but this might not be true with a variable discharge regime and should be further investigated these observations were reproduced numerically in an upscaled version of the laboratory experiments supporting the use of a 2d model based on the numerical code delft3d to investigate this type of systems on a real river case the subsequent use of the code to study the effects of placing a longitudinal training wall in the upper reach of the alpine rhine river described by adami et al 2016 confirms the observed trends and shows that a variable discharge regime does not change the observed trends the conveyance of the channel was studied by comparing the water levels in presence of longitudinal wall with those in a reference scenario without wall the results show that the longitudinal training wall affects high flow water levels only slightly if it starts in the upstream part of a bar in this case a small increase of water level is observed near the downstream end of the longitudinal wall however if the training wall starts in the pool between two bars the raise of high flow level near the end of the longitudinal wall is not negligible even if limited acknowledgments this work is sponsored by vietnam international education

858,plant species are diverse in form function and environmental response this provides enormous potential for designing nature based stormwater treatment technologies such as biofiltration systems however species can vary dramatically in their pollutant removal performance particularly for nitrogen removal currently there is a lack of information on how to efficiently select from the vast palette of species this study aimed to identify plant traits beneficial to performance and create a decision support tool to screen species for further testing a laboratory experiment using 220 biofilter columns paired plant morphological characteristics with nitrogen removal and water loss for 20 australian native species and two lawn grasses testing was undertaken during wet and dry conditions for two biofilter designs saturated zone and free draining an extensive root system and high total biomass were critical to the effective removal of total nitrogen tn and nitrate no3 driven by high nitrogen assimilation the same characteristics were key to performance under dry conditions and were associated with high water use for australian native plants linking assimilation and transpiration the decision support tool uses these scientific relationships and readily available information to identify the morphology natural distribution and stress tolerances likely to be good

in terms of nutrient removal and most particularly nitrogen the difference between a poorly performing leaching biofiltration system and effective removal can hinge upon the choice of plant species bratières et al 2008 lucas and greenway 2011 the imperative for informed plant selection was highlighted by a study finding only 5 out of 20 species effectively reduced effluent total nitrogen concentrations more than non vegetated controls read et al 2008 this variation stems from the complexity of the nitrogen cycle and its interaction with plant characteristics in particular the importance of plant assimilation for the initial processing of incoming no3 entering stormwater biofilters has been demonstrated in a related laboratory study payne et al 2014 in contrast the removal of many heavy metals sediment and micropollutants such as hydrocarbons and pesticides from stormwater runoff is far less sensitive to plant choice and more dependent upon physio chemical processes hatt et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 blecken et al 2011 importantly the pioneering study of read et al 2010 provided our first understanding of the relationships between stormwater biofilter functioning and plant traits noting the importance of fine and extensive root systems for efficient nutrient removal however the study was confined to species from one geographic region tested under regular stormwater inflows and over a relatively short three month period with the authors noting the critical need to expand understanding across a broader range of species and varied environmental conditions more recently some guidelines for biofilter media have shifted towards a lower nutrient sandy substrate henderson et al 2007 bratières et al 2009 and this has been associated with greater consistency between the performance of different plants during frequent inflow periods payne et al 2014 inclusion of a saturated zone also known as an internal water storage zone and carbon source in the lower biofilter layers also acts to minimise performance variation through ongoing treatment of the volume stored between inflow events and provision of a water source to support biological functions in dry periods zinger et al 2013 kim et al 2003 however prolonged dry periods exceeding two weeks a typical characteristic of these ephemeral systems will still reduce performance and

are tailored to suit the local climate plant species and catchment characteristics philadelphia water 2014 thus further laboratory testing of species performance is essential but resource intensive allowing only a limited number of species to be trialled successful expansion of the technology therefore requires a tool to identify the most promising candidates this paper aims to i expand our understanding of the relationships between plant traits and the performance of stormwater biofiltration systems and ii develop a plant selection tool to indicate the likely performance of different

stormwater biofiltration systems it is important to recognise that i the tool was developed using the characteristics and performance of australian native plants ii it incorporates both experimentally tested relationships and simple untested hypotheses and iii it requires ongoing validation and development laboratory testing of the performance of selected species is strongly recommended where feasible particularly in the context of new bioregions and climates while this paper focuses on nitrogen removal and water dynamics future work is required to extend the tool to other aspects of

included 20 plant species native to two geographically distinct australian states 10 from victoria south east and 10 from western australia south west and two common lawn grasses species covered a range of growth forms grasses sedges reeds trees and shrubs table 1 as a large scale laboratory experiment the broad methodology has already been reported in payne et al 2014a 2014b 2017 but details relevant to this paper are presented here where possible species were sourced as tubestock from nurseries from their endemic state velvetenetm austrodanthonia caespitosa cyperus gymnocaulis and carex tereticaulis were sourced from south australian nurseries due to availability and inter state quarantine requirements plants were established individually in large planter bags 150 mm high 300 mm deep filled with loamy sand biofilter media fawb 2009 for six months from april 2010 the plants were stored in the open with twice weekly watering of 200 ml tap water as required to supplement rainfall following this establishment period the plants were transferred to their experimental testing columns in total 220 laboratory scale biofilter columns were used to test the performance of 22 plant species the inclusion exclusion of a saturated zone and carbon source each treatment species x saturated zone no saturated zone was tested using 5 replicates the columns were constructed using 150 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride plastic pipe to a height of 600 mm with clear perspex forming a 200 mm ponding zone the columns were filled with 100 mm of fine 7 10 mm gravel at the base overlain by 200 mm of sand and 300 mm of loamy sand in accordance with biofilter media specifications payne et al 2015 half the columns incorporated a carbon source of sugar cane mulch and pine chips mixed manually and separately throughout the gravel and sand to comprise approximately 5 by volume prior to their placement into layers kim et al 2003 in these same columns the saturated zone was created using a raised outlet pipe 300 mm from the base within the gravel and sand layers 2 2 stormwater dosing and water quality sampling the biofilter columns were placed inside a roofed to prevent rain entry open air greenhouse in melbourne australia and plants established in the columns for six months from november 2010 with twice weekly stormwater dosing this was followed by a 12 month period of sample collection may 2011 to april 2012 which incorporated six months of wet conditions with twice weekly stormwater dosing and four months of dry with intermittent watering across summer months before a return to wet conditions for the final two months during the dry period between 11 to 16 days of drying occurred on four occasions but at other times some intermittent watering at more frequent intervals and typically at reduced volumes was required to prevent plant death a comparison of dry spells from the experiment with the rainfall record is provided in figure s1 in the supplementary

filterable reactive phosphorus frp and nox were sampled monthly as outlined in payne et al 2013 in this paper effluent data from the dry month of december with the longest number of drying days and wet month of april the last month before harvest commenced were used to represent plant species performance the entire outflow was collected in a container and weighed to determine the effluent volume 2 3 harvest immediately prior to installing the plants into the experimental columns an initial plant harvest was conducted on a duplicate set of 220 plants to provide baseline data to calculate plant growth and characterise morphology across a five week period in august and september 2010 throughout the experiment the lawn grasses were regularly trimmed with scissors to an approximate height of 5 8 cm and the clippings collected dried and weighed at the conclusion of the 1 5 years of stormwater dosing the plants from the columns were harvested between june and october 2012 this time frame was required to process the large number of plants but ongoing growth was minimised by the winter period applying only a small volume of tap water to sustain the remaining plants and the mature size of the plants relative to the small column size the effect of further growth on results was also reduced by harvesting columns in a largely randomised order plant roots were washed free of soil and plants were separated into roots stems and leaves reproductive structures flowers or seed heads were present on many of the native australian plants particularly towards late winter and early spring and these were also separated the roots were cut into lengths of approximately 2 4 cm mixed thoroughly in a water filled tub with compressed air bubbles and three sub samples of approximately 10 g each were randomly separated it was not feasible to scan the entire root system due to mature plant sizes instead sub sampling was conducted and the ratio of sub sample dry mass and total dry mass was used to scale data across the entire plant the sub sampling methodology was developed using bootstrapping analysis to determine the number of sub samples required to sufficiently reduce variation in the estimated total root length tested by scanning an entire root system for three species each sub sample was spread out across a perspex water filled tray and scanned epson flatbed scanner with

and divide the data across specified root diameter classes sensitivity analysis was used to select appropriate root diameter classes a sub sample of 20 leaves was collected from each plant scanned and

statistical analyses significant differences in plant characteristics between species and between non saturated and saturated designs were assessed using anova the kolmogorov smirnov test and levene s test were applied to assess the normality and homogeneity of the data respectively when data did not fit the assumptions of normality or homogeneity the data was transformed by the natural logarithm and the non parametric kruskal wallis test was used the same procedure was applied to test the difference in outflow tn concentrations from victorian and western australian vegetated columns the significance of linear correlations between effluent quality or volume loss and plant characteristics was investigated using pearson s product moment correlation and confirmed using spearman rank correlation if data did not meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity non saturated and saturated designs were separated in the analysis analysis was performed using the gplots warnes 2012 fbasics wuertz 2013 and car fox and weisberg 2011 packages within the r software environment r core development team 2012 a critical value of α 0 05 was used for hypothesis tests to study how characteristics differ between species principal component analysis pca was conducted on a sub set of characteristics selected by first conducting the analysis using all characteristics then eliminating characteristics with high co linearity or minimal variation across species the traits incorporated into the pca are listed in table s2 of the supplementary information data were scaled to unit variance and with the functions prcomp and plotted using biplot hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to further investigate species differentiation using plant characteristics averaged across non saturated and saturated designs and standardised to a mean of zero and unit standard deviation using the complete linkage method and hclust function key traits distinguishing clusters were identified from the distance matrix by the highest absolute difference between clusters 3 results 3 1 how do species differ in morpohology it is first necessary to distinguish how plant species differ in their traits before relating these to their functioning in biofilters morphological traits varied widely amongst the 22 plant species tested with species differing in indicators of growth biomass allocation and scale fig 1 additional boxplots in fig s2 supplementary information variable morphology was particularly evident for the sedges reeds and trees tested whereas the grasses both native and lawn species were distinct for their relatively homogeneous morphology with minimal size and relatively limited root systems lawn grasses were also distinct for their much lower relative growth rate rgr compared to australian native species the pca groups together broad plant types and identifies key defining traits the scale of the root system in terms of length surface area and mass and total plant mass were the key traits differentiating plant species dominating the first axis of variation in the principle components analysis which represented 44 of the trait variation in designs with a submerged zone fig 2 and components detailed in table s2 supplementary information again the minimal size and root system of the grasses at the lower end of pc1 x axis fig 2 are distinguished from the extensive root systems and biomass of certain sedges reeds and trees resulting in a tight cluster of grasses on pc1 relative to the scatter for other plant types certain sedges reeds and trees namely carex appressa juncus pallidus and leptospermum continentale are distinct for the key characteristic of high root length and a tendency for higher root surface area root mass length of fine roots total mass and longer shoots also distinguished by the hierarchical cluster analysis fig 3 which additionally includes melaleuca incana based upon the traits contributing the most to variation the second principal component axis pc2 appears to differentiate species by plant biomass allocation between leaves and support mass i e stems or rhizomes y axis fig 2 this axis represents 21 of variation and tends to cluster together the sedges and reeds and shrubs and trees across relatively narrow bands plants with high investment in leaf mass tend to lie at the upper end of the spectrum the monocots incorporating most native grasses sedges and reeds the dicots represented by woody trees or shrubs and herbaceous grasses with runners the lawn grasses or spreading rhizomes sporobolus virginicus tended to lie at the lower end with their high proportion of support mass there do not appear to be distinct groupings based on geographic origin vic or wa finally along the third axis of variation representing 14 of variation species were apparently distinguished by trade offs in the efficiency of resource capture such as light nutrients water and leaf or root tissue thickness or density which influences tissue lifespan table s2 supplementary information ryser and lambers 1995 combined the three axes of variation in the pca explain almost 80 of differences in species morphology it should be noted that the inclusion or exclusion of a saturated zone did not lead to consistent variation in plant species characteristics significant differences given in table s3 supplementary information and for some species there were few or no significant differences for certain species the presence of a saturated zone led to significant differences in root system characteristics such as higher mass length or proportion of fine roots or an increase in total plant mass also noted by glaister et al 2017 for carex appressa conversely other species generally grew better i e increased mass or had deeper roots in non saturated free draining designs table s3 supplementary information in addition despite the differences in stormwater dose volume and geographical origin between plant species from victoria vic and western australia wa the resulting difference in tn outflow concentration for vegetated biofilters grouped together by vic and wa was of little practical significance figure s3 supplementary information as a result the analysis was conducted jointly for all 22 plant species providing a larger data set for the observation of relationships 3 2 relating nitrogen removal to plant species traits plant species characteristics closely correlated with nitrogen removal performance these relationships differed between nitrogen species and between wet twice weekly inflows and dry approximately fortnightly inflows summer temperatures conditions in particular concentrations of nox in biofilter effluent correlated strongly with multiple plant characteristics and tended to dictate similar relationships for tn fig 4 table s4 and figure s5 supplementary information payne et al 2014 provides further species performance data in wet conditions root characteristics including high total length surface area mass and length of fine roots were critical to the effective removal of total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrite nox table 2 and table s4 supplementary information an extensive root system often coincided with high total biomass fig 2 and together these traits reflect the key distinguishing features between species highlighted by the pca and hierarchical cluster analyses with similar groupings of species across the performance spectrum fig 3 and duplicated biplot with groupings based upon performance in figure s4 supplementary information contrasting relationships between plant traits and performance emerge under dry conditions with many correlations between no x and tn removal reversed in their direction or significance generally weaker table 2 and figure s4 supplementary information species with high rgr ulr growth over the experiment or low sla tended to have higher concentrations of tn in the effluent producing poorer biofilter performance compared to the wet period there are some similarities e g juncus pallidus melaleuca incana carex spp and some reversals cyperus gymnocaulis juncus kraussii buffalo dianella spp in the performance rank of the native species while the lawn grasses displayed distinctly effective nitrogen removal these analyses were conducted using all species tested in the experiment but the distinct morphology of the lawn grasses may have skewed the relationships particularly under dry conditions where they exhibited particularly low water loss fig 5 their performance may have been disproportionately influenced by the small column area and perspex ponding zone acting to protect the short lawn grasses from the same degree of drying as taller native plants for this reason the analyses with plant characteristics were repeated excluding the lawn grasses table 2 as expected there were little differences in results under wet conditions but under dry conditions the nitrogen removal performance of native plants in non saturated free draining designs was higher for species with high root length length of fine roots high srl and high sla if a saturated zone was present a slower growth rate high leaf area high ulr and root system concentrated across a shallower depth were significantly associated with lower effluent nitrogen concentrations unlike no x and tn fewer relationships were evident between plant characteristics tested for all species and other nitrogen species table s4 supplementary information effluent concentrations of nh4 were correlated negatively with root depth indices and length of fine roots during the wet month but other relationships were relatively weak organic forms of nitrogen in dissolved and particulate forms which are much less bioavailable than inorganic forms had limited or only weak correlations with plant characteristics 3 3 relating plant characteristics and water loss in this study water loss is defined as the difference between the influent and effluent volume while this indirectly measures the evapotranspiration loss it is also closely tied to outlet design with designs that incorporated a saturated zone providing a reservoir that can be drawn down during dry periods during the wet period and particularly the winter months there was little water loss across any of the treatments and minimal contrast between the plant species or designs with and without a saturated zone in contrast during the dry summer months water loss varied substantially across the vegetated columns and not surprisingly increased significantly when a saturated zone was present p 05 fig 5 under dry conditions the non vegetated controls and columns planted with lawn grasses had low water loss while many native species had relatively higher water loss relationships between the characteristics of native species and water loss indicated that extensive root systems i e high root length root surface area root mass and proportion of fine roots deep roots and high plant growth rate total plant mass above ground mass and leaf mass were significantly correlated with increased water loss table 2 many of these same traits correlate with effective nitrogen removal a greater number of plant characteristics were correlated with water loss and with greater strength when a saturated zone was present in the design the saturated zone provides a greater volume of water available for plant transpiration between stormwater inflows the lawn grasses were excluded from the analysis of plant characteristics due to their different morphology and the greater potential for experimental artefacts to reduce their water loss interestingly the two native grasses sporobolus virginicus and austrodanthonia caespitosa demonstrated the most effective water regulation with low water loss from non saturated free draining designs but high water loss when it was available in a saturated zone however neither species was highly effective for nitrogen removal 4 discussion 4 1 plant species characteristics and optimal biofilter performance 4 1 1 nitrogen removal in wet conditions identifying clear patterns across plant functional types is challenging given the array of current and historical selection agents responsible for the evolution of plant traits reich et al 2003 this study extends the dataset of plant characteristics that have been quantified and related to biofilter functioning for stormwater treatment incorporating species from two geographically distinct parts of australia lawn grasses and also investigating the impact of alternate drying periods on the selection of favourable plant traits the relationships are applied to the development of a decision support tool fig 6 to help designers select from a wider range of flora than the limited number of species that have been tested in laboratory experiments it should be noted that this experiment used single plant columns but species performance can vary significantly under interspecific competition ellerton et al 2012 extensive root systems and high plant biomass were repeatedly highlighted by the different analyses as critical traits differentiating species and their performance for nitrogen removal this is consistent with the findings of read et al 2010 milandri et al 2012 and glaister et al 2017 which variously identified deep roots high root mass root length root surface area plant biomass and growth rate as beneficial to nitrogen removal in stormwater biofiltration these traits allow plants to efficiently and rapidly assimilate inorganic nitrogen from stormwater infiltrating through the filter media forming the primary sink for nitrate payne et al 2014 plant nitrogen acquisition is closely tied to root length robinson 2001 hodge 2006 deep roots were not a prerequisite for effective nitrogen uptake from incoming stormwater indicating the efficiency of dense near surface roots for nitrogen use fitter et al 1991 bodner et al 2013 the effect of scale is also important as plants with higher biomass tend to have increased nitrogen demand from the shoots and an extensive root system to effectively acquire nitrogen maire et al 2009 in related fields other studies have also linked these plant characteristics to nitrogen processing high root length surface area and widespread root tips are beneficial in phytoremediation shimp et al 1993 high plant biomass growth rate transpiration rate and no3 uptake capacity in sewage sludge remediation neuschutz and greger 2010 and in treatment wetlands various combinations of high total plant mass root mass fine root mass root length root porosity i e aerenchyma cells above ground mass and high rates of root oxygenation photosynthesis and transpiration tanner 1996 brisson and chazarenc 2009 lai et al 2012 greenway and woolley 1999 for green rooves plant height indicates growth rate which in turn reflects nitrate removal lundholm et al 2015 it follows that the same plant species characteristics should also facilitate assimilation of nh4 a key source of plant nitrogen from the stormwater and during the wet period nh4 was indeed correlated with characteristics representative of effective assimilation such as root depth and fine root length in the wet period however nh4 removal was much less sensitive to choice of plant species likely due to a relatively consistent contribution from microbial and physical processes nitrification and adsorption respectively within all biofilters 4 1 2 the influence of drying on water loss and nitrogen removal critically when inflows were less frequent dry conditions the relationships with plant characteristics changed prolonged drying leads to an overall decline in nitrogen removal payne et al 2014 mangangka et al 2015 a well documented phenomenon in wetting and drying environments baldwin and mitchell 2000 groffman et al 2004 scholz et al 2002 cui and caldwell 1997 nitrate and organic nitrogen both dissolved and particulate removal by biofiltration is compromised by severe drying payne et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2009 while plant uptake of inorganic nitrogen continues upon re wetting payne 2013 an accumulation of organic nitrogen released from dead microbial and plant cells throughout the dry period is available for flushing there were also reversals and shifts in the relative performance of species between the simulated wet and dry conditions performance for nitrogen removal in dry conditions was related to water loss but the relationship was not straightforward water loss indicates the difference between the influent and effluent volumes passing through the biofilter the extent of evapotranspiration the lawn grasses buffalo and velvetene performed exceptionally well for nitrogen removal likely as a result of their particularly low water loss which reduced the deleterious effects of drying on biofilter function however this performance is likely influenced by limitations of the experimental apparatus namely a small column diameter and perspex ponding zone which reduced evapotranspiration from the short lawn grasses as a result lawn grass characteristics dominated the analysis indicating that species with reduced above ground mass leaf mass slow growth and low biomass were relatively effective for nitrogen removal in dry periods despite the potential experimental artefacts the results demonstrate that very low water loss is beneficial to biofilter functioning under significant drying and the potential benefits of high ground cover when the analysis was repeated without the lawn grasses it indicated that amongst australian native plants extensive root systems and high biomass remained key characteristics for performance in dry conditions plants which showed the most effective nitrogen removal when there is adequate moisture under wet conditions are also those that have high water uptake under dry conditions these plants with high root length biomass and growth demonstrate the links between plant transpiration nutrient assimilation and plant productivity or carbon fixation reich et al 2003 sterling 2017 in stormwater biofilters plants able to maximise their water use also provide effective nitrogen assimilation this protects downstream environments by reducing the nitrogen load volume and frequency of urban stormwater runoff back towards the pre development hydrological regime burns et al 2012 walsh et al 2005 while plant size is a good predictor of both water and nutrient uptake maire et al 2009 lundholm et al 2015 schenk and jackson 2002 the ability of the most effective plants to maintain their nutrient uptake even during dry periods is an important insight for species selection farrell et al s work 2013 suggests that these highly effective species are able to effectively regulate their internal plant water status via stomatal control despite high water use in both wet and dry conditions this demonstrated that drought tolerance can be associated with high water use a capacity known as isohydric and related to a high root biomass farrell et al 2013 the authors used these findings to guide plant selection for green rooves where high water loss and drought survival are both critical to performance identifying certain monocots and herbs from granite outcrop environments with these properties surprisingly the most effective native plants for nitrogen removal were not those with a high capacity to regulate their water use according to its availability such a response which demonstrates high plasticity was exhibited by the native grasses sporobolus virginicus and austrodanthonia caespitosa table s5 supplementary information but these grasses only had medium to poor nitrogen removal again this supports the findings of farrell et al 2012 who also recommended against the selection of succulent species for green rooves due to their low transpiration loss while succulent species may seem an attractive option for biofilters in dry climates the likely loss of nutrient uptake potential and the reduced water retention during wet periods mean that alternative design approaches such as inclusion of a saturated zone to support plant and microbial functioning through extended drying payne et al 2014 zinger et al 2013 would be preferable 4 1 3 other biofilter functions that relate to plant characteristics this work focuses on nitrogen removal and water loss dynamics indicative of evapotranspiration two functions that can differ significantly in response to plant species milandri et al 2012 lundholm et al 2015 farrell et al 2013 wu et al 2017 however there are other key biofilter functions which are not particularly sensitive to the choice of plant species or even plant presence including the removal of most heavy metals sediment and micropollutants such as hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pesticides herbicides which are instead primarily driven by physio chemical processes related to the media hatt et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 blecken et al 2009 the removal of other pollutants does vary between plant species including pathogens phosphorus and certain heavy metals such as iron aluminium and chromium chandrasena et al 2014 feng et al 2012 glaister et al 2014 in addition other aspects of biofilter functioning that are also closely tied to plant characteristics include infiltration capacity virahsawmy et al 2014 rainfall interception philadelphia water 2014 and benefits beyond water treatment such as influences on urban cooling lin and lin 2010 air quality beckett et al 2000 amenity greenery and biodiversity macivor et al 2016 lundholm et al 2015 and use for urban agriculture tom et al 2014 such performance objectives have not been incorporated into the decision support tool as it exceeds the scope of this paper and in many cases there is a lack of data specifically measuring plant traits however in future the tool may be expanded to help designers select plants to meet these additional objectives 4 1 4 plant strategies underlie species function the identified relationships between plant characteristics nutrient removal performance and water uptake or loss from the system reflect different plant adaptive strategies and in turn these are reflected within the decision support tool plant traits are highly inter correlated and tend to occur grouped along spectra dictated by environmental conditions such as climate and soils interspecific competition and unavoidable trade offs ryser 1996 aerts 1999 in particular species compromise between their efficiency of nutrient and carbon capture and its conservation within the plant lavorel et al 2007 wright and westoby 2003 they cannot be simultaneously optimised due to the conflict in resource deployment required wright et al 2004 uptake and growth associated with high biomass photosynthesis transpiration respiration and productivity are maximised by an extensive and fine root system and high leaf area relative to dry mass but efficiency requires thin or low density tissues i e typically high lar sla srl with reduced lifespan a strategy most successful for plant species in nutrient rich habitats lavorel et al 2007 van der krift and berendse 2002 poorter et al 1990 at some point when nutrients become limited an opposing strategy becomes advantageous one that employs resources towards the conservation of nutrients and carbon by strengthening tissues to increase their lifetime low tissue nutrient concentrations and synthesis of chemical compounds for defence against herbivores and microbial attack accompanied by low growth rates wright et al 2004 wink 2010 the two contrasting plant strategies tend to reinforce themselves via positive feedback mechanisms in litter decomposability leading to fast or slow rates of nutrient cycling hobbie 1992 cornwell et al 2008 chapin 2003 both strategies have potential advantages and disadvantages in biofilters effective uptake but rapid turnover potentially leading to nutrient re release versus slow growth and uptake with longer internal plant retention thus reducing the risk of re mobilisation payne et al 2014 it is the former strategy embodying species traits from fertile habitats which appears to most strongly influence biofilter function during its early life this is consistent with an associated study demonstrating the importance of plant nitrogen assimilation to biofilter performance payne et al 2014 however the identity of functional species within systems can change over time allan et al 2011 and more conservative plant strategies may be beneficial within mature biofiltration systems or those experiencing higher environmental stress for example as plants mature their nitrogen uptake may be balanced by returns from biomass turnover and mineralisation processes kadlec et al 2005 hanson et al 1994 this may lead to an increase in the nitrogen flux lost via denitrification or leaching in this case other plant traits may become critical to performance such as slow turnover recalcitrant tissues or characteristics that facilitate denitrification in addition alternative plant strategies may be advantageous when stormwater biofiltration technology is applied to different geographic regions with significantly different evolutionary pressures and environmental conditions to address this longer term uncertainty in addition to planting species with the identified effective characteristics for nitrogen removal incorporating a wider diversity of species is also recommended to buffer the system against a changing environment and ensure greater consistency in function and biomass production over time macivor et al 2016 allan et al 2011 dı az and cabido 2001 4 2 decision support tool for the pre selection of plant species 4 2 1 nitrogen removal while root characteristics are critical to plant performance for nitrogen removal information on below ground traits is not readily available and measurements are extremely time consuming a decision support tool was therefore developed fig 6 to help practitioners to select species for inclusion or exclusion from stormwater biofiltration systems when nitrogen removal is a key performance objective the tool incorporates the experimental outcomes and those of read et al 2010 these have been labelled high reliability indicators it also draws upon simple observations from readily available plant species descriptions labelled lower reliability indicators and available online through floral databases and vegetation management websites the information was tabulated for each species in the current study and patterns were observed relating these reported characteristics to nitrogen removal performance table s5 supplementary information there are exceptions to the observed patterns but the tool s predictive reliability is expected to increase if a number of traits within the decision support tool are met in combination due to their distinctive morphology the lawn grasses were not included in development of the tool observed patterns that emerged from the readily available species characteristics fig 6 include the tendencies for effective plant species to have i natural distributions that include proximity to water bodies or seasonally wet depressions but also capability to survive dry periods i e not obligate wetland species ii high proportion of lateral roots and ability to form a dense mat of fine and fibrous roots near the media surface or reported soil binding roots iii tolerance for sandy soils iv tolerance for periodic inundation and v may include a range of plant types but are more likely to include rushes sedges shrubs and trees these characteristics likely allow effective species to thrive within the biofilter environment support growth and productivity and the rapid uptake of nutrient pulses passing through the filter media during stormwater inflow events traits such as a tolerance of wetting and drying are already recognised as beneficial in design guidelines the prince george s country maryland 2007 conversely observations suggest poorer performing species may have one or more of the following characteristics fig 6 i natural distribution that includes dry inland habitats ii very high tolerances to salt deep shade or nutrient poor soils iii high investment in plant defences against herbivores and pathogens which requires slower growth herms and mattson 1992 iv low tolerance for typical biofilter conditions including periodic inundation drought periods and sandy soils many of these characteristics indicate species that allocate resources for survival in higher stress environments but the unavoidable trade off is slower growth and reduced nutrient uptake reich et al 2003 maire et al 2009 ryser 1996 importantly such species still have a role to play within stormwater biofilters providing diversity and system resilience to changing environmental conditions allan et al 2011 and performance for biofilters located in stressful environments e g high shade saline conditions or very dry climate macivor et al 2016 or treating low nutrient oligotrophic water sources indeed design guidelines from the northern hemisphere recommend salt tolerant species for systems adjacent to roads and parking lots where de icing salts are used shaw and schmidt 2003 the work of szota et al 2015 also demonstrates that certain species can perform effectively for nitrogen removal while surviving under the stress of saline conditions in addition research has demonstrated that plant species effective for nutrient removal need not be present in monoculture or dominant configurations and can be just as effective in mixed plantings alongside poorer performing species ellerton et al 2012 hooper and vitousek 1998 4 2 2 water loss for ecosystem protection the decision support tool evaluating species based upon their water use fig 7 has been developed using the relationships with plant characteristics identified in the current study observations and other studies farrell et al 2013 farrell et al 2012 the relationships will require further testing and it is important to consider other aspects of system functioning such as pollutant removal importantly design features such as a saturated zone in the lower layers of the biofilter also play a vital and significant role in the hydrological function of stormwater biofilters 4 3 validation the tool for nitrogen removal performance was tested using 17 different species with known performance from the read et al 2008 stormwater biofilter study validation results shown in table s6 in supplementary information noting that application of the decision support tool is somewhat subjective the tool correctly selected or rejected 12 plant species i e species effective for nitrogen removal were selected and poor performers were rejected incorrectly rejected one species juncus flavidus which read et al 2008 found to be effective but the tool rejected for its reported preference for heavy soils and poor drought tolerance and did an average job for four species in cases where medium performers were either selected or rejected or goodenia ovata which is an effective performer but the tool only selected as possible as it does not occur in seasonally wet areas only damp zones thus the validation indicated the tool generated reliable plant selection recommendations for 71 of plants poor guidance in 6 of cases and average outcomes for 24 of plants however the performance of some species remains difficult to predict lomandra longifolia is one such species although the decision support tool correctly rejected it due to reported sensitivities some salt tolerance and distribution in rocky environments it shares similar natural habitat to more effective species such as carex appressa and grows well in the biofilter environment but has demonstrated poor nitrogen removal read et al 2010 ellerton et al 2012 in addition some high performing species for nutrient removal also have a degree of salt tolerance as demonstrated by szota et al 2015 e g ficinia nodosa juncus kraussii these contradictions confirm the importance of additional testing and refinement of the relationships within the tool including testing its application to a more diverse range of flora beyond native australian species 5 conclusions this study paired a detailed plant morphological dataset with species performance for nitrogen removal and water balance in a large scale 18 month stormwater biofiltration experiment the results provide our most comprehensive understanding yet of how plant characteristics interact with biofilter function and this was developed into a decision support tool plant characteristics that drive efficient nutrient uptake are essential to biofilter performance for nitrate and total nitrogen removal these include an extensive and fine root system and high plant biomass which provide effective contact with stormwater passing through the filter and plant growth to drive nutrient demand the same characteristics were associated with high evapotranspiration losses in dry conditions from biofilters planted with australian native species thus water and nutrient uptake were linked despite the expected decline in nitrogen removal following drying the most successful species for nutrient removal were distinguished by their high root length in contrast extremely low water loss also led to effective nitrogen removal demonstrated by the lawn grasses while this indicated that reduced above ground mass and slower growth can benefit biofilter performance in dry conditions experimental limitations may have artificially limited evapotranspiration from the lawn grasses the contradiction highlights the benefits of diverse plantings in biofilters and inclusion of a saturated zone to buffer the impact of plant selection on performance and provide a water source through dry spells noting that maintenance is required to replenish the saturated zone throughout extended dry periods the decision support tool brings together scientific findings with observations from accessible plant information and will facilitate the selection of species for use in stormwater biofilters where nitrogen removal or high water loss are key performance objectives further work is required to confirm the untested relationships within the tool validate its use beyond australian native plants and

858,plant species are diverse in form function and environmental response this provides enormous potential for designing nature based stormwater treatment technologies such as biofiltration systems however species can vary dramatically in their pollutant removal performance particularly for nitrogen removal currently there is a lack of information on how to efficiently select from the vast palette of species this study aimed to identify plant traits beneficial to performance and create a decision support tool to screen species for further testing a laboratory experiment using 220 biofilter columns paired plant morphological characteristics with nitrogen removal and water loss for 20 australian native species and two lawn grasses testing was undertaken during wet and dry conditions for two biofilter designs saturated zone and free draining an extensive root system and high total biomass were critical to the effective removal of total nitrogen tn and nitrate no3 driven by high nitrogen assimilation the same characteristics were key to performance under dry conditions and were associated with high water use for australian native plants linking assimilation and

optimal engineering of nature based stormwater treatment technologies requires careful plant species selection success particularly for nutrient removal relies heavily on selecting the correct vegetation read et al 2010 tanner 1996 other aspects of system functioning including amenity microclimate and biodiversity benefits and maintenance costs also depend upon a functional healthy and resilient plant community macivor et al 2016 importantly individual plant species vary enormously in their nutrient uptake biomass allocation tissue composition rate of turnover water relations strategies for resource capture microbial associations and seasonality payne et al 2014 hobbie et al 2007 hinsinger et al 2009 these differences can have significant implications on system functioning and water treatment performance read et al 2008 milandri et al 2012 biofiltration systems also known as raingardens or bioretention systems are a nature based technology that intercept and treat urban stormwater runoff using vertical filtration through vegetated layers of filter media davis et al 2006 the systems effectively reduce the concentrations and loads of urban stormwater pollutants including sediment heavy metals nutrients pathogens and micropollutants and reduce the volume and frequency of stormwater runoff hatt et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 henderson et al 2007 hunt et al 2008 chandrasena et al 2014 in doing so biofilters help to protect the health of sensitive downstream receiving waters or provide treated water for harvesting purposes e g irrigation toilet flushing the essential roles that plants provide in biofiltration are widely recognised in design guidelines globally many of which provide detailed planting lists the prince george s country maryland 2007 shaw and schmidt 2003 philadelphia water 2014 credit valley conservation 2010 oversby et al 2014 these provide excellent guidance for local plants that will survive in varied biofilter environments however in terms of nutrient removal and most particularly nitrogen the difference between a poorly performing leaching biofiltration system and effective removal can hinge upon the choice of plant species bratières et al 2008 lucas and greenway 2011 the imperative for informed plant selection was highlighted by a study finding only 5 out of 20 species effectively reduced effluent total nitrogen concentrations more than non vegetated controls read et al 2008 this variation stems from the complexity of the nitrogen cycle and its interaction with plant characteristics in particular the importance of plant assimilation for the initial processing of incoming no3 entering stormwater biofilters has been demonstrated in a related laboratory study payne et al 2014 in contrast the removal of many heavy metals sediment and micropollutants such as hydrocarbons and pesticides from stormwater runoff is far less sensitive to plant choice and more dependent upon physio chemical processes hatt et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 blecken et al 2011 importantly the pioneering study of read et al 2010 provided our first understanding of the relationships between stormwater biofilter functioning and plant traits noting the importance of fine and extensive root systems for efficient nutrient removal however the study was confined to species from one geographic region tested under regular stormwater inflows and over a relatively short three month period with the authors noting the critical need to expand understanding across a broader range of species and varied environmental conditions more recently some guidelines for biofilter media have shifted towards a lower nutrient sandy substrate henderson et al 2007 bratières et al 2009 and this has been associated with greater consistency between the performance of different plants during frequent inflow periods payne et al 2014 inclusion of a saturated zone also known as an internal water storage zone and carbon source in the lower biofilter layers also acts to minimise performance variation through ongoing treatment of the volume stored between inflow events and provision of a water source to support biological functions in dry periods zinger et al 2013 kim et al 2003 however prolonged dry periods exceeding two weeks a typical characteristic of these ephemeral systems will still reduce performance and exacerbate species differences zinger et al 2007 as the use of biofiltration systems widens to new regions and countries milandri et al 2012 blecken et al 2011 trowsdale and simcock 2011 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 autixier et al 2014 the use of local flora offers a whole new range of possibilities stormwater biofiltration technology is site specific with greatest success likely if designs are tailored to suit the local climate plant species and catchment characteristics philadelphia water 2014 thus further laboratory testing of species performance is essential but resource intensive allowing only a limited number of species to be trialled successful expansion of the technology therefore requires a tool to identify the most promising candidates this paper aims to i expand our understanding of the relationships between plant traits and the performance of stormwater biofiltration systems and ii develop a plant selection tool to indicate the likely performance of different plants using readily available species information uniquely it reports results from a detailed plant harvest for 22 species from two geographically distinct regions the south east in victoria and south west of australia in western australia paired with species performance in lab scale biofiltration columns tested under both wet and dry conditions over an 18 month period in terms of our understanding of biofilter functioning this work expands the number species tested the geographic range of plants the duration of growth and climatic conditions simulated these results form a subset from a large 18 month experimental study investigating the performance and internal processes of 220 vegetated biofilter columns results have already been published detailing nitrogen removal

nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 within the biofilter columns payne et al 2017 the decision support tool is intended to help designers choose species when incorporating untested plant species into stormwater biofiltration systems it is important to recognise that i the tool was developed using the characteristics and performance of australian native plants ii it incorporates both experimentally tested relationships and simple untested hypotheses and iii it requires ongoing validation and development laboratory testing of the performance of selected species is strongly recommended where feasible particularly in the context of new bioregions and climates while this paper focuses on nitrogen removal and water dynamics future work is required to extend the tool to other aspects of biofilter functioning also sensitive to plant choice including pathogen removal infiltration capacity urban cooling urban agriculture and amenity 2 methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment included 20 plant species native to two geographically distinct australian states 10 from victoria south east and 10 from western australia south west and two common lawn grasses species covered a range of growth forms grasses sedges reeds trees and shrubs table 1 as a large scale laboratory experiment the broad methodology has already been reported in payne et al 2014a 2014b 2017 but details relevant to this paper are presented here where possible species were sourced as tubestock from nurseries from their endemic state velvetenetm austrodanthonia caespitosa cyperus gymnocaulis and carex tereticaulis were sourced from south australian nurseries due to availability and inter state quarantine requirements plants were established individually in large planter bags 150 mm high 300 mm deep filled with loamy sand biofilter media fawb 2009 for six months from april 2010 the plants were stored in the open with twice weekly watering of 200 ml tap water as required to supplement rainfall following this establishment period the plants were transferred to their experimental testing columns in total 220 laboratory scale biofilter columns were used to test the performance of 22 plant species the inclusion exclusion of a saturated zone and carbon source each treatment species x saturated zone no saturated zone was tested using 5 replicates the columns were constructed using 150 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride plastic pipe to a height of 600 mm with clear perspex forming a 200 mm ponding zone the columns were filled with 100 mm of fine 7 10 mm gravel at the base overlain by 200 mm of sand and 300 mm of loamy sand in accordance with biofilter media specifications payne et al 2015 half the columns incorporated a carbon source of sugar cane mulch and pine chips mixed manually and separately throughout the gravel and sand to comprise approximately 5 by volume prior to their placement into layers kim et al 2003 in these same columns the saturated zone was created using a raised outlet pipe 300 mm from the base within the gravel and sand layers 2 2 stormwater dosing and water quality sampling the biofilter columns were placed inside a roofed to prevent rain entry open air greenhouse in melbourne australia and plants established in the columns for six months from november 2010 with twice weekly stormwater dosing this was followed by a 12 month period of sample collection may 2011 to april 2012 which incorporated six months of wet conditions with twice weekly stormwater dosing and four months of dry with intermittent watering across summer months before a return to wet conditions for the final two months during the dry period between 11 to 16 days of drying occurred on four occasions but at other times some intermittent watering at more frequent intervals and typically at reduced volumes was required to prevent plant death a comparison of dry spells from the experiment with the rainfall record is provided in figure s1 in the supplementary information noting that the small column volume and greenhouse facility likely exposed the plants to greater heat stress than in bulk soil conditions the semi natural stormwater comprised sediment from a local stormwater retention wetland sieved to 1 mm particle size and mixed with de chlorinated tapwater hatt et al 2007 to target a total suspended solids tss concentration of 150 mg l consistent with a global analysis of urban stormwater composition duncan and hp 1999 laboratory chemicals potassium nitrate ammonium chloride nicotinic acid potassium phosphate and sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate were added to target typical urban stormwater nutrient concentrations based upon worldwide duncan and hp 1999 and melbourne australia data taylor et al 2005 based upon monthly inflow samples collected across 12 months on average the semi natural stormwater comprised total nitrogen tn 2 21 mg l 0 21 mg l standard deviation nitrate nitrite nox 0 99 mg l 0 06 mg l ammonium nh4 0 41

filterable reactive phosphorus frp and nox were sampled monthly as outlined in payne et al 2013 in this paper effluent data from the dry month of december with the longest number of drying days and wet month of april the last month before harvest commenced were used to represent plant species performance the entire outflow was collected in a container and weighed to determine the effluent volume 2 3 harvest immediately prior to installing the plants into the experimental columns an initial plant harvest was conducted on a duplicate set of 220 plants to provide baseline data to calculate plant growth and characterise morphology across a five week period in august and september 2010 throughout the experiment the lawn grasses were regularly trimmed with scissors to an approximate height of 5 8 cm and the clippings collected dried and weighed at the conclusion of the 1 5 years of stormwater dosing the plants from the columns were harvested between june and october 2012 this time frame was required to process the large number of plants but ongoing growth was minimised by the winter period applying only a small volume of tap water to sustain the remaining plants and the mature size of the plants relative to the small column size the effect of further growth on results was also reduced by harvesting columns in a largely randomised order plant roots were washed free of soil and plants were separated into roots stems and leaves reproductive structures flowers or seed heads were present on many of the native australian plants particularly towards late winter and early spring and these were also separated the roots were cut into lengths of approximately 2 4 cm mixed thoroughly in a water filled tub with compressed air bubbles and three sub samples of approximately 10 g each were randomly separated it was not feasible to scan the entire root system due to mature plant sizes instead sub sampling was conducted and the ratio of sub sample dry mass and total dry mass was used to scale data across the entire plant the sub sampling methodology was developed using bootstrapping analysis to determine the number of sub samples required to sufficiently reduce variation in the estimated total root length tested by scanning an entire root system for three species each sub sample was spread out across a perspex water filled tray and scanned epson flatbed scanner with epson expression 10000xl 1 8 v3 49 driver software winrhizo software v 2009c regent instruments canada inc analysed the image to determine the total root length surface area volume average diameter and divide the data across specified root diameter classes sensitivity analysis was used to select appropriate root diameter classes a sub sample of 20 leaves was collected from each plant scanned and leaf area analysed using winrhizo separated plant components were oven dried at 60 c to constant mass and weighed the set of plant morphological and growth parameters determined from the plant harvest is similar to the parameters utilised by read et al 2010 table s1 supplementary information the relative growth rate rgr eq 1 and unit leaf rate ulr eq 2 were both determined using dry mass components

statistical analyses significant differences in plant characteristics between species and between non saturated and saturated designs were assessed using anova the kolmogorov smirnov test and levene s test were applied to assess the normality and homogeneity of the data respectively when data did not fit the assumptions of normality or homogeneity the data was transformed by the natural logarithm and the non parametric kruskal wallis test was used the same procedure was applied to test the difference in outflow tn concentrations from victorian and western australian vegetated columns the significance of linear correlations between effluent quality or volume loss and plant characteristics was investigated using pearson s product moment correlation and confirmed using spearman rank correlation if data did not meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity non saturated and saturated designs were separated in the analysis analysis was performed using the gplots warnes 2012 fbasics wuertz 2013 and car fox and weisberg 2011 packages within the r software environment r core development team 2012 a critical value of α 0 05 was used for hypothesis tests to study how characteristics differ between species principal component analysis pca was conducted on a sub set of characteristics selected by first conducting the analysis using all characteristics then eliminating characteristics with high co linearity or minimal variation across species the traits incorporated into the pca are listed in table s2 of the supplementary information data were scaled to unit variance and with the functions prcomp and plotted using biplot hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to further investigate species differentiation using plant characteristics averaged across non saturated and saturated designs and standardised to a mean of zero and unit standard deviation using the complete linkage method and hclust function key traits distinguishing clusters were identified from the distance matrix by the highest absolute difference between clusters 3 results 3 1 how do species differ in morpohology it is first necessary to distinguish how plant species differ in their traits before relating these to their functioning in biofilters morphological traits varied widely amongst the 22 plant species tested with species differing in indicators of growth biomass allocation and scale fig 1 additional boxplots in fig s2 supplementary information variable morphology was particularly evident for the sedges reeds and trees tested whereas the grasses both native and lawn species were distinct for their relatively homogeneous morphology with minimal size and relatively limited root systems lawn grasses were also distinct for their much lower relative growth rate rgr compared to australian native species the pca groups together broad plant types and identifies key defining traits the scale of the root system in terms of length surface area and mass and total plant mass were the key traits differentiating plant species dominating the first axis of variation in the principle components analysis which represented 44 of the trait variation in designs with a submerged zone fig 2 and components detailed in table s2 supplementary information again the minimal size and root system of the grasses at the lower end of pc1 x axis fig 2 are distinguished from the extensive root systems and biomass of certain sedges reeds and trees resulting in a tight cluster of grasses on pc1 relative to the scatter for other plant types certain sedges reeds and trees namely carex appressa juncus pallidus and leptospermum continentale are distinct for the key characteristic of high root length and a tendency for higher root surface area root mass length of fine roots total mass and longer shoots also distinguished by the hierarchical cluster analysis fig 3 which additionally includes melaleuca incana based upon the traits contributing the most to variation the second principal component axis pc2 appears to differentiate species by plant biomass allocation between leaves and support mass i e stems or rhizomes y axis fig 2 this axis represents 21 of variation and tends to cluster together the sedges and reeds and shrubs and trees across relatively narrow bands plants with high investment in leaf mass tend to lie at the upper end of the spectrum the monocots incorporating most native grasses sedges and reeds the dicots represented by woody trees or shrubs and herbaceous grasses with runners the lawn grasses or spreading rhizomes sporobolus virginicus tended to lie at the lower end with their high proportion of support mass there do not appear to be distinct groupings based on geographic origin vic or wa finally along the third axis of variation representing 14 of variation species were apparently distinguished by trade offs in the efficiency of resource capture such as light nutrients water and leaf or root tissue thickness or density which influences tissue lifespan table s2 supplementary information ryser and lambers 1995 combined the three axes of variation in the pca explain almost 80 of differences in species morphology it should be noted that the inclusion or exclusion of a saturated zone did not lead to consistent variation in plant species characteristics significant differences given in table s3 supplementary information and for some species there were few or no significant differences for certain species the presence of a saturated zone led to significant differences in root system characteristics such as higher mass length or proportion of fine roots or an increase in total plant mass also noted by glaister et al 2017 for carex appressa conversely other species generally grew better i e increased mass or had deeper roots in non saturated free draining designs table s3 supplementary information in addition despite the differences in stormwater dose volume and geographical origin between plant species from victoria vic and western australia wa the resulting difference in tn outflow concentration for vegetated biofilters grouped together by vic and wa was of little practical significance figure s3 supplementary information as a result the analysis was conducted jointly for all 22 plant species providing a larger data set for the observation of relationships 3 2 relating nitrogen removal to plant species traits plant species characteristics closely correlated with nitrogen removal performance these relationships differed between nitrogen species and between wet twice weekly inflows and dry approximately fortnightly inflows summer temperatures conditions in particular concentrations of nox in biofilter effluent correlated strongly with multiple plant characteristics and tended to dictate similar relationships for tn fig 4 table s4 and figure s5 supplementary information payne et al 2014 provides further species performance data in wet conditions root characteristics including high total length surface area mass and length of fine roots were critical to the effective removal of total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrite nox table 2 and table s4 supplementary information an extensive root system often coincided with high total biomass fig 2 and together these traits reflect the key distinguishing features between species highlighted by the pca and hierarchical cluster analyses with similar groupings of species across the performance spectrum fig 3 and duplicated biplot with groupings based upon performance in figure s4 supplementary information contrasting relationships between plant traits and performance emerge under dry conditions with many correlations between no x and tn removal reversed in their direction or significance generally weaker table 2 and figure s4 supplementary information species with high rgr ulr growth over the experiment or low sla tended to have higher concentrations of tn in the effluent producing poorer biofilter performance compared to the wet period there are some similarities e g juncus pallidus melaleuca incana carex spp and some reversals cyperus gymnocaulis juncus kraussii buffalo dianella spp in the performance rank of the native species while the lawn grasses displayed distinctly effective nitrogen removal these analyses were conducted using all species tested in the experiment but the distinct morphology of the lawn grasses may have skewed the relationships particularly under dry conditions where they exhibited particularly low water loss fig 5 their performance may have been disproportionately influenced by the small column area and perspex ponding zone acting to protect the short lawn grasses from the same degree of drying as taller native plants for this reason the analyses with plant characteristics were repeated excluding the lawn grasses table 2 as expected there were little differences in results under wet conditions but under dry conditions the nitrogen removal performance of native plants in non saturated free draining designs was higher for species with high root length length of fine roots high srl and high sla if a saturated zone was present a slower growth rate high leaf area high ulr and root system concentrated across a shallower depth were significantly associated with lower effluent nitrogen concentrations unlike no x and tn fewer relationships were evident between plant characteristics tested for all species and other nitrogen species table s4 supplementary information effluent concentrations of nh4 were correlated negatively with root depth indices and length of fine roots during the wet month but other relationships were relatively weak organic forms of nitrogen in dissolved and particulate forms which are much less bioavailable than inorganic forms had limited or only weak correlations with plant characteristics 3 3 relating plant characteristics and water loss in this study water loss is defined as the difference between the influent and effluent volume while this indirectly measures the evapotranspiration loss it is also closely tied to outlet design with designs that incorporated a saturated zone providing a reservoir that can be drawn down during dry periods during the wet period and particularly the winter months there was little water loss across any of the treatments and minimal contrast between the plant species or designs with and without a saturated zone in contrast during the dry summer months water loss varied substantially across the vegetated columns and not surprisingly increased significantly when a saturated zone was present p 05 fig 5 under dry conditions the non vegetated controls and columns planted with lawn grasses had low water loss while many native species had relatively higher water loss relationships between the characteristics of native species and water loss indicated that extensive root systems i e high root length root surface area root mass and proportion of fine roots deep roots and high plant growth rate total plant mass above ground mass and leaf mass were significantly correlated with increased water loss table 2 many of these same traits correlate with effective nitrogen removal a greater number of plant characteristics were correlated with water loss and with greater strength when a saturated zone was present in the design the saturated zone provides a greater volume of water available for plant transpiration between stormwater inflows the lawn grasses were excluded from the analysis of plant characteristics due to their different morphology and the greater potential for experimental artefacts to reduce their water loss interestingly the two native grasses sporobolus virginicus and austrodanthonia caespitosa demonstrated the most effective water regulation with low water loss from non saturated free draining designs but high water loss when it was available in a saturated zone however neither species was highly effective for nitrogen removal 4 discussion 4 1 plant species characteristics and optimal biofilter performance 4 1 1 nitrogen removal in wet conditions identifying clear patterns across plant functional types is challenging given the array of current and historical selection agents responsible for the evolution of plant traits reich et al 2003 this study extends the dataset of plant characteristics that have been quantified and related to biofilter functioning for stormwater treatment incorporating species from two geographically distinct parts of australia lawn grasses and also investigating the impact of alternate drying periods on the selection of favourable plant traits the relationships are applied to the development of a decision support tool fig 6 to help designers select from a wider range of flora than the limited number of species that have been tested in laboratory experiments it should be noted that this experiment used single plant columns but species performance can vary significantly under interspecific competition ellerton et al 2012 extensive root systems and high plant biomass were repeatedly highlighted by the different analyses as critical traits differentiating species and their performance for nitrogen removal this is consistent with the findings of read et al 2010 milandri et al 2012 and glaister et al 2017 which variously identified deep roots high root mass root length root surface area plant biomass and growth rate as beneficial to nitrogen removal in stormwater biofiltration these traits allow plants to efficiently and rapidly assimilate inorganic nitrogen from stormwater infiltrating through the filter media forming the primary sink for nitrate payne et al 2014 plant nitrogen acquisition is closely tied to root length robinson 2001 hodge 2006 deep roots were not a prerequisite for effective nitrogen uptake from incoming stormwater indicating the efficiency of dense near surface roots for nitrogen use fitter et al 1991 bodner et al 2013 the effect of scale is also important as plants with higher biomass tend to have increased nitrogen demand from the shoots and an extensive root system to effectively acquire nitrogen maire et al 2009 in related fields other studies have also linked these plant characteristics to nitrogen processing high root length surface area and widespread root tips are beneficial in phytoremediation shimp et al 1993 high plant biomass growth rate transpiration rate and no3 uptake capacity in sewage sludge remediation neuschutz and greger 2010 and in treatment wetlands various combinations of high total plant mass root mass fine root mass root length root porosity i e aerenchyma cells above ground mass and high rates of root oxygenation photosynthesis and transpiration tanner 1996 brisson and chazarenc 2009 lai et al 2012 greenway and woolley 1999 for green rooves plant height indicates growth rate which in turn reflects nitrate removal lundholm et al 2015 it follows that the same plant species characteristics should also facilitate assimilation of nh4 a key source of plant nitrogen from the stormwater and during the wet period nh4 was indeed correlated with characteristics representative of effective assimilation such as root depth and fine root length in the wet period however nh4 removal was much less sensitive to choice of plant species likely due to a relatively consistent contribution from microbial and physical processes nitrification and adsorption respectively within all biofilters 4 1 2 the influence of drying on water loss and nitrogen removal critically when inflows were less frequent dry conditions the relationships with plant characteristics changed prolonged drying leads to an overall decline in nitrogen removal payne et al 2014 mangangka et al 2015 a well documented phenomenon in wetting and drying environments baldwin and mitchell 2000 groffman et al 2004 scholz et al 2002 cui and caldwell 1997 nitrate and organic nitrogen both dissolved and particulate removal by biofiltration is compromised by severe drying payne et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2009 while plant uptake of inorganic nitrogen continues upon re wetting payne 2013 an accumulation of organic nitrogen released from dead microbial and plant cells throughout the dry period is available for flushing there were also reversals and shifts in the relative performance of species between the simulated wet and dry conditions performance for nitrogen removal in dry conditions was related to water loss but the relationship was not straightforward water loss indicates the difference between the influent and effluent volumes passing through the biofilter the extent of evapotranspiration the lawn grasses buffalo and velvetene performed exceptionally well for nitrogen removal likely as a result of their particularly low water loss which reduced the deleterious effects of drying on biofilter function however this performance is likely influenced by limitations of the experimental apparatus namely a small column diameter and perspex ponding zone which reduced evapotranspiration from the short lawn grasses as a result lawn grass characteristics dominated the analysis indicating that species with reduced above ground mass leaf mass slow growth and low biomass were relatively effective for nitrogen removal in dry periods despite the potential experimental artefacts the results demonstrate that very low water loss is beneficial to biofilter functioning under significant drying and the potential benefits of high ground cover when the analysis was repeated without the lawn grasses it indicated that amongst australian native plants extensive root systems and high biomass remained key characteristics for performance in dry conditions plants which showed the most effective nitrogen removal when there is adequate moisture under wet conditions are also those that have high water uptake under dry conditions these plants with high root length biomass and growth demonstrate the links between plant transpiration nutrient assimilation and plant productivity or carbon fixation reich et al 2003 sterling 2017 in stormwater biofilters plants able to maximise their water use also provide effective nitrogen assimilation this protects downstream environments by reducing the nitrogen load volume and frequency of urban stormwater runoff back towards the pre development hydrological regime burns et al 2012 walsh et al 2005 while plant size is a good predictor of both water and nutrient uptake maire et al 2009 lundholm et al 2015 schenk and jackson 2002 the ability of the most effective plants to maintain their nutrient uptake even during dry periods is an important insight for species selection farrell et al s work 2013 suggests that these highly effective species are able to effectively regulate their internal plant water status via stomatal control despite high water use in both wet and dry conditions this demonstrated that drought tolerance can be associated with high water use a capacity known as isohydric and related to a high root biomass farrell et al 2013 the authors used these findings to guide plant selection for green rooves where high water loss and drought survival are both critical to performance identifying certain monocots and herbs from granite outcrop environments with these properties surprisingly the most effective native plants for nitrogen removal were not those with a high capacity to regulate their water use according to its availability such a response which demonstrates high plasticity was exhibited by the native grasses sporobolus virginicus and austrodanthonia caespitosa table s5 supplementary information but these grasses only had medium to poor nitrogen removal again this supports the findings of farrell et al 2012 who also recommended against the selection of succulent species for green rooves due to their low transpiration loss while succulent species may seem an attractive option for biofilters in dry climates the likely loss of nutrient uptake potential and the reduced water retention during wet periods mean that alternative design approaches such as inclusion of a saturated zone to support plant and microbial functioning through extended drying payne et al 2014 zinger et al 2013 would be preferable 4 1 3 other biofilter functions that relate to plant characteristics this work focuses on nitrogen removal and water loss dynamics indicative of evapotranspiration two functions that can differ significantly in response to plant species milandri et al 2012 lundholm et al 2015 farrell et al 2013 wu et al 2017 however there are other key biofilter functions which are not particularly sensitive to the choice of plant species or even plant presence including the removal of most heavy metals sediment and micropollutants such as hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pesticides herbicides which are instead primarily driven by physio chemical processes related to the media hatt et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 blecken et al 2009 the removal of other pollutants does vary between plant species including pathogens phosphorus and certain heavy metals such as iron aluminium and chromium chandrasena et al 2014 feng et al 2012 glaister et al 2014 in addition other aspects of biofilter functioning that are also closely tied to plant characteristics include infiltration capacity virahsawmy et al 2014 rainfall interception philadelphia water 2014 and benefits beyond water treatment such as influences on urban cooling lin and lin 2010 air quality beckett et al 2000 amenity greenery and biodiversity macivor et al 2016 lundholm et al 2015 and use for urban agriculture tom et al 2014 such performance objectives have not been incorporated into the decision support tool as it exceeds the scope of this paper and in many cases there is a lack of data specifically measuring plant traits however in future the tool may be expanded to help designers select plants to meet these additional objectives 4 1 4 plant strategies underlie species function the identified relationships between plant characteristics nutrient removal performance and water uptake or loss from the system reflect different plant adaptive strategies and in turn these are reflected within the decision support tool plant traits are highly inter correlated and tend to occur grouped along spectra dictated by environmental conditions such as climate and soils interspecific competition and unavoidable trade offs ryser 1996 aerts 1999 in particular species compromise between their efficiency of nutrient and carbon capture and its conservation within the plant lavorel et al 2007 wright and westoby 2003 they cannot be simultaneously optimised due to the conflict in resource deployment required wright et al 2004 uptake and growth associated with high biomass photosynthesis transpiration respiration and productivity are maximised by an extensive and fine root system and high leaf area relative to dry mass but efficiency requires thin or low density tissues i e typically high lar sla srl with reduced lifespan a strategy most successful for plant species in nutrient rich habitats lavorel et al 2007 van der krift and berendse 2002 poorter et al 1990 at some point when nutrients become limited an opposing strategy becomes advantageous one that employs resources towards the conservation of nutrients and carbon by strengthening tissues to increase their lifetime low tissue nutrient concentrations and synthesis of chemical compounds for defence against herbivores and microbial attack accompanied by low growth rates wright et al 2004 wink 2010 the two contrasting plant strategies tend to reinforce themselves via positive feedback mechanisms in litter decomposability leading to fast or slow rates of nutrient cycling hobbie 1992 cornwell et al 2008 chapin 2003 both strategies have potential advantages and disadvantages in biofilters effective uptake but rapid turnover potentially leading to nutrient re release versus slow growth and uptake with longer internal plant retention thus reducing the risk of re mobilisation payne et al 2014 it is the former strategy embodying species traits from fertile habitats which appears to most strongly influence biofilter function during its early life this is consistent with an associated study demonstrating the importance of plant nitrogen assimilation to biofilter performance payne et al 2014 however the identity of functional species within systems can change over time allan et al 2011 and more conservative plant strategies may be beneficial within mature biofiltration systems or those experiencing higher environmental stress for example as plants mature their nitrogen uptake may be balanced by returns from biomass turnover and mineralisation processes kadlec et al 2005 hanson et al 1994 this may lead to an increase in the nitrogen flux lost via denitrification or leaching in this case other plant traits may become critical to performance such as slow turnover recalcitrant tissues or characteristics that facilitate denitrification in addition alternative plant strategies may be advantageous when stormwater biofiltration technology is applied to different geographic regions with significantly different evolutionary pressures and environmental conditions to address this longer term uncertainty in addition to planting species with the identified effective characteristics for nitrogen removal incorporating a wider diversity of species is also recommended to buffer the system against a changing environment and ensure greater consistency in function and biomass production over time macivor et al 2016 allan et al 2011 dı az and cabido 2001 4 2 decision support tool for the pre selection of plant species 4 2 1 nitrogen removal while root characteristics are critical to plant performance for nitrogen removal information on below ground traits is not readily available and measurements are extremely time consuming a decision support tool was therefore developed fig 6 to help practitioners to select species for inclusion or exclusion from stormwater biofiltration systems when nitrogen removal is a key performance objective the tool incorporates the experimental outcomes and those of read et al 2010 these have been labelled high reliability indicators it also draws upon simple observations from readily available plant species descriptions labelled lower reliability indicators and available online through floral databases and vegetation management websites the information was tabulated for each species in the current study and patterns were observed relating these reported characteristics to nitrogen removal performance table s5 supplementary information there are exceptions to the observed patterns but the tool s predictive reliability is expected to increase if a number of traits within the decision support tool are met in combination due to their distinctive morphology the lawn grasses were not included in development of the tool observed patterns that emerged from the readily available species characteristics fig 6 include the tendencies for effective plant species to have i natural distributions that include proximity to water bodies or seasonally wet depressions but also capability to survive dry periods i e not obligate wetland species ii high proportion of lateral roots and ability to form a dense mat of fine and fibrous roots near the media surface or reported soil binding roots iii tolerance for sandy soils iv tolerance for periodic inundation and v may include a range of plant types but are more likely to include rushes sedges shrubs and trees these characteristics likely allow effective species to thrive within the biofilter environment support growth and productivity and the rapid uptake of nutrient pulses passing through the filter media during stormwater inflow events traits such as a tolerance of wetting and drying are already recognised as beneficial in design guidelines the prince george s country maryland 2007 conversely observations suggest poorer performing species may have one or more of the following characteristics fig 6 i natural distribution that includes dry inland habitats ii very high tolerances to salt deep shade or nutrient poor soils iii high investment in plant defences against herbivores and pathogens which requires slower growth herms and mattson 1992 iv low tolerance for typical biofilter conditions including periodic inundation drought periods and sandy soils many of these characteristics indicate species that allocate resources for survival in higher stress environments but the unavoidable trade off is slower growth and reduced nutrient uptake reich et al 2003 maire et al 2009 ryser 1996 importantly such species still have a role to play within stormwater biofilters providing diversity and system resilience to changing environmental conditions allan et al 2011 and performance for biofilters located in stressful environments e g high shade saline conditions or very dry climate macivor et al 2016 or treating low nutrient oligotrophic water sources indeed design guidelines from the northern hemisphere recommend salt tolerant species for systems adjacent to roads and parking lots where de icing salts are used shaw and schmidt 2003 the work of szota et al 2015 also demonstrates that certain species can perform effectively for nitrogen removal while surviving under the stress of saline conditions in addition research has demonstrated that plant species effective for nutrient removal need not be present in monoculture or dominant configurations and can be just as effective in mixed plantings alongside poorer performing species ellerton et al 2012 hooper and vitousek 1998 4 2 2 water loss for ecosystem protection the decision support tool evaluating species based upon their water use fig 7 has been developed using the relationships with plant characteristics identified in the current study observations and other studies farrell et al 2013 farrell et al 2012 the relationships will require further testing and it is important to consider other aspects of system functioning such as pollutant removal importantly design features such as a saturated zone in the lower layers of the biofilter also play a vital and significant role in the hydrological function of stormwater biofilters 4 3 validation the tool for nitrogen removal performance was tested using 17 different species with known performance from the read et al 2008 stormwater biofilter study validation results shown in table s6 in supplementary information noting that application of the decision support tool is somewhat subjective the tool correctly selected or rejected 12 plant species i e species effective for nitrogen removal were selected and poor performers were rejected incorrectly rejected one species juncus flavidus which read et al 2008 found to be effective but the tool rejected for its reported preference for heavy soils and poor drought tolerance and did an average job for four species in cases where medium performers were either selected or rejected or goodenia ovata which is an effective performer but the tool only selected as possible as it does not occur in seasonally wet areas only damp zones thus the validation indicated the tool generated reliable plant selection recommendations for 71 of plants poor guidance in 6 of cases and average outcomes for 24 of plants however the performance of some species remains difficult to predict lomandra longifolia is one such species although the decision support tool correctly rejected it due to reported sensitivities some salt tolerance and distribution in rocky environments it shares similar natural habitat to more effective species such as carex appressa and grows well in the biofilter environment but has demonstrated poor nitrogen removal read et al 2010 ellerton et al 2012 in addition some high performing species for nutrient removal also have a degree of salt tolerance as demonstrated by szota et al 2015 e g ficinia nodosa juncus kraussii these contradictions confirm the importance of additional testing and refinement of the relationships within the tool including testing its application to a more diverse range of flora beyond native australian species 5 conclusions this study paired a detailed plant morphological dataset with species performance for nitrogen removal and water balance in a large scale 18 month stormwater biofiltration experiment the results provide our most comprehensive understanding yet of how plant characteristics interact with biofilter function and this was developed into a decision support tool plant characteristics that drive efficient nutrient uptake are essential to biofilter performance for nitrate and total nitrogen removal these include an extensive and fine root system and high plant biomass which provide effective contact with stormwater passing through the filter and plant growth to drive nutrient demand the same characteristics were associated with high evapotranspiration losses in dry conditions from biofilters planted with australian native species thus water and nutrient uptake were linked despite the expected decline in nitrogen removal following drying the most successful species for nutrient removal were distinguished by their high root length in contrast extremely low water loss also led to effective nitrogen removal demonstrated by the lawn grasses while this indicated that reduced above ground mass and slower growth can benefit biofilter performance in dry conditions experimental limitations may have artificially limited evapotranspiration from the lawn grasses the contradiction highlights the benefits of diverse plantings in biofilters and inclusion of a saturated zone to buffer the impact of plant selection on performance and provide a water source through dry spells noting that maintenance is required to replenish the saturated zone throughout extended dry periods the decision support tool brings together scientific findings with observations from accessible plant information and will facilitate the selection of species for use in stormwater biofilters where nitrogen removal or high water loss are key performance objectives further work is required to confirm the untested relationships within the tool validate its use beyond australian native plants and

859,in this work we combine measurements and modeling to investigate the application of pressure decay experiments towards delineation and interpretation of co2 solubility uptake and mass transfer in water brine systems at elevated pressures of relevance to co2 storage operations in saline aquifers accurate measurements and modeling of mass transfer in this context are crucial to an improved understanding of the longer term fate of co2 that is injected into the subsurface for storage purposes pressure decay experiments are presented for co2 water and co2 brine systems with and without the presence of unconsolidated porous media we demonstrate via high resolution numerical calculations in 2 d that natural convection will complicate the interpretation of the experimental observations if the particle size is not sufficiently small in such settings we demonstrate that simple 1 d interpretations can result in an overestimation of the uptake diffusivity by two orders of magnitude furthermore we demonstrate that high resolution numerical calculations agree well with the experimental observations for settings where natural convection contributes substantially to the overall mass transfer process keywords co2 brine systems mass transfer experiments diffusion natural convection high resolution numerical calculations 1 introduction it is now widely accepted that emissions of greenhouse gases produced from human activities contribute to the observed global warming karl and trenberth 2003 baird and cann 2005 carbon capture and sequestration ccs is currently one of the promising solutions to mitigate the rising levels of atmospheric co2 and to minimize human impact on the climate pires et al 2011 gccsi 2016 particularly sequestration of co2 in deep saline formations offers the potential of storing billion of tons of injected co2 in this approach co2 is injected into the subsurface and is trapped by three main mechanisms 1 physical trapping 2 dissolution and 3 mineral precipitation when co2 is injected into a subsurface formation it will migrate upwards due to buoyancy forces until it is trapped confined in a region that is capped by an impermeable layer of rock shale this is referred to as physical trapping co2 is in a gaseous state and may potentially leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere if the seal integrity is compromised when co2 is trapped under an impermeable barrier i e at pressures lower than the capillary entry pressure of the barrier it remains in contact with the resident brine and will dissolve gradually into the liquid phase at rates that are controlled by molecular diffusion dissolution trapping is potentially more permanent than physical trapping because the co2 is held in solution within the liquid brine co2 saturated brine is more dense than fresh brine and upward migration of co2 due to buoyancy is not possible as the ph of the liquid phase decreases due to co2 dissolution geochemical reactions may occur between the co2 brine solution and the formation rock minerals leading to dissolution precipitation of salts and minerals to be able to accurately assess the co2 storage capacity and the safety of a given storage operation the co2 distribution in the liquid phase long after injection ends must also be taken into consideration consequently careful measurement of the co2 mass transfer in water brine at relevant subsurface conditions is critical in order to delineate the long term behavior of co2 in the subsurface several experimental techniques have been proposed to measure gas diffusion in liquids himmelblau 1964 policarpo and ribeiro 2011 these can be classified as conventional or unconventional methods conventional methods are further classified as either direct or indirect methods in the conventional direct methods one needs to analyze the composition of the liquid phase by sampling at different times during an experiment the conventional direct methods include the taylor aris dispersion method proposed by frank et al 1996 the capillary cell method by witherspoon and saraf 1965 the diaphragm cell method by gubbins et al 1966 and gas adsorption in a laminar jet as proposed by tang and himmelblau 1965 the main limitation of these direct methods relates to the difficulty of intrusive sampling at high pressures and temperatures in the conventional indirect methods one needs to correlate the measured system properties to the composition of the liquid phase policarpo and ribeiro 2011 one of the unconventional indirect methods is the so called pressure decay method in this method the co2 diffusivity is determined from experiments in a pressure volume temperature pvt cell by monitoring and interpreting the observed pressure decay riazi 1996 as co2 dissolves and diffuses into a given liquid the primary advantage of the pvt cell method is that intrusive sampling is not required however in this approach where the mass transfer between the co2 rich gas phase and the water brine phase is relatively slow small gas leaks in the experimental set up may impact the interpretation of the pressure decay and contribute to the experimental errors particularly when experiments are performed at elevated pressures subsurface conditions which exacerbate such leaks in addition as the co2 saturated brine is denser than fresh brine yan et al 2011 the density difference can induce density driven convection and accelerate the mass transfer rate of co2 into the brine weir et al 1996 riaz et al 2006 yang and gu 2006 farajzadeh et al 2009 wang et al 2013 density driven convection will further complicate the interpretation of mass transfer experiments and can lead if ignored to an over estimation of co2 diffusivity as further demonstrated and discussed in this work it is well known that the diffusivity of co2 in formation brine is highly dependent on the prevailing temperature and pressure conditions however most of the reported measurements of co2 diffusivity in water brine were conducted at atmospheric conditions for example tang and himmelblau 1965 studied the diffusivity of co2 in water at 25 c using a large liquid jet method tamimi et al 1994 studied the diffusivity of co2 in a temperature range of 20 95 c using a wetted sphere absorption apparatus frank et al 1996 measured the diffusivity of co2 in a temperature range of 20 95 c using the taylor aris dispersion method only a few studies have been conducted at higher pressures of relevance to subsurface storage of co2 for example hirai et al 1997 report the diffusivity of co2 in water at 13 c and at 9400 kpa and 39 200 kpa using laser induced fluorescence sell et al 2013 measured the co2 diffusivity over a pressure range of 500 5000 kpa at 26 c using a microfluidic approach raad et al 2015 measured the diffusivity of co2 at a temperature range of 30 40 c and a pressure range of 5880 6265 kpa using a pvt cell the experimental work reported to date on the measurement of diffusivity of co2 in saline systems at reservoir conditions is limited as well wang et al 1996 measured the co2 diffusivity in 0 25 n nacl solution over a pressure range of 1524 5178 kpa at 38 c while azin et al 2013 reported the co2 diffusivity in brine samples from an oil field for a temperature range of 32 50 c and a pressure range of 5900 6900 kpa zarghami et al 2017 studied the effect of salinity on co2 diffusivity at a temperature of 68 c and a pressure of 17 450 kpa a summary of co2 diffusivity as reported in the literature for water and assorted brines is provided in table 1 in table 1 the diffusion coefficients that are derived from interpretation of pressure decay observations in pvt cells are labeled with an asterisk we observe from the same table that the reported values of the diffusion coefficient in both water and brine span two orders of magnitude for example yang and gu 2006 farajzadeh et al 2009 and wang et al 2013 report co2 diffusion coefficients in water and brine on the order of 10 3 cm2 s while most other experimental observations are in the range of 10 5 cm2 s azin and mahmoudy 2013 farajzadeh et al 2007 and zarghami et al 2017 report that the mass transfer rate during the early stages of an uptake experiment is one to two orders of magnitude greater than that during the later times they chose to report the values derived from the later times in the experiment as the co2 diffusivity in the bulk liquid theorizing that elevated values of the diffusion coefficient at the early stages suggest that density driven convection or mechanical mixing may have occurred that was not represented explicitly in the interpretation of the experiments in this study the co2 diffusivity in water brine and in water brine saturated porous media has been measured at 50 c in the pressure range of 4245 5785 kpa via pressure decay observations in a pvt cell our study has two key goals i the experiments and their interpretation provide valuable information on the solubility and the diffusion characteristics of co2 in brine of relevance to the mt simon formation towards a better understanding of the co2 behavior at later times in deep saline formations in the context of ccs processes ii by performing experiments with and without a porous medium being present we investigate the role that density driven convection may play during diffusivity measurements in a pvt cell in order to arrive at a set of guidelines for future experimental efforts we start by presenting our experimental procedure and the interpretation of the experiments via a relatively simple mathematical model that considers diffusive mass transfer only high resolution numerical calculations of co2 transport in the water brine are then reported in order to investigate the role of density driven convection with emphasis on the impact of the presence of a porous medium on the uptake dynamics we conclude the manuscript with a discussion of the experimental observations and their interpretation based on observations from both simple and advanced modeling of the uptake process 2 materials and experimental approach 2 1 materials the co2 used in this study was coleman grade with purity of 99 99 while the brine composition reported in table 2 is based on information collected from the illinois basin decatur project ibdp site in decatur illinois in addition to measuring the co2 diffusion in bulk water brine experiments were performed for two unconsolidated porous media saturated with water brine these unconsolidated porous media were created by packing together dense solid particles with different particle sizes the first porous medium was generated from packing glass beads with a particle size of 1 6 mm and a second porous medium was prepared by packing quartz particles with particle sizes is the range of 125 150 µm national scientific company the properties of the porous media are given in table 3 the porosities of the porous media reported in table 3 were measured experimentally via liquid infiltration and an accompanying material volume balance dimensions of packing mass density of fluid 2 2 experimental approach solubility experiments to properly interpret the diffusion experiments the solubility of co2 in water brine must be known as a function of pressure at the temperature of the experiments performed here at 50 c hence in an initial set of experiments the solubility of co2 was determined in water and brine at 50 c for a pressure range of 728 6074 kpa the solubility experiments were performed in a typical pvt system the main equipment see fig 1 consists of a reference cell and a sample cell the capacity of the reference cell and sample cell used for the solubility measurements was 14 7 cm3 and 13 6 cm3 respectively both reference and sample cells were placed in an air bath to ensure that all experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 50 c high accuracy 0 03 full scale omega pressure transducers with a pressure range of 34 474 kpa were used to monitor the pressure in each cell thermocouples omega were used to monitor the temperature in each cell a data acquisition system was used to record the pressure and temperature data throughout the experiments to initiate the experiment a known quantity of water or brine was loaded into the sample cell the temperature of the air bath was then set to 50 c to evaluate the gas leak rate the system was evacuated at 933 2 pa and then pressurized by helium the pressure was then monitored for 24 h based on the observed he leak rate the leak rate of co2 is subsequently estimated via the dusty gas model see supplemental material the reference and sample cells were then placed briefly under moderate vacuum at 933 2 pa to remove all air and residual helium from the cells the reference cell was then isolated from the sample cell and pressurized with co2 to a certain pressure and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the pressure and temperature of the reference cell being used to calculate the moles of co2 initially present in the system the co2 in the reference cell was then expanded into the sample cell containing water or brine and the pressures and temperatures of the two cells were monitored recorded until equilibrium was reached following this initial step with co2 in the reference cell being expanded into the evacuated sample cell the reference cell was then again isolated from the sample cell and charged with additional co2 to increase its pressure above the prevailing sample cell pressure the co2 in the reference cell was then once more expanded into the sample cell with the pressures and temperatures of the two cells being recorded until equilibrium was reached this equilibration procedure was then repeated several times to arrive at a relevant set of equilibrium pressure observations at each stage the experiment was terminated once the system pressure was stabilized i e when the pressure change in the sample cell falls below 689 5 pa h or when the pressure variation in the sample cell became equal to the estimated leak rate the solubility of co2 was then subsequently evaluated at each pressure step from a material balance on the vapor phase using co2 compressibility factors from the nist webbook see section 3 1 for additional detail it should be noted that each pressure step in the solubility measurements effectively corresponds to a diffusion experiment which is allowed to reach equilibrium 2 3 experimental approach diffusivity experiments the diffusivity experiments were performed in the same experimental setup that was used for the solubility experiments see fig 1 above but employing different size reference and sample cells 83 3 cm3 and 54 8 cm3 respectively a larger volume sample cell height 8 3 cm inner diameter 2 9 cm was selected to accommodate the porous media a known mass of water or brine was first loaded into the sample cell for the experiments involving a porous medium a known mass of solid particles was then added to the sample cell wet packing until the height of the particles packed equaled the liquid level the height of the liquid saturated porous material was then recorded for use in the subsequent interpretation see section 3 2 below the system was then allowed to reach thermal equilibrium at 50 c in the air bath prior to a diffusion experiment the leak rate was measured using helium following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 the sample and reference cells were then evacuated as with the solubility measurements and subsequently isolated from each other the reference cell was then charged with co2 and allowed to establish thermal equilibrium the diffusion experiment was initiated by opening the valve in between the reference and the sample cells in order to allow co2 from the reference cell to enter the sample cell the pressure and temperature in both cells were recorded during the experiment and their values are employed in the interpretation of the data see additional discussion below when the pressure in the sample cell reached a certain value the valve in between the two cells was closed thus isolating the reference cell past this point the pressure in the sample cell decreases due to co2 diffusion and dissolution into the liquid phase the pressure and temperature of the system being monitored and recorded continuously allow for subsequent calculation of the mass transfer rates of co2 into the liquid phase as discussed in section 3 2 3 interpretation of experiments 3 1 solubility of co2 in water brine the purpose of the solubility experiments performed in this work is solely to facilitate the interpretation of the diffusivity experiments numerous authors have previously measured and reported the solubility of co2 in water see e g carroll and mather 1992 yan et al 2011 and references therein and in model brines see e g yan et al 2011 for nacl containing brines and references therein however the solubility of co2 in any natural brine depends on the specific salts in solution and on their concentrations accordingly the co2 brine solubility measurements presented here are required to interpret our mass transfer experiments since no prior data are available with this particular brine while the co2 water solubility measurements serve as a quality check for the accuracy of the experimental approach for each stage in the solubility measurements the moles of co2 in solution were calculated from the experimental observations of pressure and temperature in the sample and reference cells along with the known quantity of water or brine placed in the sample cell the molar density of co2 as reported from nist webbook was used in the material balance an assumption that is made in our evaluation of co2 solubility justified by the small solubilities measured is that the volume change if any of the liquid phase due to dissolution of co2 is negligible and can thus be ignored based on this assumption the material balance for any given pressure stage is described by 1 δ n v r ρ r 1 ρ r 2 v s v l 1 ρ s 1 v s v l 2 ρ s 2 where δn is the number of moles dissolved during that stage vr vs and vl represent the reference cell sample cell and the liquid volumes while ρr and ρs represent the vapor phase molar density of co2 in the reference and sample cells subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the initial pressure and final pressure of any given stage of the experiment we note that the change in density of water due to pressure variation is very modest over the relevant pressure range 0 5 increase in water density between 102 kpa and 105 kpa at 50 c based on data from the nist webbook and can be ignored based on eq 1 one can calculate the number of moles of co2 dissolved in the water or brine in the sample cell at the conclusion of each stage and thus finally arrive at the solubility of co2 in liquid brine corresponding to the observed final pressure in the sample cell to interpret the solubility experiments we start at the general requirement for thermodynamic equilibrium in vapor liquid systems written in terms of the fugacity fi of component i 2 f i v f i l i 1 n c with our specific emphasis on the solubility of co2 in an aqueous phase at moderate temperature and pressures we apply the two fluid phi gamma formulation e g carroll and mather 1992 to express the fugacity of co2 in vapor and liquid phases as follows 3 f 1 v y 1 p φ 1 4 f 1 l x 1 h 1 γ 1 5 ln h 1 ln h 1 o p 2 o p v 1 d p 6 ln γ 1 ln γ 1 o p 2 o p v 1 v 1 d p here y 1 and x 1 are the molar fractions of co2 in the vapor and liquid phases respectively p is the overall pressure φ 1 is the fugacity coefficient of co2 in the vapor phase h1 is the henry s constant at pressure p h 1 0 is henry s constant at the reference state p 1 0 γ 1 is the asymmetric activity coefficient of co2 in the liquid phase γ 1 0 is the activity coefficient of co2 at the reference state v1 is the reduced partial molar volume i e v rt of co2 v1 is the reduced partial molar volume at infinite dilution and p 1 0 is the vapor pressure of water at temperature t 12 34 kpa at 50 c nist webbook the application of eqs 3 6 for data interpretation is discussed in further detail in section 4 1 3 2 diffusivity in water and brine the experimental approach as outlined in section 2 3 provides a time series of pressures and temperatures in the reference and sample cells with known volumes of the reference cell and the sample cell we then calculate the number of moles of co2 in the vapor phase via an equation of state the peng robinson eos is used here this in turn allows us to calculate the number of moles of co2 in the liquid phase nliq t and in the vapor phase above the liquid in the sample cell ns t from the material balances 7 n l i q t v r ρ r t 0 v r ρ r t v s v l ρ s t 8 n s t v r ρ r t 0 n l i q t to relate the change in mole numbers with time to the diffusion of co2 into the liquid phase a simple mathematical model was initially formulated based on fick s law for diffusive mass transfer we assume that the diffusion process in this experimental system is a 1 d process as illustrated in fig 2 we further assume that the change in liquid volume due to evaporation and to swelling due to co2 dissolution is negligible and can be ignored this is a reasonable assumption given the low vapor pressure of water at the experimental temperature 12 34 kpa at 50 c and the low solubility of co2 in these liquids moreover we assume as it is commonly done in the technical literature to date that the diffusion coefficient is that for a single species in fact co2 exists in various forms in the solution each potentially with its own diffusivity so the measured diffusivity is an effective diffusivity reflecting the overall transport of all carbon bearing species and does not change significantly with co2 concentration in water brine a good assumption likely given the very dilute co2 concentrations in these liquids based on these assumptions the mass transfer of co2 from the vapor phase into the liquid phase is described by 9 c t d 2 c z 2 subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 10 c z t 0 0 11 c 0 t c e q p s t s 12 z c l t 0 here c denotes the concentration of co2 in the liquid phase mol cm3 ceq is the solubility mol cm3 of co2 in the liquid phase at the pressure ps and temperature ts of the sample cell d is the effective co2 diffusivity cm2 s diffusion coefficient divided by the tortuosity in the experiments with a porous medium being present in the liquid the equilibrium concentration of co2 at the liquid interphase is evaluated from our independent solubility measurements 13 c e q x 1 ρ m w where ρ is the density of the liquid phase g cm3 and mw is the molecular weight g mol of the mixture of co2 and water brine given by 14 m w x 1 m w 1 1 x 1 m w l i q where m w 1 is molecular weight of co2 and m w liq the molecular weight of the fresh brine the mass density of the liquid phase ρ increases slightly with co2 dissolution as demonstrated by yan et al 2011 they demonstrated based on interpretation of literature data and new measurements that the correlation of garcia 2001 for the apparent partial molar volume of co2 in solution cm3 mol 15 v 1 37 51 9 585 10

density g cm3 of the pure liquid fresh brine and w 1 is the mass fraction of co2 in solution the molar flow of co2 j1 mol s into the liquid phase across the vapor liquid interface at any given time is evaluated from 18 j 1 ɛ a d c z z 0 where ε is the porosity of the porous medium in the cell taken as unity for the bulk liquid experiments and a is the cross sectional area of the pvt cell finally the model is linked to the experimental observations by equating the change in moles of co2 in the sample cell to the molar co2 across the interface 19 n s t n s t δ t j 1 δ t the model was solved numerically via an implicit finite volume method and was used to estimate the diffusivity d from the experimental observations i e by matching the moles of co2 in the vapor phase in the sample cell evaluated from the changes in experimental pressure over the time of an experiment 4 results and observations 4 1 solubility experiments the solubility of co2 in water and brine was measured at 50 c for pressures up to 6074 kpa according to the procedure outlined in section 2 2 and the data are reported as a function of pressure in tables 4 5 with the sole purpose of interpreting the diffusivity experiments we need functional relationships between the gas phase pressure and the solubility of co2 in water and brine to this end we utilize eqs 3 6 as introduced in section 3 1 to evaluate the fugacity of co2 in the vapor phase we use the peng robinson equation of state eos and assume that the partial pressure of water in the vapor phase is sufficiently small so that its impact on the fugacity coefficient of co2 is marginal this assumption is supported by the measurements of weibe and gaddy 1941 the mole fraction of water in the vapor phase at 50 c never exceeds 0 01 i e y co2 0 99 at pressures between 1013 25 10 132 5 kpa furthermore the mole fraction of water in the vapor phase is evaluated from raoult s law to arrive at a simple representation of the solubility data we start by assuming that the activity coefficient of co2 see eq 4 in the liquid phase approaches its limiting value of 1 asymmetric activity coefficient for the range of solubilities pressures of our experiments and approximate the fugacity of co2 1 in the liquid as 20 f 1 l x 1 h 1 o α 21 α exp v 1 p p 2 o in this approximation we furthermore assume that the partial molar volume of co2 at infinite dilution is a weak function of pressure as suggested by van ness and abbott 1982 and set the value of v1 to 37 6 cm3 mol according to the work of parkinson and denevers 1969 fig 3 reports the fugacity as calculated for the vapor phase see discussion above divided by the pressure correction α as a function of the mole fraction of co2 in water x1 we find from fig 3 that the approximate representation of the liquid phase fugacity provides for a near perfect representation of the experimental observations the slope of fig 3 provides an estimate for h 1 0 we note however that this estimate does not represent the true henry s constant of the system as the impact of composition on the non ideal behavior i e activity coefficient was not included explicitly in the data reduction given that the purpose of the solubility measurements is solely for use in the boundary condition eq 11 for analysis of our diffusivity measurements we defer further use of the functional form of the excess gibbs function i e activity coefficient model given the accuracy of the simplified representation max difference between model and data 1 2 to further validate our experimental data and model fig 4 compares our measurements with data from the literature fig 4 demonstrates that our measurements are in good agreement with literature data and that the proposed simplified model performs well in the pressure range of relevance to our diffusivity experiments a similar analysis was performed for our co2 brine solubility measurements where we assume that the partial molar volume of co2 at infinite dilution in brine is approximately the same to that of the co2 water system fig 5 compares the experimental observations to the simplified model and we observe a good agreement max difference between model and data 1 while a simplified representation of the solubility data works well for the pressure range of this study up to 6000 kpa it is important to stress that solubility modeling at higher pressures may require an explicit representation of the compositional effects on the nonideal behavior in such settings one may not be able to ignore the impact of the activity coefficient in the phi gamma formulation 4 2 diffusivity experiments six diffusivity experiments were performed and initially interpreted according to the procedure discussed in section 3 2 the initial and final pressures in the sample cell for each experiment are reported in table 6 the observed pressure decay due to co2 diffusion and dissolution in the bulk liquids and in the liquid saturated porous media is reported as a function of time in figs 6 8 where we report the normalized pressure i e the ratio of pressure to initial pressure to facilitate comparison from fig 6 we observe that the pressure decay in the bulk water experiment is larger than that in the corresponding bulk brine experiment this is due to the larger solubility of co2 in water compared to that brine and is consistent with the co2 solubility measurements see section 4 1 from the slope of the pressure decay curves it is also evident that the pressure in the water experiment decays faster than in the brine experiment this difference in slope indicates that the co2 diffusivity in water is larger than that in brine fig 7 reports the normalized pressure decay from the diffusivity experiments a liquid saturated porous medium made from 1 6 mm glass beads we observe that these experiments behave similarly to the bulk liquid measurements see fig 6 the normalized pressure decay for diffusivity experiments in a liquid saturated porous medium made from 125 150 µm quartz particles is reported in fig 8 here we observe that the pressure decreases much more slowly than for the corresponding experiments in bulk liquid and in the liquid saturated glass bead pack at the end of the experiment the pressure is still reducing far from equilibrium even after 15 h these observations indicate that the diffusive mass transfer in the liquid saturated quartz pack is significantly smaller than that in the bulk liquid and in the liquid saturated porous medium made from 1 6 mm glass beads figs 9 10 and 11 compare the experimental observations with the simple 1 d interpretations eqs 1 6 for the bulk water and bulk brine experiments in terms of moles of co2 in the gas phase as a function of time in addition figs 10 and 11 includes error estimates bracketed by the broken lines as obtained from error propagation analysis we observe that the model matches the data well for both the bulk water and brine measurements with estimated values of co2 diffusivity in water and brine of 2 93 10 3 cm2 s and 1 09 10 3 cm2 s respectively the value of the diffusivity in water is found to be higher than that in brine which is also consistent with the differences in slope in the pressure decay curves however the order of magnitude of the diffusivities obtained in the bulk water and brine experiments 10 3 cm2 s is larger than what is expected for pure diffusive mass transfer in a liquid a potential explanation for the high values of diffusivity observed in the bulk measurements is density driven convection see e g weir et al 1996 as the density increases with increasing dissolution of co2 at the interface the fluid on the top becomes denser this density gradient can induce natural convection in the system which in turn accelerates the mass transfer of co2 into the water brine and results in higher flux of co2 at the interface if this is the case we expect that the effect of convection will be reduced in experiments with a porous medium because the porous structure can retard the natural convection additional analysis to this end is provided in section 5 figs 12 and 13 provide a comparison of the experimental observations in terms of moles of gas in the sample cell over time and the interpretation for the water and brine saturated porous medium made of 1 6 mm glass beads the calculated and experimental behavior are in good agreement for both experiments the co2 diffusivity estimated from the water experiment is 2 61 10 3cm2 s while that for the brine experiment is 8 20 10 4 cm2 s we observe that the diffusivity values obtained from interpretation of these experiments are smaller than those obtained from the bulk experiments due likely to the presence of the porous media and the fact that we estimate effective diffusivities for these experiments however the magnitude of diffusivity is still on the order of 10 3 cm2 s which suggests that convection may still be contributing to the mass transfer in the glass bead system a particle size of 1 6 mm is apparently not sufficiently small to prevent the onset of convection figs 13 and 14 compare experimental observations with modeling for the water and brine saturated porous medium made of quartz particles again we observe that the model matches the experiments very well for both the water and the brine experiments here the co2 diffusivities for the water and brine experiments are estimated to be 3 37 10 5 cm2 s and 1 25 10 5 cm2 s respectively it is noticeable that the diffusivities obtained from these experiments are on the order of magnitude of 10 5 cm2 s which agrees with other experimental observations reported for water and brine see table 1 this also suggests that the presence of the quartz particle significantly reduces the effect of natural convection and that the mass transfer in this porous system is likely to be dominated by molecular diffusion in the liquid phase 5 natural convection as mentioned above in some of our experiments the 1 d diffusion model estimates a diffusivity of o 10 3 cm2 s magnitude which is much larger than what is expected for purely diffusive mass transfer in a liquid phase this raises the possibility that convection may have set in for these cases so that the 1 d diffusion model itself may no longer be suitable to describe the co2 mass transport in the water brine in this section therefore we perform high resolution direct numerical simulations in a two dimensional 2 d rectangular domain to predict the co2 convective transport and dissolution process in the liquid phase our simulations here only focus on interpreting the experiments with the water saturated porous media in an isotropic and homogenous porous medium the flow is

peyret 2002 was used for computation of the remaining steps for each time step the saturated co2 concentration at the interface ceq was updated explicitly by using the procedure described in section 3 the dynamics of a system described by eqs 22 26 are governed by two dimensionless parameters assuming a constant concentration of co2 at the top boundary the domain aspect ratio r w l where w is the domain width or the diameter of the sample cell and the rayleigh number 27 ra lkg δ ρ 0 μ ɛ d representing the ratio of driving to damping forces in an infinitely wide domain r when the rayleigh number exceeds some critical value mass transfer is primarily in the form of convection although the specific value of this critical rayleigh number for onset of convection is still subject to debate in many studies ennis king et al 2005 xu et al 2006 riaz et al 2006 hassanzadeh et al 2006 kim et al 2008 kim and choi 2012 slim and ramakrishnan 2010 pau et al 2010 elenius and johannsen 2012 slim 2014 riaz and cinar 2014 there is no doubt that convection can be observed when ra 100 table 7 shows the specific values of diffusivity permeability and domain aspect ratio used in the 2 d simulations the permeability k of the unconsolidated porous materials reported in table 7 was calculated using the kozeny carman correlation wyllie and gregory 1955 28 k ɛ 3 a s gr 2 1 ɛ 2 where sgr is the surface area per unit grain volume and a is the kozeny carman constant in this work we set a 5 and evaluate sgr 3 rp where rp is the particle radius the resulting rayleigh numbers for water saturated 1 6 mm glass beads and water saturated 125 150 µm quartz particles are respectively 18 442 and 173 obviously for the water saturated 1 6 mm glass beads there exists strong convection during co2 transport and dissolution we start by considering the water beads experiment figs 15 and 16 show that the co2 dissolution rate predicted by the 1 d diffusion model using a diffusivity value of 3 37 10 5 cm2 s as obtained from the water quartz experiment is much smaller than that observed from the water beads experiment in contrast the 2 d convection model not only predicts the general evolution of the quantity of co2 in the vapor phase but also captures the varying trends of the co2 dissolution rate for different flow regimes when co2 first flows into the sample cell it dissolves and accumulates near the vapor liquid interface where it generates a thin co2 saturated diffusion boundary layer as more co2 dissolves into the water this diffusive layer becomes unstable under the influence of gravity and the co2 rich fluid sinks in the form of slender fingers see fig 17 before the onset of convection the mass transfer is dominated by diffusion and the co2 dissolution rate declines as t 1 2 after that the dissolution is greatly enhanced by convection convection continuously brings fresh liquid not saturated with co2 to the interface and the flow transitions to a quasi steady convective dissolution regime the dissolution of co2 into the liquid will induce a decrease in pressure in the gas phase which may in turn reduce the amount of co2 dissolved in the liquid phase however in the experiments with the 1 6 mm glass beads the reduction of the pressure is rather small see table 6 and as a result the relative change in the saturated co2 concentration is also small this results in a dissolution rate that remains nearly invariant during the quasi steady convective regime as the fresh water is depleted the convection begins to shut down and the dissolution rate declines rapidly with time see fig 16 the experimental dissolution rate reported in fig 16 was obtained from fitting the experimental data moles of co2 in gas phase to a smooth function and evaluating the derivative see supplemental material for additional details in fig 16 the first vertical dashed line denotes the time t1 3000 tad when the dissolution rate starts to increase above that of pure diffusion tad d u 2 is the advection diffusion balanced timescale and u kgδρ0 μϕ is the buoyancy velocity our experiments were not designed to investigate the onset dynamics and since t 1 is usually very small at large values of ra t1 9 s in the water bead case it cannot be estimated accurately from the current experimental data with measurements every 2 s we note that the transition time t1 ranges from o 100tad to o 1000tad depending on the magnitudes and types of perturbations slim 2014 and that our simulation results substantially agree with previous work on linear stability analysis e g riaz et al 2006 javaheri et al 2010 elenius et al 2014 the second vertical dashed line in fig 16 denotes the time t2 16 ta with ta l u the advection time scale where the mass transfer process transitions from the quasi steady to the shut down regime according to previous studies by hewitt et al 2013 and slim 2014 this estimate of t 2 also agrees well with both experimental and numerical results fig 17 shows the evolution of the normalized co2 concentration i e c ceq 0 in numerical simulations for the convective co2 dissolution in water saturated 1 6 mm glass beads for this case the onset of convection occurs in a very short time due to the large value of the rayleigh number apparent fingers can be observed beneath the co2 water interface at t 44 s at t 6 2 min the first density finger reaches the bottom wall and for t 15 min the convection begins to shut down for the water saturated 125 150 µm quartz particles ra 173 and convection should also prevail in a sufficiently wide domain nevertheless no convection was observed in our 2 d simulations due to the limitation of the small domain width corresponding to the experimental configuration mass transfer in this case is purely diffusive it is not surprising therefore that the 1 d diffusion model can reproduce the experimental observations and estimate a diffusivity in the expected range as shown in fig 13 6 discussion and conclusions in the previous sections we have described a series of experiments to measure solubility and mass transfer of co2 in water and brine the experiments were based on pressure decay observations in a pvt cell and included measurements in bulk liquids and in two liquid saturated unconsolidated porous media a simple mathematical model was initially introduced to interpret the pressure decay observations in terms of co2 mass transfer in the liquid and the liquid saturated porous media co2 diffusivities obtained by fitting the 1 d model to the experimental data demonstrate that a simple representation allows for good agreement between experiments and modeling table 8 provides a summary of the diffusion coefficients as extracted from the experiments from table 8 we observe that the ratios between the effective diffusivity in water and the corresponding value in brine as extracted from the water and brine experiments are 2 69 bulk 3 18 glass beads and 2 67 quartz several factors may contribute to the observed lower effective diffusivities of co2 in brine when compared to those in the water systems they include impact of viscosity per the stokes einstein equation the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the bulk phase the viscosities of water 0 547 cp and brine 0 893 cp were measured in our laboratory via poiseuille flow through a tube at 1atm and 50 c their ratio being 1 6 based on viscosity effects alone one would then expect the effective diffusivity in water to be at least 1 6 times larger than that in brine in addition to the impact of viscosity on diffusive mass transfer convective mass transfer in bulk and glass beads experiments is also affected by the viscosity as represented here via darcy s equation impact of multicomponent diffusion in the interpretation of the uptake experiments we apply a simple fick s law description of co2 diffusion in a liquid in reality both the water co2 and in particular the brine co2 are multicomponent systems that in principle require a more sophisticated representation of diffusive fluxes e g a maxwell stefan diffusion model that properly accounts for the friction among the various species in practice that is rarely done as the maxwell stefan diffusion coefficients for each pair of species in solution must be known or determined via separate experiments however when one forgoes the use of the elaborate maxwell stefan description of transport in favor of the simplified 1 d fickian description the additional drag between species in solution and potentially also the charge imbalances between diffusing ions manifest themselves as an additional decrease in the effective diffusivity in the co2 brine system as compared to the co2 water system the diffusivities diffusion coefficient for bulk liquid and diffusion coefficient divided by tortuosity for the porous materials extracted from the pressure decay data were demonstrated to span two orders of magnitude 10 3 10 5 cm2 s we explain this on the basis that measurements in bulk liquids and in the 1 6 mm in diameter bead packs are subject to accelerated mass transfer due to density driven natural convection in contrast measurements of mass transfer performed in quartz packs 125 150 µm diameter provide diffusion coefficients that are consistent with the literature 10 5 cm2 s accordingly the use of a porous medium made of particles with suitable size can eliminate the acceleration in co2 mass transfer due to natural convection during diffusivity measurement in pvt cells based on the diffusivity extracted from the water quartz system we demonstrated that high resolution numerical calculation accurately captures the uptake dynamics observed in the experiments for

859,in this work we combine measurements and modeling to investigate the application of pressure decay experiments towards delineation and interpretation of co2 solubility uptake and mass transfer in water brine systems at elevated pressures of relevance to co2 storage operations in saline aquifers accurate measurements and modeling of mass transfer in this context are crucial to an improved understanding of the longer term fate of co2 that is injected into the subsurface for storage purposes pressure decay experiments are presented for co2 water and co2 brine systems with and without the presence of unconsolidated porous media we demonstrate via high resolution numerical calculations in 2 d that natural convection will complicate the interpretation of the experimental observations if the particle size is not sufficiently small in such settings we demonstrate that simple 1 d interpretations can result in an overestimation of the uptake diffusivity by two orders of magnitude furthermore we demonstrate that high resolution numerical calculations agree well with the experimental observations for settings where natural convection contributes substantially to the overall mass transfer process keywords co2 brine systems mass transfer experiments diffusion natural convection high resolution numerical calculations 1 introduction it is now widely accepted that emissions of greenhouse gases produced from human activities contribute to the observed global warming karl and trenberth 2003 baird and cann 2005 carbon capture and sequestration ccs is currently one of the promising solutions to mitigate the rising levels of atmospheric co2 and to minimize human impact on the climate pires et al 2011 gccsi 2016 particularly sequestration of co2 in deep saline formations offers the potential of storing billion of tons of injected co2 in this approach co2 is injected into the subsurface and is trapped by three main mechanisms 1 physical trapping 2 dissolution and 3 mineral precipitation when co2 is injected into a subsurface formation it will migrate upwards due to buoyancy forces until it is trapped confined in a region that is capped by an impermeable layer of rock shale this is referred to as physical trapping co2 is in a gaseous state and may potentially leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere if the seal integrity is compromised when co2 is trapped under an impermeable barrier i e at pressures lower than the capillary entry pressure of the barrier it remains in contact with the resident brine and will dissolve gradually into the liquid phase at rates that are controlled by molecular diffusion dissolution trapping is potentially more permanent than physical trapping because the co2 is held in solution within the liquid brine co2 saturated brine is more dense than fresh brine and upward migration of co2 due to buoyancy is not possible as the ph of the liquid phase decreases due to co2 dissolution geochemical reactions may occur between the co2 brine solution and the formation rock minerals leading to dissolution precipitation of salts and minerals to be able to accurately assess the co2 storage capacity and the safety of a given storage operation the co2 distribution in the liquid phase long after injection ends must also be taken into consideration consequently careful measurement of the co2 mass transfer in water brine at relevant subsurface conditions is critical in order to delineate the long term behavior of co2 in the subsurface several experimental techniques have been proposed to measure gas diffusion in liquids himmelblau 1964 policarpo and ribeiro 2011 these can be classified as conventional or unconventional methods conventional methods are further classified as either direct or indirect methods in the conventional direct methods one needs to analyze the composition of the liquid phase by sampling at different times during an experiment the conventional direct methods include the taylor aris dispersion method proposed by frank et al 1996 the capillary cell method by witherspoon and saraf 1965 the diaphragm cell method by gubbins et al 1966 and gas adsorption in a laminar jet as proposed by tang and himmelblau 1965 the main limitation of these direct methods relates to the difficulty of intrusive sampling at high pressures and temperatures in the conventional indirect methods one needs to correlate the measured system properties to the composition of the liquid phase policarpo and ribeiro 2011 one of the unconventional indirect methods is the so called pressure decay method in this method the co2 diffusivity is determined from experiments in a pressure volume temperature pvt cell by monitoring and interpreting the observed pressure decay riazi 1996 as co2 dissolves and diffuses into a given liquid the primary advantage of the pvt cell method is that intrusive sampling is not required however in this approach where the mass transfer between the co2 rich gas phase and the water brine phase is relatively slow small gas leaks in the experimental set up may impact the interpretation of the pressure decay and contribute to the experimental errors particularly when experiments are performed at elevated pressures subsurface conditions which exacerbate such leaks in addition as the co2 saturated brine is denser than fresh brine yan et al 2011 the density difference can induce density driven convection and accelerate the mass transfer rate of co2 into the brine weir et al 1996 riaz et al 2006 yang and gu 2006 farajzadeh et al 2009 wang et al 2013 density driven convection will further complicate the interpretation of mass transfer experiments and can lead if ignored to an over estimation of co2 diffusivity as further demonstrated and discussed in this work it is well known that the diffusivity of co2 in formation brine is highly dependent on the prevailing temperature and pressure conditions however most of the reported measurements of co2 diffusivity in water brine were conducted at atmospheric conditions for example tang and himmelblau 1965 studied the diffusivity of co2 in water at 25 c using a large liquid jet method tamimi et al 1994 studied the diffusivity of co2 in a temperature range of 20 95 c using a wetted sphere absorption apparatus frank et al 1996 measured the diffusivity of co2 in a temperature range of 20 95 c using the taylor aris dispersion method only a few studies have been conducted at higher pressures of relevance to subsurface storage of co2 for example hirai et al 1997 report the diffusivity of co2 in water at 13 c and at 9400 kpa and 39 200 kpa using laser induced fluorescence sell et al 2013 measured the co2 diffusivity over a pressure range of 500 5000 kpa at 26 c using a microfluidic approach raad et al 2015 measured the diffusivity of co2 at a temperature range of 30 40 c and a pressure range of 5880 6265 kpa using a pvt cell the experimental work reported to date on the measurement of diffusivity of co2 in saline systems at reservoir conditions is limited as well wang et al 1996 measured the co2 diffusivity in 0 25 n nacl solution over a pressure range of 1524 5178 kpa at 38 c while azin et al 2013 reported the co2 diffusivity in brine samples from an oil field for a temperature range of 32 50 c and a pressure range of 5900 6900 kpa zarghami et al 2017 studied the effect of salinity on co2 diffusivity at a temperature of 68 c and a pressure of 17 450 kpa a summary of co2 diffusivity as reported in the literature for water and assorted brines is provided in table 1 in table 1 the diffusion coefficients that are derived from interpretation of pressure decay observations in pvt cells are labeled with an asterisk we observe from the same table that the reported values of the diffusion coefficient in both water and brine span two orders of magnitude for example yang and gu 2006 farajzadeh et al 2009 and wang et al 2013 report co2 diffusion coefficients in water and brine on the order of 10 3 cm2 s while most other experimental observations are in the range of 10 5 cm2 s azin and mahmoudy 2013 farajzadeh et al 2007 and zarghami et al 2017 report that the mass transfer rate during the early stages of an uptake experiment is one to two orders of magnitude greater than that during the later times they chose to report the values derived from the later times in the experiment as the co2 diffusivity in the bulk liquid theorizing that elevated values of the diffusion coefficient at the early stages suggest that density driven convection or mechanical mixing may have occurred that was not represented explicitly in the interpretation of the experiments in this study the co2 diffusivity in water brine and in water brine saturated porous media has been measured at 50 c in the pressure range of 4245 5785 kpa via pressure decay observations in a pvt cell our study has two key goals i the experiments and their interpretation provide valuable information on the solubility and the diffusion characteristics of co2 in brine of relevance to the mt simon formation towards a better understanding of the co2 behavior at later times in deep saline formations in the context of ccs processes ii by performing experiments with and without a porous medium being present we investigate the role that density driven convection may play during diffusivity measurements in a pvt cell in order to arrive at a set of guidelines for future experimental efforts we start by presenting our experimental procedure and the interpretation of the experiments via a relatively simple mathematical model that considers diffusive mass transfer only high resolution numerical calculations of co2 transport in the water brine are then reported in order to investigate the role of density driven convection with emphasis on the impact of the presence of a porous medium on the uptake dynamics we conclude the manuscript with a discussion of the experimental observations and their interpretation based on observations from both simple and advanced modeling of the uptake process 2 materials and experimental approach 2 1 materials the co2 used in this study was coleman grade with purity of 99 99 while the brine composition reported in table 2 is based on information collected from the illinois basin decatur project ibdp site in decatur illinois in addition to measuring the co2 diffusion in bulk water brine experiments were performed for two unconsolidated porous media saturated with water brine these unconsolidated porous media were created by packing together dense solid particles with different particle sizes the first porous medium was generated from packing glass beads with a particle size of 1 6 mm and a second porous medium was prepared by packing quartz particles with particle sizes is the range of 125 150 µm national scientific company the properties of the porous media are given in table 3 the porosities of the porous media reported in table 3 were measured experimentally via liquid infiltration and an accompanying material volume balance dimensions of packing mass density of fluid 2 2 experimental approach solubility experiments to properly interpret the diffusion experiments the solubility of co2 in water brine must be known as a function of pressure at the temperature of the experiments performed here at 50 c hence in an initial set of experiments the solubility of co2 was determined in water and brine at 50 c for a pressure range of 728 6074 kpa the solubility experiments were performed in a typical pvt system the main equipment see fig 1 consists of a reference cell and a sample cell the capacity of the reference cell and sample cell used for the solubility measurements was 14 7 cm3 and 13 6 cm3 respectively both reference and sample cells were placed in an air bath to ensure that all experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 50 c high accuracy 0 03 full scale omega pressure transducers with a pressure range of 34 474 kpa were used to monitor the pressure in each cell thermocouples omega were used to monitor the temperature in each cell a data acquisition system was used to record the pressure and temperature data throughout the experiments to initiate the experiment a known quantity of water or brine was loaded into the sample cell the temperature of the air bath was then set to 50 c to evaluate the gas leak rate the system was evacuated at 933 2 pa and then pressurized by helium the pressure was then monitored for 24 h based on the observed he leak rate the leak rate of co2 is subsequently estimated via the dusty gas model see supplemental material the reference and sample cells were then placed briefly under moderate vacuum at 933 2 pa to remove all air and residual helium from the cells the reference cell was then isolated from the sample cell and pressurized with co2 to a certain pressure and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the pressure and temperature of the reference cell being used to calculate the moles of co2 initially present in the system the co2 in the reference cell was then expanded into the sample cell containing water or brine and the pressures and temperatures of the two cells were monitored recorded until equilibrium was reached following this initial step with co2 in the reference cell being expanded into the evacuated sample cell the reference cell was then again isolated from the sample cell and charged with additional co2 to increase its pressure above the prevailing sample cell pressure the co2 in the reference cell was then once more expanded into the sample cell with the pressures and temperatures of the two cells being recorded until equilibrium was reached this equilibration procedure was then repeated several times to arrive at a relevant set of equilibrium pressure observations at each stage the experiment was terminated once the system pressure was stabilized i e when the pressure change in the sample cell falls below 689 5 pa h or when the pressure variation in the sample cell became equal to the estimated leak rate the solubility of co2 was then subsequently evaluated at each pressure step from a material balance on the vapor phase using co2 compressibility factors from the nist webbook see section 3 1 for additional detail it should be noted that each pressure step in the solubility measurements effectively corresponds to a diffusion experiment which is allowed to reach equilibrium 2 3 experimental approach diffusivity experiments the diffusivity experiments were performed in the same experimental setup that was used for the solubility experiments see fig 1 above but employing different size reference and sample cells 83 3 cm3 and 54 8 cm3 respectively a larger volume sample cell height 8 3 cm inner diameter 2 9 cm was selected to accommodate the porous media a known mass of water or brine was first loaded into the sample cell for the experiments involving a porous medium a known mass of solid particles was then added to the sample cell wet packing until the height of the particles packed equaled the liquid level the height of the liquid saturated porous material was then recorded for use in the subsequent interpretation see section 3 2 below the system was then allowed to reach thermal equilibrium at 50 c in the air bath prior to a diffusion experiment the leak rate was measured using helium following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 the sample and reference cells were then evacuated as with the solubility measurements and subsequently isolated from each other the reference cell was then charged with co2 and allowed to establish thermal equilibrium the diffusion experiment was initiated by opening the valve in between the reference and the sample cells in order to allow co2 from the reference cell to enter the sample cell the pressure and temperature in both cells were recorded during the experiment and their values are employed in the interpretation of the data see additional discussion below when the pressure in the sample cell reached a certain value the valve in between the two cells was closed thus isolating the reference cell past this point the pressure in the sample cell decreases due to co2 diffusion and dissolution into the liquid phase the pressure and temperature of the system being monitored and recorded continuously allow for subsequent calculation of the mass transfer rates of co2 into the liquid phase as discussed in section 3 2 3 interpretation of experiments 3 1 solubility of co2 in water brine the purpose of the solubility experiments performed in this work is solely to facilitate the interpretation of the diffusivity experiments numerous authors have previously measured and reported the solubility of co2 in water see e g carroll and mather 1992 yan et al 2011 and references therein and in model brines see e g yan et al 2011 for nacl containing brines and references therein however the solubility of co2 in any natural brine depends on the specific salts in solution and on their concentrations accordingly the co2 brine solubility measurements presented here are required to interpret our mass transfer experiments since no prior data are available with this particular brine while the co2 water solubility measurements serve as a quality check for the accuracy of the experimental approach for each stage in the solubility measurements the moles of co2 in solution were calculated from the experimental observations of pressure and temperature in the sample and reference cells along with the known quantity of water or brine placed in the sample cell the molar density of co2 as reported from nist webbook was used in the material balance an assumption that is made in our evaluation of co2 solubility justified by the small solubilities measured is that the volume change if any of the liquid phase due to dissolution of co2 is negligible and can thus be ignored based on this assumption the material balance for any given pressure stage is described by 1 δ n v r ρ r 1 ρ r 2 v s v l 1 ρ s 1 v s v l 2 ρ s 2 where δn is the number of moles dissolved during that stage vr vs and vl represent the reference cell sample cell and the liquid volumes while ρr and ρs represent the vapor phase molar density of co2 in the reference and sample cells subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the initial pressure and final pressure of any given stage of the experiment we note that the change in density of water due to pressure variation is very modest over the relevant pressure range 0 5 increase in water density between 102 kpa and 105 kpa at 50 c based on data from the nist webbook and can be ignored based on eq 1 one can calculate the number of moles of co2 dissolved in the water or brine in the sample cell at the conclusion of each stage and thus finally arrive at the solubility of co2 in liquid brine corresponding to the observed final pressure in the sample cell to interpret the solubility experiments we start at the general requirement for thermodynamic equilibrium in vapor liquid systems written in terms of the fugacity fi of component i 2 f i v f i l i 1 n c with our specific emphasis on the solubility of co2 in an aqueous phase at moderate temperature and pressures we apply the two fluid phi gamma formulation e g carroll and mather 1992 to express the fugacity of co2 in vapor and liquid phases as follows 3 f 1 v y 1 p φ 1 4 f 1 l x 1 h 1 γ 1 5 ln h 1 ln h 1 o p 2 o p v 1 d p 6 ln γ 1 ln γ 1 o p 2 o p v 1 v 1 d p here y 1 and x 1 are the molar fractions of co2 in the vapor and liquid phases respectively p is the overall pressure φ 1 is the fugacity coefficient of co2 in the

approach as outlined in section 2 3 provides a time series of pressures and temperatures in the reference and sample cells with known volumes of the reference cell and the sample cell we then calculate the number of moles of co2 in the vapor phase via an equation of state the peng robinson eos is used here this in turn allows us to calculate the number of moles of co2 in the liquid phase

mole numbers with time to the diffusion of co2 into the liquid phase a simple mathematical model was initially formulated based on fick s law for diffusive mass transfer we assume that the diffusion process in this experimental system is a 1 d process as illustrated in fig 2 we further assume that the change in liquid volume due to evaporation and to swelling due to co2 dissolution is negligible and can be ignored this is a reasonable assumption given the low vapor pressure of water at the experimental temperature 12 34 kpa at 50 c and the low solubility of co2 in these liquids moreover we assume as it is commonly done in the technical literature to date that the diffusion coefficient is that for a single species in fact co2 exists in various forms in the solution each potentially with its own diffusivity so the measured diffusivity is an effective diffusivity reflecting the overall transport of all carbon bearing species and does not change significantly with co2 concentration in water brine a good assumption likely given the very dilute co2 concentrations in these liquids based on these assumptions the mass transfer of co2 from the vapor phase into the liquid phase is described by 9 c t d 2 c z 2 subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 10 c z t 0 0 11 c 0 t c e q p s t s 12 z c l t 0 here c denotes the concentration of co2 in the liquid phase mol

tortuosity in the experiments with a porous medium being present in the liquid the equilibrium concentration of co2 at the liquid interphase is evaluated from our independent solubility measurements

molecular weight of co2 and m w liq the molecular weight of the fresh brine the mass density of the liquid phase ρ increases slightly with co2 dissolution as demonstrated by yan et al 2011 they

evaluated from 18 j 1 ɛ a d c z z 0 where ε is the porosity of the porous medium in the cell taken as unity for the bulk liquid experiments and a is the cross sectional area of the pvt cell finally the model is linked to the experimental observations by equating the change in moles of co2 in the sample cell to the molar co2 across the interface 19 n s t n s t δ t j 1 δ t the model was solved numerically via an implicit finite volume method and was used to estimate the diffusivity d from the experimental observations i e by matching the moles of co2 in the vapor phase in the sample cell evaluated from the changes in experimental pressure over the time of an experiment 4 results and observations 4 1 solubility experiments the solubility of co2 in water and brine was measured at 50 c for pressures up to 6074 kpa according to the procedure outlined in section 2 2 and the data are reported as a function of pressure in tables 4 5 with the sole purpose of interpreting the diffusivity experiments we need functional relationships between the gas phase pressure and the solubility of co2 in water and brine to this end we utilize eqs 3 6 as introduced in section 3 1 to evaluate the fugacity of co2 in the vapor phase we use the peng robinson equation of state eos and assume that the partial pressure of water in the vapor phase is sufficiently small so that its impact on the fugacity coefficient of co2 is marginal this assumption is supported by the measurements of weibe and gaddy 1941 the mole fraction of water in the vapor phase at 50 c never exceeds 0 01 i e y co2 0 99 at pressures between 1013 25 10 132 5 kpa furthermore the mole fraction of water in the vapor phase is evaluated from raoult s law to arrive at a simple representation of the solubility data we start by assuming that the activity coefficient of co2 see eq 4 in the liquid phase approaches its limiting value of 1 asymmetric activity coefficient for the range of solubilities pressures of our experiments and approximate the fugacity of co2 1 in the liquid as 20 f 1 l x 1 h 1 o α 21 α exp v 1 p p 2 o in this approximation we furthermore assume that the partial molar volume of co2 at infinite dilution is a weak function of pressure as suggested by van ness and abbott 1982 and set the value of v1 to 37 6 cm3 mol according to the work of parkinson and denevers 1969 fig 3 reports the fugacity as calculated for the vapor phase see discussion above divided by the pressure correction α as a function of the mole fraction of co2 in water x1 we find from fig 3 that the approximate representation of the liquid phase fugacity provides for a near perfect representation of the experimental observations the slope of fig 3 provides an estimate for h 1 0 we note however that this estimate does not represent the true henry s constant of the system as the impact of composition on the non ideal behavior i e activity coefficient was not included explicitly in the data reduction given that the purpose of the solubility measurements is solely for use in the boundary condition eq 11 for analysis of our diffusivity measurements we defer further use of the functional form of the excess gibbs function i e activity coefficient model given the accuracy of the simplified representation max difference between model and data 1 2 to further validate our experimental data and model fig 4 compares our measurements with data from the literature fig 4 demonstrates that our measurements are in good agreement with literature data and that the proposed simplified model performs well in the pressure range of relevance to our diffusivity experiments a similar analysis was performed for our co2 brine solubility measurements where we assume that the partial molar volume of co2 at infinite dilution in brine is approximately the same to that of the co2 water system fig 5 compares the experimental observations to the simplified model and we observe a good agreement max difference between model and data 1 while a simplified representation of the solubility data works well for the pressure range of this study up to 6000 kpa it is important to stress that solubility modeling at higher pressures may require an explicit representation of the compositional effects on the nonideal behavior in such settings one may not be able to ignore the impact of the activity coefficient in the phi gamma formulation 4 2 diffusivity experiments six diffusivity experiments were performed and initially interpreted according to the procedure discussed in section 3 2 the initial and final pressures in the sample cell for each experiment are reported in table 6 the observed pressure decay due to co2 diffusion and dissolution in the bulk liquids and in the liquid saturated porous media is reported as a function of time in figs 6 8 where we report the normalized pressure i e the ratio of pressure to initial pressure to facilitate comparison from fig 6 we observe that the pressure decay in the bulk water experiment is larger than that in the corresponding bulk brine experiment this is due to the larger solubility of co2 in water compared to that brine and is consistent with the co2 solubility measurements see section 4 1 from the slope of the pressure decay curves it is also evident that the pressure in the water experiment decays faster than in the brine experiment this difference in slope indicates that the co2 diffusivity in water is larger than that in brine fig 7 reports the normalized pressure decay from the diffusivity experiments a liquid saturated porous medium made from 1 6 mm glass beads we observe that these experiments behave similarly to the bulk liquid measurements see fig 6 the normalized pressure decay for diffusivity experiments in a liquid saturated porous medium made from 125 150 µm quartz particles is reported in fig 8 here we observe that the pressure decreases much more slowly than for the corresponding experiments in bulk liquid and in the liquid saturated glass bead pack at the end of the experiment the pressure is still reducing far from equilibrium even after 15 h these observations indicate that the diffusive mass transfer in the liquid saturated quartz pack is significantly smaller than that in the bulk liquid and in the liquid saturated porous medium made from 1 6 mm glass beads figs 9 10 and 11 compare the experimental observations with the simple 1 d interpretations eqs 1 6 for the bulk water and bulk brine experiments in terms of moles of co2 in the gas phase as a function of time in addition figs 10 and 11 includes error estimates bracketed by the broken lines as obtained from error propagation analysis we observe that the model matches the data well for both the bulk water and brine measurements with estimated values of co2 diffusivity in water and brine of 2 93 10 3 cm2 s and 1 09 10 3 cm2 s respectively the value of the diffusivity in water is found to be higher than that in brine which is also consistent with the differences in slope in the pressure decay curves however the order of magnitude of the diffusivities obtained in the bulk water and brine experiments 10 3 cm2 s is larger than what is expected for pure diffusive mass transfer in a liquid a potential explanation for the high values of diffusivity observed in the bulk measurements is density driven convection see e g weir et al 1996 as the density increases with increasing dissolution of co2 at the interface the fluid on the top becomes denser this density gradient can induce natural convection in the system which in turn accelerates the mass transfer of co2 into the water brine and results in higher flux of co2 at the interface if this is the case we expect that the effect of convection will be reduced in experiments with a porous medium because the porous structure can retard the natural convection additional analysis to this end is provided in section 5 figs 12 and 13 provide a comparison of the experimental observations in terms of moles of gas in the sample cell over time and the interpretation for the water and brine saturated porous medium made of 1 6 mm glass beads the calculated and experimental behavior are in good agreement for both experiments the co2 diffusivity estimated from the water experiment is 2 61 10 3cm2 s while that for the brine experiment is 8 20 10 4 cm2 s we observe that the diffusivity values obtained from interpretation of these experiments are smaller than those obtained from the bulk experiments due likely to the presence of the porous media and the fact that we estimate effective diffusivities for these experiments however the magnitude of diffusivity is still on the order of 10 3 cm2 s which suggests that convection may still be contributing to the mass transfer in the glass bead system a particle size of 1 6 mm is apparently not sufficiently small to prevent the onset of convection figs 13 and 14 compare experimental observations with modeling for the water and brine saturated porous medium made of quartz particles again we observe that the model matches the experiments very well for both the water and the brine experiments here the co2 diffusivities for the water and brine experiments are estimated to be 3 37 10 5 cm2 s and 1 25 10 5 cm2 s respectively it is noticeable that the diffusivities obtained from these experiments are on the order of magnitude of 10 5 cm2 s which agrees with other experimental observations reported for water and brine see table 1 this also suggests that the presence of the quartz particle significantly reduces the effect of natural convection and that the mass transfer in this porous system is likely to be dominated by molecular diffusion in the liquid phase 5 natural convection as mentioned above in some of our experiments the 1 d diffusion model estimates a diffusivity of o 10 3 cm2 s magnitude which is much larger than what is expected for purely diffusive mass transfer in a liquid phase this raises the possibility that convection may have set in for these cases so that the 1 d diffusion model itself may no longer be suitable to describe the co2 mass transport in the water brine in this section therefore we perform high resolution direct numerical simulations in a two dimensional 2 d rectangular domain to predict the co2 convective transport and dissolution process in the liquid phase our simulations here only focus on interpreting the experiments with the water saturated porous media in an isotropic and homogenous porous medium the flow is

at time t 0 when the valve to the sample chamber is closed the concentration field in the water phase is governed by the following advection diffusion equation 25 c t u c d 2 c for boundary conditions the upper boundary of the liquid phase i e the vapor liquid interface at z 0 is always instantaneously saturated with co2 and impermeable to fluid the lower boundary is impermeable to solute and fluid 26 z c 0 and w 0 at z l c c eq t and w 0 at z 0 all the variables are periodic at the side walls we note that the equilibrium concentration at the interface varies with time as the pressure in the gas phase decays the variation in pressure with time is evaluated from a material balance on the moles of co2 in the vapor phase for a fixed vapor volume and compressibility factors from nist webbook in this study eqs 22 26 are solved numerically using a fourier chebyshev tau pseudo spectral solver which was verified in wen et al 2013 2015 for temporal discretization a third order accurate semi implicit runge kutta scheme nikitin 2006 was utilized for computations of the first three steps and then a four step fourth order accurate semi implicit adams bashforth backward differentiation scheme peyret 2002 was used for computation of the remaining steps for each time step the saturated co2 concentration at the interface ceq was updated explicitly by using the procedure described in section 3 the dynamics of a system described by eqs 22 26 are governed by two dimensionless parameters assuming a constant concentration of co2 at the top boundary the domain aspect ratio r w l where w is the domain width or the diameter of the sample cell and the rayleigh number 27 ra lkg δ ρ 0 μ ɛ d representing the ratio of driving to damping forces in an infinitely wide domain r when the rayleigh number exceeds some critical value mass transfer is primarily in the form of convection although the specific value of this critical rayleigh number for onset of convection is still subject to debate in many studies ennis king et al 2005 xu et al 2006 riaz et al 2006 hassanzadeh et al 2006 kim et al 2008 kim and choi 2012 slim and ramakrishnan 2010 pau et al 2010 elenius and johannsen 2012 slim 2014 riaz and cinar 2014 there is no doubt that convection can be observed when ra 100 table 7 shows the specific values of diffusivity permeability and domain aspect ratio used in the 2 d simulations the permeability k of the unconsolidated porous materials reported in table 7 was calculated using the kozeny carman correlation wyllie and gregory 1955 28 k ɛ 3 a s gr 2 1 ɛ 2 where sgr is the surface area per unit grain volume and a is the kozeny carman constant in this work we set a 5 and evaluate sgr 3 rp where rp is the particle radius the resulting rayleigh numbers for water saturated 1 6 mm glass beads and water saturated 125 150 µm quartz particles are respectively 18 442 and 173 obviously for the water saturated 1 6 mm glass beads there exists strong convection during co2 transport and dissolution we start by considering the water beads experiment figs 15 and 16 show that the co2 dissolution rate predicted by the 1 d diffusion model using a diffusivity value of 3 37 10 5 cm2 s as obtained from the water quartz experiment is much smaller than that observed from the water beads experiment in contrast the 2 d convection model not only predicts the general evolution of the quantity of co2 in the vapor phase but also captures the varying trends of the co2 dissolution rate for different flow regimes when co2 first flows into the sample cell it dissolves and accumulates near the vapor liquid interface where it generates a thin co2 saturated diffusion boundary layer as more co2 dissolves into the water this diffusive layer becomes unstable under the influence of gravity and the co2 rich fluid sinks in the form of slender fingers see fig 17 before the onset of convection the mass transfer is dominated by diffusion and the co2 dissolution rate declines as t 1 2 after that the dissolution is greatly enhanced by convection convection continuously brings fresh liquid not saturated with co2 to the interface and the flow transitions to a quasi steady convective dissolution regime the dissolution of co2 into the liquid will induce a decrease in pressure in the gas phase which may in turn reduce the amount of co2 dissolved in the liquid phase however in the experiments with the 1 6 mm glass beads the reduction of the pressure is rather small see table 6 and as a result the relative change in the saturated co2 concentration is also small this results in a dissolution rate that remains nearly invariant during the quasi steady convective regime as the fresh water is depleted the convection begins to shut down and the dissolution rate declines rapidly with time see fig 16 the experimental dissolution rate reported in fig 16 was obtained from fitting the experimental data moles of co2 in gas phase to a smooth function and evaluating the derivative see supplemental material for additional details in fig 16 the first vertical dashed line denotes the time t1 3000 tad when the dissolution rate starts to increase above that of pure diffusion tad d u 2 is the advection diffusion balanced timescale and u kgδρ0 μϕ is the buoyancy velocity our experiments were not designed to investigate the onset dynamics and since t 1 is usually very small at large values of ra t1 9 s in the water bead case it cannot be estimated accurately from the current experimental data with measurements every 2 s we note that the transition time t1 ranges from o 100tad to o 1000tad depending on the magnitudes and types of perturbations slim 2014 and that our simulation results substantially agree with previous work on linear stability analysis e g riaz et al 2006 javaheri et al 2010 elenius et al 2014 the second vertical dashed line in fig 16 denotes the time t2 16 ta with ta l u the advection time scale where the mass transfer process transitions from the quasi steady to the shut down regime according to previous studies by hewitt et al 2013 and slim 2014 this estimate of t 2 also agrees well with both experimental and numerical results fig 17 shows the evolution of the normalized co2 concentration i e c ceq 0 in numerical simulations for the convective co2 dissolution in water saturated 1 6 mm glass beads for this case the onset of convection occurs in a very short time due to the large value of the rayleigh number apparent fingers can be observed beneath the co2 water interface at t 44 s at t 6 2 min the first density finger reaches the bottom wall and for t 15 min the convection begins to shut down for the water saturated 125 150 µm quartz particles ra 173 and convection should also prevail in a sufficiently wide domain nevertheless no convection was observed in our 2 d simulations due to the limitation of the small domain width corresponding to the experimental configuration mass transfer in this case is purely diffusive it is not surprising therefore that the 1 d diffusion model can reproduce the experimental observations and estimate a diffusivity in the expected range as shown in fig 13 6 discussion and conclusions in the previous sections we have described a series of experiments to measure solubility and mass transfer of co2 in water and brine the experiments were based on pressure decay observations in a pvt cell and included measurements in bulk liquids and in two liquid saturated unconsolidated porous media a simple mathematical model was initially introduced to interpret the pressure decay observations in terms of co2 mass transfer in the liquid and the liquid saturated porous media co2 diffusivities obtained by fitting the 1 d model to the experimental data demonstrate that a simple representation allows for good agreement between experiments and modeling table 8 provides a summary of the diffusion coefficients as extracted from the experiments from table 8 we observe that the ratios between the effective diffusivity in water and the corresponding value in brine as extracted from the water and brine experiments are 2 69 bulk 3 18 glass beads and 2 67 quartz several factors may contribute to the observed lower effective diffusivities of co2 in brine when compared to those in the water systems they include impact of viscosity per the stokes einstein equation the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the bulk phase the viscosities of water 0 547 cp and brine 0 893 cp were measured in our laboratory via poiseuille flow through a tube at 1atm and 50 c their ratio being 1 6 based on viscosity effects alone one would then expect the effective diffusivity in water to be at least 1 6 times larger than that in brine in addition to the impact of viscosity on diffusive mass transfer convective mass transfer in bulk and glass beads experiments is also affected by the viscosity as represented here via darcy s equation impact of multicomponent diffusion in the interpretation of the uptake experiments we apply a simple fick s law description of co2 diffusion in a liquid in reality both the water co2 and in particular the brine co2 are multicomponent systems that in principle require a more sophisticated representation of diffusive fluxes e g a maxwell stefan diffusion model that properly accounts for the friction among the various species in practice that is rarely done as the maxwell stefan diffusion coefficients for each pair of species in solution must be known or determined via separate experiments however when one forgoes the use of the elaborate maxwell stefan description of transport in favor of the simplified 1 d fickian description the additional drag between species in solution and potentially also the charge imbalances between diffusing ions manifest themselves as an additional decrease in the effective diffusivity in the co2 brine system as compared to the co2 water system the diffusivities diffusion coefficient for bulk liquid and diffusion coefficient divided by tortuosity for the porous materials extracted from the pressure decay data were demonstrated to span two orders of magnitude 10 3 10 5 cm2 s we explain this on the basis that measurements in bulk liquids and in the 1 6 mm in diameter bead packs are subject to accelerated mass transfer due to density driven natural convection in contrast measurements of mass transfer performed in quartz packs 125 150 µm diameter provide diffusion coefficients that are consistent with the literature 10 5 cm2 s accordingly the use of a porous medium made of particles with suitable size can eliminate the acceleration in co2 mass transfer due to natural convection during diffusivity measurement in pvt cells based on the diffusivity extracted from the water quartz system we demonstrated that high resolution numerical calculation accurately captures the uptake dynamics observed in the experiments for settings where natural convection contributes substantially to the overall mass transfer process acknowledgments work at usc was supported as part of the center for geologic storage of co2 an energy
