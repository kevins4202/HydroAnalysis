12980,this study aimed to optimize a seeded precipitation process using recovered caco3 for treating wastewater containing high concentrations of fluoride and co anions the simulated wastewater contained 4000 mg f l and 2000 mg l of co anions i e no3 po4 3 and so4 2 critical factors such as precipitant concentration mm ca2 seed dosage g and ph were subjected to box behnken design a response surface methodology to simultaneously model f and po4 3 removal efficiencies generally the critical factors were all statistically significant with ca2 concentration as the most significant parameter for both fluoride and phosphate removal even at extreme anion concentrations the optimum condition ca2 105 0 mm seed dosage 5 0 g and ph 3 79 0 13 still reached a high defluoridation efficiency about 98 with marginal error from predicted removal moreover anionic species i e po4 3 so4 2 and no3 had removal efficiencies of 75 40 and 17 respectively the range of the prevailing acidic ph 2 0 6 0 presumably deterred the potential precipitation of ca2 with other anions but still ensured caf2 precipitation in this study the solid analysis of the recovered caco3 subjected to different conditions could demonstrate a complex defluoridation mechanism using seeded precipitation keywords defluoridation wastewater treatment adsorption design of experiments calcite 1 introduction the rapid rise of urbanization and industrialization also has augmented the challenges in water requirements and environmental conservation this has increased water demand wastewater discharge and environmental pollution 1 in the past years fluoride emissions in the air and discharges in water bodies have been constant distress possibly damaging crops and live stocks contaminating water sources and compromising public health 2 a recent investigation further revealed that aggressive land development has widened the risk of fluoride exposure by two to seven fold of land area for a variety of land use within 8 years 3 however these developments endure sustaining economic growth in china the photovoltaic manufacturer was also recently reported to generate about 50 000 ppm f of effluent 4 it has also been estimated that metallurgical industries released about 390 million cubic meters of acidic fluoride wastewater containing about 50 1000 ppm with ph 1 0 5 moreover a recent study has also revealed that fluoride contamination of china s surface water intermingled with its complex convergence with groundwater 6 consequently the contaminated groundwater source could imperil the region s public health through its consumption leading to fluoride causing dental bone and iq reducing illnesses 7 9 in the past decades there have also been constant researches to defluoridate semi conductor industries in taiwan 10 12 in middle eastern regions the fertilizer industries also generating extreme concentrations of fluoride wastewater reaching about 10 000 ppm have been flourishing 13 moreover both of these regions have also been suffering from limited water 14 15 hence contamination of potential water sources should be avoided and managed with utmost care accordingly conscientious and reliable water management is vital consequentially resulting in the emergence of different defluoridation technologies for wastewater 16 it was observed that aside from fluoride both industries may also contain phosphate in the wastewater similar to hydrofluoric acid phosphoric acid has been used in etching for chemical and mechanical polishing 17 additionally fluoroapatite a raw material for fertilizer production contains fluoride and phosphate which may also end up at the effluent thus the simultaneous removal of both fluoride and phosphate has been reported in treating wastewater by chemical precipitation 200 mg po4 3 l 18 and by electrodialysis 4540 mg po4 3 l 19 in other literature the presence and the interfering effects of other anions have also been reported and investigated such as nitrate 350 2000 mg l 20 21 and sulfate 500 2000 mg l 22 the use of chemical precipitation followed by coagulation has continuously developed 23 24 moreover to improve precipitation seeds such as caf2 caco3 and ca₅ po₄ ₃f have either provided nucleation sites or adsorbing surfaces for fluoride removal 25 26 however these reports have been limited to low concentrations of fluoride only about 10 to 290 mg f l relatively very low compared to industrial effluents 1 0 to 50 0 g f l hence the seeded precipitation has not been thoroughly investigated with extreme concentrations of fluoride and other co existing anions in the past few years our research group has also had consecutive reports both treating water hardness and retrieving calcite using fluidized bed homogenous crystallization 27 29 in this study the retrieved calcite is directed as seed to aid precipitation 1 to primarily evaluate factors affecting the defluoridation efficiency at the presence of a high concentration of fluoride and co anions and 2 to further model the efficiency in terms of critical factors with statistically determined significance using box behnken design response surface methodology bbd rsm ultimately the model will be used to predict the optimum condition for fluoride removal to assess the efficiency with the presence of co anions moreover the defluoridation mechanism of fluoride removal will be proposed in the recovered solids from the precipitation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all solutions were prepared using doubly deionized water using the ro ultrapure water system resistance 18 2 mω the reagents used were analytical grade intended for laboratory use and no further purifications were applied to simulate the components of the synthetic wastewater viz f so4 2 po4 3 and no3 a stock solution was prepared with 8 0 g f l and 4 0 g l of other co anions all reagents were sodium based compounds sodium fluoride from panreac applichem sodium nitrate from choneye pure chemicals sodium persulfate from honeywell disodium phosphate from showa with a purity of about 99 likewise a stock solution of precipitant about 8 4 g ca2 l was also prepared using cacl2 2h2o 99 from aencore then sodium hydroxide from fisher scientific and hydrochloric acid 32 4 purity from choneye pure chemicals solutions were employed for ph adjustments total ion strength adjustment buffer tisab 1 from cole parmer neutralized ph between 5 0 and 5 5 and chelated metals in the solution generating free f for detection carbonate solution containing na2co3 from honeywell fluka and nahco3 from emsure with concentrations about 170 and 680 mg l respectively were also prepared for sample dilution before co anion detection the calcite seed having a nominal diameter of 350 μm was previously recovered from a lab scale fluidized bed homogenous crystallization process treating water hardness 2 2 experimental set ups calcite seed deionized water synthetic wastewater solution and precipitant solution were mixed based on predetermined proportions of precipitant concentration pc and seed dosage sd in a 500 ml beaker a mechanical gang stirrer from hung yao instrument co mixed the solution in two phases this was to simulate the coagulation flocculation process with the rapid and gradual mixing the first phase was agitated with a speed of 150 rpm within 10 min then reduced to 30 rpm for the rest of the operation time 50 min the resulting initial concentrations of anions c0 were 4000 mg l for f and 2000 mg l for other ions i e so4 2 po4 3 and no3 and varying ca2 concentrations 0 to 105 mm in 500 ml solution the ph was adjusted three times during the operation a during the rapid mixing 0 10 min b right after 10 min rapid mixing and c half time of slow mixing between 30 and 35 min of complete operation time the seeded precipitation setup is illustrated in fig 1 2 3 analytical methods and characterization all samples were initially filtered by a 0 2 μm syringe filter before their respective analysis for fluoride detection samples were diluted 10 fold then the 1 ml diluted sample was extracted and mixed with 1 ml tisab 1 solution the ion detector suntex ts 130 portable meter and an electrode having 4 0 m kcl electrolyte solution manufactured by cole parmer were used for fluoride ion measurement phosphate concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography ic dionex dx 120 the samples were first diluted with carbonated solution resulting in concentrations 100 mg l and precipitating remaining metals and filtered again before ic analysis for the calcium residuals no further sample preparations after filtering were done and samples were directly probed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes ultima 2000 horiba ltd japan upon measuring the residuals in the solution to compute for the removal efficiency η the following equation was used 1 η 1 c c 0 where η is the removal efficiency c is the final or residual concentration c0 is the initial concentration of the synthetic wastewater for the analysis of the recovered solids the solutions were decanted to recover the seeds and precipitates the surface morphology and elemental composition were determined by the scanning electron microscope sem joel jxa 840 hitachi s4100 and energy dispersive spectrometry eds links an10000 85s respectively to characterize the solids x ray diffraction xrd dx iii rigaku co japan was used revealing crystal structures peaks were then compared with the database of the joint committee of powder diffraction standards jcpds to identify the compounds 2 4 design of experiments to better understand the treatment by seeded precipitation and to minimize the number of experiments needed a design of experiment doe was applied the design expert 7 0 software trial version stat ease inc minneapolis usa was used to direct the user throughout the doe statistical analysis and its further optimization the box behnken design bbd response surface methodology rsm was the pre selected doe in this study the bbd is primarily intended to model or to fit in second order equations this has commonly been presented by equation terminating on the third term designated by second order variables at eq 2 30 however higher order departures indicated by ε in eq 2 have been sometimes necessary to allow degrees of freedom which could be beneficial to the model fitting 31 thus the model equation for the relevant responses is fitted in this supplemented eq 2 2 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k j 1 k β ij x i x j ε the ca2 concentration or pc sd and ph were pre selected as potential critical parameters these three were independent variables possibly affecting the fluoride and phosphate removal range levels or lower 1 and upper limits 1 with middle observation 0 would set a three level observation for each independent variable summarized in table 1 the software would convert the independent variables pc sd and ph to dimensionless coded values x i in eq 3 which would further be presented as variables a b and c in the results and discussion designated on the figures 3 x i x 0 x m x r where x 0 is the original value of the independent variable x m is the mid point value between the lower limits x l and upper limits x u and x r is the range between the midpoint of the 1 0 limits this would practically convert all the variables to coded values 1 0 0 and 1 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 curve fitting and regression analysis the defluoridation and the secondary phosphate removal by seeded precipitation with three pre selected factors were investigated using a three level bbd rsm the doe resulted in a total of 17 experimental runs where five of which were replicates listed in table 2 subjecting the experimental data to multi regression analysis the mathematical relationship between the factors and determined responses could be most fitted on a second order with minimal higher order departure 4 y 1 0 650 0 361 a 0 058 b 0 151 c 0 045 ab 0 065 ac 0 049 bc 0 087 a 2 0 058 b 2 0 014 c 2 0 134 a 2 c 5 y 2 0 212 0 256 a 0 172 b 0 067 c 0 070 ab 0 099 a c 0 157 bc 0 132 a 2 0 135 b 2 0 057 c 2 0 079 a 2 b 0 111 a 2 c 0 103 ab 2 eqs 4 and 5 were the modeled removal efficiency for fluoride y1 and phosphate y2 respectively both modeled equations contained third order variables a2c additionally a2b and ab2 were supplementary variables for phosphate although bbd was primarily preferred to fit in a second order model as mentioned in section 2 4 the second order could be inadequate requiring a higher variable indicated by ε in eq 2 thus a third or a higher order polynomial added more fitness to the model in this study draper et al termed this supplement of higher order terms as a true or feared model 31 while other authors referred as a reduced cubic model by the inclusion of third order variable s 32 additionally the points in fig 2 showing the correlation between the predicted and the actual values of removal efficiencies were almost fitted in the linear graph the individual effects of each variable together with its interactions as shown in the model eqs 4 and 5 were evaluated by anova in tables 3 and 4 the p value determined the coefficient and significance of each variable setting α 0 1 both the individual parameters and its interactions with p value 0 1 would be insignificant few variables demonstrated higher p values such as quadratic terms ab and c2 0 0002 and 0 0389 respectively while the rest had a p value 0 0001 conversely all the variables with the interactions had the p value 0 1 denoting the significance of the overall models together with the individual variable and interactions thus the regression models of removal efficiencies eqs 4 and 5 in general could be considered to have an adequate correlation with the observed values supplementary criteria were presented in table 5 the r squared complementing illustration in fig 2 was also relatively high 0 9994 and 0 9999 for fluoride and phosphate removal respectively likewise the adjusted r squared which could vary with the number of terms in the model were also high the adequate precisions measuring signal to noise ratio were both much higher to 4 0 indicating a desirable model to navigate the design space 33 overall the generated model of removal efficiencies by seeded precipitation is desirable and fitted to a supplemented second order equation with statistically significant terms 3 2 effects of the operating condition fig 3 shows the perturbation plots of the three parameters demonstrating the extent of the effects of the pre determined range of each parameter in this section individual effects of the variables were scrutinized holding other variables constant at coded value 0 subsequently the orders of variable significance are as follows in fig 3 a pc ph sd for fluoride removal and b pc sd ph for phosphate removal pc which dictated the amount of soluble calcium had the most significant effects among the variables having the stiffest slope for both fluoride and phosphate removal additionally the significance of the two other variables differed in the two responses figs 4 and 5 illustrate the three dimensional 3 d responses and two dimensional 2 d contour plots generated from regression analysis this was to further navigate the design space and explore the effects of each variable and its interaction in fluoride and phosphate removal the succeeding sections reveal that variable range could promote different mechanisms of removal in the different regions of the response surface 3 2 1 pc sd interaction effects the soluble calcium and calcite represented by pc and sd in this study are the precipitating agent and the seed to purportedly improve removal respectively the pc demonstrated the most significant parameter varying pc from 0 to 105 mm would significantly increase fluoride removal efficiency from 0 20 to 0 95 in fig 3a and phosphate removal efficiency from 0 1 to 0 60 in fig 3b the simultaneous improvement in the removal efficiencies of both fluoride and phosphate could intuitively be attributed to induced precipitation by the increase of ca2 in the solution however the prevailing ph at 4 0 unlike fluoride could restrict the phosphate precipitation the next possible mechanism for phosphate removal was adsorption which could be directly attributed to the 3 0 g of calcite however this would not still justify the increase of phosphate removal efficiency when pc was increased thus it was posited that the high removal observed at ph 4 0 might be by adsorption of newly generated caf2 particles the caf2 phpzc has been described to be at ph 7 8 34 while a pilot scale directly using a caf2 sludge reported the lowest zeta potential about 20 mv at ph 10 5 26 from this literature it could be postulated that the prevailing ph 4 0 might be promoting electrostatic attraction of anions e g phosphate to caf2 surface moreover fluoride fig 4a and phosphate fig 5a removal were in the ranges of 0 2 to 0 99 and 0 05 to 0 9 respectively generally as the value of the pc and sd increased both fluoride and phosphate removal increased however fig 4a shows that the effect of sd is also relatively insignificant compared to an increase in values of pc confirming a precipitation dominated defluoridation thus the seed application could only slightly improve fluoride removal conversely both the increase of pc and sd appreciably increased the phosphate removal in fig 5a as mentioned above the increase in the removal of phosphate could be governed by adsorption likely by the added seed or the newly formed caf2 in the works of sanciolo et al a calcite seed enhanced ca precipitation has also been described as a pre treatment of surface and groundwater before membrane filtration 35 36 conversely the size of the seed has been substantially smaller between 20 nm to 32 0 14 μm relative to the directly used size of recovered calcite about 350 μm the use of seed generally improves precipitation by providing regions for reaction moreover the smaller size of seeds having the same mass provides a higher surface area for regions of reaction thus the insignificant influence of the seed in defluoridation at fig 4a could presumably be due to the lack of surface area associated with larger particle size interestingly further examining the extreme conditions sd 1 0 g with increasing pc and at pc 105 mm with increasing sd at fig 5a the two variables pc and sd had relatively more expressive effects in phosphate removal it was subsequently suspected that there could be a synergistic effect by the two variables in removing the soluble phosphate at the solution aside from the possible direct removal of anions by direct calcite adsorption the high concentrations of different ions in the solution e g ca2 so4 2 po4 3 with opposite charges could alternately change the calcite surface charge derkani et al recently explored the effects of salts i e nacl cacl2 mgcl2 nahco3 and na2so4 on adsorption by calcite and dolomite 37 the authors further revealed that calcite has had an initial negative charge near neutral ph and the presence of anions hco3 and so4 2 could intensify the negative charge while cations ca2 and mg2 could instigate charge reversal hence low ph could initially alter the calcite surface to positive through the excessive h then the presence of opposite charge ions could modify the charge creating a multi layer of ions with an interchanging charge that would perhaps terminate upon ca depletion although other ionic components may not be removed or reduced through precipitation by calcium ionic components can be removed by complex electrostatic charge alteration at the calcite surface generally the defluoridation by the seeded precipitation still primarily relies on the caf2 precipitation demonstrated with the increase of pc moreover although the increase of sd can slightly contribute to the defluoridation it is perhaps restrained only by its present size on the other hand the removal of phosphate could chiefly be through simple or multi faceted adsorption induced by ca2 hence the immediate soluble calcium and calcite expressed by pc and sd can contribute to the simultaneous removal of both fluoride and phosphate 3 2 2 pc ph interaction effects as discussed above pc is a critical parameter being a measure of a removal agent depending on precipitation however precipitation is a complex process that could be governed by ph determining the possible precipitates by influencing the ionic species fig 3 shows that varying ph from 2 0 to 6 0 holding pc and sd constant will result in 0 85 to 0 55 defluoridation efficiency fig 3a and 0 3 to 0 2 phosphate removal efficiency fig 3b both constituted a decrease in efficiency as the ph increased which was contrary to the theoretical optimum ph for precipitation in the pc ph interaction figs 4b and 5b the ranges of fluoride and phosphate removals were 0 20 1 00 and 0 05 0 75 respectively figs 4b and 5b still reveal eminent pc effects while ph has lesser significance with phosphate than fluoride removal theoretically highly acidic ph 3 16 can inhibit caf2 precipitation eq 6 with the dominating hf species and the optimum ph is anticipated between 4 0 and 5 0 also avoiding an oh competition to ca2 6 ca 2 2 f caf 2 k sp 10 11 however there could be a dissolution of calcite at low ph adding soluble ions which would be discussed thoroughly in section 3 2 3 possibly contributing to precipitation 25 likewise in our previous investigation we have also discussed that the effect of low ph 2 0 could be subjugated by very high concentrations of ca2 and f boosting ion collision further forming caf2 38 hence activating the dormant calcium in calcite induced by lower ph would increase defluoridation efficiency even in acidic conditions unlike fluoride phosphate may undergo multiple conversions caddarao et al have detailed illustrations of this conversion of phosphate species from a triprotic acid h3po4 to its dissociation to po4 3 following three pka values i e pka1 2 2 pka2 7 2 and pka3 12 4 39 the authors have further illustrated the precipitation of cahpo4 by eq 7 from ph 5 0 to ph 14 0 which could have the presence of hpo4 2 species 7 ca 2 hpo 4 2 cahpo 4 k sp 10 7 meanwhile in this study the ph range was from ph 2 0 6 0 which could be highly dominated by h3po4 at ph 2 2 and h2po4 for the rest of the range although h2po4 could react with ca2 the solid product was soluble which could be easily dissolved again in the solution however at ph 5 0 hpo4 2 could already be generated and reacting with ca2 could precipitate insoluble cahpo4 possibly contributing to the removal of phosphate in the solution this explains the insignificant effect of ph on phosphate removal because the range would not allow a substantial phosphate species conversion with a condition predominated by h2po4 in this section the binary effects of ph in defluoridation are emphasized both inhibiting through hf formation and prompting precipitation initiated by calcite dissolution moreover the h2po4 dominated solution likely prevents the solid formation making the observed phosphate removal be attributed to adsorption 3 2 3 ph sd interaction effects as previously mentioned the primary intention of the seed is to provide surface area becoming nucleation sites alternatively the ph and sd interaction can generate an electrostatic attraction to the seed acting as an adsorbent in fig 3 increasing sd from 1 0 5 0 g the perturbation plot showed a change of defluoridation efficiency from 0 7 to about 0 75 while the phosphate efficiency changed from 0 15 0 50 the sd in this instance was relatively insignificant to defluoridation which was the least significant among the variables on the contrary sd had a significant effect on the removal of phosphate greater than ph in fig 4c the lowest and the highest defluoridation efficiency were 0 50 to 0 90 respectively the defluoridation efficiency generally increased as ph decreased and as sd increased in fig 5c the lowest and the highest phosphate removal efficiency were 0 15 to 0 60 respectively while efficiency increased as both variables increased the insignificant change in defluoridation efficiency at perturbation could also be highly influenced by ph at ph 4 0 calcite seed could still be relatively stable and only act as a nucleation site or adsorbent to increase defluoridation efficiency however further lowering of ph could already dissolve calcite or directly react with hf through eqs 8 and 9 8 caco 3 2 h h 2 co 3 2 ca 2 9 caco 3 2 hf caf 2 h 2 o co 2 eq 8 incorporates the dissolved ca2 from calcite to the solution and acts as precipitant filling the deficit ca2 of the limited pc 52 5 mm this condition could happen from ph 4 0 and below when the calcite dissolution would be highly dependent on the h concentration 40 thus the ph may shift the mechanism of calcite as an adsorbent or nucleation site to a source of ca2 precipitating f and sequentially improving defluoridation a recent study also demonstrated a caco3 induced by bacteria to precipitate f in groundwater 41 the addition of sd could improve phosphate removal moreover an increase in ph possibly inducing cahpo4 precipitation was relatively less significant making adsorption a dominant removing mechanism kosmulski has also cataloged calcite to have phpzc between 8 5 and 11 0 indicating a positively dominated surface charge at ph lower than phpzc 34 this has been similarly reported in the induced adsorption of phosphate on a graphene surface at acidic conditions 42 despite this the high concentration of ca2 increased through calcite dissolution might also possibly be undermining the ph effects similar to caf2 precipitation in hf dominated ph 38 thus this made phosphate possibly precipitate insoluble cahpo4 promoted by high concentrations leading to considerable ion collision this was to consider the increased phosphate removal efficiency with high ca2 by pc variation in fig 4a which possibly recurred in fig 4c in brief it is highlighted that calcite through ph interaction could not only serve as a nucleation site as primarily intended but also as a precipitant source and adsorbent 3 3 model validation using optimum condition the ultimate objective of the modeling was to predict the optimum condition for defluoridation efficiency under the presence of other co anions all the three parameters pc sd and ph were set in range while the goals for y1 and y2 were both set to maximize the first three solutions with desirability 1 0 were selected with a predictive value of defluoridation efficiency of about 1 0 the projected values of variables were practically the highest value for pc and sd about 105 mm and 5 0 g respectively while the ph was averaged to 3 79 0 13 these conditions were applied in the optimization experiment resulting in actual reaction ph 3 75 0 23 after the experiment the duplicated optimum condition demonstrated a 98 2 0 1 removal efficiency with 0 8 error relative to the predicted value hence co anions could insignificantly inhibit defluoridation in seed assisted precipitation at acidic ph upon further examination of other ionic species po4 3 so4 2 and no3 removal efficiencies were 75 40 and 17 respectively while no trace amount of ca2 was detected even though defluoridation attained high efficiency the final fluoride concentration would still be about 70 mg f l aoudj et al have described the insufficiency of treating fluoride by caf2 precipitation lowering fluoride to 25 60 mg l and requiring post treatment 43 on the other hand the use of mg precipitant was reported to simultaneously remove f 1280 56 mg l and po4 3 201 3 4 mg l leading to 91 and 58 removal 18 comparatively for similar anions the removal efficiencies in this study are still relatively higher at 98 4000 mg f l and 75 2000 mg po4 3 l thus the use of seeded precipitation using calcium can still significantly remove fluoride with co existing anions and still partially remove these anions especially phosphate 3 4 solid characterization and removal mechanism 3 4 1 xrd analysis fig 6 exhibits the xrd patterns for seed and recovered sludge revealing material crystal structure fig 6a shows that the raw and used calcite have almost the same pattern matched with jcpds no 47 1743 for caco3 moreover the pattern peaks for the recovered sludge matched with jcpds no 35 0816 for fluorite in fig 6b there was an observed slight reduction of seed size after the experiment attributed fractional dissolution of calcite in the solution despite this fig 6a suggests that the calcite dissolution under optimum condition had no significant changes in the crystal structure of the seed on the other hand the recovered sludge matched with fluorite alone also with chemical formula caf2 without significant indication of other crystal structure formation this confirmed the discussed removal dominated by chemical precipitation forming caf2 3 4 2 sem image and eds analysis fig 7 shows sem images and eds analysis of the calcite seeds from the original condition fig 7a and after the seeds have been subjected to varying conditions it was aimed to individually describe the possible interaction of the primary pollutant f in fig 7b and the precipitant ca2 in fig 7c to the seed by withholding either ca2 or f concentrations as well as its simultaneous interaction under the optimum condition in fig 7d precipitates from the optimum condition were also recovered and analyzed in fig 7e the seed subjected to 210 mm f without precipitant in fig 7b had about 40 f by weight on the surface of the seed while no noticeable morphological changes were observed likewise there were trace element of na and cl while n was manually identified at 0 392 kev though no traces of p was observed on the second blank experiment without f but with 105 mm ca2 in fig 7c a trace of p about 4 was observed while s was manually identified at 2 307 kev in addition there was an apparent smoothening of the calcite surface at both 70 and 2000 times magnifications at optimum condition presented in fig 7d f cl and p were both detected measuring about 40 35 and 3 respectively with the peak of n notably there was a significant change in morphology making the surface uneven from the original fairly uniformed clustered spherical shape to a smoother surface the precipitate was dominated by f and ca by weight about 50 and 40 respectively with trace amounts of p o and na while the surface morphology was relatively smooth as shown in fig 7e the detection of f at the surface of the seed even without the addition of ca2 in fig 7b verified that attraction of f to calcite most probably by adsorption as discussed above similarly n introduced from no3 was also possibly adsorbed by calcite the detection of the p and s in fig 7c could also imply the attachment of phosphate and sulfate in the calcite seed this was perhaps promoted by ca2 through complex adsorption induced by interchanging charge with other anions as also discussed in section 3 2 1 however the low concentrations of other anionic elements could suggest that the potential competition from anions could also be minimal in fig 7d the substantial morphological change could be due to the attachment of massive caf2 particles producing sludge attached to the surface of the calcite ultimately the detection of different anionic elements on the seed upheld the contribution of the calcite seed in the removal of the anions under the optimum condition moreover trace elements shown in fig 7e confirmed the potential attachment of ionic species on the generated caf2 sludge theoretically the molar ratio ca 2f would imply a slightly greater amount of ca by weight but otherwise occurred which could indicate an f adsorption at caf2 sludge most of the reports have dealt with groundwater having low f levels relative to very high and greater concentrations of anions 44 46 consequently these reports commonly found out significant effects of the co existing anions and the removal mechanism has been highly dependent on adsorption rosales et al have further described the adsorption of sulfates and phosphates by flocs competing with f 45 hence in this study besides direct adsorption from calcite it was also possible that anions were attached to the caf2 flocs in contrast the fluoride containing effluent from industrial processes has been dominated by fluoride ions declining the potential effects of co existing anions in this study the investigated treatment was not also highly dependent on adsorption but rather on chemical precipitation reducing the anionic competition with selective removal of f under favorable ph this selective removal of f under acidic ph with insignificant co ion interference has also been observed using a silica based precipitant 5 the smoothening of surface area was similar to the previously identified caf2 using conventional precipitation 38 in eq 9 calcite could instantaneously provide ca2 potentially precipitating f on the surface of calcite the ca2 from precipitant salt could also be attached to calcite similar to the bacteria used as a nucleation site precipitating caf2 47 the observed caf2 on the other hand could also be formed in the solution before attachment due to the relatively larger size of the seed with the reduced area as potential nucleation sites briefly the solid analysis of the seed subjected to different conditions confirmed the complex defluoridation mechanism and interaction with other anions using seeded precipitation 3 4 3 proposed mechanism fig 8 illustrates the proposed fluoride removal mechanism using seeded precipitation it was proposed that there were three removing agents 1 ca precipitant 2 calcite seed and 3 the generated caf2 sludge the defluoridation still heavily relied on the chemical precipitation with the soluble calcium presented in eq 6 which was classified as the main defluoridation mechanism initially calcite had only been deemed as a minor component acting as a reaction site for chemical precipitation however it was identified that calcite could have three other pathways aiding defluoridation the immediate actions were through a seed adsorption and b precipitation by direct hf reaction at the seed additionally the calcite seed could also adsorb other competing anionic species i e no3 po4 3 and so4 2 the third was the c dissolution of caco3 generating free ca2 which could consequentially lead to chemical precipitation finally precipitates forming a large amount of sludge could attract co anions to its surface thus during flocculation the caf2 sludge acted as an adsorbent similar to calcite further assisting the defluoridation of an aqueous solution 4 conclusions seeded precipitation has substantially removed fluoride and phosphate by 98 and 75 respectively at optimum condition pc 105 mm sd 5 0 g and ph 3 75 0 23 with 2000 mg l co anions the presumed competition of other anions has primarily been minimal due to the range of the prevailing acidic ph 2 0 6 0 inhibiting potential precipitation with ca2 the models of the critical parameters defining both the fluoride and phosphate removal efficiencies have been statistically significant the study has further shown that variables have had an order of significance in fluoride pc ph sd and phosphate pc sd ph removal efficiencies both the character of the removal efficiencies and the analysis of the recovered solids suggested that the prime mechanism of defluoridation was chemical precipitation while the partial removal co anions could be attributed to adsorption results confirmed the effectiveness of calcium based seeded precipitation using calcium and recovered calcite however the sd though demonstrated relatively significant effects statistically on defluoridation has been the least significant among the variables possibly be due to its size hence it is proposed that the reduction of particle size may increase the surface area may also increase the significance of sd with the same range 1 0 5 0 g declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

12980,this study aimed to optimize a seeded precipitation process using recovered caco3 for treating wastewater containing high concentrations of fluoride and co anions the simulated wastewater contained 4000 mg f l and 2000 mg l of co anions i e no3 po4 3 and so4 2 critical factors such as precipitant concentration mm ca2 seed dosage g and ph were subjected to box behnken design a response surface methodology to simultaneously model f and po4 3 removal efficiencies generally the critical factors were all statistically significant with ca2 concentration as the most significant parameter for both fluoride and phosphate removal even at extreme anion concentrations the optimum condition ca2 105 0 mm seed dosage 5 0 g and ph 3 79 0 13 still reached a high defluoridation efficiency about 98 with marginal error from predicted removal moreover anionic species i e po4 3 so4 2 and no3 had removal efficiencies of 75 40 and 17 respectively the range of the prevailing acidic ph 2 0 6 0 presumably deterred the potential precipitation of ca2 with other anions but still ensured caf2 precipitation in this study the solid analysis of the recovered caco3 subjected to different conditions could demonstrate a complex defluoridation mechanism using seeded precipitation keywords defluoridation wastewater treatment adsorption design of experiments calcite 1 introduction the rapid rise of urbanization and industrialization also has augmented the challenges in water requirements and environmental conservation this has increased water demand wastewater discharge and environmental pollution 1 in the past years fluoride emissions in the air and discharges in water bodies have been constant distress possibly damaging crops and live stocks contaminating water sources and compromising public health 2 a recent investigation further revealed that aggressive land development has widened the risk of fluoride exposure by two to seven fold of land area for a variety of land use within 8 years 3 however these developments endure sustaining economic growth in china the photovoltaic manufacturer was also recently reported to generate about 50 000 ppm f of effluent 4 it has also been estimated that metallurgical industries released about 390 million cubic meters of acidic fluoride wastewater containing about 50 1000 ppm with ph 1 0 5 moreover a recent study has also revealed that fluoride contamination of china s surface water intermingled with its complex convergence with groundwater 6 consequently the contaminated groundwater source could imperil the region s public health through its consumption leading to fluoride causing dental bone and iq reducing illnesses 7 9 in the past decades there have also been constant researches to defluoridate semi conductor industries in taiwan 10 12 in middle eastern regions the fertilizer industries also generating extreme concentrations of fluoride wastewater reaching about 10 000 ppm have been flourishing 13 moreover both of these regions have also been suffering from limited water 14 15 hence contamination of potential water sources should be avoided and managed with utmost care accordingly conscientious and reliable water management is vital consequentially resulting in the emergence of different defluoridation technologies for wastewater 16 it was observed that aside from fluoride both industries may also contain phosphate in the wastewater similar to hydrofluoric acid phosphoric acid has been used in etching for chemical and mechanical polishing 17 additionally fluoroapatite a raw material for fertilizer production contains fluoride and phosphate which may also end up at the effluent thus the simultaneous removal of both fluoride and phosphate has been reported in treating wastewater by chemical precipitation 200 mg po4 3 l 18 and by electrodialysis 4540 mg po4 3 l 19 in other literature the presence and the interfering effects of other anions have also been reported and investigated such as nitrate 350 2000 mg l 20 21 and sulfate 500 2000 mg l 22 the use of chemical precipitation followed by coagulation has continuously developed 23 24 moreover to improve precipitation seeds such as caf2 caco3 and ca₅ po₄ ₃f have either provided nucleation sites or adsorbing surfaces for fluoride removal 25 26 however these reports have been limited to low concentrations of fluoride only about 10 to 290 mg f l relatively very low compared to industrial effluents 1 0 to 50 0 g f l hence the seeded precipitation has not been thoroughly investigated with extreme concentrations of fluoride and other co existing anions in the past few years our research group has also had consecutive reports both treating water hardness and retrieving calcite using fluidized bed homogenous crystallization 27 29 in this study the retrieved calcite is directed as seed to aid precipitation 1 to primarily evaluate factors affecting the defluoridation efficiency at the presence of a high concentration of fluoride and co anions and 2 to further model the efficiency in terms of critical factors with statistically determined significance using box behnken design response surface methodology bbd rsm ultimately the model will be used to predict the optimum condition for fluoride removal to assess the efficiency with the presence of co anions moreover the defluoridation mechanism of fluoride removal will be proposed in the recovered solids from the precipitation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all solutions were prepared using doubly deionized water using the ro ultrapure water system resistance 18 2 mω the reagents used were analytical grade intended for laboratory use and no further purifications were applied to simulate the components of the synthetic wastewater viz f so4 2 po4 3 and no3 a stock solution was prepared with 8 0 g f l and 4 0 g l of other co anions all reagents were sodium based compounds sodium fluoride from panreac applichem sodium nitrate from choneye pure chemicals sodium persulfate from honeywell disodium phosphate from showa with a purity of about 99 likewise a stock solution of precipitant about 8 4 g ca2 l was also prepared using cacl2 2h2o 99 from aencore then sodium hydroxide from fisher scientific and hydrochloric acid 32 4 purity from choneye pure chemicals solutions were employed for ph adjustments total ion strength adjustment buffer tisab 1 from cole parmer neutralized ph between 5 0 and 5 5 and chelated metals in the solution generating free f for detection carbonate solution containing na2co3 from honeywell fluka and nahco3 from emsure with concentrations about 170 and 680 mg l respectively were also prepared for sample dilution before co anion detection the calcite seed having a nominal diameter of 350 μm was previously recovered from a lab scale fluidized bed homogenous crystallization process treating water hardness 2 2 experimental set ups calcite seed deionized water synthetic wastewater solution and precipitant solution were mixed based on predetermined proportions of precipitant concentration pc and seed dosage sd in a 500 ml beaker a mechanical gang stirrer from hung yao instrument co mixed the solution in two phases this was to simulate the coagulation flocculation process with the rapid and gradual mixing the first phase was agitated with a speed of 150 rpm within 10 min then reduced to 30 rpm for the rest of the operation time 50 min the resulting initial concentrations of anions c0 were 4000 mg l for f and 2000 mg l for other ions i e so4 2 po4 3 and no3 and varying ca2 concentrations 0 to 105 mm in 500 ml solution the ph was adjusted three times during the operation a during the rapid mixing 0 10 min b right after 10 min rapid mixing and c half time of slow mixing between 30 and 35 min of complete operation time the seeded precipitation setup is illustrated in fig 1 2 3 analytical methods and characterization all samples were initially filtered by a 0 2 μm syringe filter before their respective analysis for fluoride detection samples were diluted 10 fold then the 1 ml diluted sample was extracted and mixed with 1 ml tisab 1 solution the ion detector suntex ts 130 portable meter and an electrode having 4 0 m kcl electrolyte solution manufactured by cole parmer were used for fluoride ion measurement phosphate concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography ic dionex dx 120 the samples were first diluted with carbonated solution resulting in concentrations 100 mg l and precipitating remaining metals and filtered again before ic analysis for the calcium residuals no further sample preparations after filtering were done and samples were directly probed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes ultima 2000 horiba ltd japan upon measuring the residuals in the solution to compute for the removal efficiency η the following equation was used 1 η 1 c c 0 where η is the removal efficiency c is the final or residual concentration c0 is the initial concentration of the synthetic wastewater for the analysis of the recovered solids the solutions were decanted to recover the seeds and precipitates the surface morphology and elemental composition were determined by the scanning electron microscope sem joel jxa 840 hitachi s4100 and energy dispersive spectrometry eds links an10000 85s respectively to characterize the solids x ray diffraction xrd dx iii rigaku co japan was used revealing crystal structures peaks were then compared with the database of the joint committee of powder diffraction standards jcpds to identify the compounds 2 4 design of experiments to better understand the treatment by seeded precipitation and to minimize the number of experiments needed a design of experiment doe was applied the design expert 7 0 software trial version stat ease inc minneapolis usa was used to direct the user throughout the doe statistical analysis and its further optimization the box behnken design bbd response surface methodology rsm was the pre selected doe in this study the bbd is primarily intended to model or to fit in second order equations this has commonly been presented by equation terminating on the third term designated by second order variables at eq 2 30 however higher order departures indicated by ε in eq 2 have been sometimes necessary to allow degrees of freedom which could be beneficial to the model fitting 31 thus the model equation for the relevant responses is fitted in this supplemented eq 2 2 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k j 1 k β ij x i x j ε the ca2 concentration or pc sd and ph were pre selected as potential critical parameters these three were independent variables possibly affecting the fluoride and phosphate removal range levels or lower 1 and upper limits 1 with middle observation 0 would set a three level observation for each independent variable summarized in table 1 the software would convert the independent variables pc sd and ph to dimensionless coded values x i in eq 3 which would further be presented as variables a b and c in the results and discussion designated on the figures 3 x i x 0 x m x r where x 0 is the original value of the independent variable x m is the mid point value between the lower limits x l and upper limits x u and x r is the range between the midpoint of the 1 0 limits this would practically convert all the variables to coded values 1 0 0 and 1 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 curve fitting and regression analysis the defluoridation and the secondary phosphate removal by seeded precipitation with three pre selected factors were investigated using a three level bbd rsm the doe resulted in a total of 17 experimental runs where five of which were replicates listed in table 2 subjecting the experimental data to multi regression analysis the mathematical relationship between the factors and determined responses could be most fitted on a second order with minimal higher order departure 4 y 1 0 650 0 361 a 0 058 b 0 151 c 0 045 ab 0 065 ac 0 049 bc 0 087 a 2 0 058 b 2 0 014 c 2 0 134 a 2 c 5 y 2 0 212 0 256 a 0 172 b 0 067 c 0 070 ab 0 099 a c 0 157 bc 0 132 a 2 0 135 b 2 0 057 c 2 0 079 a 2 b 0 111 a 2 c 0 103 ab 2 eqs 4 and 5 were the modeled removal efficiency for fluoride y1 and phosphate y2 respectively both modeled equations contained third order variables a2c additionally a2b and ab2 were supplementary variables for phosphate although bbd was primarily preferred to fit in a second order model as mentioned in section 2 4 the second order could be inadequate requiring a higher variable indicated by ε in eq 2 thus a third or a higher order polynomial added more fitness to the model in this study draper et al termed this supplement of higher order terms as a true or feared model 31 while other authors referred as a reduced cubic model by the inclusion of third order variable s 32 additionally the points in fig 2 showing the correlation between the predicted and the actual values of removal efficiencies were almost fitted in the linear graph the individual effects of each variable together with its interactions as shown in the model eqs 4 and 5 were evaluated by anova in tables 3 and 4 the p value determined the coefficient and significance of each variable setting α 0 1 both the individual parameters and its interactions with p value 0 1 would be insignificant few variables demonstrated higher p values such as quadratic terms ab and c2 0 0002 and 0 0389 respectively while the rest had a p value 0 0001 conversely all the variables with the interactions had the p value 0 1 denoting the significance of the overall models together with the individual variable and interactions thus the regression models of removal efficiencies eqs 4 and 5 in general could be considered to have an adequate correlation with the observed values supplementary criteria were presented in table 5 the r squared complementing illustration in fig 2 was also relatively high 0 9994 and 0 9999 for fluoride and phosphate removal respectively likewise the adjusted r squared which could vary with the number of terms in the model were also high the adequate precisions measuring signal to noise ratio were both much higher to 4 0 indicating a desirable model to navigate the design space 33 overall the generated model of removal efficiencies by seeded precipitation is desirable and fitted to a supplemented second order equation with statistically significant terms 3 2 effects of the operating condition fig 3 shows the perturbation plots of the three parameters demonstrating the extent of the effects of the pre determined range of each parameter in this section individual effects of the variables were scrutinized holding other variables constant at coded value 0 subsequently the orders of variable significance are as follows in fig 3 a pc ph sd for fluoride removal and b pc sd ph for phosphate removal pc which dictated the amount of soluble calcium had the most significant effects among the variables having the stiffest slope for both fluoride and phosphate removal additionally the significance of the two other variables differed in the two responses figs 4 and 5 illustrate the three dimensional 3 d responses and two dimensional 2 d contour plots generated from regression analysis this was to further navigate the design space and explore the effects of each variable and its interaction in fluoride and phosphate removal the succeeding sections reveal that variable range could promote different mechanisms of removal in the different regions of the response surface 3 2 1 pc sd interaction effects the soluble calcium and calcite represented by pc and sd in this study are the precipitating agent and the seed to purportedly improve removal respectively the pc demonstrated the most significant parameter varying pc from 0 to 105 mm would significantly increase fluoride removal efficiency from 0 20 to 0 95 in fig 3a and phosphate removal efficiency from 0 1 to 0 60 in fig 3b the simultaneous improvement in the removal efficiencies of both fluoride and phosphate could intuitively be attributed to induced precipitation by the increase of ca2 in the solution however the prevailing ph at 4 0 unlike fluoride could restrict the phosphate precipitation the next possible mechanism for phosphate removal was adsorption which could be directly attributed to the 3 0 g of calcite however this would not still justify the increase of phosphate removal efficiency when pc was increased thus it was posited that the high removal observed at ph 4 0 might be by adsorption of newly generated caf2 particles the caf2 phpzc has been described to be at ph 7 8 34 while a pilot scale directly using a caf2 sludge reported the lowest zeta potential about 20 mv at ph 10 5 26 from this literature it could be postulated that the prevailing ph 4 0 might be promoting electrostatic attraction of anions e g phosphate to caf2 surface moreover fluoride fig 4a and phosphate fig 5a removal were in the ranges of 0 2 to 0 99 and 0 05 to 0 9 respectively generally as the value of the pc and sd increased both fluoride and phosphate removal increased however fig 4a shows that the effect of sd is also relatively insignificant compared to an increase in values of pc confirming a precipitation dominated defluoridation thus the seed application could only slightly improve fluoride removal conversely both the increase of pc and sd appreciably increased the phosphate removal in fig 5a as mentioned above the increase in the removal of phosphate could be governed by adsorption likely by the added seed or the newly formed caf2 in the works of sanciolo et al a calcite seed enhanced ca precipitation has also been described as a pre treatment of surface and groundwater before membrane filtration 35 36 conversely the size of the seed has been substantially smaller between 20 nm to 32 0 14 μm relative to the directly used size of recovered calcite about 350 μm the use of seed generally improves precipitation by providing regions for reaction moreover the smaller size of seeds having the same mass provides a higher surface area for regions of reaction thus the insignificant influence of the seed in defluoridation at fig 4a could presumably be due to the lack of surface area associated with larger particle size interestingly further examining the extreme conditions sd 1 0 g with increasing pc and at pc 105 mm with increasing sd at fig 5a the two variables pc and sd had relatively more expressive effects in phosphate removal it was subsequently suspected that there could be a synergistic effect by the two variables in removing the soluble phosphate at the solution aside from the possible direct removal of anions by direct calcite adsorption the high concentrations of different ions in the solution e g ca2 so4 2 po4 3 with opposite charges could alternately change the calcite surface charge derkani et al recently explored the effects of salts i e nacl cacl2 mgcl2 nahco3 and na2so4 on adsorption by calcite and dolomite 37 the authors further revealed that calcite has had an initial negative charge near neutral ph and the presence of anions hco3 and so4 2 could intensify the negative charge while cations ca2 and mg2 could instigate charge reversal hence low ph could initially alter the calcite surface to positive through the excessive h then the presence of opposite charge ions could modify the charge creating a multi layer of ions with an interchanging charge that would perhaps terminate upon ca depletion although other ionic components may not be removed or reduced through precipitation by calcium ionic components can be removed by complex electrostatic charge alteration at the calcite surface generally the defluoridation by the seeded precipitation still primarily relies on the caf2 precipitation demonstrated with the increase of pc moreover although the increase of sd can slightly contribute to the defluoridation it is perhaps restrained only by its present size on the other hand the removal of phosphate could chiefly be through simple or multi faceted adsorption induced by ca2 hence the immediate soluble calcium and calcite expressed by pc and sd can contribute to the simultaneous removal of both fluoride and phosphate 3 2 2 pc ph interaction effects as discussed above pc is a critical parameter being a measure of a removal agent depending on precipitation however precipitation is a complex process that could be governed by ph determining the possible precipitates by influencing the ionic species fig 3 shows that varying ph from 2 0 to 6 0 holding pc and sd constant will result in 0 85 to 0 55 defluoridation efficiency fig 3a and 0 3 to 0 2 phosphate removal efficiency fig 3b both constituted a decrease in efficiency as the ph increased which was contrary to the theoretical optimum ph for precipitation in the pc ph interaction figs 4b and 5b the ranges of fluoride and phosphate removals were 0 20 1 00 and 0 05 0 75 respectively figs 4b and 5b still reveal eminent pc effects while ph has lesser significance with phosphate than fluoride removal theoretically highly acidic ph 3 16 can inhibit caf2 precipitation eq 6 with the dominating hf species and the optimum ph is anticipated between 4 0 and 5 0 also avoiding an oh competition to ca2 6 ca 2 2 f caf 2 k sp 10 11 however there could be a dissolution of calcite at low ph adding soluble ions which would be discussed thoroughly in section 3 2 3 possibly contributing to precipitation 25 likewise in our previous investigation we have also discussed that the effect of low ph 2 0 could be subjugated by very high concentrations of ca2 and f boosting ion collision further forming caf2 38 hence activating the dormant calcium in calcite induced by lower ph would increase defluoridation efficiency even in acidic conditions unlike fluoride phosphate may undergo multiple conversions caddarao et al have detailed illustrations of this conversion of phosphate species from a triprotic acid h3po4 to its dissociation to po4 3 following three pka values i e pka1 2 2 pka2 7 2 and pka3 12 4 39 the authors have further illustrated the precipitation of cahpo4 by eq 7 from ph 5 0 to ph 14 0 which could have the presence of hpo4 2 species 7 ca 2 hpo 4 2 cahpo 4 k sp 10 7 meanwhile in this study the ph range was from ph 2 0 6 0 which could be highly dominated by h3po4 at ph 2 2 and h2po4 for the rest of the range although h2po4 could react with ca2 the solid product was soluble which could be easily dissolved again in the solution however at ph 5 0 hpo4 2 could already be generated and reacting with ca2 could precipitate insoluble cahpo4 possibly contributing to the removal of phosphate in the solution this explains the insignificant effect of ph on phosphate removal because the range would not allow a substantial phosphate species conversion with a condition predominated by h2po4 in this section the binary effects of ph in defluoridation are emphasized both inhibiting through hf formation and prompting precipitation initiated by calcite dissolution moreover the h2po4 dominated solution likely prevents the solid formation making the observed phosphate removal be attributed to adsorption 3 2 3 ph sd interaction effects as previously mentioned the primary intention of the seed is to provide surface area becoming nucleation sites alternatively the ph and sd interaction can generate an electrostatic attraction to the seed acting as an adsorbent in fig 3 increasing sd from 1 0 5 0 g the perturbation plot showed a change of defluoridation efficiency from 0 7 to about 0 75 while the phosphate efficiency changed from 0 15 0 50 the sd in this instance was relatively insignificant to defluoridation which was the least significant among the variables on the contrary sd had a significant effect on the removal of phosphate greater than ph in fig 4c the lowest and the highest defluoridation efficiency were 0 50 to 0 90 respectively the defluoridation efficiency generally increased as ph decreased and as sd increased in fig 5c the lowest and the highest phosphate removal efficiency were 0 15 to 0 60 respectively while efficiency increased as both variables increased the insignificant change in defluoridation efficiency at perturbation could also be highly influenced by ph at ph 4 0 calcite seed could still be relatively stable and only act as a nucleation site or adsorbent to increase defluoridation efficiency however further lowering of ph could already dissolve calcite or directly react with hf through eqs 8 and 9 8 caco 3 2 h h 2 co 3 2 ca 2 9 caco 3 2 hf caf 2 h 2 o co 2 eq 8 incorporates the dissolved ca2 from calcite to the solution and acts as precipitant filling the deficit ca2 of the limited pc 52 5 mm this condition could happen from ph 4 0 and below when the calcite dissolution would be highly dependent on the h concentration 40 thus the ph may shift the mechanism of calcite as an adsorbent or nucleation site to a source of ca2 precipitating f and sequentially improving defluoridation a recent study also demonstrated a caco3 induced by bacteria to precipitate f in groundwater 41 the addition of sd could improve phosphate removal moreover an increase in ph possibly inducing cahpo4 precipitation was relatively less significant making adsorption a dominant removing mechanism kosmulski has also cataloged calcite to have phpzc between 8 5 and 11 0 indicating a positively dominated surface charge at ph lower than phpzc 34 this has been similarly reported in the induced adsorption of phosphate on a graphene surface at acidic conditions 42 despite this the high concentration of ca2 increased through calcite dissolution might also possibly be undermining the ph effects similar to caf2 precipitation in hf dominated ph 38 thus this made phosphate possibly precipitate insoluble cahpo4 promoted by high concentrations leading to considerable ion collision this was to consider the increased phosphate removal efficiency with high ca2 by pc variation in fig 4a which possibly recurred in fig 4c in brief it is highlighted that calcite through ph interaction could not only serve as a nucleation site as primarily intended but also as a precipitant source and adsorbent 3 3 model validation using optimum condition the ultimate objective of the modeling was to predict the optimum condition for defluoridation efficiency under the presence of other co anions all the three parameters pc sd and ph were set in range while the goals for y1 and y2 were both set to maximize the first three solutions with desirability 1 0 were selected with a predictive value of defluoridation efficiency of about 1 0 the projected values of variables were practically the highest value for pc and sd about 105 mm and 5 0 g respectively while the ph was averaged to 3 79 0 13 these conditions were applied in the optimization experiment resulting in actual reaction ph 3 75 0 23 after the experiment the duplicated optimum condition demonstrated a 98 2 0 1 removal efficiency with 0 8 error relative to the predicted value hence co anions could insignificantly inhibit defluoridation in seed assisted precipitation at acidic ph upon further examination of other ionic species po4 3 so4 2 and no3 removal efficiencies were 75 40 and 17 respectively while no trace amount of ca2 was detected even though defluoridation attained high efficiency the final fluoride concentration would still be about 70 mg f l aoudj et al have described the insufficiency of treating fluoride by caf2 precipitation lowering fluoride to 25 60 mg l and requiring post treatment 43 on the other hand the use of mg precipitant was reported to simultaneously remove f 1280 56 mg l and po4 3 201 3 4 mg l leading to 91 and 58 removal 18 comparatively for similar anions the removal efficiencies in this study are still relatively higher at 98 4000 mg f l and 75 2000 mg po4 3 l thus the use of seeded precipitation using calcium can still significantly remove fluoride with co existing anions and still partially remove these anions especially phosphate 3 4 solid characterization and removal mechanism 3 4 1 xrd analysis fig 6 exhibits the xrd patterns for seed and recovered sludge revealing material crystal structure fig 6a shows that the raw and used calcite have almost the same pattern matched with jcpds no 47 1743 for caco3 moreover the pattern peaks for the recovered sludge matched with jcpds no 35 0816 for fluorite in fig 6b there was an observed slight reduction of seed size after the experiment attributed fractional dissolution of calcite in the solution despite this fig 6a suggests that the calcite dissolution under optimum condition had no significant changes in the crystal structure of the seed on the other hand the recovered sludge matched with fluorite alone also with chemical formula caf2 without significant indication of other crystal structure formation this confirmed the discussed removal dominated by chemical precipitation forming caf2 3 4 2 sem image and eds analysis fig 7 shows sem images and eds analysis of the calcite seeds from the original condition fig 7a and after the seeds have been subjected to varying conditions it was aimed to individually describe the possible interaction of the primary pollutant f in fig 7b and the precipitant ca2 in fig 7c to the seed by withholding either ca2 or f concentrations as well as its simultaneous interaction under the optimum condition in fig 7d precipitates from the optimum condition were also recovered and analyzed in fig 7e the seed subjected to 210 mm f without precipitant in fig 7b had about 40 f by weight on the surface of the seed while no noticeable morphological changes were observed likewise there were trace element of na and cl while n was manually identified at 0 392 kev though no traces of p was observed on the second blank experiment without f but with 105 mm ca2 in fig 7c a trace of p about 4 was observed while s was manually identified at 2 307 kev in addition there was an apparent smoothening of the calcite surface at both 70 and 2000 times magnifications at optimum condition presented in fig 7d f cl and p were both detected measuring about 40 35 and 3 respectively with the peak of n notably there was a significant change in morphology making the surface uneven from the original fairly uniformed clustered spherical shape to a smoother surface the precipitate was dominated by f and ca by weight about 50 and 40 respectively with trace amounts of p o and na while the surface morphology was relatively smooth as shown in fig 7e the detection of f at the surface of the seed even without the addition of ca2 in fig 7b verified that attraction of f to calcite most probably by adsorption as discussed above similarly n introduced from no3 was also possibly adsorbed by calcite the detection of the p and s in fig 7c could also imply the attachment of phosphate and sulfate in the calcite seed this was perhaps promoted by ca2 through complex adsorption induced by interchanging charge with other anions as also discussed in section 3 2 1 however the low concentrations of other anionic elements could suggest that the potential competition from anions could also be minimal in fig 7d the substantial morphological change could be due to the attachment of massive caf2 particles producing sludge attached to the surface of the calcite ultimately the detection of different anionic elements on the seed upheld the contribution of the calcite seed in the removal of the anions under the optimum condition moreover trace elements shown in fig 7e confirmed the potential attachment of ionic species on the generated caf2 sludge theoretically the molar ratio ca 2f would imply a slightly greater amount of ca by weight but otherwise occurred which could indicate an f adsorption at caf2 sludge most of the reports have dealt with groundwater having low f levels relative to very high and greater concentrations of anions 44 46 consequently these reports commonly found out significant effects of the co existing anions and the removal mechanism has been highly dependent on adsorption rosales et al have further described the adsorption of sulfates and phosphates by flocs competing with f 45 hence in this study besides direct adsorption from calcite it was also possible that anions were attached to the caf2 flocs in contrast the fluoride containing effluent from industrial processes has been dominated by fluoride ions declining the potential effects of co existing anions in this study the investigated treatment was not also highly dependent on adsorption but rather on chemical precipitation reducing the anionic competition with selective removal of f under favorable ph this selective removal of f under acidic ph with insignificant co ion interference has also been observed using a silica based precipitant 5 the smoothening of surface area was similar to the previously identified caf2 using conventional precipitation 38 in eq 9 calcite could instantaneously provide ca2 potentially precipitating f on the surface of calcite the ca2 from precipitant salt could also be attached to calcite similar to the bacteria used as a nucleation site precipitating caf2 47 the observed caf2 on the other hand could also be formed in the solution before attachment due to the relatively larger size of the seed with the reduced area as potential nucleation sites briefly the solid analysis of the seed subjected to different conditions confirmed the complex defluoridation mechanism and interaction with other anions using seeded precipitation 3 4 3 proposed mechanism fig 8 illustrates the proposed fluoride removal mechanism using seeded precipitation it was proposed that there were three removing agents 1 ca precipitant 2 calcite seed and 3 the generated caf2 sludge the defluoridation still heavily relied on the chemical precipitation with the soluble calcium presented in eq 6 which was classified as the main defluoridation mechanism initially calcite had only been deemed as a minor component acting as a reaction site for chemical precipitation however it was identified that calcite could have three other pathways aiding defluoridation the immediate actions were through a seed adsorption and b precipitation by direct hf reaction at the seed additionally the calcite seed could also adsorb other competing anionic species i e no3 po4 3 and so4 2 the third was the c dissolution of caco3 generating free ca2 which could consequentially lead to chemical precipitation finally precipitates forming a large amount of sludge could attract co anions to its surface thus during flocculation the caf2 sludge acted as an adsorbent similar to calcite further assisting the defluoridation of an aqueous solution 4 conclusions seeded precipitation has substantially removed fluoride and phosphate by 98 and 75 respectively at optimum condition pc 105 mm sd 5 0 g and ph 3 75 0 23 with 2000 mg l co anions the presumed competition of other anions has primarily been minimal due to the range of the prevailing acidic ph 2 0 6 0 inhibiting potential precipitation with ca2 the models of the critical parameters defining both the fluoride and phosphate removal efficiencies have been statistically significant the study has further shown that variables have had an order of significance in fluoride pc ph sd and phosphate pc sd ph removal efficiencies both the character of the removal efficiencies and the analysis of the recovered solids suggested that the prime mechanism of defluoridation was chemical precipitation while the partial removal co anions could be attributed to adsorption results confirmed the effectiveness of calcium based seeded precipitation using calcium and recovered calcite however the sd though demonstrated relatively significant effects statistically on defluoridation has been the least significant among the variables possibly be due to its size hence it is proposed that the reduction of particle size may increase the surface area may also increase the significance of sd with the same range 1 0 5 0 g declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

trimethacrylate 1 introduction oxyhalide anions are often found as pollutants in surface and ground waters the most common of these perchlorate clo4 is used as an oxidant in various industrial processes including the production of rocket propellants fireworks missile fuels explosives and batteries 1 whereas chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 are formed during water disinfection with chlorine dioxide clo2 2 or ozone 3 furthermore bromate bro3 occurs in drinking water primarily as a disinfection by product which forms during ozone treatment of bromide br containing water 4 5 although at most current levels of environmental exposure clo4 is not considered to represent a significant health risk 6 7 its presence in the environment is still a cause for concern because of its function as an endocrine disruptor that affects the thyroid gland as reported for workers experiencing long term exposure 8 as well as in model animal systems 9 clo4 has also been classified as a likely human carcinogen 10 and is considered to have the potential to induce renal cell tumors furthermore its ecotoxicity has been reported to vary according to species 11 and there are many outstanding questions concerning the effects of clo4 in the environment 12 although clo4 levels in drinking water are not currently regulated in the usa 12 it has still gained significant attention in recent years as a result of its widespread occurrence 13 15 in addition bro3 is a known mutagen and carcinogen 16 17 and together with clo4 its high solubility and stability make it difficult to remove efficiently from aqueous solutions removal of oxyhalide anions from water using conventional treatment technologies is difficult because of their non volatility high solubility and chemical stability and there has been much effort to develop cheap safe and effective methods 18 including ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and activated carbon adsorption along with biological chemical and electrochemical reduction 19 20 among these various water treatment technologies adsorption is considered to be the most appropriate for removing clo4 due to its high processing efficiency low cost and convenient operation among the various adsorbents that have been investigated synthetic resins have proved to be the most effective and attractive for lightly clo4 polluted drinking water for which they have advantages of high treatment efficiency low cost and easy operation 21 22 for instance xiong et al reported that polystyrene resins have a higher clo4 adsorption capacity than polyacrylic resins because of the hydrophilic properties of clo4 and the enhanced hydration energy of lewis acid base interactions 23 in addition various magnetic ion exchange systems have been developed for ease of separation from waters these include graphene loaded magnetic chitosan 24 corn straw modified biopolymer magnetic ion exchange resin 25 and a biofilm magnetic ion exchange resin 26 in addition response surface methodology has been used to guide adsorption studies of chlorate and chlorite on miex resins 27 furthermore trimethylolpropane triacrylate is widely used in light cured coatings flexible prints paints and polymer modifications with resistance to photolysis and solder but there is currently little literature on its potential use in resins for removal of pollutants from water in the present study we describe the free radical synthesis of a novel macroporous resin in which tertiary amine hydrochloride macroporous resins tahmr is present as a functional group its performance as an adsorbent was then evaluated for the removal of oxyhalide anions from water by assessing the effects of adsorbent dosage solution ph ionic strength other anions

performed at 70 c for 12 h with constant stirring at the end of the reaction the filtered polymer trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate resin tamr was washed repeatedly

and temperature on clo4 adsorption adsorption isotherms were measured for various initial concentrations of clo4 from 2 0 to 4 0 mmol l 1 at 15 25 35 and 45 c after clo4 adsorption suspensions were filtered through a nylon membrane filter millipore filter 0 22 μm and the amounts remaining in solution were measured to determine the adsorption dynamics a solution of clo4 1 0 mmol l 1 was passed upwards through a glass column ø10 500 mm packed with 7 0 g tahmr particle size 0 16 0 28 mm at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 the eluted concentrations were measured at various time intervals the amount of clo4 adsorbed by tahmr and its removal efficiency from solution were calculated from the differences between the initial and residual concentrations 2 4 analytical methods solution concentrations

clo4 clo3 clo2 and bro3 respectively total organic carbon toc was measured according to us epa standard methods 5310c all measurements were performed in triplicate and average values are presented the standard deviation was 5 in all cases 2 5 tahmr regeneration and reuse various reagents 0 1 mmol l 1 and 0 5 mmol l 1 hcl hno3 naoh and nacl were used to investigate desorption of clo4 from spent tahmr preliminary experiments showed that 0 5 mmol l 1 naoh provided the best desorption efficiency for tahmr loaded with clo4 95 4 si fig s1 tahmr adsorbed clo4 was regenerated with 0 5 mmol l 1 naoh solution followed by 0 2 mol l 1 hcl for activation of the resin at 25 c briefly 50 mg of clo4 saturated tahmr from the 25 c isotherm experiment was added to 50 ml of desorption reagent in a flask shaken for 10 min centrifuged and the residual clo4 concentration was measured as described above the regenerated resin was washed with pure water until neutral ph prior to reuse consecutive adsorption desorption cycles were repeated six times 2 6 stability and cytotoxicity tests for tahmr the stability of tahmr 1 0 g in water 1 l was assessed by shaking for 24 h at 30 c and ph values 2 0 7 0 or 12 0 then analyzing the solution at each ph cytotoxicity of tahmr was evaluated on chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cells using the mtt assay briefly cho k1 cell cultures were prepared as suspensions containing 4 104 1 104 or 0 6 104 cells ml 1 seeded in a 96 well microplate and cultured for 24 h extracts of tahmr diluted to various concentrations 100 50 25 12 5 were added to the microplate and 100 μl aliquots of the mixtures were incubated for 1 2 5 or 7 days then the cells were incubated with the mtt reagent for 4 h at 37 c subsequently 100 μl formazan solutions were added to each well and the optical density od was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at an adsorption wavelength of 490 nm the relative cell growth rate rgr was calculated as described in text s2 of eq s1 29 control cultures for the cho k1 cell assay were performed with ultrapure water and all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 7 quantum chemistry calculations all calculations used the gaussian 09 software package 30 models and adsorbent complexes were preliminarily optimized using molecular mechanics mm software prior to fully optimizing the geometries of all species by density functional theory dft without restrictions using the becke3 parameter exchange function of the lee yang parr correlation function b3lyp 31 the basis set for c h o n and cl atoms was 6 311 g and br atoms were in the pseudo potential basis set lanl2dz single point frequency calculations of these optimized geometries ensured their minimum energy structures were produced a detailed description of the quantum chemistry calculations is available as si text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tahmr tahmr was characterized by ftir sem bet elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis sem images show that the tahmr samples are in the form of spherical beads fig 1a and have a porous surface fig 1b comparison of the ftir spectra of tamr and tahmr fig 1c shows negligible differences in the positions of the peaks for co 1646 1731 cm 1 and ch3 2985 cm 1 32 however the peak at 2827 cm 1 that is assigned to the n ch3 2 stretching vibration in tamr shifted to 2697 cm 1 in tahmr and corresponds to hn ch3 2 groups on the tahmr surface the n2 adsorption desorption curve fig 1d shows that the surface area is about 7 9 m2 g 1 the average pore diameter is 13 4 nm with a volume of 0 018 cm3 g 1 the diameter distribution curve shows an average pore width around 14 nm examination of the thermal stability of tahmr tga fig 1e shows the presence of two major weight loss peaks below 480 c in the dta curve however the resin is stable below 300 c and thus has sufficient thermal stability for use in water treatment processes 3 2 tahmr selectivity for adsorption of oxyhalide anions the adsorption capacities of the oxyhalide anions at 25 c varied considerably and followed the descending order clo4 2 74 mmol g 1 clo3 2 5 mmol g 1 clo2 2 43 mmol g 1 bro3 1 16 mmol g 1 these along with their adsorption isotherms are available as si fig s2 and are described by both the langmuir and freundlich models which are presented in si text s4 and table s2 the langmuir model fitted well to these adsorption isotherms r 2 0 999 si table s2 and this indicates that the oxyhalide anions were adsorbed as monolayers based on their physicochemical properties the different adsorption capacities of these oxyhalide anions can be explained as a preference of tahmr for ions with larger ionic radius and electronegativity additionally quantum chemistry calculations provide support for this interpretation of the experimental results fig s3 and table s3 3 3 comparison with adsorption capacities of various commercial resins for clo4 the performances of five commercial resins ira 410 irn 150 ira 167 d201 and d301 were compared with that of tahmr figs 2 and s4 the adsorption capacity of tahmr for clo4 was significantly greater than that of the commercial resins thus suggesting that it could be an effective adsorbent for removing oxyhalide anions from waters generally the adsorption capacity is affected by several factors including specific surface area adsorbent polarity and pore structures however although the specific surface area of tahmr is lower than those of d301 d201 or ira 167 si table s1 whilst its adsorption capacity for clo4 is higher thus the specific surface area is not the main factor for determining the anion adsorption capacity of these resins 33 3 4 factors affecting adsorption of clo4 various conditions that affect the adsorption of clo4 on tahmr were also investigated and are described in this section 3 4 1 effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of clo4 on tahmr with a fixed initial concentration of clo4 1 0 mmol l 1 is shown in fig s5 there was a significant increase in clo4 adsorption for adsorbent dosages in the range 0 25 to 0 5 g l 1 but there were only small increases for amounts 0 75 g l 1 thus for subsequent experiments to assess the effects of other factors on adsorption efficiency we chose to work with 1 0 g l 1 adsorbent dosage as a balance between assessing maximum clo4 adsorption and economy for adsorbent usage 34 3 4 2 effect of nitrogen grafting ratio the clo4 adsorption capacities of tahmr were strongly influenced by the nitrogen grafting rate with values of 0 25 0 85 and 0 94 mmol g 1 being observed for 5 7 and 9 n fig 3 in tahmr respectively the release of cl ions when clo4 was adsorbed on tahmr indicates that ion exchange is an important mechanism for clo4 removal from water and tahmr containing 9 n was selected as the optimum adsorbent for the following experiments the amount of cl released from the cl activated resin was slightly lower than that of clo4 adsorbed which means that other adsorption mechanisms are involved in the clo4 adsorption process besides ion exchange 35 3 4 3 effect of ph and ionic strength ph is an important factor that influences adsorption processes through its effect on the surface charge of the adsorbent and the degree ionization of the adsorbate 36 its effect on clo4 adsorption by tahmr is shown in fig 4a adsorption of clo4 increased with ph in the range 2 0 4 0 but was independent of ph in the range 4 0 10 0 which suggests that protonation of tertiary amines occurs at low ph to further investigate the effect of ph on clo4 adsorption zeta potentials were measured as a function of ph before and after adsorption of clo4 shown as fig s6 37 with both samples the zeta potentials decreased progressively with increasing ph from 2 0 to 10 0 and tahmr has a positively charged surface at ph 6 0 when ph phzpc the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged resulting in repulsive forces between clo4 and the surface of tahmr however the fact that high ph favors adsorption and removal of clo4 from solution thus suggests that ion exchange is the main adsorption mechanism and not electrostatic attraction 34 the effect of ionic strength on clo4 adsorption was studied using nacl concentrations between 0 and 50 mmol l 1 fig 4b the amount of clo4 adsorbed by the resin decreased appreciably with increasing ionic strength in the range 0 10 mmol l 1 but by smaller amounts for 10 50 mmol l 1 previous studies have shown that ionic strength has a significant negative effect on the adsorption process if electrostatic attraction is the main adsorption mechanism 38 and the present result provides further evidence that electrostatic attraction is not the main adsorption mechanism for clo4 in media with high ionic strength 3 4 4 effects of associated components and the water matrix water matrices commonly contain nom such as humic acid and various inorganic anions including f no3 hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 previous studies have shown that such anions can compete with clo4 in adsorption processes 39 and the effect of various associated components on clo4 adsorption on tahmr is illustrated in fig 4c in each case clo4 adsorption decreased with the increasing concentrations of the associated anions at concentrations 1 0 mmol l 1 this inhibitory effect is consistent with an ion exchange mechanism for clo4 adsorption on tahmr and indicates that the coordination effect of anions involved in electron donors acceptor interaction may affect the adsorption process additionally the ion exchange process may also be related to the ionic radius of the anions among the anions studied so4 2 had the greatest impact on the clo4 removal from water and the inhibitory effect on clo4 adsorption decreased in the order as so4 2 sio3 2 hpo4 2 hco3 no3 f which is similar to that observed in a previous study of the adsorption of clo4 on activated carbon 39 the presence of nom can also decrease the adsorption of clo4 40 and as illustrated in fig s7 the efficiency of clo4 removal from water by tahmr decreased progressively with increasing nom concentration express as doc the potential of tahmr for use in practical applications was assessed by determining its performance in natural waters spiked with clo4 fig 4d here the adsorption capacity for clo4 was found to be significantly lower with lake water indicating that organic components in the lake water compete with clo4 for the adsorption sites on tahmr si table s4 nevertheless the adsorption capacity of tahmr for clo4 remained appreciable and these results demonstrate the practical potential of tahmr for removing clo4 from natural water sources 41 3 4 5 adsorption kinetics the kinetics for adsorption of clo4 on tahmr at different initial clo4 concentrations 0 5 1 5 mmol l 1 are shown in fig 5 for each concentration clo4 removal from solution was very rapid in the first 10 min and reached equilibrium with a maximum removal of 95 after 25 min this is much faster than the times reported for other adsorbents 18 42 and demonstrates that tahmr possesses easily accessible sites with high affinity for clo4 in order to further evaluate the reaction mechanism and rate determining steps the results in fig s8 were analyzed using pseudo first order second order and intra particle diffusion kinetic models described in si text s4 the adsorption kinetics were fitted well with the pseudo second order model correlation coefficient r 2 0 999 and details of these results are available as si table s5 and fig s8a and b plots of q t mg g 1 versus t 0 5 for the intra particle diffusion model could be separated into two linear regions si fig s8c and indicate that most of the adsorption occurs during the initial rapid step 43 3 5 clo4 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics adsorption isotherms for clo4 on tahmr at 15 45 c si fig s9 show that adsorption of clo4 increased with the increasing temperature the langmuir and freundlich models described in table s6 were both used to fit these isotherm data 44 the langmuir model r 2 0 999 gave the better fit to the experimental data which indicates that adsorption occurs as a monolayer it is also noteworthy that the q m value is higher than the corresponding values reported for other adsorbents as presented in table 1 thermodynamic parameters standard gibbs energy δg o ads enthalpy δh o ads and entropy δs o ads for adsorption of clo4 on tahmr at different temperatures were calculated from eqs 1 and 2 and the results summarized in si table s7 1 δ g ads o rt ln k d 2 ln k d δ s ads o r δ h ads o rt where k d is the adsorption distribution coefficient c ad c e c ad is the concentration of solute that is adsorbed on tahmr at equilibrium and c e is the concentration of solute that is in solution at equilibrium r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t k is the absolute temperature the enthalpy change δh o ads was obtained by plotting lnkd versus 1 t si fig s10 and has a value of 30 9 kj mol 1 whilst δs o ads has a value of 0 13 kj mol 1 k 1 the values of δg o ads were negative at all temperatures and in the range 6 9 to 10 2 kj mol 1 the negative values of δg o ads indicate the thermodynamic feasibility and spontaneous nature of adsorption of clo4 on tahmr whilst the positive values of δh o ads and δs o ads indicate that the adsorption of clo4 on tahmr is an endothermic process with increasing randomness at the solid liquid interface after adsorption 18 3 6 simultaneous adsorption of both clo4 and bro3 bro3 is now recognized as an emerging pollutant that is frequently found in drinking water 5 and its adsorption on tahmr was investigated separately and in combination with clo4 the results for adsorption of clo4 and bro3 as single components are described by the langmuir equation figs s11 and s12 and the equilibrium data for the binary system was thus analyzed using the langmuir competitive model lcm 51 which is described by eqs 3 4 3 q p q max p k p c eq p 1 k p c eq p k b c eq b 4 q b q max b k b c eq b 1 k b c eq b k p c eq p where the suffixes p and b represent clo4 and bro3 respectively q max p and q max b represent the maximum sorbate uptake k p and k b are the langmuir constants for clo4 and bro3 in a mixture of the oxyhalide anions and c eq p and c eq b are the equilibrium concentrations for clo4 and bro3 in the solute mixture mmol l 1 in binary systems adsorption of clo4 on tahmr was greater than that of bro3 fig 6 small bro3 concentrations had little effect on the adsorption of clo4 although it had an increasing effect as the bro3 concentration was increased in order to determine whether the surfaces in fig 6 accurately describe the equilibria the calculated q e cal and the experimental q e exp for the adsorbed oxyhalide anions were compared the standard deviations between these values for q e cal and q e exp were very small fig s13 and the regression equations for clo4 and bro3 are q e cal 1 0003 q e exp 2 3 10 3 r 2 0 999 and q e cal 1 0001 q e exp 2 7 10 3 r 2 0 999 moreover the experimental data for the equilibrium concentrations of clo4 and bro3 are well fitted with the 3 d adsorption isotherm fig 6 for the binary clo4 bro3 system selectivity for adsorption from equimolar ratios on tahmr was calculated from the experimental single component isotherms using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast model 52 extended to predict multi component adsorption equilibrium from dilute liquid solutions this is described by eq 5 5 selectivity z b x b z p x p q b c eq p q p c eq b where zp and zb are the mole fraction of the clo4 and bro3 in the adsorbed phase xp and xb are the mole fraction of the clo4 and bro3 in the liquid phase q p and q b are the amounts of clo4 and bro3 adsorbed the concentrations of clo4 and bro3 used for the iast model calculations are within the ranges of experimental data si fig s14 however selectivity increased with increasing concentrations and tahmr exhibited high selectivity for clo4 over bro3 at high concentrations this tendency is consistent with the quantum chemistry calculations and experimental data in section 3 2 3 7 fixed bed column adsorption and regeneration to further evaluate the feasibility of using tahmr for practical applications adsorption of clo4 was also studied using a fixed bed column 46 break through curves for adsorption of clo4 on tahmr are shown in fig 7a for 6 consecutive cycles adsorption equilibrium was approached when the bed volume bv was 4000 and reached at 4500 bv the dynamic behavior of this adsorbent adsorbate system was simulated by the thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart models si text s6 and fig s15 both thomas and yoon nelson models showed good fits to the dynamic adsorption data with an adsorption capacity of 2 43 mmol g 1 for clo4 si fig s15 and table s8 in order to examine its potential for reuse a tahmr column that had been saturated with clo4 was regenerated with 0 5 mmol l 1 naoh followed by 0 5 mmol l 1 hcl most of the eluted clo4 was concentrated within 40 bv 53 fig 7b when six consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles were performed the dynamic adsorption capacity decreased progressively to 95 6 93 6 92 9 90 3 and finally 87 5 of the initial value thus demonstrating that the adsorption capacity of tahmr remains relatively stable in 6 repeated adsorptions overall these experimental results demonstrate that tahmr has a good potential for use in the selective removal of clo4 from water 54 3 8 tahmr stability and cytotoxicity the stability of the tahmr in water was assessed by monitoring the composition of the leachate as described in section 2 there was only low total organic dissolution 0 2 mg l 1 of toc and no trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate or toluene was detected the potential toxicity of the tahmr was evaluated by the mtt assay which is commonly employed for detection of cytotoxicity or assessing cell viability fig s16 shows the morphologies of cho cells cultured in different extracts after 7 days of incubation all were normal and healthy and similar to that of the control also as shown in fig s17 there was no significant effect of tahmr on the relative cell viability of control after 1 2 5 and 7 days of incubation although the relative cell viability for 100 concentration of extracts of tahmr was slightly decreased after 7 days incubation thus based on the standard iso 10993 5 1999 55 these resin extracts have no significant cytotoxic effect furthermore compared with untreated solutions of 1 0 mmol l 1 clo4 adsorption by tahmr significantly reduced its toxicity and thus confirms its good biocompatibility and demonstrates its potential use as an adsorbent for the removal of oxyhalide anions from drinking water 3 9 adsorption mechanisms generally characterization of the solid phase is used to aid elucidation of the interaction mechanisms between adsorbents and adsorbates and in the present work interactions between clo4 as a representative oxyhalide and tahmr were explored by a combination of ftir and xps infrared spectra of tahmr before and after adsorption of clo4 at ph 7 0 are shown in fig s18 after the adsorption of clo4 the 2697 cm 1 peak that is assigned to the tertiarylamine hydrochloride r ch3 2n hcl group in tahmr 32 56 disappeared and was replaced by peaks at 1100 and 605 cm 1 that correspond to clo4 this result demonstrates conclusively that clo4 was adsorbed on tahmr during the adsorption process the xps spectra in figs 8 and s19 of tahmr and tahmr clo4 prepared at ph 7 0 showed negligible differences in the c 1s and o 1s binding energy regions although this is unsurprising because of the much larger number of c and o atoms in the resin framework than on the surface which interacts with clo4 however there were appreciable differences in the n 1s binding region in tahmr the spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies of 399 39 ev and 410 75 ev corresponding respectively to nitrogen in the r n ch3 2 group nh2 or nh and protonated amine nh3 57 these peaks both shifted to lower binding energies 399 07 ev and 410 54 ev after clo4 adsorption and this result demonstrates that nitrogen was involved in the adsorption of clo4 a peak at 207 36 ev which has been assigned to the clo bonds of clo4 37 appeared in the cl 2p spectrum of tahmr clo4 and further confirms that clo4 was adsorbed on tahmr overall the experimental results indicate that adsorption of clo4 on tahmr is mainly due to ion exchange with some additional contribution from electrostatic interactions as illustrated in scheme 2 in order to gain further insight into the relative importance of various mechanisms for the adsorption of clo4 quantum chemistry calculations were performed for the two optimized geometrical structures of the possible tahmr clo4 complexes these calculations gave binding energies for ion exchange interaction model i and electrostatic interaction interaction model ii as 17 6 kj mol 1 and 406 5 kj mol 1 respectively and thus provide further support for ion exchange being the dominant adsorption mechanism figs 9 and s20 4 conclusions this study has described the preparation and characterization of a novel macroporous resin tahmr containing tertiary amine functional groups and demonstrated that it can effectively remove oxyhalide anions i e clo4 clo3 clo2 and bro3 from water ion exchange was shown to be the principal mechanism for adsorption of clo4 and presumably also other oxyhalide anions on tahmr and the tertiary amino groups were shown to be directly involved in the adsorption process after use dilute naoh followed by hcl solutions could effectively regenerate the resin based on results obtained using adsorption of clo4 as a representative oxyhalide tahmr compared favorably with several commercial resins in terms of both adsorption capacity and speed of adsorption the adsorption process was shown to obey pseudo second order kinetics and clo4 adsorption on tahmr was fitted well with langmuir model which indicated a maximum adsorption capacity of 2 74 mmol g 1 however in a binary system of clo4 and bro3 tahmr was shown to have significantly greater affinity for clo4 and its removal of the more toxic bro3 is limited from waters with high clo4 contents although the current research demonstrates that tahmr is a promising adsorbent for use in water treatment we did not investigate the potential contribution to the adsorption properties of the bentonite mineral which was used primarily as a dispersing agent during the resin preparation however the incorporation of clays such as bentonite may improve the physical and chemical properties of polymers or conventional micro and macro composites and the influence of the exchanged ion in the clay and the clay organic ratio on the performance of the tahmr resin will be the subject of further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships with other

12981,the non volatility high solubility and chemical stability of oxyhalide anions make them difficult to remove from waters here we describe the synthesis and characterization of tertiary amine hydrochloride macroporous resins tahmr that show excellent performance for the adsorption of oxyhalide anions adsorption capacities were in the order clo4 clo3 clo2 bro3 and compared favorably with those from various commercial resins studied compared with the common anions in water tahmr has better selectivity for clo4 adsorption of clo4 on tahmr increased with increasing ph in the range 2 0 4 0 but was independent of ph in the range 4 0 10 0 and was only slightly affected by the presence of hco3 and hpo4 2 the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo second order rate model and was fitted well by the langmuir isotherm with maximum adsorption capacity of 2 74 mmol g 1 investigations with various spectroscopic techniques and quantum chemistry calculations indicate that adsorption of oxyhalide anions occurs at the nitrogen atoms in the resin furthermore tahmr resins could be effectively regenerated and reused and did not show any cytotoxic effects thus tahmr is a promising

most current levels of environmental exposure clo4 is not considered to represent a significant health risk 6 7 its presence in the environment is still a cause for concern because of its function as an endocrine disruptor that affects the thyroid gland as reported for workers experiencing long term exposure 8 as well as in model animal systems 9 clo4 has also been classified as a likely human carcinogen 10 and is considered to have the potential to induce renal cell tumors furthermore its ecotoxicity has been reported to vary according to species 11 and there are many outstanding questions concerning the effects of clo4 in the environment 12 although clo4 levels in drinking water are not currently regulated in the usa 12 it has still gained significant attention in recent years as a result of its widespread occurrence 13 15 in addition bro3 is a known mutagen and carcinogen 16 17 and together with clo4 its high solubility and stability make it difficult to remove efficiently from aqueous solutions removal of oxyhalide anions from water using conventional treatment technologies is difficult because of their non volatility high solubility and chemical stability and there has been much effort to develop cheap safe and effective methods 18 including ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and activated carbon adsorption along with biological chemical and electrochemical reduction 19 20 among these various water treatment technologies adsorption is considered to be the most appropriate for removing clo4 due to its high processing efficiency low cost and convenient operation among the various adsorbents that have been investigated synthetic resins have proved to be the most effective and attractive for lightly clo4 polluted drinking water for which they have advantages of high treatment efficiency low cost and easy operation 21 22 for instance xiong et al reported that polystyrene resins have a higher clo4 adsorption capacity than polyacrylic resins because of the hydrophilic properties of clo4 and the enhanced hydration energy of lewis acid base interactions 23 in addition various magnetic ion exchange systems have been developed for ease of separation from waters these include graphene loaded magnetic chitosan 24 corn straw modified biopolymer magnetic ion exchange resin 25 and a biofilm magnetic ion exchange resin 26 in addition response surface methodology has been used to guide adsorption studies of chlorate and chlorite on miex resins 27 furthermore trimethylolpropane triacrylate is widely used in light cured coatings flexible prints paints and polymer modifications with resistance to photolysis and solder but there is currently little literature on its potential use in resins for removal of pollutants from water in the present study we describe the free radical synthesis of a novel macroporous resin in which tertiary amine hydrochloride macroporous resins tahmr is present as a functional group its performance as an adsorbent was then evaluated for the removal of oxyhalide anions from water by assessing the effects of adsorbent dosage solution ph ionic strength other anions and natural organic matter nom concentration as well as the composition of the water matrix the kinetics and thermodynamic properties of clo4 adsorption on tahmr were also measured subsequently the stability and cytotoxicity tests for tahmr also were evaluated adsorption mechanisms were elucidated using a combination of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps along with quantum chemistry calculations which used density function theory dft to provide insight into the interaction model structure and ability of various functional groups in

performed at 70 c for 12 h with constant stirring at the end of the reaction the filtered polymer trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate resin tamr was washed repeatedly

and temperature on clo4 adsorption adsorption isotherms were measured for various initial concentrations of clo4 from 2 0 to 4 0 mmol l 1 at 15 25 35 and 45 c after clo4 adsorption suspensions were filtered through a nylon membrane filter millipore filter 0 22 μm and the amounts remaining in solution were measured to determine the adsorption dynamics a solution of clo4 1 0 mmol l 1 was passed upwards through a glass column ø10 500 mm packed with 7 0 g tahmr particle size 0 16 0 28 mm at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 the eluted concentrations were measured at various time intervals the amount of clo4 adsorbed by tahmr and its removal efficiency from solution were calculated from the differences between the initial and residual concentrations 2 4 analytical methods solution concentrations

column a guard column and a 250 μl sample loop a 3 6 mmol l 1 na2co3 solution was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0 8 cm3 min 1 and the quantification limits were 5 4 1 2 5 and 8 0 μg l 1 for clo4 clo3 clo2 and bro3 respectively total organic carbon toc was measured according to us epa standard methods 5310c all measurements were performed in triplicate and average values are presented the standard deviation was 5 in all cases 2 5 tahmr regeneration and reuse various reagents 0 1 mmol l 1 and 0 5 mmol l 1 hcl hno3 naoh and nacl were used to investigate desorption of clo4 from spent tahmr preliminary experiments showed that 0 5 mmol l 1 naoh provided the best desorption efficiency for tahmr loaded with clo4 95 4 si fig s1 tahmr adsorbed clo4 was regenerated with 0 5 mmol l 1 naoh solution followed by 0 2 mol l 1 hcl for activation of the resin at 25 c briefly 50 mg of clo4 saturated tahmr from the 25 c isotherm experiment was added to 50 ml of desorption reagent in a flask shaken for 10 min centrifuged and the residual clo4 concentration was measured as described above the regenerated resin was washed with pure water until neutral ph prior to reuse consecutive adsorption desorption cycles were repeated six times 2 6 stability and cytotoxicity tests for tahmr the stability of tahmr 1 0 g in water 1 l was assessed by shaking for 24 h at 30 c and ph values 2 0 7 0 or 12 0 then analyzing the solution at each ph cytotoxicity of tahmr was evaluated on chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cells using the mtt assay briefly cho k1 cell cultures were prepared as suspensions containing 4 104 1 104 or 0 6 104 cells ml 1 seeded in a 96 well microplate and cultured for 24 h extracts of tahmr diluted to various concentrations 100 50 25 12 5 were added to the microplate and 100 μl aliquots of the mixtures were incubated for 1 2 5 or 7 days then the cells were incubated with the mtt reagent for 4 h at 37 c subsequently 100 μl formazan solutions were added to each well and the optical density od was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at an adsorption wavelength of 490 nm the relative cell growth rate rgr was calculated as described in text s2 of eq s1 29 control cultures for the cho k1 cell assay were performed with ultrapure water and all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 7 quantum chemistry calculations all calculations used the gaussian 09 software package 30 models and adsorbent complexes were preliminarily optimized using molecular mechanics mm software prior to fully optimizing the geometries of all species by density functional theory dft without restrictions using the becke3 parameter exchange function of the lee yang parr correlation function b3lyp 31 the basis set for c h o n and cl atoms was 6 311 g and br atoms were in the pseudo potential basis set lanl2dz single point frequency calculations of these optimized geometries ensured their minimum energy structures were produced a detailed description of the quantum chemistry calculations is available as si text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tahmr tahmr was characterized by ftir sem bet elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis sem images show that the tahmr samples are in the form of spherical beads fig 1a and have a porous surface fig 1b comparison of the ftir spectra of tamr and tahmr fig 1c shows negligible differences in the positions of the peaks for co 1646 1731 cm 1 and ch3 2985 cm 1 32 however the peak at 2827 cm 1 that is assigned to the n ch3 2 stretching vibration in tamr shifted to 2697 cm 1 in tahmr and corresponds to hn ch3 2 groups on the tahmr surface the n2 adsorption desorption curve fig 1d shows that the surface area is about 7 9 m2 g 1 the average pore diameter is 13 4 nm with a volume of 0 018 cm3 g 1 the diameter distribution curve shows an average pore width around 14 nm examination of the thermal stability of tahmr tga fig 1e shows the presence of two major weight loss peaks below 480 c in the dta curve however the resin is stable below 300 c and thus has sufficient thermal stability for use in water treatment processes 3 2 tahmr selectivity for adsorption of oxyhalide anions the adsorption capacities of the oxyhalide anions at 25 c varied considerably and followed the descending order clo4 2 74 mmol g 1 clo3 2 5 mmol g 1 clo2 2 43 mmol g 1 bro3 1 16 mmol g 1 these along with their adsorption isotherms are available as si fig s2 and are described by both the langmuir and freundlich models which are presented in si text s4 and table s2 the langmuir model fitted well to these adsorption isotherms r 2 0 999 si table s2 and this indicates that the oxyhalide anions were adsorbed as monolayers based on their physicochemical properties the different adsorption capacities of these oxyhalide anions can be explained as a preference of tahmr for ions with larger ionic radius and electronegativity additionally quantum chemistry calculations provide support for this interpretation of the experimental results fig s3 and table s3 3 3 comparison with adsorption capacities of various commercial resins for clo4 the performances of five commercial resins ira 410 irn 150 ira 167 d201 and d301 were compared with that of tahmr figs 2 and s4 the adsorption capacity of tahmr for clo4 was significantly greater than that of the commercial resins thus suggesting that it could be an effective adsorbent for removing oxyhalide anions from waters generally the adsorption capacity is affected by several factors including specific surface area adsorbent polarity and pore structures however although the specific surface area of tahmr is lower than those of d301 d201 or ira 167 si table s1 whilst its adsorption capacity for clo4 is higher thus the specific surface area is not the main factor for determining the anion adsorption capacity of these resins 33 3 4 factors affecting adsorption of clo4 various conditions that affect the adsorption of clo4 on tahmr were also investigated and are described in this section 3 4 1 effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of clo4 on tahmr with a fixed initial concentration of clo4 1 0 mmol l 1 is shown in fig s5 there was a significant increase in clo4 adsorption for adsorbent dosages in the range 0 25 to 0 5 g l 1 but there were only small increases for amounts 0 75 g l 1 thus for subsequent experiments to assess the effects of other factors on adsorption efficiency we chose to work with 1 0 g l 1 adsorbent dosage as a balance between assessing maximum clo4 adsorption and economy for adsorbent usage 34 3 4 2 effect of nitrogen grafting ratio the clo4 adsorption capacities of tahmr were strongly influenced by the nitrogen grafting rate with values of 0 25 0 85 and 0 94 mmol g 1 being observed for 5 7 and 9 n fig 3 in tahmr respectively the release of cl ions when clo4 was adsorbed on tahmr indicates that ion exchange is an important mechanism for clo4 removal from water and tahmr containing 9 n was selected as the optimum adsorbent for the following experiments the amount of cl released from the cl activated resin was slightly lower than that of clo4 adsorbed which means that other adsorption mechanisms are involved in the clo4 adsorption process besides ion exchange 35 3 4 3 effect of ph and ionic strength ph is an important factor that influences adsorption processes through its effect on the surface charge of the adsorbent and the degree ionization of the adsorbate 36 its effect on clo4 adsorption by tahmr is shown in fig 4a adsorption of clo4 increased with ph in the range 2 0 4 0 but was independent of ph in the range 4 0 10 0 which suggests that protonation of tertiary amines occurs at low ph to further investigate the effect of ph on clo4 adsorption zeta potentials were measured as a function of ph before and after adsorption of clo4 shown as fig s6 37 with both samples the zeta potentials decreased progressively with increasing ph from 2 0 to 10 0 and tahmr has a positively charged surface at ph 6 0 when ph phzpc the surface of the adsorbent is negatively charged resulting in repulsive forces between clo4 and the surface of tahmr however the fact that high ph favors adsorption and removal of clo4 from solution thus suggests that ion exchange is the main adsorption mechanism and not electrostatic attraction 34 the effect of ionic strength on clo4 adsorption was studied using nacl concentrations between 0 and 50 mmol l 1 fig 4b the amount of clo4 adsorbed by the resin decreased appreciably with increasing ionic strength in the range 0 10 mmol l 1 but by smaller amounts for 10 50 mmol l 1 previous studies have shown that ionic strength has a significant negative effect on the adsorption process if electrostatic attraction is the main adsorption mechanism 38 and the present result provides further evidence that electrostatic attraction is not the main adsorption mechanism for clo4 in media with high ionic strength 3 4 4 effects of associated components and the water matrix water matrices commonly contain nom such as humic acid and various inorganic anions including f no3 hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 previous studies have shown that such anions can compete with clo4 in adsorption processes 39 and the effect of various associated components on clo4 adsorption on tahmr is illustrated in fig 4c in each case clo4 adsorption decreased with the increasing concentrations of the associated anions at concentrations 1 0 mmol l 1 this inhibitory effect is consistent with an ion exchange mechanism for clo4 adsorption on tahmr and indicates that the coordination effect of anions involved in electron donors acceptor interaction may affect the adsorption process additionally the ion exchange process may also be related to the ionic radius of the anions among the anions studied so4 2 had the greatest impact on the clo4 removal from water and the inhibitory effect on clo4 adsorption decreased in the order as so4 2 sio3 2 hpo4 2 hco3 no3 f which is similar to that observed in a previous study of the adsorption of clo4 on activated carbon 39 the presence of nom can also decrease the adsorption of clo4 40 and as illustrated in fig s7 the efficiency of clo4 removal from water by tahmr decreased progressively with increasing nom concentration express as doc the potential of tahmr for use in practical applications was assessed by determining its performance in natural waters spiked with clo4 fig 4d here the adsorption capacity for clo4 was found to be significantly lower with lake water indicating that organic components in the lake water compete with clo4 for the adsorption sites on tahmr si table s4 nevertheless the adsorption capacity of tahmr for clo4 remained appreciable and these results demonstrate the practical potential of tahmr for removing clo4 from natural water sources 41 3 4 5 adsorption kinetics the kinetics for adsorption of clo4 on tahmr at different initial clo4 concentrations 0 5 1 5 mmol l 1 are shown in fig 5 for each concentration clo4 removal from solution was very rapid in the first 10 min and reached equilibrium with a maximum removal of 95 after 25 min this is much faster than the times reported for other adsorbents 18 42 and demonstrates that tahmr possesses easily accessible sites with high affinity for clo4 in order to further evaluate the reaction mechanism and rate determining steps the results in fig s8 were analyzed using pseudo first order second order and intra particle diffusion kinetic models described in si text s4 the adsorption kinetics were fitted well with the pseudo second order model correlation coefficient r 2 0 999 and details of these results are available as si table s5 and fig s8a and b plots of q t mg g 1 versus t 0 5 for the intra particle diffusion model could be separated into two linear regions si fig s8c and indicate that most of the adsorption occurs during the initial rapid step 43 3 5 clo4 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics adsorption isotherms for clo4 on tahmr at 15 45 c si fig s9 show that adsorption of clo4 increased with the increasing temperature the langmuir and freundlich models described in table s6 were both used to fit these isotherm data 44 the langmuir model r 2 0 999 gave the better fit to the experimental data which indicates that adsorption occurs as a monolayer it is also noteworthy that the q m value is higher than the corresponding values reported for other adsorbents as presented in table 1 thermodynamic parameters standard gibbs energy δg o ads enthalpy δh o ads and entropy δs o ads for adsorption of clo4 on tahmr at different temperatures were calculated from eqs 1 and 2 and the results summarized in si table s7 1 δ g ads o rt ln k d 2 ln k d δ s ads o r δ h ads o rt where k d is the adsorption distribution coefficient c ad c e c ad is the concentration of solute that is adsorbed on tahmr at equilibrium and c e is the concentration of solute that is in solution at equilibrium r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t k is the absolute temperature the enthalpy change δh o ads was obtained by plotting lnkd versus 1 t si fig s10 and has a value of 30 9 kj mol 1 whilst δs o ads has a value of 0 13 kj mol 1 k 1 the values of δg o ads were negative at all temperatures and in the range 6 9 to 10 2 kj mol 1 the negative values of δg o ads indicate the thermodynamic feasibility and spontaneous nature of adsorption of clo4 on tahmr whilst the positive values of δh o ads and δs o ads indicate that the adsorption of clo4 on tahmr is an endothermic process with increasing randomness at the solid liquid interface after adsorption 18 3 6 simultaneous adsorption of both clo4 and bro3 bro3 is now recognized as an emerging pollutant that is frequently found in drinking water 5 and its adsorption on tahmr was investigated separately and in combination with clo4 the results for adsorption of clo4 and bro3 as single components are described by the langmuir equation figs s11 and s12 and the equilibrium data for the binary system was thus analyzed using the langmuir competitive model lcm 51 which is described by eqs 3 4 3 q p q max p k p c eq p 1 k p c eq p k b c eq b 4 q b q max b k b c eq b 1 k b c eq b k p c eq p where the suffixes p and b represent clo4 and bro3 respectively q max p and q max b represent the maximum sorbate uptake k p and k b are the langmuir constants for clo4 and bro3 in a mixture of the oxyhalide anions and c eq p and c eq b are the equilibrium concentrations for clo4 and bro3 in the solute mixture mmol l 1 in binary systems adsorption of clo4 on tahmr was greater than that of bro3 fig 6 small bro3 concentrations had little effect on the adsorption of clo4 although it had an increasing effect as the bro3 concentration was increased in order to determine whether the surfaces in fig 6 accurately describe the equilibria the calculated q e cal and the experimental q e exp for the adsorbed oxyhalide anions were compared the standard deviations between these values for q e cal and q e exp were very small fig s13 and the regression equations for clo4 and bro3 are q e cal 1 0003 q e exp 2 3 10 3 r 2 0 999 and q e cal 1 0001 q e exp 2 7 10 3 r 2 0 999 moreover the experimental data for the equilibrium concentrations of clo4 and bro3 are well fitted with the 3 d adsorption isotherm fig 6 for the binary clo4 bro3 system selectivity for adsorption from equimolar ratios on tahmr was calculated from the experimental single component isotherms using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast model 52 extended to predict multi component adsorption equilibrium from dilute liquid solutions this is described by eq 5 5 selectivity z b x b z p x p q b c eq p q p c eq b where zp and zb are the mole fraction of the clo4 and bro3 in the adsorbed phase xp and xb are the mole fraction of the clo4 and bro3 in the liquid phase q p and q b are the amounts of clo4 and bro3 adsorbed the concentrations of clo4 and bro3 used for the iast model calculations are within the ranges of experimental data si fig s14 however selectivity increased with increasing concentrations and tahmr exhibited high selectivity for clo4 over bro3 at high concentrations this tendency is consistent with the quantum chemistry calculations and experimental data in section 3 2 3 7 fixed bed column adsorption and regeneration to further evaluate the feasibility of using tahmr for practical applications adsorption of clo4 was also studied using a fixed bed column 46 break through curves for adsorption of clo4 on tahmr are shown in fig 7a for 6 consecutive cycles adsorption equilibrium was approached when the bed volume bv was 4000 and reached at 4500 bv the dynamic behavior of this adsorbent adsorbate system was simulated by the thomas yoon nelson and adams bohart models si text s6 and fig s15 both thomas and yoon nelson models showed good fits to the dynamic adsorption data with an adsorption capacity of 2 43 mmol g 1 for clo4 si fig s15 and table s8 in order to examine its potential for reuse a tahmr column that had been saturated with clo4 was regenerated with 0 5 mmol l 1 naoh followed by 0 5 mmol l 1 hcl most of the eluted clo4 was concentrated within 40 bv 53 fig 7b when six consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles were performed the dynamic adsorption capacity decreased progressively to 95 6 93 6 92 9 90 3 and finally 87 5 of the initial value thus demonstrating that the adsorption capacity of tahmr remains relatively stable in 6 repeated adsorptions overall these experimental results demonstrate that tahmr has a good potential for use in the selective removal of clo4 from water 54 3 8 tahmr stability and cytotoxicity the stability of the tahmr in water was assessed by monitoring the composition of the leachate as described in section 2 there was only low total organic dissolution 0 2 mg l 1 of toc and no trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate or toluene was detected the potential toxicity of the tahmr was evaluated by the mtt assay which is commonly employed for detection of cytotoxicity or assessing cell viability fig s16 shows the morphologies of cho cells cultured in different extracts after 7 days of incubation all were normal and healthy and similar to that of the control also as shown in fig s17 there was no significant effect of tahmr on the relative cell viability of control after 1 2 5 and 7 days of incubation although the relative cell viability for 100 concentration of extracts of tahmr was slightly decreased after 7 days incubation thus based on the standard iso 10993 5 1999 55 these resin extracts have no significant cytotoxic effect furthermore compared with untreated solutions of 1 0 mmol l 1 clo4 adsorption by tahmr significantly reduced its toxicity and thus confirms its good biocompatibility and demonstrates its potential use as an adsorbent for the removal of oxyhalide anions from drinking water 3 9 adsorption mechanisms generally characterization of the solid phase is used to aid elucidation of the interaction mechanisms between adsorbents and adsorbates and in the present work interactions between clo4 as a representative oxyhalide and tahmr were explored by a combination of ftir and xps infrared spectra of tahmr before and after adsorption of clo4 at ph 7 0 are shown in fig s18 after the adsorption of clo4 the 2697 cm 1 peak that is assigned to the tertiarylamine hydrochloride r ch3 2n hcl group in tahmr 32 56 disappeared and was replaced by peaks at 1100 and 605 cm 1 that correspond to clo4 this result demonstrates conclusively that clo4 was adsorbed on tahmr during the adsorption process the xps spectra in figs 8 and s19 of tahmr and tahmr clo4 prepared at ph 7 0 showed negligible differences in the c 1s and o 1s binding energy regions although this is unsurprising because of the much larger number of c and o atoms in the resin framework than on the surface which interacts with clo4 however there were appreciable differences in the n 1s binding region in tahmr the spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies of 399 39 ev and 410 75 ev corresponding respectively to nitrogen in the r n ch3 2 group nh2 or nh and protonated amine nh3 57 these peaks both shifted to lower binding energies 399 07 ev and 410 54 ev after clo4 adsorption and this result demonstrates that nitrogen was involved in the adsorption of clo4 a peak at 207 36 ev which has been assigned to the clo bonds of clo4 37 appeared in the cl 2p spectrum of tahmr clo4 and further confirms that clo4 was adsorbed on tahmr overall the experimental results indicate that adsorption of clo4 on tahmr is mainly due to ion exchange with some additional contribution from electrostatic interactions as illustrated in scheme 2 in order to gain further insight into the relative importance of various mechanisms for the adsorption of clo4 quantum chemistry calculations were performed for the two optimized geometrical structures of the possible tahmr clo4 complexes these calculations gave binding energies for ion exchange interaction model i and electrostatic interaction interaction model ii as 17 6 kj mol 1 and 406 5 kj mol 1 respectively and thus provide further support for ion exchange being the dominant adsorption mechanism figs 9 and s20 4 conclusions this study has described the preparation and characterization of a novel macroporous resin tahmr containing tertiary amine functional groups and demonstrated that it can effectively remove oxyhalide anions i e clo4 clo3 clo2 and bro3 from water ion exchange was shown to be the principal mechanism for adsorption of clo4 and presumably also other oxyhalide anions on tahmr and the tertiary amino groups were shown to be directly involved in the adsorption process after use dilute naoh followed by hcl solutions could effectively regenerate the resin based on results obtained using adsorption of clo4 as a representative oxyhalide tahmr compared favorably with several commercial resins in terms of both adsorption capacity and speed of adsorption the adsorption process was shown to obey pseudo second order kinetics and clo4 adsorption on tahmr was fitted well with langmuir model which indicated a maximum adsorption capacity of 2 74 mmol g 1 however in a binary system of clo4 and bro3 tahmr was shown to have significantly greater affinity for clo4 and its removal of the more toxic bro3 is limited from waters with high clo4 contents although the current research demonstrates that tahmr is a promising adsorbent for use in water treatment we did not investigate the potential contribution to the adsorption properties of the bentonite mineral which was used primarily as a dispersing agent during the resin preparation however the incorporation of clays such as bentonite may improve the physical and chemical properties of polymers or conventional micro and macro composites and the influence of the exchanged ion in the clay and the clay organic ratio on the performance of the tahmr resin will be the subject of further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships with other

pharmaceutical pollutant 1 introduction many of the environmental issues we currently face are exacerbated and humanity is paving the way for its extinction as a result of its actions the destruction of the environment and the reduction of food resources on the one hand and the resulting violence and even the war over resources on the other hand threaten human survival important issues such as surging population water depletion and air pollution the spread of diseases soil erosion deforestation and mass migration lead to conflict and violence 1 it is estimated that close to one fourth of the world s population will be affected by water scarcity by 2025 large populations live in arid regions and the main concern is in the semi arid regions of asia and the middle east which are facing declining water tables residents of these areas do not have enough resources to meet their needs and will have to reduce water consumption in agriculture and import food and increase their dependency on costly and energy consuming desalination plants to fulfill domestic and industrial needs 2 in arid and semi arid regions groundwater is one of the crucial and primary fresh water sources improper abstraction of groundwater not only affects water and food security but also causes soil salinity and land subsidence land subsidence reduces the capacity of aquifers and facilitation to groundwater 3 water scarcity also increases the risks of growing water pollution these dangers affect the deprived strata of society more than others and cause many diseases 2 one of the worldwide growing concerns is discharging hazardous and untreated materials into the water bodies 4 5 as water pollution is a massive threat for humans aquatic organisms and plants wastewater treatment especially removing organic pollutants has become the center of attention and one of the most urgent research topics among scientists 6 8 chemical and pharmaceutical contaminants are released directly into the environment after passing through wastewater treatment stages which are not designed to remove such structures 9 10 pharmaceutical compounds are highly bioactive and cause various biological effects in target organisms some medicines are continuously discharged into the environment and can cause irreversible changes many pharmaceuticals are polar compounds to be better transported by the bloodstream this feature allows them to move easily in the presence of the aquatic medium and sometimes traces of them can be found far away from the source of discharge 11 diazepam dzp is the most widely used active ingredient in benzodiazepine anxiolytics and is ubiquitous sleeping pills in addition it is used to treat alcohol withdrawal muscle spasms and seizures this contaminant enters the aquatic environment via the pharmaceutical industries hospitals and domestic effluents dzp has been detected in a range of concentrations in the aqueous environment from 20 ng l river water to 600 ng l hospital wastewater another concern is the presence of this medicine in fish tissues which indicates that bioaccumulation of dzp occurs and hence chronic exposure can affect aquatic living creatures even in a poor concentration 12 14 another group of chemical contaminants is dyes which are considered the primary pollutants in wastewater in large quantities 15 in recent decades with the increasing demand of various industries for dyes the proportion of pollution and their presence in wastewater has increased 16 due to their complex aromatic structure most of these compounds particularly azo dyes have nn bonds in their structure cannot be broken down and removed by chemical physical and biological treatment and their presence in aquatic environments has caused severe damage to marine life the environment and human health 17 19 amaranth am is an azo dye with many applications in textiles paper wood leather and food industries it has been proved to be carcinogenic and toxic for years and can lead to tumors allergies respiratory problems and congenital disabilities in humans however it is not banned in many countries 20 22 the main physicochemical features of am and dzp are presented in table 1 numerous publications have presented physicochemical and biological techniques to remove organic pollutants from wastewater 26 29 due to the conventional methods limitations such as enormous costs chemical consumption and conversion of particles to secondary pollutants which are sometimes more toxic in wastewater treatment researchers are investigating new techniques to reduce or remove mentioned limitations photocatalysis has been described as a promising technique for solving environmental problems without generating secondary pollutants 15 a green and friendly method that uses solar energy in various applications such as water splitting degradation and reduction of harmful pollutants and photoreduction of co2 30 the photocatalytic process refers to the ultraviolet uv light illumination that is semiconductor interaction through which an excited electron bounces off the valence band vb to the conduction band cb developing a consequent electron hole e h pair from the resulting reaction between the electron or hole and the oxygen in water the reactive radicals such as hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 emerge that in turn react with organic substances leading to development of mineralized products like carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o most photocatalysts require uv light and because only about 10 of sunlight is uv it is challenging to perform photocatalytic reactions efficiently 31 thus components such as light harvesting semiconductors catalytically active sites oxidation and reduction potential play an important role during the reaction and are the main features for electron transfer to the catalyst surface however a photocatalyst with a larger bandgap has strong redox potential and charges carrier separation with the least solar energy utilization on the other hand a photocatalyst with a smaller bandgap possesses exceptional solar light harvesting properties thus it could be taken advantage of the benefits of both systems and simultaneously reduce the limitations by synthesizing heterojunction of a proper reductive catalyst high cb and an oxidative catalyst low vb with a suitable band structure 32 therefore to develop more sensible photocatalysts with better photocatalytic performance for practical applications the study and synthesis of visible light photocatalysts have attracted much attention 33 layered double hydroxides have received a vast deal of attention in recent years due to their properties including layered structure anion exchangeability compositional flexibility non toxicity ease of synthesis and low cost 34 36 layered double hydroxides ldhs are classified as anionic minerals ldhs structure emanates from the isomorphous substitution of divalent cations by trivalent or tetravalent cations in a brucite like lattice with various morphologies like nanofibers nanosheets nanospheres nanotubes and so on this layered structure is held together by interlayer counter anions and water molecules 37 38 the general formula for ldhs is m1 x iimx iii oh 2 x ax n n mh2o in which mii and miii are divalent and trivalent cations an represents the anions with the negative charge of n which are settled within the interlayer alongside h2o molecules whose number is denoted by m and eventually x is the layer charge density of ldhs 39 these materials have found a special place among catalysts and have shown outstanding performance in the field of removal of aqueous contaminants which has made them a reliable alternative to tio2 ti doping into ldhs structure enhances the catalytic ability and in this respect znti ldh has a superior photocatalytic activity to tio2 and zno 30 hexagonal boron nitride h bn is a 2d metal free material consisting of a hexagonal ring of nitrogen and boron atoms this material is an analog of graphene in terms of structure and various properties and is sometimes referred to as white graphene 40 41 apart from its application in multiple industries such as electrical resistors thermal conductors and cement concrete h bn has shown excellent performance in environmental protection and catalytic activities the broad application of h bn is due to its strong antioxidation ability chemical stability non toxicity and good thermal conductivity 42 44 while significant advances have been made in the field of graphene based materials in recent years boron based composites with similar specifications have not received much attention in addition to recent progress in exfoliation and stabilization of h bn diverse activities have been taken to composite h bn with other materials 43 the formation of heterojunction composites by combining two different photocatalysts with suitable bandgaps has become one of the most promising methods to solve the recombination of photogenerated charge and holes problems 30 herein a novel h bn based heterojunction composite with znti ldh has been prepared the presence of an ldh as a strong photocatalyst with two elements of titanium and zinc in its structure along with h bn as a powerful adsorbent with a stable structure results in a better efficiency at less time in the processes of separation and removal of pollutants the synthesized samples were characterized by ftir xrd fesem eds bet tem and drs analyses the photocatalytic performance of znti ldh h bn composites was evaluated under the irradiation of a visible light lamp to remove dzp and am simultaneously from the aqueous solution it was found that the nanocomposite material showed better removal performance than pure znti ldh and h bn 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemical reagents including boric acid h3bo3 for analysis zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o 99 titanium tetrachloride ticl4 99 9 and urea ch4n2o 99 were

powder the product was washed well with dilute hydrochloric acid and absolute ethanol and dried at ambient temperature and it was made into a homogeneous powder using an agate mortar 44 2 3 preparation of znti ldh h bn photocatalysts there are several methods for synthesizing ldhs include co precipitation urea hydrolysis sol gel ion exchange and calcination rehydration each of them has its advantages depending on the purpose of the synthesis 37 for znti ldh h bn composites ldh was synthesized by the co precipitation approach and prepared h bn was already added to the synthesis solution to form znti ldh on it 80 mg of as obtained h bn powder was first dispersed into 100 ml of deionized water by ultrasonication for 0 5 h to give a white suspension then 1 19 g zn no3 2 6h2o and 3 g urea were added into the solution under magnetic stirring subsequently naoh aqueous solution 0 5 m was added into the mixture to keep the ph constant ph 7 5 after stirring for 0 5 h 0 22 ml of ticl4 was added dropwise to the stirring mixture and continued for another 0 5 h the resulting reactant was aged in an autoclave at 130 c for 48 h then the solid was separated by centrifuging and washed several times with water and dried overnight at 60 c in an oven 30 35 2 4 samples characterization the crystal structure and morphology of the prepared catalytic samples were characterized by a

instruments for more information see supporting file 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of znti ldh h bn composite in fig 1 the xrd pattern of znti ldh h bn and its two constituents is depicted to determine the crystalline phase for znti ldh strong reflection 003 was observed at 13 26 and reflections of 006 009 at 24 8 and 36 3 which correspond to the basal and higher order reflections of ldhs the other reflections of 100 012 110 and 113 are the usual ldh reflections the basal reflection 2θ 13 21 d003 66 nm with slight variation occurred at a higher angle than the previous value reported in the literature 45 47 the reflections of 002 and 100 at 25 7 and 42 respectively belong to the h bn structure based on a standard pdf card jcpds pdf card no 34 0421 48 49 after the composite formation it is clear that the xrd patterns of the composite and znti ldh are identical on the other hand h bn prominent peaks did not appear to be noticeable due to the low impact on crystallinity good exfoliation of h bn nanosheets during the synthesis procedure by ultrasonication and its low weight ratio to ldh 1 5 30 43 although this effect is not significant the addition of h bn to znti ldh has reduced the crystalline intensity and could be observed in the composite xrd pattern s peaks which got wider and smoother near 25 7 and 42 this effect has been investigated with the crystallite size and scherer equation 1 d kλ β cosθ where k represents the scherrer constant k 0 94 λ represents the x ray wavelength λ 0 15418 nm β is the width of the diffraction peak at half of the maximum intensity fwhm and θ is the bragg s angle 50 the crystallite sizes for composite and znti ldh were 34 82 and 37 98 nm respectively it was found that adding h bn lowers the crystallite size of the composite slightly compared to znti ldh fig 2 shows the ftir spectrum of prepared samples which clearly shows a broad band at 3370 cm 1 revealing the oh stretching mode of the interlayer water molecule and hydroxyl groups fig 2a 51 this band is formed by the oh bands of the ldh structure fig 2b between the various metal cations and the oh and h bn structure plus the nh2 group at 3244 and 1593 2 cm 1 presence in the h bn structure fig 2c 48 in the case of the ldh sample the bands at 1506 and 1393 cm 1 are related to the ν3 stretching mode of interlayer carbonate ions also the weaker bands at 1046 9 and 706 5 cm 1 are related to the ν1 stretching mode of carbonate and free carbonate ions respectively 51 mode ν2 of carbonate anions is responsible for bands 947 5 and 836 cm 1 the 706 5 cm 1 band is due to the presence of ν4 free carbonate anions 52 also bands at 1393 and 739 cm 1 might be due to in plane bn stretching and plane b n b bending modes respectively 43 absorption bands at 400 800 cm 1 are attributed to m o stretching and m o m bridging stretching mode m zn ti 53 in fig 2 from the comparison of the diagrams it is clear that the composite spectrum fig 2a follows znti ldh and wherever h bn has peaked it has affected the composite spectrum by increasing the intensity of the peaks compared to the ldh diagram fig 2b in order to examine the microstructure and morphology of nanoparticles the fesem eds and tem analyzes were performed the fesem images of znti ldh h bn are shown in fig 3 for better comparison and confirmation of the composite formation synthesized h bn and znti ldh images are also provided as shown in fig 3 a b the h bn structure is layered with few layered stacking sheets and a smooth surface resembling the structure of graphene nanosheets 54 znti ldh images fig 3 c d displayed the hierarchical structure with many macropores in fig 3 e h however both structures can be seen 2d nanoflakes with hierarchical structure and smooth nanosheets stacked over each other fig 3e shows ldh particles formed on h bn clods which are marked in the image in fig 3f while the accumulation of ldh is observed h bn sheets are marked with arrows fig 3g shows clearly the distribution and formation of ldh on h bn fig 3h zooms in the previous figure fig 3g shows the intertwined ldh sheets placed vertically on the smooth h bn sheets the photos in fig 3 e h indicate the presence of compact sheets with a high surface area that enhances the contact possibility between the reactant and the photocatalyst surface furthermore the eds analysis characterized the surface elements of both znti ldh and the composite for a more explicit endorsement illustrated in fig 4 the reported eds spectra for znti ldh fig 4a demonstrate zn and ti elements with great intensity on the surface of materials and oxygen with a significant intensity representing the hydroxide bonds in ldh structure on the other hand fig 4b shows the presence of b and n on the composite surface that is a sanction to the accuracy of the synthesis despite the low intensity which is due to less proportion of applied boron nitride in the composite composition 44 55 tem analysis of the synthesized samples confirms the flake like structure of composite particles fig 5 it reveals two dimensional layers with different sizes and thicknesses and many mesopores existed on their surface the structure of znti ldh is indicated in fig 5a by a red dashed line comparable to fig 3d on the other hand the structure of h bn is shown with a blue dashed line which is darker than the other parts due to the density of the existing layers as well two distinct structures are evident in fig 5b marked separately comparable with fesem images the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the prepared composite and znti ldh are shown in fig 6 as the graph illustrates the isotherm for composites is type iv with the h3 type hysteresis loop this would suggest that this type of hysteresis might form due to the presence of large slitlike mesopores composed of pores with much smaller sizes 56 the measured specific surface area was 137 m2 g 1 for znti ldh was about 128 m2 g 1 with the mean pore diameter of 8 5 nm moreover the pore size distribution analysis plot fig 6 inset indicated that the major pore volume is related to about 1 8 2 5 nm size pores one key factor that sets photocatalysts apart from other catalysts is their ability to absorb light to supply process energy the amount of light absorption by nanoparticles is determined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs analysis the light absorbing of znti ldh and the composited material is shown in fig 7 representing that the nanocomposite had a better optical absorption notably in the visible light region the enhancement could be for the more excellent transmission of h bn within the visible light region the inset figure also shows the theoretical bandgap of as prepared semiconductors as expected and could be deduced from the literature the znti ldh bandgap was about 3 25 ev in comparison the as formed heterojunction between the h bn and the ldh improved the situation and diminished the distance between the conduction and valence bands to reach around 3 02 ev 18 55 57 58 the diagram is plotted based on αhν n a hν eg equation where α is the absorption coefficient ν is light frequency h is plank s constant eg is the bandgap energy and a is a constant as well n is a factor correlated to the semiconductor s optical transition direct or indirect transition for znti ldh h bn with direct transition n is equal to 2 44 59 3 2 degradation study after the nanocomposite synthesis the calibration curves for each contaminant were plotted using the uv vis spectrophotometer am showed two prominent absorption peaks at 215 and 520 nm and dzp at 238 and 285 nm which 520 nm and 238 nm are the main peaks of am and dzp respectively 21 60 the removal percentage of contaminants was obtained from the following equation 2 removal c 0 c i c 0 100 c0 and ci represent the initial and the final concentration mg l in the aqueous solution respectively the spectrum of 20 mg l am and 10 mg l dzp concentration and calibration curves are depicted in fig s2 c0 and ci represent the initial and the final concentration mg l in the aqueous solution respectively the spectrum of 20 mg l am and 10 mg l dzp concentration and calibration curves are depicted in fig s2 3 2 1 effect of solution ph the ph of the solution has a great effect on the removal of pollutants due to the possible interactions between the ions of the solution and the surface charge of the catalysts therefore the effect of the different ph of the solution ph 2 to 10 has been studied on am and dzp degradation and shown in fig 8 hcl and naoh were used to adjust the ph while other factors such as the initial concentration photocatalyst dosage and contact time were fixed at 10 mg l 100 mg l and 60 min respectively as shown in fig 8 increasing the ph from 2 to 10 reduces the degradation efficiency both for am and dzp the difference in reduction of efficiency for am is close to 86 96 5 at ph 2 and 9 9 at ph 10 while it is not significant for dzp since it is only about 18 33 23 at ph 2 and 15 47 at ph 10 this observation was predictable because the result of zeta potential analysis indicated that the synthesized nanocomposites had a positive surface charge in the acidic medium while am is an anionic dye thus a strong electrostatic attraction is formed between the pollutant and the surface of photocatalysts however dzp has a large amount of negative charge accumulation near its c o group and a positive charge accumulation near the nh group so the better adsorption of dzp is possible on the photocatalyst surface both in acidic and alkaline environments 61 62 the zeta potential of composites in deionized water am solution and dzp solution is shown in fig s3 the zero point charge for znti ldh h bn was obtained at ph 6 in aqueous media at ph 2 9 in am solution and at ph 5 6 in dzp solution as a result according to fig 8 and zeta potential ph 2 was considered the optimum ph of the solution the ph of the solution has a great effect on the removal of pollutants due to the possible interactions between the ions of the solution and the surface charge of the catalysts therefore the effect of the different ph of the solution ph 2 to 10 has been studied on am and dzp degradation and shown in fig 8 hcl and naoh were used to adjust the ph while other factors such as the initial concentration photocatalyst dosage and contact time were fixed at 10 mg l 100 mg l and 60 min respectively as shown in fig 8 increasing the ph from 2 to 10 reduces the degradation efficiency both for am and dzp the difference in reduction of efficiency for am is close to 86 96 5 at ph 2 and 9 9 at ph 10 while it is not significant for dzp since it is only about 18 33 23 at ph 2 and 15 47 at ph 10 this observation was predictable because the result of zeta potential analysis indicated that the synthesized nanocomposites had a positive surface charge in the acidic medium while am is an anionic dye thus a strong electrostatic attraction is formed between the pollutant and the surface of photocatalysts however dzp has a large amount of negative charge accumulation near its c o group and a positive charge accumulation near the nh group so the better adsorption of dzp is possible on the photocatalyst surface both in acidic and alkaline environments 61 62 the zeta potential of composites in deionized water am solution and dzp solution is shown in fig s3 the zero point charge for znti ldh h bn was obtained at ph 6 in aqueous media at ph 2 9 in am solution and at ph 5 6 in dzp solution as a result according to fig 8 and zeta potential ph 2 was considered the optimum ph of the solution 3 2 2 effect of contact time further studies were performed to determine the equilibrium time of adsorption and degrading of contaminants moreover a test was performed to investigate the photolysis effect on am and dzp the results are shown in fig 9 reaction conditions ph 2 adsorbent amount 100 mg l initial concentration of am and dzp samples were 20 mg l and 5 mg l respectively it should be acknowledged that the photolysis of the contaminants has been very small and negligible hence there was no concern about the photodegradation of contaminants by light regarding the contribution of adsorption on am removal it could be concluded that the synthesized photocatalyst is a suitable adsorbent of this dye owing to the adsorption capacity which was 14 mg gca after 90 min however the synthesized particles of the nanocomposite are not a promising adsorbent for dzp because after 120 min its adsorption capacity was only about 12 5 mg gca in the presence of light depending on the reaction conditions am reaches equilibrium after about 60 min dzp removal though it did not reach the maximum amount of initial concentration decreased its degradation intensity and equilibrium was achieved within 120 min absorption spectra also show the reduction process for both am and dzp in their reference situation and after reduction time in dark and light mode fig 9c d the langmuir hinshelwood l h model was used to inquire into the degradation kinetics of the am and dzp considering the effect of adsorption and desorption in the photocatalytic removal reaction makes this model suitable to study the photodegradation kinetics which has been the simplified form 63 eq 3 represents the l h equation where k1 is the pseudo first order reaction rate constant c0 is the initial concentration of pollutants and t means the reaction time 64 3 ln c c 0 k 1 t the reaction constant for am degradation by composite 0 0622 s 1 was 1 4 and 7 7 times the value obtained by znti ldh and h bn respectively dzp degraded less rapidly and the reaction constant when using the composite was 0 0141 s 1 which was 1 7 and 1 8 times higher than using znti ldh and h bn respectively under the same circumstances 3 2 3 effect of photocatalyst dosage to determine the effects of photocatalyst loading on the degradation efficiency different amounts of znti ldh h bn 80 to 200 mg l were added to the particular concentration of the solution while other reaction conditions are kept constant at ph 2 contact time of 60 min and 20 mg l for dye concentration as shown in fig 10 a by increasing the amount of catalyst from 80 to 200 mg l the degradation efficiency is increasing 78 90 to 99 60 but after 160 mg l efficiency rises only slightly and no significant amount is obtained fig 10 a also shows the effect of increasing the photocatalyst dose on dzp according to the previous step where the removal efficiency of dzp was evaluated with the contact time although it was tested for 120 min the amount of photocatalyst was not enough for its complete removal therefore the catalyst dose range at this section was considered from 100 to 500 mg l other reaction conditions were equal to ph 2 contact time 120 min and initial concentration 5 mg l dzp also responded well to increasing the catalyst dose and the degradation efficiency increased from 40 1 to 50 5 considering the catalyst savings and the slight difference in removal efficiency 300 mg l seems appropriate for the optimum point 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration of pollutants the concentration of contaminants is an effective parameter and by changing it an attempt has been made to improve the removal process the catalyst dosage was kept constant 160 mg l for removing am and 300 mg l for removing diazepam as shown in fig 10 b the degradation efficiency declines with the increasing concentration of am and dzp this is because active sites are saturated according to the obtained data 20 and 2 mg l values were considered the optimum concentrations for am and dzp respectively 3 2 5 possible intermediates and effect of radical scavenger the impact of reactive species affecting the degradation of pollutants was investigated the results of these studies also revealed the reaction mechanism in this regard p benzoquinone isopropanol edta and potassium dichromate quenchers were used to scavenge o2 oh h and e respectively 10 65 the effect of 0 1 m of different scavengers on the photocatalytic degradation of am and dzp over the synthesized composite is shown in fig 11 it was observed that the am was not affected by benzoquinone and dichromate and was degraded with the same intensity as before but edta and isopropanol reduced the am removal efficiency from 99 48 to 84 5 and 93 9 respectively oh and h are effective as reactive species for am removal therefore the mechanism of am degradation is considered according to the following equations 66 68 4 znti ldh h bn hν e h 5 h h 2 o oh h 6 h oh oh in the case of dzp isopropanol scavenges hydroxyl radicals and by decreasing this radical from the reaction medium the degradation efficiency of dzp reduces other scavengers have not significantly affected the degradation process so oh was chosen as the reactive species of dzp the possible intermediates of am and dzp which were photodegraded on the znti ldh h bn nanocomposite were identified with gc ms analysis and results are presented in table 2 according to the gc ms analysis results and other references the reaction mechanism can be considered as fig 12 for am and fig 13 for dzp 13 66 the tracks with the blue arrow have been suggested by other researchers and the tracks with the red arrow are the result of the present research 3 2 6 mineralization study intermediates generated during photodegradation processes are of major significance since they can be more toxic than the prior compounds 69 under optimal conditions for am and dzp removal the removal efficiency of toc was measured and shown in fig 14 which indicates suitable mineralization of contaminants by znti ldh h bn in this process the mineralization of am and dzp was about 51 and 33 after 2 h and might be performed according to the following equations respectively 7 c 10 h 11 n 2 o 10 na 3 s 3 51 2 o 2 20 co 2 2 no

transported to wastewater treatment plants most of which do not have the potential to remove materials with stable structures factories such as pharmaceutical textile and food production factories operate side by side in industrial parks whose sewage is connected through pipelines it is possible to provide wastewater treatment units for each industrial park to remove hazardous pollutants from the water media before reaching the city wastewater treatment plants simultaneous removal of amaranth and diazepam can show the znti ldh h bn composites potential for being an option for such treatment units during the simultaneous removal of contaminants the test conditions were selected in such a way that they overlap well so that the specified concentration of each contaminant can be removed similar to the previous sections ph 2 contact time 120 min catalyst dosage 300 mg l amaranth concentration 20 mg l diazepam concentration 2 mg l from the results am was completely degraded and the degradation efficiency of dzp was more than 95 making znti ldh h bn composites an excellent photocatalyst for simultaneous removal of organic and pharmaceutical pollutants interestingly observations confirm that decolorization of the dye accompanied with diazepam lasted less than 30 min which could be considered the effect of by products of diazepam on amaranth degradation to confirm the photocatalytic capability of znti ldh h bn composite a comparison has been made between the degradation performance of various photocatalysts used for am and dzp removal and photocatalysts based on znti ldh and h bn and the results are given in table 3 by examining the data in this table and comparing different operational conditions valuable information can be obtained regarding the synthesized samples potential in this study features such as utilizing small amounts of catalyst short operating time visible light proper concentration of pollutants and especially excellent degradation rate make znti ldh h bn heterojunction an effective photocatalyst another point that can be mentioned is the degradation of two organic contaminants in the same aqueous solution degrading pollutants simultaneously particularly pharmaceutical contaminants without utilizing the uv light or additives such as h2o2 is challenging which znti ldh h bn has achieved in ideal conditions and in a short time 3 2 8 reusability and stability to investigate the reusability of synthesized photocatalysts three degradation cycles were tested each performed for 120 min according to previous tests it is worth noting that the particles were tested without recovery and washing in each round as shown in fig 15 differences in the removal efficiency of am are negligible during each cycle however the severity of dzp degradation has been reduced which of course is not so significant thus the znti ldh h bn could be considered stable and usable in three cycles additional analysis was conducted on the nature of the recovered znti ldh h bn particles as depicted in fig 16 the composite s xrd pattern and ftir spectrum were approximately the same as fresh photocatalyst after the three cycles indicating that synthesized nanocomposites had good stability throughout the photocatalytic process there are minor changes in the used composites ftir curves in 1393 3 and 1506 7 cm 1 wavenumbers which shifted to 1400 and 1630 cm 1 respectively these differences may be due to the catalyst and its surface not being thoroughly cleaned the leached metal ions from znti ldh h bn nanoparticles were investigated by the icp oes technique which revealed that only a minimal amount less than 0 5 of ti zn and b were leached into the solution which could be the reason for the slight decrease in the activity of the catalysts in the subsequent cycles however this amount of leaching is typical and can be due to the lack of complete washing during synthesis steps 4 conclusion in this work we succeeded in presenting a novel nanocomposite with photocatalytic properties consisting of znti ldh and h bn in which znti ldh was well dispersed on h bn synthesized materials were investigated to remove organic pollutants from water amaranth azo dye and diazepam the morphological and structural features of the photocatalyst were analyzed by various characterization tests including xrd ftir fesem eds tem and bet bjh there was a decrease of about 7 in the bandgap of the znti ldh h bn when compared to the bare znti ldh znti ldh h bn has demonstrated superior performance in eliminating and degrading the considered pollutants in the proposed structure h bn played a role as a support layer and an excellent adsorbent in the adsorption of am to achieve ideal efficiency in reducing pollution alongside znti ldh various contributing parameters such as ph contact time catalyst dosage and pollutants initial concentration which affect the efficiency of photocatalyst activity were evaluated to determine optimum conditions after ensuring that the synthesized samples effectively degrade am and dzp following the simultaneous removal of both contaminants by selecting the appropriate conditions znti ldh h bn was

12982,in the present study a novel heterostructure nanocomposite consisting of hexagonal boron nitride h bn and znti layered double hydroxide was synthesized to remove two organic pollutants simultaneously from the aqueous solution under visible light irradiation at room temperature znti ldh h bn represents a cost effective reusable material that showed both adsorption and substantial photocatalytic performance in the degradation of amaranth am azo dye and diazepam dzp as organic contaminants of water various analyses were performed to assess the morphology characteristic features and synthesis accuracy of the as prepared materials that proved the proper formation of the nanocomposite additionally an acceptable reduction was observed in the bandgap of the nanocomposite in comparison with the bandgap of znti ldh furthermore the effect of various parameters including ph of the solution contaminant concentration and catalyst dosage were studied on the adsorption and photocatalytic activity to find out optimum conditions during the process results revealed that the synthesized catalysts had performed exceptionally well in adsorbing and degrading considered pollutants even in removing both from the same solution the layered structure of the h bn played a crucial role in providing an available surface area needed for adsorption and better dispersion of the photocatalyst particles and at the same time znti ldh reduced am and dzp by its photocatalytic activity in the optimal conditions the simultaneous removal efficiency of the molecule of am and dzp was measured to be more than 99 and 95 respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords visible light photocatalysis znti layered double hydroxide hexagonal boron nitride amaranth diazepam pharmaceutical pollutant 1 introduction many of the environmental issues we currently face are exacerbated and humanity is paving the way for its extinction as a result of its actions the destruction of the environment and the reduction of food resources on the one hand and the resulting violence and even the war over resources on the other hand threaten human survival important issues such as surging population water depletion and air pollution the spread of diseases soil erosion deforestation and mass migration lead to conflict and violence 1 it is estimated that close to one fourth of the world s population will be affected by water scarcity by 2025 large populations live in arid regions and the main concern is in the semi arid regions of asia and the middle east which are facing declining water tables residents of these areas do not have enough resources to meet their needs and will have to reduce water consumption in agriculture and import food and increase their dependency on costly and energy consuming desalination plants to fulfill domestic and industrial needs 2 in arid and semi arid regions groundwater is one of the crucial and primary fresh water sources improper abstraction of groundwater not only affects water and food security but also causes soil salinity and land subsidence land subsidence reduces the capacity of aquifers and facilitation to groundwater 3 water scarcity also increases the risks of growing water pollution these dangers affect the deprived strata of society more than others and cause many diseases 2 one of the worldwide growing concerns is discharging hazardous and untreated materials into the water bodies 4 5 as water pollution is a massive threat for humans aquatic organisms and plants wastewater treatment especially removing organic pollutants has become the center of attention and one of the most urgent research topics among scientists 6 8 chemical and pharmaceutical contaminants are released directly into the environment after passing through wastewater treatment stages which are not designed to remove such structures 9 10 pharmaceutical compounds are highly bioactive and cause various biological effects in target organisms some medicines are continuously discharged into the environment and can cause irreversible changes many pharmaceuticals are polar compounds to be better transported by the bloodstream this feature allows them to move easily in the presence of the aquatic medium and sometimes traces of them can be found far away from the source of discharge 11 diazepam dzp is the most widely used active ingredient in benzodiazepine anxiolytics and is ubiquitous sleeping pills in addition it is used to treat alcohol withdrawal muscle spasms and seizures this contaminant enters the aquatic environment via the pharmaceutical industries hospitals and domestic effluents dzp has been detected in a range of concentrations in the aqueous environment from 20 ng l river water to 600 ng l hospital wastewater another concern is the presence of this medicine in fish tissues which indicates that bioaccumulation of dzp occurs and hence chronic exposure can affect aquatic living creatures even in a poor concentration 12 14 another group of chemical contaminants is dyes which are considered the primary pollutants in wastewater in large quantities 15 in recent decades with the increasing demand of various industries for dyes the proportion of pollution and their presence in wastewater has increased 16 due to their complex aromatic structure most of these compounds particularly azo dyes have nn bonds in their structure cannot be broken down and removed by chemical physical and biological treatment and their presence in aquatic environments has caused severe damage to marine life the environment and human health 17 19 amaranth am is an azo dye with many applications in textiles paper wood leather and food industries it has been proved to be carcinogenic and toxic for years and can lead to tumors allergies respiratory problems and congenital disabilities in humans however it is not banned in many countries 20 22 the main physicochemical features of am and dzp are presented in table 1 numerous publications have presented physicochemical and biological techniques to remove organic pollutants from wastewater 26 29 due to the conventional methods limitations such as enormous costs chemical consumption and conversion of particles to secondary pollutants which are sometimes more toxic in wastewater treatment researchers are investigating new techniques to reduce or remove mentioned limitations photocatalysis has been described as a promising technique for solving environmental problems without generating secondary pollutants 15 a green and friendly method that uses solar energy in various applications such as water splitting degradation and reduction of harmful pollutants and photoreduction of co2 30 the photocatalytic process refers to the ultraviolet uv light illumination that is semiconductor interaction through which an excited electron bounces off the valence band vb to the conduction band cb developing a consequent electron hole e h pair from the resulting reaction between the electron or hole and the oxygen in water the reactive radicals such as hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 emerge that in turn react with organic substances leading to development of mineralized products like carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o most photocatalysts require uv light and because only about 10 of sunlight is uv it is challenging to perform photocatalytic reactions efficiently 31 thus components such as light harvesting semiconductors catalytically active sites oxidation and reduction potential play an important role during the reaction and are the main features for electron transfer to the catalyst surface however a photocatalyst with a larger bandgap has strong redox potential and charges carrier separation with the least solar energy utilization on the other hand a photocatalyst with a smaller bandgap possesses exceptional solar light harvesting properties thus it could be taken advantage of the benefits of both systems and simultaneously reduce the limitations by synthesizing heterojunction of a proper reductive catalyst high cb and an oxidative catalyst low vb with a suitable band structure 32 therefore to develop more sensible photocatalysts with better photocatalytic performance for practical applications the study and synthesis of visible light photocatalysts have attracted much attention 33 layered double hydroxides have received a vast deal of attention in recent years due to their properties including layered structure anion exchangeability compositional flexibility non toxicity ease of synthesis and low cost 34 36 layered double hydroxides ldhs are classified as anionic minerals ldhs structure emanates from the isomorphous substitution of divalent cations by trivalent or tetravalent cations in a brucite like lattice with various morphologies like nanofibers nanosheets nanospheres nanotubes and so on this layered structure is held together by interlayer counter anions and water molecules 37 38 the general formula for ldhs is m1 x iimx iii oh 2 x ax n n mh2o in which mii and miii are divalent and trivalent cations an represents the anions with the negative charge of n which are settled within the interlayer alongside h2o molecules whose number is denoted by m and eventually x is the layer charge density of ldhs 39 these materials have found a special place among catalysts and have shown outstanding performance in the field of removal of aqueous contaminants which has made them a reliable alternative to tio2 ti doping into ldhs structure enhances the catalytic ability and in this respect znti ldh has a superior photocatalytic activity to tio2 and zno 30 hexagonal boron nitride h bn is a 2d metal free material consisting of a hexagonal ring of nitrogen and boron atoms this material is an analog of graphene in terms of structure and various properties and is sometimes referred to as white graphene 40 41 apart from its application in multiple industries such as electrical resistors thermal conductors and cement concrete h bn has shown excellent performance in environmental protection and catalytic activities the broad application of h bn is due to its strong antioxidation ability chemical stability non toxicity and good thermal conductivity 42 44 while significant advances have been made in the field of graphene based materials in recent years boron based composites with similar specifications have not received much attention in addition to recent progress in exfoliation and stabilization of h bn diverse activities have been taken to composite h bn with other materials 43 the formation of heterojunction composites by combining two different photocatalysts with suitable bandgaps has become one of the most promising methods to solve the recombination of photogenerated charge and holes problems 30 herein a novel h bn based heterojunction composite with znti ldh has been prepared the presence of an ldh as a strong photocatalyst with two elements of titanium and zinc in its structure along with h bn as a powerful adsorbent with a stable structure results in a better efficiency at less time in the processes of separation and removal of pollutants the synthesized samples were characterized by ftir xrd fesem eds bet tem and drs analyses the photocatalytic performance of znti ldh h bn composites was evaluated under the irradiation of a visible light lamp to remove dzp and am simultaneously from the aqueous solution it was found that the nanocomposite material showed better removal performance than pure znti ldh and h bn 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemical reagents including boric acid h3bo3 for analysis zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o 99 titanium tetrachloride ticl4 99 9 and urea ch4n2o 99 were

powder the product was washed well with dilute hydrochloric acid and absolute ethanol and dried at ambient temperature and it was made into a homogeneous powder using an agate mortar 44 2 3 preparation of znti ldh h bn photocatalysts there are several methods for synthesizing ldhs include co precipitation urea hydrolysis sol gel ion exchange and calcination rehydration each of them has its advantages depending on the purpose of the synthesis 37 for znti ldh h bn composites ldh was synthesized by the co precipitation approach and prepared h bn was already added to the synthesis solution to form znti ldh on it 80 mg of as obtained h bn powder was first dispersed into 100 ml of deionized water by ultrasonication for 0 5 h to give a white suspension then 1 19 g zn no3 2 6h2o and 3 g urea were added into the solution under magnetic stirring subsequently naoh aqueous solution 0 5 m was added into the mixture to keep the ph constant ph 7 5 after stirring for 0 5 h 0 22 ml of

instruments for more information see supporting file 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of znti ldh h bn composite in fig 1 the xrd pattern of znti ldh h bn and its two constituents is depicted to determine the crystalline phase for znti ldh strong reflection 003 was observed at 13 26 and reflections of 006 009 at 24 8 and 36 3 which correspond to the basal and higher order reflections of ldhs the other reflections of 100 012 110 and 113 are the usual ldh reflections the basal reflection 2θ 13 21 d003 66 nm with slight variation occurred at a higher angle than the previous value reported in the literature 45 47 the reflections of 002 and 100 at 25 7 and 42 respectively belong to the h bn structure based on a standard pdf card jcpds pdf card no 34 0421 48 49 after the composite formation it is clear that the xrd patterns of the composite and znti ldh are identical on the other hand h bn prominent peaks did not appear to be noticeable due to the low impact on crystallinity good exfoliation of h bn nanosheets during the synthesis procedure by ultrasonication and its low weight ratio to ldh 1 5 30 43 although this effect is not significant the addition of h bn to znti ldh has reduced the crystalline intensity and could be observed in the composite xrd pattern s peaks which got wider and smoother near 25 7 and 42 this effect has been investigated with the crystallite size and scherer equation 1 d kλ β cosθ where k represents the scherrer constant k 0 94 λ represents the x ray wavelength λ 0 15418 nm β is the width of the diffraction peak at half of the maximum intensity fwhm and θ is the bragg s angle 50 the crystallite sizes for composite and znti ldh were 34 82 and 37 98 nm respectively it was found that adding h bn lowers the crystallite size of the composite slightly compared to znti ldh fig 2 shows the ftir spectrum of prepared samples which clearly shows a broad band at 3370 cm 1 revealing the oh stretching mode of the interlayer water molecule and hydroxyl groups fig 2a 51 this band is formed by the oh bands of the ldh structure fig 2b between the various metal cations and the oh and h bn structure plus the nh2 group at 3244 and 1593 2 cm 1 presence in the h bn structure fig 2c 48 in the case of the ldh sample the bands at 1506 and 1393 cm 1 are related to the ν3 stretching mode of interlayer carbonate ions also the weaker bands at 1046 9 and 706 5 cm 1 are related to the ν1 stretching mode of carbonate and free carbonate ions respectively 51 mode ν2 of carbonate anions is responsible for bands 947 5 and 836 cm 1 the 706 5 cm 1 band is due to the presence of ν4 free carbonate anions 52 also bands at 1393 and 739 cm 1 might be due to in plane bn stretching and plane b n b bending modes respectively 43 absorption bands at 400 800 cm 1 are attributed to m o stretching and m o m bridging stretching mode m zn ti 53 in fig 2 from the comparison of the diagrams it is clear that the composite spectrum fig 2a follows znti ldh and wherever h bn has peaked it has affected the composite spectrum by increasing the intensity of the peaks compared to the ldh diagram fig 2b in order to examine the microstructure and morphology of nanoparticles the fesem eds and tem analyzes were performed the fesem images of znti ldh h bn are shown in fig 3 for better comparison and confirmation of the composite formation synthesized h bn and znti ldh images are also provided as shown in fig 3 a b the h bn structure is layered with few layered stacking sheets and a smooth surface resembling the structure of graphene nanosheets 54 znti ldh images fig 3 c d displayed the hierarchical structure with many macropores in fig 3 e h however both structures can be seen 2d nanoflakes with hierarchical structure and smooth nanosheets stacked over each other fig 3e shows ldh particles formed on h bn clods which are marked in the image in fig 3f while the accumulation of ldh is observed h bn sheets are marked with arrows fig 3g shows clearly the distribution and formation of ldh on h bn fig 3h zooms in the previous figure fig 3g shows the intertwined ldh sheets placed vertically on the smooth h bn sheets the photos in fig 3 e h indicate the presence of compact sheets with a high surface area that enhances the contact possibility between the reactant and the photocatalyst surface furthermore the eds analysis characterized the surface elements of both znti ldh and the composite for a more explicit endorsement illustrated in fig 4 the reported eds spectra for znti ldh fig 4a demonstrate zn and ti elements with great intensity on the surface of materials and oxygen with a significant intensity representing the hydroxide bonds in ldh structure on the other hand fig 4b shows the presence of b and n on the composite surface that is a sanction to the accuracy of the synthesis despite the low intensity which is due to less proportion of applied boron nitride in the composite composition 44 55 tem analysis of the synthesized samples confirms the flake like structure of composite particles fig 5 it reveals two dimensional layers with different sizes and thicknesses and many mesopores existed on their surface the structure of znti ldh is indicated in fig 5a by a red dashed line comparable to fig 3d on the other hand the structure of h bn is shown with a blue dashed line which is darker than the other parts due to the density of the existing layers as well two distinct structures are evident in fig 5b marked separately comparable with fesem images the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the prepared composite and znti ldh are shown in fig 6 as the graph illustrates the isotherm for composites is type iv with the h3 type hysteresis loop this would suggest that this type of hysteresis might form due to the presence of large slitlike mesopores composed of pores with much smaller sizes 56 the measured specific surface area was 137 m2 g 1 for znti ldh was about 128 m2 g 1 with the mean pore diameter of 8 5 nm moreover the pore size distribution analysis plot fig 6 inset indicated that the major pore volume is related to about 1 8 2 5 nm size pores one key factor that sets photocatalysts apart from other catalysts is their ability to absorb light to supply process energy the amount of light absorption by nanoparticles is determined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs analysis the light absorbing of znti ldh and the composited material is shown in fig 7 representing that the nanocomposite had a better optical absorption notably in the visible light region the enhancement could be for the more excellent transmission of h bn within the visible light region the inset figure also shows the theoretical bandgap of as prepared semiconductors as expected and could be deduced from the literature the znti ldh bandgap was about 3 25 ev in comparison the as formed heterojunction between the h bn and the ldh improved the situation and diminished the distance between the conduction and valence bands to reach around 3 02 ev 18 55 57 58 the diagram is plotted based on αhν n a hν eg equation where α is the absorption coefficient ν is light frequency h is plank s constant eg is the bandgap energy and a is a constant as well n is a factor correlated to the semiconductor s optical transition direct or indirect transition for znti ldh h bn with direct transition n is equal to 2 44 59 3 2 degradation study after the nanocomposite synthesis the calibration curves for each contaminant were plotted using the uv vis spectrophotometer am showed two prominent absorption peaks at 215 and 520 nm and dzp at 238 and 285 nm which 520 nm and 238 nm are the main peaks of am and dzp respectively 21 60 the removal percentage of contaminants was obtained from the following equation 2 removal c 0 c i c 0 100 c0 and ci represent the initial and the final concentration mg l in the aqueous solution respectively the spectrum of 20 mg l am and 10 mg l dzp concentration and calibration curves are depicted in fig s2 c0 and ci represent the initial and the final concentration mg l in the aqueous solution respectively the spectrum of 20 mg l am and 10 mg l dzp concentration and calibration curves are depicted in fig s2 3 2 1 effect of solution ph the ph of the solution has a great effect on the removal of pollutants due to the possible interactions between the ions of the solution and the surface charge of the catalysts therefore the effect of the different ph of the solution ph 2 to 10 has been studied on am and dzp degradation and shown in fig 8 hcl and naoh were used to adjust the ph while other factors such as the initial concentration photocatalyst dosage and contact time were fixed at 10 mg l 100 mg l and 60 min respectively as shown in fig 8 increasing the ph from 2 to 10 reduces the degradation efficiency both for am and dzp the difference in reduction of efficiency for am is close to 86 96 5 at ph 2 and 9 9 at ph 10 while it is not significant for dzp since it is only about 18 33 23 at ph 2 and 15 47 at ph 10 this observation was predictable because the result of zeta potential analysis indicated that the synthesized nanocomposites had a positive surface charge in the acidic medium while am is an anionic dye thus a strong electrostatic attraction is formed between the pollutant and the surface of photocatalysts however dzp has a large amount of negative charge accumulation near its c o group and a positive charge accumulation near the nh group so the better adsorption of dzp is possible on the photocatalyst surface both in acidic and alkaline environments 61 62 the zeta potential of composites in deionized water am solution and dzp solution is shown in fig s3 the zero point charge for znti ldh h bn was obtained at ph 6 in aqueous media at ph 2 9 in am solution and at ph 5 6 in dzp solution as a result according to fig 8 and zeta potential ph 2 was considered the optimum ph of the solution the ph of the solution has a great effect on the removal of pollutants due to the possible interactions between the ions of the solution and the surface charge of the catalysts therefore the effect of the different ph of the solution ph 2 to 10 has been studied on am and dzp degradation and shown in fig 8 hcl and naoh were used to adjust the ph while other factors such as the initial concentration photocatalyst dosage and contact time were fixed at 10 mg l 100 mg l and 60 min respectively as shown in fig 8 increasing the ph from 2 to 10 reduces the degradation efficiency both for am and dzp the difference in reduction of efficiency for am is close to 86 96 5 at ph 2 and 9 9 at ph 10 while it is not significant for dzp since it is only about 18 33 23 at ph 2 and 15 47 at ph 10 this observation was predictable because the result of zeta potential analysis indicated that the synthesized nanocomposites had a positive surface charge in the acidic medium while am is an anionic dye thus a strong electrostatic attraction is formed between the pollutant and the surface of photocatalysts however dzp has a large amount of negative charge accumulation near its c o group and a positive charge accumulation near the nh group so the better adsorption of dzp is possible on the photocatalyst surface both in acidic and alkaline environments 61 62 the zeta potential of composites in deionized water am solution and dzp solution is shown in fig s3 the zero point charge for znti ldh h bn was obtained at ph 6 in aqueous media at ph 2 9 in am solution and at ph 5 6 in dzp solution as a result according to fig 8 and zeta potential ph 2 was considered the optimum ph of the solution 3 2 2 effect of contact time further studies were performed to determine the equilibrium time of adsorption and degrading of contaminants moreover a test was performed to investigate the photolysis effect on am and dzp the results are shown in fig 9 reaction conditions ph 2 adsorbent amount 100 mg l initial concentration of am and dzp samples were 20 mg l and 5 mg l respectively it should be acknowledged that the photolysis of the contaminants has been very small and negligible hence there was no concern about the photodegradation of contaminants by light regarding the contribution of adsorption on am removal it could be concluded that the synthesized photocatalyst is a suitable adsorbent of this dye owing to the adsorption capacity which was 14 mg gca after 90 min however the synthesized particles of the nanocomposite are not a promising adsorbent for dzp because after 120 min its adsorption capacity was only about 12 5 mg gca in the presence of light depending on the reaction conditions am reaches equilibrium after about 60 min dzp removal though it did not reach the maximum amount of initial concentration decreased its degradation intensity and equilibrium was achieved within 120 min absorption spectra also show the reduction process for both am and dzp in their reference situation and after reduction time in dark and light mode fig 9c d the langmuir hinshelwood l h model was used to inquire into the degradation kinetics of the am and dzp considering the effect of adsorption and desorption in the photocatalytic removal reaction makes this model suitable to study the photodegradation kinetics which has been the simplified form 63 eq 3 represents the l h equation where k1 is the pseudo first order reaction rate constant c0 is the initial concentration of pollutants and t means the reaction time 64 3 ln c c 0 k 1 t the reaction constant for am degradation by composite 0 0622 s 1 was 1 4 and 7 7 times the value obtained by znti ldh and h bn respectively dzp degraded less rapidly and the reaction constant when using the composite was 0 0141 s 1 which was 1 7 and 1 8 times higher than using znti ldh and h bn respectively under the same circumstances 3 2 3 effect of photocatalyst dosage to determine the effects of photocatalyst loading on the degradation efficiency different amounts of znti ldh h bn 80 to 200 mg l were added to the particular concentration of the solution while other reaction conditions are kept constant at ph 2 contact time of 60 min and 20 mg l for dye concentration as shown in fig 10 a by increasing the amount of catalyst from 80 to 200 mg l the degradation efficiency is increasing 78 90 to 99 60 but after 160 mg l efficiency rises only slightly and no significant amount is obtained fig 10 a also shows the effect of increasing the photocatalyst dose on dzp according to the previous step where the removal efficiency of dzp was evaluated with the contact time although it was tested for 120 min the amount of photocatalyst was not enough for its complete removal therefore the catalyst dose range at this section was considered from 100 to 500 mg l other reaction conditions were equal to ph 2 contact time 120 min and initial concentration 5 mg l dzp also responded well to increasing the catalyst dose and the degradation efficiency increased from 40 1 to 50 5 considering the catalyst savings and the slight difference in removal efficiency 300 mg l seems appropriate for the optimum point 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration of pollutants the concentration of contaminants is an effective parameter and by changing it an attempt has been made to improve the removal process the catalyst dosage was kept constant 160 mg l for removing am and 300 mg l for removing diazepam as shown in fig 10 b the degradation efficiency declines with the increasing concentration of am and dzp this is because active sites are saturated according to the obtained data 20 and 2 mg l values were considered the optimum concentrations for am and dzp respectively 3 2 5 possible intermediates and effect of radical scavenger the impact of reactive species affecting the degradation of pollutants was investigated the results of these studies also revealed the reaction mechanism in this regard p benzoquinone isopropanol edta and potassium dichromate quenchers were used to scavenge o2 oh h and e respectively 10 65 the effect of 0 1 m of different scavengers on the photocatalytic degradation of am and dzp over the synthesized composite is shown in fig 11 it was observed that the am was not affected by benzoquinone and dichromate and was degraded with the same intensity as before but edta and isopropanol reduced the am removal efficiency from 99 48 to 84 5 and 93 9 respectively oh and h are effective as reactive species for am removal therefore the mechanism of am degradation is considered according to the following equations 66 68 4 znti ldh h bn hν e h 5 h h 2 o oh h 6 h oh oh in the case of dzp isopropanol scavenges hydroxyl radicals and by decreasing this radical from the reaction medium the degradation efficiency of dzp reduces other scavengers have not significantly affected the degradation process so oh was chosen as the reactive species of dzp the possible intermediates of am and dzp which were photodegraded on the znti ldh h bn nanocomposite were identified with gc ms analysis and results are presented in table 2 according to the gc ms analysis results and other references the reaction mechanism can be considered as fig 12 for am and fig 13 for dzp 13 66 the tracks with the blue arrow have been suggested by other researchers and the tracks with the red arrow are the result of the present research 3 2 6 mineralization study intermediates generated during photodegradation processes are of major significance since they can be more toxic than the prior compounds 69 under optimal conditions for am and dzp removal the removal efficiency of toc was measured and shown in fig 14 which indicates suitable mineralization of contaminants by znti ldh h bn in this process the mineralization of am and dzp was about 51 and 33 after 2 h and might be performed according to the following equations respectively 7 c 10 h 11 n 2 o 10 na 3 s 3 51 2 o 2 20 co 2 2 no

operate side by side in industrial parks whose sewage is connected through pipelines it is possible to provide wastewater treatment units for each industrial park to remove hazardous pollutants from the water media before reaching the city wastewater treatment plants simultaneous removal of amaranth and diazepam can show the znti ldh h bn composites potential for being an option for such treatment units during the simultaneous removal of contaminants the test conditions were selected in such a way that they overlap well so that the specified concentration of each contaminant can be removed similar to the previous sections ph 2 contact time 120 min catalyst dosage 300 mg l amaranth concentration 20 mg l diazepam concentration 2 mg l from the results am was completely degraded and the degradation efficiency of dzp was more than 95 making znti ldh h bn composites an excellent photocatalyst for simultaneous removal of organic and pharmaceutical pollutants interestingly observations confirm that decolorization of the dye accompanied with diazepam lasted less than 30 min which could be considered the effect of by products of diazepam on amaranth degradation to confirm the photocatalytic capability of znti ldh h bn composite a comparison has been made between the degradation performance of various photocatalysts used for am and dzp removal and photocatalysts based on znti ldh and h bn and the results are given in table 3 by examining the data in this table and comparing different operational conditions valuable information can be obtained regarding the synthesized samples potential in this study features such as utilizing small amounts of catalyst short operating time visible light proper concentration of pollutants and especially excellent degradation rate make znti ldh h bn heterojunction an effective photocatalyst another point that can be mentioned is the degradation of two organic contaminants in the same aqueous solution degrading pollutants simultaneously particularly pharmaceutical contaminants without utilizing the uv light or additives such as h2o2 is challenging which znti ldh h bn has achieved in ideal conditions and in a short time 3 2 8 reusability and stability to investigate the reusability of synthesized photocatalysts three degradation cycles were tested each performed for 120 min according to previous tests it is worth noting that the particles were tested without recovery and washing in each round as shown in fig 15 differences in the removal efficiency of am are negligible during each cycle however the severity of dzp degradation has been reduced which of course is not so significant thus the znti ldh h bn could be considered stable and usable in three cycles additional analysis was conducted on the nature of the recovered znti ldh h bn particles as depicted in fig 16 the composite s xrd pattern and ftir spectrum were approximately the same as fresh photocatalyst after the three cycles indicating that synthesized nanocomposites had good stability throughout the photocatalytic process there are minor changes in the used composites ftir curves in 1393 3 and 1506 7 cm 1 wavenumbers which shifted to 1400 and 1630 cm 1 respectively these differences may be due to the catalyst and its surface not being thoroughly cleaned the leached metal ions from znti ldh h bn nanoparticles were investigated by the icp oes technique which revealed that only a minimal amount less than 0 5 of ti zn and b were leached into the solution which could be the reason for the slight decrease in the activity of the catalysts in the subsequent cycles however this amount of leaching is typical and can be due to the lack of complete washing during synthesis steps 4 conclusion in this work we succeeded in presenting a novel nanocomposite with photocatalytic properties consisting of znti ldh and h bn in which znti ldh was well dispersed on h bn synthesized materials were investigated to remove organic pollutants from water amaranth azo dye and diazepam the morphological and structural features of the photocatalyst were analyzed by various characterization tests including xrd ftir fesem eds tem and bet bjh there was a decrease of about 7 in the bandgap of the znti ldh h bn when compared to the bare znti ldh znti ldh h bn has demonstrated superior performance in eliminating and degrading the considered pollutants in the proposed structure h bn played a role as a support layer and an excellent adsorbent in the adsorption of am to achieve ideal efficiency in reducing pollution alongside znti ldh various contributing parameters such as ph contact time catalyst dosage and pollutants initial concentration which affect the efficiency of photocatalyst activity were evaluated to determine optimum conditions after ensuring that the synthesized samples effectively degrade am and dzp following the simultaneous removal of both contaminants by selecting the appropriate conditions znti ldh h bn was able to reduce the pollutants well under visible light simultaneous removal efficiencies were more than 99 and 95 for am and dzp respectively moreover the composites could be recycled three times without a marked decline in photocatalytic performance the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 schematic of photocatalytic reaction equipment and main processes

12983,viruses e g sars cov 2 are discharged into surface water bodies or agricultural irrigation from treated municipal domestic wastewater therefore this study aimed to evaluate the viral removal from wastewater treatment technologies also considering wastewater physicochemical properties based on a bibliometric statistical review a preliminary bibliometric analysis keywords co occurrence using vos viewer n 698 scientific publications was established moreover systematic constraining criteria 1983 2021 limiting the statistical study to 93 scientific publications were carried out variance analysis anova 2 ways and principal component analysis pca were used to identify the most influential wastewater treatment typology and parameters affecting viral removal bibliometric results showed that at least 25 of the studies on viral removal from wastewater corresponded to the last 2 years therefore sars cov 2 was approached in a particular way thus more than 15 viruses and or genotypes and more than 20 specific non specific technologies for viral removal were statistically analyzed results did not report significant differences p 0 05 of log removal virus lrv between specific e g mbr chlorination and non specific e g activated sludge anaerobic digestion technologies however mbr specific and anaerobic digestion non specific reported the highest viral removal efficiencies sars cov 2 has been reported to be removed by specific and non specific technologies but it is not conclusive preliminary statistical approximations establish that the physicochemical parameters cod tss ph from wastewater could influence the viral removal future challenges should focus on operational improvements new technology development and regulation recycling discharge assuming potential risks human environment keywords bibliometric statistical sars cov 2 wastewater viruses treatment technologies solids 1 introduction about 4 5 billion people worldwide do not have sanitation collection treatment discharge reaching large gaps between developed 60 and developing 20 countries 1 2 this scenario is made more complex by the water scarcity that in 2016 affected 32 5 of the world population 3 thus treated wastewater recycling emerges as an alternative water source for water scare areas 4 5 however both discharge and recycling of treated wastewater constitute a potential health risk due to its microbiological composition indeed wastewaters are rich environments that contain bacteria fungi protozoans and viruses 6 in specific viruses are excreted from human feces at rates between 105 and 1012 viral particles g of stool 7 human feces that end up in wastewater however viruses from other species such as animals plants fungi and bacteria can also be found within wastewater 8 thus wastewaters have reported a viral diversity constituted by norovirus nov rotavirus rv hepatitis a virus ha enterovirus ev adenovirus hadv among others 9 10 due to the variety of viruses in wastewater studies have been conducted to determine concentrations in both influent and effluent see table 1 in the case of norovirus 1 8 104 9 7 105 copies l astroviruses 13 7 103 1 2 108 copies l have been detected between 24 and 20 of environmental waters samples after wwtps wastewater treatment plants discharge 11 this could depend on the treatment technology typologies from wwtps effectively some studies have reported the presence of hepatitis a 1 86 107 copies l and norovirus gii 2 94 108 copies l from german wastewater effluents 12 131 another case is rotaviruses which have been detected 103 105 copies l in several south african wwtps 13 therefore the risk to public health from the discharge and recycling of treated wastewater is evident water has a direct influence on gastrointestinal diseases 20 million case years and related deaths 2 3 million persons year 9 10 in 2010 the world health organization who reported 600 million diseases and 420 000 deaths were caused by pathogens transmitted by food washed with untreated wastewater with 40 of the diseases occurring in children under five years of age 14 moreover given the relevance of diseases caused by viruses who has identified the top 10 threats to global health four of which are virus related such as pandemic influenza hiv dengue and ebola 132 emerging infectious diseases caused by new viruses are a significant concern worldwide some of them have affected several communities with significant outbreaks in the last 20 years such as sars during 2002 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ebola 2014 2016 swine flu h1n1 2009 2010 and zika virus 2015 2016 the latest coronavirus associated 2019 to present is the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 sars cov 2 virus which causes the covid 19 disease declared a pandemic in 2020 by who when analyzing the information on viral removal during the period 1983 2021 117 dates it is observed that the norovirus nov genus is one of the most studied representing 22 of the total data nov 7 nov gi 5 nov gii 9 nov giv 1 followed by the adenovirus genus with 19 enterovirus 14 and sars cov 2 with 12 these being the four most studied viruses in viral removal in wastewater worldwide see fig 1a in addition rotavirus hepatitis a viruses hepatitis e viruses among others have been studied see fig 1a noroviruses adenoviruses and enteroviruses date back to the 1950s and as time has progressed new variants have been discovered however the scientific community s interest in studying these genus stands out since they are the leading causes of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases affecting more frequently children under five years of age of low socioeconomic levels 15 the four most studied viruses are relevant due to the clinical pictures they can generate in the case of noroviruses ssrna that are genetically diverse have been made a new classification grouped into ten genogroups gi gx and 49 genotypes this virus is mainly associated with acute gastroenteritis 16 nov infections are mainly spread by the fecal oral route with person to person transmission ingestion of contaminated food or water or through contact with contaminated surfaces 17 the genogroups that cause disease in humans are gi gii and giv 18 which are found in wastewater see fig 1a the human adenoviruses dna viruses are associated with gastrointestinal neurological ophthalmological and genitourinary diseases 19 eighty eight different types of hadv have been identified and classified into seven species a g where 57 hadv belong to species d 20 the main pathway of transmission is by contact with water containing adenoviruses or from person to person 21 adenoviruses are a standard viral indicator of human fecal contamination in drinking water and wastewater treatment 22 in addition hadv can remain stable and persist to wastewater treatment with a persistence of 132 days in wastewater 22 the enteroviruses ev are rna viruses can cause a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from meningitis myocarditis respiratory and gastrointestinal infections 23 the ev can be transmitted by contact with contaminated secretions or surfaces a total of 106 enteroviruses infect humans and are grouped into four species a d with species b containing the highest number 59 24 the scientific community s interest in studying these genus stands out since they are the leading causes of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases affecting more frequently children under five years of age of low socioeconomic levels 15 24 the fourth most studied virus corresponds to sars cov 2 with 12 its appearance in december 2019 gives rise to covid 19 disease which became pandemic in march 2020 sars cov 2 causes multi system dysfunction and new evidence suggests it is a vascular and not respiratory disease which plays an essential role in defining treatments for infected persons 25 in addition new variants of sars cov 2 have been found circulating in the community that is of interest to who such as alpha kappa delta gamma and mu variants 26 new variants there has been an increase in studies focused on determining the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater and wwtps it allows evaluating the spread of the virus virus circulation and even to determine the variants circulating in the community 27 130 thus most of its studies on wastewater have focused on using it as an epidemiological indicator epidemiology based on wastewater thus viruses from wastewater are the most dangerous since some of them remain active from weeks to months under suitable aqueous environments 28 sars cov 2 causes the covid 19 disease which is classified as a pandemic by the who since 2019 has been reported in wastewater around of world 27 due to the diversity of shapes sizes and types of genetic material the baltimore classification groups viruses according to their genetic material and replication strategy this classification considers seven groups group i dsdna e g adenoviruses herpesviruses poxviruses group ii ssdna e g parvoviruses group iii dsrna e g rotaviruses rheoviridae group iv ssrna hepatitis viruses sars yellow fever group v ssrna ebola rabies viruses flu viruses group vi ssrna rt hiv aids group vii dsdna rt hepatitis b viruses according to the baltimore classification see fig 1b when analyzing the viruses studied in wastewater plants 1983 2020 the most studied viruses with 64 7 correspond to group iv group i with 17 6 the other two groups studied are iii 11 8 and ii 5 9 it is not surprising that group iv will be one of the most studied since it considers viruses such as hepatitis norovirus enterovirus and sars cov 2 in group i adenovirus hadv polyomavirus and bacteriophages t4 and group iii includes rotavirus and reovirus and finally in group ii which groups viruses such as torque teno virus ttv groups iv and i include the viruses with the highest percentage of viral removal publications due to the public health problems they have generated at different times related to how the viruses replicate in addition group iv can be directly translated that is its viral replication is faster while group i depends on the characteristics of the host 29 in recent years there has been an increased interest in studying the behavior and viruses removal from wastewater for the potential recycling of treated wastewater impact on aquatic ecosystems and epidemiological surveillance the analysis of the state of the art indicates that there has been an increased interest in studying the behavior and removal of viruses present in municipal domestic wastewater since the goal is to reuse wastewater soon and wastewater based epidemiology studies during current pandemic in specific due to the increased interest in safe recycling and viral removal the objective of our work was to evaluate the influence of wastewater treatment technologies on virus removal 2 methodology 2 1 information sources bibliometric analysis was carried out using the scientific journal repository scopus from elsevier joint appearances of two independent keywords within one or more scientific publications referring to the same study topic were established 30 31 thus co occurrence analysis searching wastewater and treatment and of and virus and removal and considering abstract keywords title within publications was used this analysis was limited to 1983 2021 working with 698 scientific publications and delimiting items with a minimum number of occurrences of a keyword of 5 the inclusion of as a keyword intended to limit publications that related treatment and viral removal however its use did not ultimately influence the publications number selected by scopus systematic statistical analyses were carried out using the directly scientific journal repository science direct criteria constraints considering temporality wastewater type virus among others are described in table 1 keywords such as viral removal efficiency wastewater treatment viral removal and viruses were used to generate a robust database the exploring phase recovered 70 017 scientific publications meanwhile the confirmation phase limited the systematic analysis to 93 scientific publications table 2 2 2 processing information bibliometric analysis establishing co occurrence network although vos viewer version 1 6 16 from scopus database was evaluated the co occurrence is defined as the joint appearances of two independent terms within one or several publications references to the same subject of study in order to understand visualize the scientific information available on the web 30 31 finally co occurrence maps size of each node appearance co occurrence which connect different topics were obtained in this work two groups of technologies were defined to carry out the comparative analyses specific technologies are those whose main objective is to remove pathogens as opposed to non specific technologies which help to remove pathogens but are not their primary objective systematic statistical analysis two way anova test to stablish significant differences p 0 05 between types of technologies specific s non specific ns and virus baltimore scale respect to virus removal lrv or log removal virus were determined previously database was subjected to normality shapiro wilks s test and variance homogeneity f test then parametric bonferroni test and non parametric kruskal wallis test analysis were used according to homoscedasticity of the database systematic statistical analysis pca or principal component analysis to identify correlation between control environmental operational parameters from treatment technologies and viruses removal were stablished this exploratory method was chosen because it does not require a specific probability distribution for its analysis thus positive ɵ 0 negative ɵ 180 and no correlation ɵ 90 between parameters were determined meanwhile originpro 2020b version 2021 software for statistical analysis was used 3 result and discussion 3 1 state of the art of viruses removal from wastewater treatment technologies fig 2 resumes the bibliometric analysis temporal evolution co occurrence keywords of viruses removal from wastewater treatment technologies using scientific publications 1983 2021 in this research co occurrence analysis reported about 6306 keywords with 777 items of them that meet the threshold of minimum 5 occurrences these items were grouped in 7 clusters influenced by items such as wastewater treatment occur 412 cluster 1 197 items nonhuman occur 264 cluster 2 165 items bacteria microorganisms occur 118 cluster 3 120 items viruses occur 305 cluster 4 110 items concentration composition occur 50 cluster 5 87 items wastewater occur 277 cluster 6 74 items and risk assessment occur 45 cluster 7 24 items therefore topics items related with wastewater treatment and microorganisms covered least at 76 of reported keywords regarding viral genres researches have focused on some such as sapovirus occur 13 jc virus occur 7 coliphages occur 44 enterovirus occur 83 norovirus occur 82 poliomyelitis occur 22 hepatitis occur 37 adenovirus occur 87 and coronavirus occur 158 specifically sars cov 2 occur 136 has been approached as sars cov 2 sars coronavirus covid 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019 in these last 2 years in relation to the technologies studied both specific and non specific have been used in general few non specific technologies have been reported highlighting activated sludge occur 143 lagoon ponds occur 16 and sequency batch reactor occur 11 however a wide variety of specific technologies methods have been studied mentioning membrane filter bioreactor occur 164 reverse osmosis occur 23 electro coagulation occur 31 ozonation ozonization occur 41 ultraviolet photolysis occur 75 chlorination occur 80 activated carbon occur 30 and electrochemical methods occur 5 finally virus risk assessment occur 146 has also been widely addressed by publications in short the research in this area has focused mainly on evaluating or testing specific and non specific technologies for viruses removal specifying viral genders with focus on public health recycling discharge on other hand the time evolution of studies related with virus removal from wastewater have reported a lineal growth 1 19 year with 20 scientific publications concentrated during 2003 2010 in this period reseaches about severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov were the most common meanwhile about 80 remaining scientific publications were associated the last decade with 25 of them published during 2020 2021 because mainly of sars cov 2 effectively the interest evaluating virus mainly sars cov 2 has increased in the last 2 years on the one hand the potential of influents as a sars cov 2 epidemiological indicator wastewater based epidemiology have been evaluated indeed related studies 487 scientific publications have been carried out in more than 10 countries standing out australia japan slovenia united states france netherlands ecuador chile italy spain belgium and china 32 47 in this sense detection methods and mathematical models have been evaluated in order to study its prevalence 41 48 moreover researches evaluating the potential health risk of aerosols from influents containing sars cov 2 in toilets and wwtps has been discussed 49 on the other hand effluents discharged into water bodies or recycled in irrigation has also been into account when assessing public health risks 50 51 thus sars cov 2 removal studies within wwtps are being evaluated in various countries around the world such as chile india canada saudi arabia japan thailand iran united states among others 43 52 59 fig 3 describes bibliometric analysis of scientific publications respect to geographic location wastewater type and wastewater technology categories specific non specific in specific viruses studies have been carried out mainly in europe and north america with 32 and 27 respectively see fig 3a the rest of the continents asia south america oceania africa does not exceed 41 of related studies the researches have been focused mainly on municipal 81 domestic 7 sludge 9 livestock 2 and hospital 1 wastewaters see fig 3b regarding to the technologies used about 61 of the technologies studied in the virus removal are specific mainly related with ultraviolet light uv 18 chloration chl 16 and membrane bioreactor mbr 39 see fig 3c e meanwhile the remaining 39 related to non specific technologies have focused mainly on evaluating activated sludge as 46 anaerobic rectors and 12 and lagoons ls 10 see fig 3c d gaps economics that condition sanitation coverage between developed 82 and developing countries 25 could be influencing the virus removal research from wastewater 2 moreover intensive virus research on wastewater in developed countries would also be mobilized by local regulations recycling discharge indeed highly agricultural areas e g california and florida in the united states have forced to recover wastewater irrigation being also regulated by viral contamination 60 moreover water stress and water pollution in european continent for more than 4 decades has motivated the municipal wastewater reclamation 61 63 current covid 19 pandemic has returned to alert again about the presence of sars cov 2 and other viruses in irrigation of wastewater reclamation 64 furthermore an emerging interest in developing countries would be influenced by the promising advances in wastewater based epidemiology especially in decentralized contexts 65 moreover triggered by the high incidence rates of viral waterborne diseases e g diarrhea dengue and population consequent death 2 million persons year 66 municipal domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been extensively studied as a source of viral contamination in fact activated sludge technologies as non specific technology by its antiquity 100 years and massiveness are the most used within wwtps however these technologies do not ensure the removal of the entire viral spectrum mainly coliphages 67 68 the current covid 19 pandemic has reported effluents from activated sludge processes are not always free of sars cov 2 57 69 70 these antecedents have opened an opportunity for specific wastewater treatment technologies in the last 5 years specific technologies for virus removal based mainly on filtration 30 chemical disinfection 20 and adsorption 4 have been extensively studied 6 membrane bioreactors anmbr aembr filtration have been mainly studied by their superiority over conventional treatments i e activated sludge and potential escalation 6 71 moreover mbrs have demonstrated to remove a wide variety of virus such as ms 2 t4 adenovirus norovirus gi and gii enterovirus sapovirus rotavirus coliphages among others 71 recent studies on full scale mbr have showed that sars cov 2 can be removed by this technology 50 however the most used specific technology within wwtps is the chemical disinfection by chlorination the use of chlorination disinfection is one of the most widely used methods within wwtps due to its simple application high inactivation capacity and low application cost 72 contrary to mbr use one of the disadvantages is membrane fouling which significantly reduces membrane performance and lifetime increasing maintenance and operation costs 73 bibliographic studies report that free chloride enteroviruses coxsackie virus and monochloramine adenoviruses have selectivity to the viral genre requiring adjustments in contact time and dose depending on virus genre 74 therefore wwtps are likely to selectively remove certain viruses including sars cov 2 indeed the use of sodium hypochlorite free chloride in municipal wastewater has reported to remove sars cov 2 75 all these precedents reveal how the research in the viruses removal from wastewater has been conditioned by health sanitation but also with an overview to safe wastewater reclamation in irrigation 3 2 influence of wastewater treatment technology on viruses removal fig 4 details the influence of wastewater treatment technology on virus removal considering categories of wastewater treatment technologies specific non specific technologies and viral genre the statistical analysis on bibliography information determined that specific specific non specific and non specific technologies reached average lrv of 2 81 2 22 and 2 27 respectively see fig 4b therefore no significant differences p 0 05 between wastewater treatment technology categories were reported nevertheless the biggest representatives specific technologies mbr chl uv registered average lrv of 3 56 2 08 and 1 48 respectively see fig 4a in this case significant differences p 0 05 between them were obtained being mbr the most efficient specific treatment technology that removes viruses on the other hand the biggest representatives non specific technologies as and ls reported average lrv of 2 23 3 43 and 0 90 respectively see fig 4c therefore significant differences p 0 05 between them were obtained nevertheless and was the most efficient non specific wastewater treatment technology evaluated comparing the most efficient technologies of each category it is possible to mention that there were not significant differences p 0 05 between them however mbr was up to 4 more efficient than and moreover the most used technologies within wwtps i e as and chl did not show significant differences p 0 05 between them but both technologies were up to about 42 less efficient than mbr and and the removal of the 3 most reported viral genres adenoviruses enteroviruses and norovirus genotypes from wastewater by both categories specific non specific is showed in fig 4d on the one hand no significant differences p 0 05 between specific lrv 3 10 and non specific lrv 2 22 technologies were reported for adenovirus hadv removal enterovirus ev also did not register significant differences p 0 05 between specific lrv 2 10 and non specific lrv 2 08 technologies however the average lrvs for norovirus genotypes nov nov gi nov gii and nov giv showed significant differences p 0 05 between specific lrv 2 93 and non specific lrv 1 17 technologies therefore the viral removal hierarchy in both wastewater treatment technology categories was as follow hadvs novs hadvnon s evs evnon s novnon s in summary specific technologies had better performance than non specific technologies but it was not significant except in the removal of nov genotypes conventional wwtps are made up of a stage primary screening and settling secondary activated sludge or anaerobic digestion and or tertiary disinfection by chlorination or uv although wwtps have disinfection stage specific technologies some of them especially in decentralized areas only reach secondary treatment therefore non specific technologies i e activated sludge anaerobic digestion are usually the final stage in some geographical zones before discharge on water bodies or irrigation recycling activated sludge as uses aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms forming flocs which remove viruses by adsorption 76 indeed this technology has demonstrated to remove a wide variety of viral genres ev nov hadv cs ms2 plv aiv jc sav csm ttv among others but at lrv ranges from 0 6 to 4 24 13 42 76 89 its study if it has focused on the evaluation of bacteriophages ms2 coliphage and t4 phage because they infect bacteria within as being also able to have applications in the control of bulking foaming resistant bacteria and potential disinfection 90 however operational imbalances ph organic loading dissolved oxygen make this technology unstable with respect to viral removal 68 indeed sars cov 2 has been monitored within as around the world being not detected in some and in others remaining in the effluent 39 52 59 91 anaerobic digestion and with its technologies uasb tubular domo biodigester among others are one of the most applied treatment methods after activated sludge mainly in tropical areas or emerging countries 92 93 viruses are removed within anaerobic processes although thermic inactivation 45 c 66 these technologies have reported viruses removal at lrv between 0 45 and 6 0 studying genres such as coliphages ev and plv 66 94 95 very few studies have evaluated the anaerobic digesters performance during the covid 19 pandemic however uasb in india has been monitored 57 however the variability of its performance could be influenced by its thermal typology psychrophilic mesophilic thermophilic the survival rates of encapsulated non encapsulated viruses e g coronavirus phi6 have been reported to decrease with increasing temperature 96 indeed temperature is largely known as the major factor determining virus inactivation 97 thus sars cov 2 in different surfaces repots up to 2 7 days at 20 c being reduced at hours under temperatures higher than 40 c 98 some viruses i e sars cov 2 has reported being removed within mesophilic uasb while others virus i e enteroviruses noroviruses have not been efficiently removed within psychrophilic uasb 57 94 moreover thermophilic conditions in anaerobic processes have reported viruses inactivation until 3 times higher than mesophilic treatment mainly for animal viruses and bacteriophages 99 therefore the main virus inactivation mechanism by anaerobic technologies is temperature conventional specific technologies such as disinfection using sodium hypochlorite free chloride are widely used within wwtps due its low cost and microbial inactivation 74 chlorine penetrates the microbial cellular membrane disintegrating extracellular lipids and making non functional intracellular enzymes and proteins thus this treatment method has been reported to be efficient removing viruses such as cfe nov genotypes cs ttv hadv asv ev jc rv and sav at lrv ranges from 0 25 and 4 85 82 87 100 102 however the chlorination is selective because it requires optimal dose and contact time depending on each pathogen effectively the center for diseases control and prevention from united states registers wide chlorine concentrations 0 1 1 0 mg l and contact times 0 07 12 72 min for the most frequent viral genres coxsackie genotypes echovirus hepatitis a poliovirus adenovirus and rotavirus in water wastewater 103 previous studies have reported that all sars viruses could be inactivated at chlorine concentrations higher than 0 5 mg l with 30 min of contact time 104 in fact sars cov 2 has been reported to be efficiently removed by chlorine at concentrations higher than 1 mg l exposure for 1 min 75 however its effectiveness is contrasted by its potential generation of toxic by products chloroform dichlorobromomethane monochlorodibromomethane and bromoform 105 this las aspect has opened the door to new specific technologies the most studied non conventional and specific technology is membrane bioreactor mbr for its proven efficacy removing viruses non selective and safety by not generating by products 71 membrane bioreactor anmbr aembr retains particles i e microorganisms with dimensions higher than their pore sizes filtration combined with aerated aembr or no aerated anmrb tanks that promote biodegradation 106 indeed mbrs have registered the best lrv with values between 0 2 and 6 8 for wide variety of viral genres ev hadv nov genotypes ms2 cs bf f rv sav t4 77 81 82 84 86 88 94 107 117 moreover sars cov 2 has been removed efficiently by mbr technologies 118 the membranes used in mbrs have a pore size between 0 1 and 10 μm microfiltration and between 5 and 100 nm ultrafiltration thus retaining protozoa 3 14 μm and bacteria that are larger than the pore size of each membrane 119 full scale mbrs in wwtps can remove viral load by 5 1 1 1 107 7 8 101 viruses l and 3 9 2 8 105 1 2 101 viruses l log units for enterovirus and norovirus gii respectively 117 specifically the mechanisms involved in virus removal within mbr is related to size exclusion adsorption and electrostatic repulsion independent of typology aembr anmbr 71 table 3 resumes the recent studies focused on the sars cov 2 removal from wwtps around the world between january 2020 and september 2021 has been monitored sar cov 2 within wwtps of almost 13 countries distributed in america 20 europe 27 asia 33 and africa 20 about 43 of the technologies monitored corresponds to activated sludge followed by chlorination 20 and uv 10 the rest of the technologies 27 correspond to mbr sbr and uasb the viral genome extraction method is variable standing ultrafiltration ultracentrifugation polyethylene glycol or peg and electronegative membrane vortex or emv on the one hand influents mainly from municipal domestic wastewater report values from 354 and 1 3 106 gc l being detected in most of the reported samples on the other hand 53 of the studies did not detect sars cov 2 in the effluent only 33 of studies detected sars cov 2 at values between 10 and 4 0 105 gc l physicochemical parameters from wastewater are only reported by one study therefore although some studies report the total removal of sars cov 2 this is no conclusive due to sanitary restrictions and limited study of each wwtp 3 3 influence of operational control and performance parameters on the virus s removal from wastewater fig 5 resumes the influence of operational parameters on the virus s removal from wastewater thus components related with dimension 1 pc1 and dimension 2 pc2 represented 61 4 and 18 7 of the database respectively that is the accumulated inertia or explained variance of the acp was acceptable and corresponding to 80 1 moreover grouping between the variables were observed according to the quadrants of the biplot in quadrant i lrv codinf codeff tssinf were grouped meanwhile in quadrant iv parameters such as q tsseff and phinf were observed only hrt was grouped in quadrant ii specifically results showed that codinf codeff hrt and tssinf are those that presented positive correlations ɵ 0 with lrv meanwhile no correlation ɵ 90 was stablished between q tsseff and lrv finally negative correlation ɵ 180 was founded between ph and lrv viruses have demonstrated to survive in different environment such as air soil food and water 120 in specific water and wastewater has been established as the means of greatest viral survival indeed coronavirus i e sar cov2 229e hcov have demonstrated to survive in tap water 2 12 days 20 23 c hospital domestic wastewater 14 days 4 c wang et al 2005 35 121 however other viruses non encapsulated fipv pv 1 have also reported different survival rates in tap water fipv 588 10 days 4 23 c pv 1 203 65 days 4 23 c and wastewaters fipv 2 days 23 c pv 1 10 days 23 c 121 122 although these results show that temperature is an influencing factor in viral survival there are additional factor that can condition it effectively tap water unfiltered has registered increases the viral survival between 2 and 7 days respect to tap water filtrated 121 therefore viruses increase their survival in the solids presence which they can adhere encapsulated viruses e g coronaviruses has more hydrophobicity of the viral envelope than non encapsulated e g polioviruses making them increase their adhesion to solids 121 municipal domestic wastewaters are rich environment in solids tss 250 and organic matter cod 200 mg l making them an ideal medium for survival 5 123 therefore primary and secondary stage within wwtps could be the most suitable route for its removal balboa et al 91 studying of fate of sars cov 2 within wwtps have reported inhibited negative detection genome in effluents from primary and secondary stage moreover authors registered a decrease in sars cov 2 from inhibited to negative when tss influent was decreased from 900 april 6 to 230 april 21 mg l parameters like cod have the same behavior because it is contained in the tss on the other hand ph is other environmental factor which could influence the viral survival in fact acid ph favors the virus adsorption on solids surface increasing its survival while that a high ph elute the adsorbed virus 124 indeed ph and virus morphology are among the essential parameter for pathogen inactivation it also indicates that there is no viral removal at neutral ph this means that viral removal is effective at acidic ph 80 cádiz et al 125 states that acid ph 3 00 and high temperature can reach values of up to 6 lrv which are considered the main factors of viral removal in wastewater while that neutral ph favors bacteriological growth therefore challenges in viral removal are not only related to new or improved technology but also to the knowledge of the dynamics of its behavior with respect to the wastewater physicochemical characteristics this aspect is even more relevant when understanding and improvising the predictive models of wastewater based epidemiology or recycling in irrigation 4 conclusions wastewaters are the main source of waterborne viral pathogens current covid 19 pandemic has revealed the risk of fecal oral transmission that wastewater has under direct contact by aspersion from toilet and wwtps or during irrigation recycling therefore wastewater treatment technologies emerge as one of the most effective preventive public health strategies the study of the art of viral removal from wastewater evidence a wide variety of specific non specific wastewater treatment technologies e g mbr chlorination uv activated sludge anaerobic digestion among others removing different viral genus noroviruses adenoviruses enteroviruses and sars cov 2 sanitation emergency have influenced the growth of knowledge which is evidenced by 80 of studies in the las decade conditioned by coronavirus epidemics only sar cov 2 already concentrates 25 of the bibliographic information reported moreover scientific interest has been concentrated in europe and united states with almost 60 of the studies reported economic gaps irrigation recycling regulations and currently wastewater based epidemiology are the main drivers almost 90 of the studies are focused on municipal domestic wastewater studying mainly specific technologies 61 but evaluating also full scale non specific technologies statistical analysis demonstrated that no significant differences p 0 05 between specific and non specific were founded however mbr specific technology lrv 3 56 and and non specific technology lrv 3 43 are the most efficient removing viruses the most used wastewater treatment technologies as non specific chl specific within wwtps were 42 less efficient than mbr and and only nov genotypes report significant p 0 05 removal differences between specific and non specific technologies sars cov 2 reports being removed by both specific and non specific technologies but even the information is not conclusive finally statistical results evidenced that tss and cod from wastewater register direct correlation between lrv while that ph reports indirect correlation in short the application of statistical analysis using robust bibliographic information 93 publications and comparing different treatment technologies for virus removal provides an alternative strategic decision making tool when defining the use of new technologies or improving existing ones for these proposes moreover if this analysis relates viruses presence with wastewater s environmental conditions it is possible to give the first scope regarding the mechanisms that are influencing on their permanence or removal declaration of competing

12983,viruses e g sars cov 2 are discharged into surface water bodies or agricultural irrigation from treated municipal domestic wastewater therefore this study aimed to evaluate the viral removal from wastewater treatment technologies also considering wastewater physicochemical properties based on a bibliometric statistical review a preliminary bibliometric analysis keywords co occurrence using vos viewer n 698 scientific publications was established moreover systematic constraining criteria 1983 2021 limiting the statistical study to 93 scientific publications were carried out variance analysis anova 2 ways and principal component analysis pca were used to identify the most influential wastewater treatment typology and parameters affecting viral removal bibliometric results showed that at least 25 of the studies on viral removal from wastewater corresponded to the last 2 years therefore sars cov 2 was approached in a particular way thus more than 15 viruses and or genotypes and more than 20 specific non specific technologies for viral removal were statistically analyzed results did not report significant differences p 0 05 of log removal virus lrv between specific e g mbr chlorination and non specific e g activated sludge anaerobic digestion technologies however mbr specific and anaerobic digestion non specific reported the highest viral removal efficiencies sars cov 2 has been reported to be removed by specific and non specific technologies but it is not conclusive preliminary statistical approximations establish that the physicochemical parameters cod tss ph from wastewater could influence the viral removal future challenges should focus on operational improvements new technology development and regulation recycling discharge assuming potential risks human environment keywords bibliometric statistical sars cov 2 wastewater viruses treatment technologies solids 1 introduction about 4 5 billion people worldwide do not have sanitation collection treatment discharge reaching large gaps between developed 60 and developing 20 countries 1 2 this scenario is made more complex by the water scarcity that in 2016 affected 32 5 of the world population 3 thus treated wastewater recycling emerges as an alternative water source for water scare areas 4 5 however both discharge and recycling of treated wastewater constitute a potential health risk due to its microbiological composition indeed wastewaters are rich environments that contain bacteria fungi protozoans and viruses 6 in specific viruses are excreted from human feces at rates between 105 and 1012 viral particles g of stool 7 human feces that end up in wastewater however viruses from other species such as animals plants fungi and bacteria can also be found within wastewater 8 thus wastewaters have reported a viral diversity constituted by norovirus nov rotavirus rv hepatitis a virus ha enterovirus ev adenovirus hadv among others 9 10 due to the variety of viruses in wastewater studies have been conducted to determine concentrations in both influent and effluent see table 1 in the case of norovirus 1 8 104 9 7 105 copies l astroviruses 13 7 103 1 2 108 copies l have been detected between 24 and 20 of environmental waters samples after wwtps wastewater treatment plants discharge 11 this could depend on the treatment technology typologies from wwtps effectively some studies have reported the presence of hepatitis a 1 86 107 copies l and norovirus gii 2 94 108 copies l from german wastewater effluents 12 131 another case is rotaviruses which have been detected 103 105 copies l in several south african wwtps 13 therefore the risk to public health from the discharge and recycling of treated wastewater is evident water has a direct influence on gastrointestinal diseases 20 million case years and related deaths 2 3 million persons year 9 10 in 2010 the world health organization who reported 600 million diseases and 420 000 deaths were caused by pathogens transmitted by food washed with untreated wastewater with 40 of the diseases occurring in children under five years of age 14 moreover given the relevance of diseases caused by viruses who has identified the top 10 threats to global health four of which are virus related such as pandemic influenza hiv dengue and ebola 132 emerging infectious diseases caused by new viruses are a significant concern worldwide some of them have affected several communities with significant outbreaks in the last 20 years such as sars during 2002 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ebola 2014 2016 swine flu h1n1 2009 2010 and zika virus 2015 2016 the latest coronavirus associated 2019 to present is the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 sars cov 2 virus which causes the covid 19 disease declared a pandemic in 2020 by who when analyzing the information on viral removal during the period 1983 2021 117 dates it is observed that the norovirus nov genus is one of the most studied representing 22 of the total data nov 7 nov gi 5 nov gii 9 nov giv 1 followed by the adenovirus genus with 19 enterovirus 14 and sars cov 2 with 12 these being the four most studied viruses in viral removal in wastewater worldwide see fig 1a in addition rotavirus hepatitis a viruses hepatitis e viruses among others have been studied see fig 1a noroviruses adenoviruses and enteroviruses date back to the 1950s and as time has progressed new variants have been discovered however the scientific community s interest in studying these genus stands out since they are the leading causes of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases affecting more frequently children under five years of age of low socioeconomic levels 15 the four most studied viruses are relevant due to the clinical pictures they can generate in the case of noroviruses ssrna that are genetically diverse have been made a new classification grouped into ten genogroups gi gx and 49 genotypes this virus is mainly associated with acute gastroenteritis 16 nov infections are mainly spread by the fecal oral route with person to person transmission ingestion of contaminated food or water or through contact with contaminated surfaces 17 the genogroups that cause disease in humans are gi gii and giv 18 which are found in wastewater see fig 1a the human adenoviruses dna viruses are associated with gastrointestinal neurological ophthalmological and genitourinary diseases 19 eighty eight different types of hadv have been identified and classified into seven species a g where 57 hadv belong to species d 20 the main pathway of transmission is by contact with water containing adenoviruses or from person to person 21 adenoviruses are a standard viral indicator of human fecal contamination in drinking water and wastewater treatment 22 in addition hadv can remain stable and persist to wastewater treatment with a persistence of 132 days in wastewater 22 the enteroviruses ev are rna viruses can cause a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from meningitis myocarditis respiratory and gastrointestinal infections 23 the ev can be transmitted by contact with contaminated secretions or surfaces a total of 106 enteroviruses infect humans and are grouped into four species a d with species b containing the highest number 59 24 the scientific community s interest in studying these genus stands out since they are the leading causes of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases affecting more frequently children under five years of age of low socioeconomic levels 15 24 the fourth most studied virus corresponds to sars cov 2 with 12 its appearance in december 2019 gives rise to covid 19 disease which became pandemic in march 2020 sars cov 2 causes multi system dysfunction and new evidence suggests it is a vascular and not respiratory disease which plays an essential role in defining treatments for infected persons 25 in addition new variants of sars cov 2 have been found circulating in the community that is of interest to who such as alpha kappa delta gamma and mu variants 26 new variants there has been an increase in studies focused on determining the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater and wwtps it allows evaluating the spread of the virus virus circulation and even to determine the variants circulating in the community 27 130 thus most of its studies on wastewater have focused on using it as an epidemiological indicator epidemiology based on wastewater thus viruses from wastewater are the most dangerous since some of them remain active from weeks to months under suitable aqueous environments 28 sars cov 2 causes the covid 19 disease which is classified as a pandemic by the who since 2019 has been reported in wastewater around of world 27 due to the diversity of shapes sizes and types of genetic material the baltimore classification groups viruses according to their genetic material and replication strategy this classification considers seven groups group i dsdna e g adenoviruses herpesviruses poxviruses group ii ssdna e g parvoviruses group iii dsrna e g rotaviruses rheoviridae group iv ssrna hepatitis viruses sars yellow fever group v ssrna ebola rabies viruses flu viruses group vi ssrna rt hiv aids group vii dsdna rt hepatitis b viruses according to the baltimore classification see fig 1b when analyzing the viruses studied in wastewater plants 1983 2020 the most studied viruses with 64 7 correspond to group iv group i with 17 6 the other two groups studied are iii 11 8 and ii 5 9 it is not surprising that group iv will be one of the most studied since it considers viruses such as hepatitis norovirus enterovirus and sars cov 2 in group i adenovirus hadv polyomavirus and bacteriophages t4 and group iii includes rotavirus and reovirus and finally in group ii which groups viruses such as torque teno virus ttv groups iv and i include the viruses with the highest percentage of viral removal publications due to the public health problems they have generated at different times related to how the viruses replicate in addition group iv can be directly translated that is its viral replication is faster while group i depends on the characteristics of the host 29 in recent years there has been an increased interest in studying the behavior and viruses removal from wastewater for the potential recycling of treated wastewater impact on aquatic ecosystems and epidemiological surveillance the analysis of the state of the art indicates that there has been an increased interest in studying the behavior and removal of viruses present in municipal domestic wastewater since the goal is to reuse wastewater soon and wastewater based epidemiology studies during current pandemic in specific due to the increased interest in safe recycling and viral removal the objective of our work was to evaluate the influence of wastewater treatment technologies on virus removal 2 methodology 2 1 information sources bibliometric analysis was carried out using the scientific journal repository scopus from elsevier joint appearances of two independent keywords within one or more scientific publications referring to the same study topic were established 30 31 thus co occurrence analysis searching wastewater and treatment and of and virus and removal and considering abstract keywords title within publications was used this analysis was limited to 1983 2021 working with 698 scientific publications and delimiting items with a minimum number of occurrences of a keyword of 5 the inclusion of as a keyword intended to limit publications that related treatment and viral removal however its use did not ultimately influence the publications number selected by scopus systematic statistical analyses were carried out using the directly scientific journal repository science direct criteria constraints considering temporality wastewater type virus among others are described in table 1 keywords such as viral removal efficiency wastewater treatment viral removal and viruses were used to generate a robust database the exploring phase recovered 70 017 scientific publications meanwhile the confirmation phase limited the systematic analysis to 93 scientific publications table 2 2 2 processing information bibliometric analysis establishing co occurrence network although vos viewer version 1 6 16 from scopus database was evaluated the co occurrence is defined as the joint appearances of two independent terms within one or several publications references to the same subject of study in order to understand visualize the scientific information available on the web 30 31 finally co occurrence maps size of each node appearance co occurrence which connect different topics were obtained in this work two groups of technologies were defined to carry out the comparative analyses specific technologies are those whose main objective is to remove pathogens as opposed to non specific technologies which help to remove pathogens but are not their primary objective systematic statistical analysis two way anova test to stablish significant differences p 0 05 between types of technologies specific s non specific ns and virus baltimore scale respect to virus removal lrv or log removal virus were determined previously database was subjected to normality shapiro wilks s test and variance homogeneity f test then parametric bonferroni test and non parametric kruskal wallis test analysis were used according to homoscedasticity of the database systematic statistical analysis pca or principal component analysis to identify correlation between control environmental operational parameters from treatment technologies and viruses removal were stablished this exploratory method was chosen because it does not require a specific probability distribution for its analysis thus positive ɵ 0 negative ɵ 180 and no correlation ɵ 90 between parameters were determined meanwhile originpro 2020b version 2021 software for statistical analysis was used 3 result and discussion 3 1 state of the art of viruses removal from wastewater treatment technologies fig 2 resumes the bibliometric analysis temporal evolution co occurrence keywords of viruses removal from wastewater treatment technologies using scientific publications 1983 2021 in this research co occurrence analysis reported about 6306 keywords with 777 items of them that meet the threshold of minimum 5 occurrences these items were grouped in 7 clusters influenced by items such as wastewater treatment occur 412 cluster 1 197 items nonhuman occur 264 cluster 2 165 items bacteria microorganisms occur 118 cluster 3 120 items viruses occur 305 cluster 4 110 items concentration composition occur 50 cluster 5 87 items wastewater occur 277 cluster 6 74 items and risk assessment occur 45 cluster 7 24 items therefore topics items related with wastewater treatment and microorganisms covered least at 76 of reported keywords regarding viral genres researches have focused on some such as sapovirus occur 13 jc virus occur 7 coliphages occur 44 enterovirus occur 83 norovirus occur 82 poliomyelitis occur 22 hepatitis occur 37 adenovirus occur 87 and coronavirus occur 158 specifically sars cov 2 occur 136 has been approached as sars cov 2 sars coronavirus covid 19 severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019 in these last 2 years in relation to the technologies studied both specific and non specific have been used in general few non specific technologies have been reported highlighting activated sludge occur 143 lagoon ponds occur 16 and sequency batch reactor occur 11 however a wide variety of specific technologies methods have been studied mentioning membrane filter bioreactor occur 164 reverse osmosis occur 23 electro coagulation occur 31 ozonation ozonization occur 41 ultraviolet photolysis occur 75 chlorination occur 80 activated carbon occur 30 and electrochemical methods occur 5 finally virus risk assessment occur 146 has also been widely addressed by publications in short the research in this area has focused mainly on evaluating or testing specific and non specific technologies for viruses removal specifying viral genders with focus on public health recycling discharge on other hand the time evolution of studies related with virus removal from wastewater have reported a lineal growth 1 19 year with 20 scientific publications concentrated during 2003 2010 in this period reseaches about severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov were the most common meanwhile about 80 remaining scientific publications were associated the last decade with 25 of them published during 2020 2021 because mainly of sars cov 2 effectively the interest evaluating virus mainly sars cov 2 has increased in the last 2 years on the one hand the potential of influents as a sars cov 2 epidemiological indicator wastewater based epidemiology have been evaluated indeed related studies 487 scientific publications have been carried out in more than 10 countries standing out australia japan slovenia united states france netherlands ecuador chile italy spain belgium and china 32 47 in this sense detection methods and mathematical models have been evaluated in order to study its prevalence 41 48 moreover researches evaluating the potential health risk of aerosols from influents containing sars cov 2 in toilets and wwtps has been discussed 49 on the other hand effluents discharged into water bodies or recycled in irrigation has also been into account when assessing public health risks 50 51 thus sars cov 2 removal studies within wwtps are being evaluated in various countries around the world such as chile india canada saudi arabia japan thailand iran united states among others 43 52 59 fig 3 describes bibliometric analysis of scientific publications respect to geographic location wastewater type and wastewater technology categories specific non specific in specific viruses studies have been carried out mainly in europe and north america with 32 and 27 respectively see fig 3a the rest of the continents asia south america oceania africa does not exceed 41 of related studies the researches have been focused mainly on municipal 81 domestic 7 sludge 9 livestock 2 and hospital 1 wastewaters see fig 3b regarding to the technologies used about 61 of the technologies studied in the virus removal are specific mainly related with ultraviolet light uv 18 chloration chl 16 and membrane bioreactor mbr 39 see fig 3c e meanwhile the remaining 39 related to non specific technologies have focused mainly on evaluating activated sludge as 46 anaerobic rectors and 12 and lagoons ls 10 see fig 3c d gaps economics that condition sanitation coverage between developed 82 and developing countries 25 could be influencing the virus removal research from wastewater 2 moreover intensive virus research on wastewater in developed countries would also be mobilized by local regulations recycling discharge indeed highly agricultural areas e g california and florida in the united states have forced to recover wastewater irrigation being also regulated by viral contamination 60 moreover water stress and water pollution in european continent for more than 4 decades has motivated the municipal wastewater reclamation 61 63 current covid 19 pandemic has returned to alert again about the presence of sars cov 2 and other viruses in irrigation of wastewater reclamation 64 furthermore an emerging interest in developing countries would be influenced by the promising advances in wastewater based epidemiology especially in decentralized contexts 65 moreover triggered by the high incidence rates of viral waterborne diseases e g diarrhea dengue and population consequent death 2 million persons year 66 municipal domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been extensively studied as a source of viral contamination in fact activated sludge technologies as non specific technology by its antiquity 100 years and massiveness are the most used within wwtps however these technologies do not ensure the removal of the entire viral spectrum mainly coliphages 67 68 the current covid 19 pandemic has reported effluents from activated sludge processes are not always free of sars cov 2 57 69 70 these antecedents have opened an opportunity for specific wastewater treatment technologies in the last 5 years specific technologies for virus removal based mainly on filtration 30 chemical disinfection 20 and adsorption 4 have been extensively studied 6 membrane bioreactors anmbr aembr filtration have been mainly studied by their superiority over conventional treatments i e activated sludge and potential escalation 6 71 moreover mbrs have demonstrated to remove a wide variety of virus such as ms 2 t4 adenovirus norovirus gi and gii enterovirus sapovirus rotavirus coliphages among others 71 recent studies on full scale mbr have showed that sars cov 2 can be removed by this technology 50 however the most used specific technology within wwtps is the chemical disinfection by chlorination the use of chlorination disinfection is one of the most widely used methods within wwtps due to its simple application high inactivation capacity and low application cost 72 contrary to mbr use one of the disadvantages is membrane fouling which significantly reduces membrane performance and lifetime increasing maintenance and operation costs 73 bibliographic studies report that free chloride enteroviruses coxsackie virus and monochloramine adenoviruses have selectivity to the viral genre requiring adjustments in contact time and dose depending on virus genre 74 therefore wwtps are likely to selectively remove certain viruses including sars cov 2 indeed the use of sodium hypochlorite free chloride in municipal wastewater has reported to remove sars cov 2 75 all these precedents reveal how the research in the viruses removal from wastewater has been conditioned by health sanitation but also with an overview to safe wastewater reclamation in irrigation 3 2 influence of wastewater treatment technology on viruses removal fig 4 details the influence of wastewater treatment technology on virus removal considering categories of wastewater treatment technologies specific non specific technologies and viral genre the statistical analysis on bibliography information determined that specific specific non specific and non specific technologies reached average lrv of 2 81 2 22 and 2 27 respectively see fig 4b therefore no significant differences p 0 05 between wastewater treatment technology categories were reported nevertheless the biggest representatives specific technologies mbr chl uv registered average lrv of 3 56 2 08 and 1 48 respectively see fig 4a in this case significant differences p 0 05 between them were obtained being mbr the most efficient specific treatment technology that removes viruses on the other hand the biggest representatives non specific technologies as and ls reported average lrv of 2 23 3 43 and 0 90 respectively see fig 4c therefore significant differences p 0 05 between them were obtained nevertheless and was the most efficient non specific wastewater treatment technology evaluated comparing the most efficient technologies of each category it is possible to mention that there were not significant differences p 0 05 between them however mbr was up to 4 more efficient than and moreover the most used technologies within wwtps i e as and chl did not show significant differences p 0 05 between them but both technologies were up to about 42 less efficient than mbr and and the removal of the 3 most reported viral genres adenoviruses enteroviruses and norovirus genotypes from wastewater by both categories specific non specific is showed in fig 4d on the one hand no significant differences p 0 05 between specific lrv 3 10 and non specific lrv 2 22 technologies were reported for adenovirus hadv removal enterovirus ev also did not register significant differences p 0 05 between specific lrv 2 10 and non specific lrv 2 08 technologies however the average lrvs for norovirus genotypes nov nov gi nov gii and nov giv showed significant differences p 0 05 between specific lrv 2 93 and non specific lrv 1 17 technologies therefore the viral removal hierarchy in both wastewater treatment technology categories was as follow hadvs novs hadvnon s evs evnon s novnon s in summary specific technologies had better performance than non specific technologies but it was not significant except in the removal of nov genotypes conventional wwtps are made up of a stage primary screening and settling secondary activated sludge or anaerobic digestion and or tertiary disinfection by chlorination or uv although wwtps have disinfection stage specific technologies some of them especially in decentralized areas only reach secondary treatment therefore non specific technologies i e activated sludge anaerobic digestion are usually the final stage in some geographical zones before discharge on water bodies or irrigation recycling activated sludge as uses aerobic heterotrophic microorganisms forming flocs which remove viruses by adsorption 76 indeed this technology has demonstrated to remove a wide variety of viral genres ev nov hadv cs ms2 plv aiv jc sav csm ttv among others but at lrv ranges from 0 6 to 4 24 13 42 76 89 its study if it has focused on the evaluation of bacteriophages ms2 coliphage and t4 phage because they infect bacteria within as being also able to have applications in the control of bulking foaming resistant bacteria and potential disinfection 90 however operational imbalances ph organic loading dissolved oxygen make this technology unstable with respect to viral removal 68 indeed sars cov 2 has been monitored within as around the world being not detected in some and in others remaining in the effluent 39 52 59 91 anaerobic digestion and with its technologies uasb tubular domo biodigester among others are one of the most applied treatment methods after activated sludge mainly in tropical areas or emerging countries 92 93 viruses are removed within anaerobic processes although thermic inactivation 45 c 66 these technologies have reported viruses removal at lrv between 0 45 and 6 0 studying genres such as coliphages ev and plv 66 94 95 very few studies have evaluated the anaerobic digesters performance during the covid 19 pandemic however uasb in india has been monitored 57 however the variability of its performance could be influenced by its thermal typology psychrophilic mesophilic thermophilic the survival rates of encapsulated non encapsulated viruses e g coronavirus phi6 have been reported to decrease with increasing temperature 96 indeed temperature is largely known as the major factor determining virus inactivation 97 thus sars cov 2 in different surfaces repots up to 2 7 days at 20 c being reduced at hours under temperatures higher than 40 c 98 some viruses i e sars cov 2 has reported being removed within mesophilic uasb while others virus i e enteroviruses noroviruses have not been efficiently removed within psychrophilic uasb 57 94 moreover thermophilic conditions in anaerobic processes have reported viruses inactivation until 3 times higher than mesophilic treatment mainly for animal viruses and bacteriophages 99 therefore the main virus inactivation mechanism by anaerobic technologies is temperature conventional specific technologies such as disinfection using sodium hypochlorite free chloride are widely used within wwtps due its low cost and microbial inactivation 74 chlorine penetrates the microbial cellular membrane disintegrating extracellular lipids and making non functional intracellular enzymes and proteins thus this treatment method has been reported to be efficient removing viruses such as cfe nov genotypes cs ttv hadv asv ev jc rv and sav at lrv ranges from 0 25 and 4 85 82 87 100 102 however the chlorination is selective because it requires optimal dose and contact time depending on each pathogen effectively the center for diseases control and prevention from united states registers wide chlorine concentrations 0 1 1 0 mg l and contact times 0 07 12 72 min for the most frequent viral genres coxsackie genotypes echovirus hepatitis a poliovirus adenovirus and rotavirus in water wastewater 103 previous studies have reported that all sars viruses could be inactivated at chlorine concentrations higher than 0 5 mg l with 30 min of contact time 104 in fact sars cov 2 has been reported to be efficiently removed by chlorine at concentrations higher than 1 mg l exposure for 1 min 75 however its effectiveness is contrasted by its potential generation of toxic by products chloroform dichlorobromomethane monochlorodibromomethane and bromoform 105 this las aspect has opened the door to new specific technologies the most studied non conventional and specific technology is membrane bioreactor mbr for its proven efficacy removing viruses non selective and safety by not generating by products 71 membrane bioreactor anmbr aembr retains particles i e microorganisms with dimensions higher than their pore sizes filtration combined with aerated aembr or no aerated anmrb tanks that promote biodegradation 106 indeed mbrs have registered the best lrv with values between 0 2 and 6 8 for wide variety of viral genres ev hadv nov genotypes ms2 cs bf f rv sav t4 77 81 82 84 86 88 94 107 117 moreover sars cov 2 has been removed efficiently by mbr technologies 118 the membranes used in mbrs have a pore size between 0 1 and 10 μm microfiltration and between 5 and 100 nm ultrafiltration thus retaining protozoa 3 14 μm and bacteria that are larger than the pore size of each membrane 119 full scale mbrs in wwtps can remove viral load by 5 1 1 1 107 7 8 101 viruses l and 3 9 2 8 105 1 2 101 viruses l log units for enterovirus and norovirus gii respectively 117 specifically the mechanisms involved in virus removal within mbr is related to size exclusion adsorption and electrostatic repulsion independent of typology aembr anmbr 71 table 3 resumes the recent studies focused on the sars cov 2 removal from wwtps around the world between january 2020 and september 2021 has been monitored sar cov 2 within wwtps of almost 13 countries distributed in america 20 europe 27 asia 33 and africa 20 about 43 of the technologies monitored corresponds to activated sludge followed by chlorination 20 and uv 10 the rest of the technologies 27 correspond to mbr sbr and uasb the viral genome extraction method is variable standing ultrafiltration ultracentrifugation polyethylene glycol or peg and electronegative membrane vortex or emv on the one hand influents mainly from municipal domestic wastewater report values from 354 and 1 3 106 gc l being detected in most of the reported samples on the other hand 53 of the studies did not detect sars cov 2 in the effluent only 33 of studies detected sars cov 2 at values between 10 and 4 0 105 gc l physicochemical parameters from wastewater are only reported by one study therefore although some studies report the total removal of sars cov 2 this is no conclusive due to sanitary restrictions and limited study of each wwtp 3 3 influence of operational control and performance parameters on the virus s removal from wastewater fig 5 resumes the influence of operational parameters on the virus s removal from wastewater thus components related with dimension 1 pc1 and dimension 2 pc2 represented 61 4 and 18 7 of the database respectively that is the accumulated inertia or explained variance of the acp was acceptable and corresponding to 80 1 moreover grouping between the variables were observed according to the quadrants of the biplot in quadrant i lrv codinf codeff tssinf were grouped meanwhile in quadrant iv parameters such as q tsseff and phinf were observed only hrt was grouped in quadrant ii specifically results showed that codinf codeff hrt and tssinf are those that presented positive correlations ɵ 0 with lrv meanwhile no correlation ɵ 90 was stablished between q tsseff and lrv finally negative correlation ɵ 180 was founded between ph and lrv viruses have demonstrated to survive in different environment such as air soil food and water 120 in specific water and wastewater has been established as the means of greatest viral survival indeed coronavirus i e sar cov2 229e hcov have demonstrated to survive in tap water 2 12 days 20 23 c hospital domestic wastewater 14 days 4 c wang et al 2005 35 121 however other viruses non encapsulated fipv pv 1 have also reported different survival rates in tap water fipv 588 10 days 4 23 c pv 1 203 65 days 4 23 c and wastewaters fipv 2 days 23 c pv 1 10 days 23 c 121 122 although these results show that temperature is an influencing factor in viral survival there are additional factor that can condition it effectively tap water unfiltered has registered increases the viral survival between 2 and 7 days respect to tap water filtrated 121 therefore viruses increase their survival in the solids presence which they can adhere encapsulated viruses e g coronaviruses has more hydrophobicity of the viral envelope than non encapsulated e g polioviruses making them increase their adhesion to solids 121 municipal domestic wastewaters are rich environment in solids tss 250 and organic matter cod 200 mg l making them an ideal medium for survival 5 123 therefore primary and secondary stage within wwtps could be the most suitable route for its removal balboa et al 91 studying of fate of sars cov 2 within wwtps have reported inhibited negative detection genome in effluents from primary and secondary stage moreover authors registered a decrease in sars cov 2 from inhibited to negative when tss influent was decreased from 900 april 6 to 230 april 21 mg l parameters like cod have the same behavior because it is contained in the tss on the other hand ph is other environmental factor which could influence the viral survival in fact acid ph favors the virus adsorption on solids surface increasing its survival while that a high ph elute the adsorbed virus 124 indeed ph and virus morphology are among the essential parameter for pathogen inactivation it also indicates that there is no viral removal at neutral ph this means that viral removal is effective at acidic ph 80 cádiz et al 125 states that acid ph 3 00 and high temperature can reach values of up to 6 lrv which are considered the main factors of viral removal in wastewater while that neutral ph favors bacteriological growth therefore challenges in viral removal are not only related to new or improved technology but also to the knowledge of the dynamics of its behavior with respect to the wastewater physicochemical characteristics this aspect is even more relevant when understanding and improvising the predictive models of wastewater based epidemiology or recycling in irrigation 4 conclusions wastewaters are the main source of waterborne viral pathogens current covid 19 pandemic has revealed the risk of fecal oral transmission that wastewater has under direct contact by aspersion from toilet and wwtps or during irrigation recycling therefore wastewater treatment technologies emerge as one of the most effective preventive public health strategies the study of the art of viral removal from wastewater evidence a wide variety of specific non specific wastewater treatment technologies e g mbr chlorination uv activated sludge anaerobic digestion among others removing different viral genus noroviruses adenoviruses enteroviruses and sars cov 2 sanitation emergency have influenced the growth of knowledge which is evidenced by 80 of studies in the las decade conditioned by coronavirus epidemics only sar cov 2 already concentrates 25 of the bibliographic information reported moreover scientific interest has been concentrated in europe and united states with almost 60 of the studies reported economic gaps irrigation recycling regulations and currently wastewater based epidemiology are the main drivers almost 90 of the studies are focused on municipal domestic wastewater studying mainly specific technologies 61 but evaluating also full scale non specific technologies statistical analysis demonstrated that no significant differences p 0 05 between specific and non specific were founded however mbr specific technology lrv 3 56 and and non specific technology lrv 3 43 are the most efficient removing viruses the most used wastewater treatment technologies as non specific chl specific within wwtps were 42 less efficient than mbr and and only nov genotypes report significant p 0 05 removal differences between specific and non specific technologies sars cov 2 reports being removed by both specific and non specific technologies but even the information is not conclusive finally statistical results evidenced that tss and cod from wastewater register direct correlation between lrv while that ph reports indirect correlation in short the application of statistical analysis using robust bibliographic information 93 publications and comparing different treatment technologies for virus removal provides an alternative strategic decision making tool when defining the use of new technologies or improving existing ones for these proposes moreover if this analysis relates viruses

12984,final wastewater treatment plant effluent is widely recognised as a hazardous water source for human consumption as it may contain organic micropollutants and pathogens the advanced processes required to adequately remove them are costly and consequently it is crucial to investigate how the associated costs can be optimised one of the key treatment steps in the treatment train of the cape flats managed aquifer recharge mar water reclamation plant wrp is the advanced ozonation o3 treatment process the o3 process was assessed using the t10 and cstr methods the o3 toc dose ratio was used as the main parameter to compare and relate various o3 treatment objectives and assessment methods furthermore an o3 contact time optimisation was performed on the cape flats o3 process using capital and operation and maintenance o m costing models as well as process performance regression models the optimum contact time in terms of cost for 2 4 log virus inactivation by ozone and 1 3 log giardia inactivation by ozone was determined to be between 5 and 7 min by the cstr method and 5 min by the t10 method the optimum contact time in terms of cost for 1 3 log inactivation of cryptosporidium by ozone was determined to be between 8 and 18 min by the cstr method and between 6 and 13 min by the t10 method depending on the treatment objective and o3 transfer efficiency the o3 process of the cape flats mar wrp can theoretically reduce more than 87 of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wastewater treatment works wwtw final effluent keywords ozone optimization treatment efficiency o3

works λ the likelihood of a contaminant being above their standard μ the resulting consequence of consuming water containing levels of the contaminant above or below the standard 1 introduction in water treatment o3 is the second strongest oxidant after the hydroxyl radical oh 1 the most critical impact of o3 oxidation in water is the inactivation of pathogens i e pathogens and pollutants are attacked directly by o3 oxidation and indirectly by oh formed during the o3 decomposition process 2 the foundation of oxidation based disinfection processes in the united states us is the ct framework 3 the ct value is the product of residual o3 concentration c and contact time t the ct value developed by the us epa requires that for a specific log removal a stipulated ct value be maintained in the o3 system without a measurable ct value the quantification of bacteria and viruses inactivation are difficult and no inactivation of spore forming bacteria is achieved 3 furthermore chemical disinfection does not remove pathogens from the water but only inactivates them the inactivation level is a measure of the number of pathogens that are inactivated during disinfection and is quantified by the term log inactivation 4 o3 is becoming more popular for disinfection purposes as it can eliminate nearly all microorganisms including giardia and cryptosporidium 3 when o3 is injected into water a high initial uptake initial demand of o3 is commonly observed as it reacts with scavengers and readily reactive constituents in the water this initial demand is referred to as the instantaneous o3 demand iod 5 once the initial o3 demand is met an increase in the residual dissolved o3 concentration starts to occur the point at which an increase in o3 dosage results in an increase of the residual o3 concentration is defined as the o3 demand 2 consequently this residual o3 becomes a highly effective disinfectant over time residual o3 is the most critical parameter for disinfection as o3 oxidation is the primary pathway for the inactivation of pathogens 2 in contrast oh plays a relatively small role in the inactivation of resistant pathogens 6 the ct value is the foundation of oxidation based disinfection processes in the united states us 3 to achieve a specific log removal the ct value must be maintained throughout the system such that it complies with the requirements of the us epa log inactivation tables schulz et al 7 stipulate that the ct value be determined by the o3 residual values of the outlet of the o3 contact tank the t value in the ct concept is further defined to be the time it takes for 10 of particular concentration to pass through a contact basin otherwise called the t10 8 11 7 the t10 value is the hydraulic retention time multiplied by the baffling factor which accounts for flow short circuiting 9 maintaining a constant o3 residual at the end of the o3 contact tank can result in varying pathogen disinfection results this varying result occurs when the o3 residual is measured at the end of the contact tank as it takes a significant amount of time to notice a change in the o3 concentration due to a change in o3 dose or change in water quality subsequently allowing inefficiently disinfected lumps of water to pass through however this variation in disinfection efficiency is covered within the ct concept but can result in o3 overdosing 10 instead by measuring the residual o3 after the initial o3 demand phase the time required to adapt to the changes in flows can be reduced further preventing lumps of inefficiently disinfected water to escape o3 contact tanks can be divided into theoretical or physical chambers for the determination of the ct value in accordance with the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr from the us epa 8 furthermore the chambers partitions are distinguished by two types i a reactive chamber whereby o3 can react with the water and ii a dissolution chamber whereby o3 is dosed into the water dissolution chambers are further divided into i a co current o3 contact chamber in which the water and the gas bubbles flow in the same direction both upwards and ii into a counter current contact chamber in which the o3 bubbles flow upwards and the water downwards the ct value can be determined in four ways according to the lt2eswtr 8 the four ways are the t10 method the extended t10 method the cstr method and the extended cstr method however the current study focusses on the t10 and cstr methods with the following requirements i t10 method a no inactivation credit is given for the first dissolution chamber b the ct value can be calculated for the entire contact tank or for individual segments of the contact tank summed together c a decay test is recommended to determine t10 otherwise a baffling factor must be assumed ii cstr method a should be applied to each individual type of segment chamber b ideal to use when no tracer tests are available or when the contact tank has significant back mixing i e t10 hdt 5 where hdt hydraulic detention time selecting the most applicable ct value calculation method depends on i the availability of tracer test results hydraulic flow characterisation of the contact tank according to the us epa 8 lt2eswtr ii the configuration of the contact tank and iii the amount of process monitoring and analysis that a treatment plant plans to undertake when using the t10 method the dissolved o3 concentration c can be measured directly at the outlet of each contact chamber segment or alternatively determined indirectly by predicting the c value at the outlet of each contact chamber segment using the dissolved o3 concentration at the outlet of the contact tank lt2eswtr 2010 in general the t10 method underestimates the ct value obtained the ct value in its simplest form according to the t10 method can be determined with eq 1 1 8 1 1 t 10 ct value mg min l f baffling hdt c outlet where fbaffling baffling factor describing the baffling conditions of an o3 contact tank hdt hydraulic detention time coutlet residual o3 concentration at contact tank outlet the use of the cstr or extended cstr methods is recommended when no tracer studies are available additionally a combination of the ct value calculation methods can be used 8 in general the extended methods are more complex to use but can be programmed into a spreadsheet 8 in most cases the data from a tracer study used to quantify flow short circuiting for a specific tank i e t10 will not be available unless a pilot plant is built therefore the cstr method is useful when determining the ct value as it does not require the contact tank baffling factor which reduces the effective contact time used in the ct concept having a lower effective contact time reduces the ct value that is achievable at a specific ozone dose no tracer studies were available for the current study and a t10 hdt of 0 67 was used which is close to superior baffling conditions according to the baffling classification of the us epa 11 the choice of 0 67 for the t10 hdt is further strengthened by the lt2eswtr which found the t10 hdt or baffling factor which accounts for flow short circuiting to be 0 65 even in well baffled o3 contact tanks a correlation between the o3 dose required for disinfection and the o3 dose required for organic micropollutant oxidation exists and is influenced by the incoming total organic carbon toc concentration 3 the same o3 toc dose ratio produces similar organic micropollutant oxidation in different water matrices with high variations in water quality 3 furthermore the o3 toc dose ratio relates the o3 dose required for disinfection to the o3 dose required for organic micropollutant oxidation as shown in eqs 2 1 to 2 4 12 o3 decay in secondary effluent or in water with high dissolved organic matter is categorised by two energetically different stages 3 the first stage is a short typically 30s o3 demand phase in which o3 is quickly consumed caused by the instantaneous o3 demand iod the iod is influenced by organic matter and the decay rate can be predicted by second order kinetics 13 in the second stage after the initial period the decay rate resembles first order kinetics 14 furthermore the rate constant of the dissolved residual o3 decay decreases with a higher o3 dose during the second stage 5 conceptual level capital and operation and maintenance o m costing models linked to the flow and the o3 toc dose ratio defined by the american association of cost estimation as class 4 planning level is the foundation for cost optimization through the development of a 20 year life cycle cost lcc cash flow the costing models are designed to be used as a basis for comparison and they yield accuracies between 30 50 the foundation to estimate the removal of organic micropollutants is the o3 toc dose ratio and the o3 and oh reaction rates for each pollutant the primary objectives of the current study are to i investigate whether an optimum o3 contact time exists for which the present value pv of the 20 year discounted cash flow cost of the o3 system is at its lowest ii group the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wwtw final effluent based on their o3 and hydroxyl radical oh reaction rates iii estimate the presence of organic micropollutants in the final effluent of the cape flats wwtw before and after treatment with the o3 process based on removal prediction models and iv rate the safety of the water with a water quality risk analysis the four objectives above have the collective aim to provide a framework which can be applied to future projects to determine the optimum contact time ct as well as identify potential risks to water quality 2 methods and models 2 1 case study cape flats mar wrp the city of cape town experienced four years of water shortages 2015 2018 mainly due to a continuous 3 year drought 2015 2017 which represented a 1 400 year drought 15 and urbanisation resulting in increased water demand in response to the water shortages the city of cape town identified the managed aquifer recharge mar scheme of the cape flats aquifer as a viable alternative water source the cape flats mar water reclamation plant wrp forms part of the cape flats aquifer potable reuse scheme an indirect potable reuse scheme which will inject treated secondary effluent into the cape flats aquifer one of the most critical treatment processes in the cape flats mar wrp is the o3 biological active carbon o3 bac filtration process 16 the o3 bac filtration process is an essential step in this reuse scheme to remove pathogens and micro organics provided it can be applied and operated correctly the o3 process is also the most cost intensive process due to energy and liquid oxygen costs in the cape flats mar wrp treatment train therefore this treatment process is critical but costly and raises concerns about how the o3 bac process can be customised with regard to treatment objectives and optimised with regard to cost towards generating safe drinking water as part of a reuse treatment train 2 2 wastewater treatment facility the proposed site for the new cape flats mar wrp is situated within the boundaries of the existing cape flats wwtw the cape flats wwtw treats settled sewage through 4 process trains each train consists of two biological reactors and secondary settling tanks the cape flats wwtw consists of a 5 stage modified bardenpho activated sludge process furthermore the wwtw can be operated with or without primary settling tanks final treatment is achieved using an extensive maturation pond system however the wrp will abstract secondary settling tank effluent before the ponds a layout of the cape flats wwtw and wrp are presented in fig 2 1 2 3 water quality data two samples containing organic micropollutants were taken the first sample consisted of effluent from a maturation pond pond s4 taken when the reclamation plant planned to extract final effluent from the ponds the second sample consisted of sst effluent from reactors c and d the following water quality datasets were used i an organic micropollutant grab sample of effluent from pond s4 on 24 february 2018 analysed by eurofins and ii an organic micropollutant two hourly flow weighted sample of effluent from the ssts of reactors c and d on 1 december 2019 analysed by eurofins table 2 1 shows the list of organic micropollutant groups measured and includes their corresponding testing method the water quality tests were conducted to detect the organic micropollutants present in the cape flats wwtw final effluent see table 2 1 the number of organic micropollutants detected was 112 after the organic pollutants were detected the o3 and hydroxyl radical second order reaction rates o3 ko3 and koh for each of the organic micropollutants detected in the cape flats wwtw final effluent were identified values were found for 63 of the organic micropollutants and were arranged into five groups it is empirical to note that the reaction rate for organic micropollutants changes with ph however the reaction rate ph values were not considered as they lay outside the study s scope the water quality i e the organic micropollutants was assessed using the quality standards monitoring trigger level prescribed by the california state water resources control board 17 nine of the measured organic micropollutants were above their limit when compared with their respective standard table 2 2 summarises the maximum value detected of each organic micropollutant above the standard the standard limit and the minimum reduction required to be within the water quality standard 2 4 model equations a model was developed by gerrity et al 5 to predict the residual o3 concentrations in secondary and tertiary wastewater effluent and is shown in eq 2 1 as a function of the o3 dose concentration the toc concentration the iod time and the decay constant k table 2 3 shows typical values for the constants used 2 1 o zone residual mg l o 3 toc toc iod e kt eq 2 2 gives the ct value as a function of time toc iod and o3 dose as defined by gerrity et al 5 furthermore k is used to describe the dissolved residual o3 decay rate in eq 2 2 typical values for k and iod used for the wastewater characteristics of gerrity et al 5 are shown in table 2 3 2 2 o 3 ct mg min l o 3 toc toc iod k 1 e kt snyder et al 3 found that the ability of o3 to oxidise contaminants when compared to the hydroxyl radical oh varies depending on the contaminant in consideration these distinctions motivated snyder et al 3 to group organic micropollutants based on their mode of oxidation as a result they noticed that some contaminants are very susceptible to both o3 and oh oxidation others to only o3 oxidation or to oh oxidation and some neither to o3 nor oh oxidation 3 furthermore they found that for secondary effluent type water with higher organic matter concentrations oh forms rapidly from the reaction between o3 and organic matter therefore if all the groups are to be oxidised the o3 process must provide very high o3 dosages and high oh exposure table 2 4 shows the o3 and oh reaction rates applicable to each group including the o3 dosage ratio required for removal the removal efficiency achievable the method of removal and the number of organic micropollutants present in each group with the organic micropollutants o3 and oh second order reaction rates k values known the pollutants of table 2 2 were grouped as described in table 2 4 and shown in table 2 5 for 1 7 dimethylxanthine no reaction rate was found and thus no group was attached to this micropollutant the organic micropollutants groups found to be above their standard in the cape flats wwtw final effluent were groups 1 2 3 and 5 interestingly no group 4 micropollutants were found to be above their standard snyder et al 3 found that the same o3 toc dosage ratio produces similar results even with different ct values and high variations in water quality this makes the o3 toc dose ratio a particularly useful measure of organic micropollutant oxidation similarly uvabsorbance254 uva254 changes occurred at the same o3 dose ratio in different wastewater effluents snyder et al 3 further explained that o3 is highly effective in improving the visible colour of water measured by uvabsorbance at 436nm uvabsorbance can be measured in the visible light range of 436 nm or the invisible light range of 254 nm however in some cases they found that regardless of the o3 dose the relative improvement of measurements in the visible light spectrum were the same while the improvement of uvabsorbance due to the o3 process appears satisfactory in the visible light range the actual improvement measured in the invisible light range uva254 is significantly less consequently they concluded that the relative improvement in uv absorbance at 254 nm due to the o3 process remains the preferred way to assess the process efficacy and determine the optimum o3 dose snyder et al 34 proposed eq 2 3 to describe the uva254 improvement uva254 due to the o3 process based on the o3 toc dose ratio applied to the filtered final effluent 2 3 uv 254 100 0 5077 o 3 toc 0 5968 r 2 0 92 furthermore the link between uva254 and the removal of specific organic micropollutants is described by eq 2 4 34 2 4 1 c c 0 100 slope 1 uv uv 0 100 intercept where c0 organic micropollutant concentration before treatment c organic micropollutant concentration after treatment uv0 uva254 before treatment uv uva254 after treatment slope see snyder et al 34 intercept see snyder et al 34 in contrast it should further be noted that predicting the o3 oxidation of organic micropollutants is difficult when treating wastewater given the difficulty to quantify o3 and hydroxyl radical exposure during the rapid initial phase 32 the effectiveness of removing organic compounds with o3 significantly depends on the time and concentration of o3 and oh exposure i e the ct value 3 2 5 optimum contact time model the model used to assess whether there is an optimum o3 contact time in terms of capital and o m costs for the o3 disinfection process is discussed below in particular the research focused on the cstr method and the t 10 method the cstr method is described as an integrated approach and is implemented by dividing the o3 contact tank into segments and then measuring the residual o3 for each segment the residual o3 is then multiplied by the time it takes for the water to flow between virtual segments t fig 2 2 shows an example of an o3 decay curve through an o3 contact tank the blue columns in fig 2 2 represent the virtual t 1 min segments of the o3 contact tank when using the cstr method the t10 method eq 1 1 determines the ct value as the product of the total effective contact time and the residual o3 at the end of the contact tank for the entire contact tank depicted by the orange block in fig 2 2 an alternative use of the t10 method is to sum up the ct products of the individual segments of the contact tank similar to the cstr method however the t10 method implemented here is for the entire contact tank furthermore the o3 toc dose ratio for the two process performance validation methods t10 and cstr are calculated with the equations listed in table 2 6 2 6 low cost point a life cycle costs lcc analysis was done to find the lowest cost point optimal in terms of cost between residual o3 concentration c and o3 contact time t using the ct concept the longer the contact time t the higher the cost of the contact tank in contrast the larger the residual o3 concentration c the higher the o3 equipment capital and o m costs lccs are calculated as current present value pv costs year 2020 rand using the discounted cash flow method over the project lifetime of 20 years as presented by van dijk and van vuuren 35 the pv lcc calculations were done in microsoft excel using the excel functions as described in sections 4 2 and 4 6 of blank and tarquin 36 for present worth analysis of equal life alternatives for two or more alternatives the method accounts for the capital cost in the first year which is annualised and then added to the annual o m cost for the rest of the 20 years furthermore a discount rate of 6 was used which is similar to the average annual south african inflation rate since 2009 of 5 35 37 to compare the different treatment alternatives for a 40mld treatment plant the o3 contact tank baffling factor also plays a role in the ct value credited to the o3 disinfection process for the current study a baffling factor of 0 67 was used which implies superior flow distribution baffling according to us epa 11 a summary of the pv lcc input parameters is given in table 2 7 the objective of ozonation can be to target viruses giardia or cryptosporidium separately or as a combination of them for the low cost point investigation the disinfection objectives listed in table 2 8 were used but with 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation ct 22 5 mg min l being the base case the o3 dose for disinfection was determined as the product of the highest residual o3 concentration and the effective contact time ct value as required to achieve the log removal selected in table 2 8 table 2 9 presents the cost

adapt the cost functions for various contact times other than 5 min a cost function for contact times other than 5 min was derived and is shown in fig 2 3 various factors influence the o3 process nonetheless the factors focused on were the instantaneous o3 demand iod and the o3 decay rate k the o3 decay rate k is influenced by the o3 dose ratio o3 toc as is evident from the respective k values at the three ozone dose ratios of 0 5 1 1 and 1 7 o3 toc shown in table 2 3 to assess the performance of the o3 treatment process the iod and o3 decay factors k factors presented in table 2 3 were used these factors were selected as the water quality for which they were determined closely matched the water quality of the filtered cape flats final effluent there is a relationship between the iod and k factors and their corresponding o3 toc dose ratio see table 2 3 eq 2 7 gives the adopted third order polynomial regression function and the relationship between the o3 toc dose ratio and the iod

using the cstr method and the t10 method of table 2 6 2 7 organic micropollutant water quality risk assessment model the model used to conduct a water quality risk assessment of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wwtw final effluent was split into two phases the first phase was to determine the predicted removal of the organic micropollutants the second phase was to conduct a water quality risk profile on the identified organic micropollutants to indicate the water quality risk before and after organic micropollutant removal with the o3 process to predict the removal of contaminants using the o3 process the method proposed by snyder et al 34 see eqs 2 3 to 2 4 was implemented the steps to determine the percentage of an organic micropollutant that can be removed are described by the following steps 1 determine organic micropollutant target group table 2 5 2 determine o 3 toc from table 2 4 3 determine uva254 with eq 2 3 4 determine indication of removed with eq 2

effluent of the cape flats wwtw and post treated water contains the residual organic micropollutants that remain after removal with the o3 process determined according to the steps above the water quality of the cape flats wwtw was evaluated against two criteria firstly the likelihood λ of a contaminant being above their standard and secondly the resulting consequence μ of consuming water containing levels of the contaminant above or below the standard for instance when a contaminant is below the standard it is deemed to have a moderate impact i e a minor impact for a large population table 2 12 the evaluation was done by rating an organic micropollutant according to the definitions of table 2 12 which gives λ and μ a score according to the score column the risk profile score is then obtained with the multiplication product of the λ and μ score the risk profile score categorises the risk rating on a risk profile according to table 2 13 the categories are no risk λ μ 1 low risk 1 λ μ 19 medium risk 19 λ μ 60 or high risk λ μ 60 the possible outcomes of the λ and μ multiplication product and the associated risk profile are shown in table 2 14 when the concentration of an organic micropollutant is over the standard the λ is scored almost certain and the μ is scored moderate giving it a medium risk profile if the μ of the organic micropollutant is still over its standard after treatment it is scored as above i e λ almost certain and μ moderate if the concentration of the organic micropollutant is below its standard after treatment the λ is scored unlikely and μ is scored moderate giving it a low risk profile the treatment parameters that are used in the risk assessment to predict the removal of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats filtered final effluent are presented in table 2 11 3 results and discussion 3 1 low cost point results the results are first presented in figs 3 1 to 3 4 for the base case a treatment objective of 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation with ct 22 5 mg min l and then for the other treatment objectives presented in table 2 8 in figs 3 5 and 3 6 evaluated according to the cstr and t10 method the results are valid for the parameters in table 2 7 using the cost equations of table 2 9 and the model described in section 2 6 the results are shown for an o3 transfer efficiency of 98 and 90 for the cstr method fig 3 1 gives the o3 toc ratio at various o3 contact times all required to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation fig 3 2 in turn gives the 20 year pv lcc associated with achieving 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation by using the cstr method the o3 toc dose ratio as determined by the cstr method in fig 3 1 reduces as the o3 contact time increases from 4 to 14 min after which the o3 toc dose ratio starts to plateau this plateau effect after 14 min contact time could be attributed to an equal impact of increased contact time and increasing o3 decay factor k on the o3 toc dose ratio the o3 toc dose ratio and contact time directly affect the capital cost through fig 2 3 and eq 2 5 and the o m cost through eq 2 6 as can be seen in fig 3 2 like the o3 toc dose ratio there is initially a pv lcc benefit to increase the o3 contact time from 4 to 14 min after which the benefit starts to diminish between a contact time of 4 14 min the relatively small capital cost to increase the o3 contact tank in comparison to the o m costs increases the t value contact time in the ct value which reduces the required c value residual o3 concentration required to achieve 22 5 mg min l and indirectly the pv lcc furthermore fig 3 2 reveals that the optimum contact time to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation with the cstr method is also 14 min with a negligible drop in cost after 14 min of contact time by directly comparing to the cstr method fig 3 3 gives the o3 toc ratio as determined by the t10 method at various o3 contact times required to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation fig 3 4 in turn shows the 20 year pv lcc associated with achieving 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation fig 3 3 shows that for the t10 method the lowest o3 toc dose ratios are between 12 and 16 min of o3 contact time between contact times of 4 12 min the o3 toc dose ratio drops due to the increased contact time t value on the ct value which governs the o3 toc dose ratio required whereas for contact times greater than 16 min the o3 toc dose ratio starts to rise again due to the greater effect of o3 decay as compared to contact time on the ct value which then starts to govern the o3 toc dose ratio required fig 3 4 further reveals that the optimal 20 year pv lcc point to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation is 12 min of contact time similar to the cstr method there is an initial benefit in pv lcc to increase the o3 contact time from 4 to 12 min however increasing the contact time further than 16 min reduces the pv lcc benefit of an increased contact time regarding the other treatment objectives table 2 8 the optimum contact times in terms of the lowest 20 year pv lcc are shown in fig 3 5 as determined by using the cstr method and fig 3 6 as determined by using the t10 method furthermore contact times below 5 min were not considered and the results are valid for the different conditions outlined in table 2 7 fig 3 5 reveals that the optimum contact time for 2 to 4 log virus inactivation by o3 including 1 to 3 log giardia inactivation by o3 lies between 5 and 7 min depending on the transfer efficiency determined using the cstr method in contrast the optimum contact time for 1 to 3 log inactivation of cryptosporidium lies between 8 and 18 min depending on the o3 transfer efficiency fig 3 6 presents the optimum contact times as determined by the t10 method and shows that for 2 to 4 log virus inactivation and 1 to 3 log giardia inactivation the optimum contact time lies at 5 min furthermore the optimum contact time for 1 to 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation lies between 6 and 13 min depending on the o3 transfer efficiency in general the cstr method requires longer o3 contact times and lower o3 toc dose ratios than the t10 method which requires shorter o3 contact times and higher o3 toc dose ratios it is critical to note that the optimum contact times observed in the results are only applicable to the o3 decay rates the iod and the parameters used for the evaluation in this study a summary of the optimum contact times found in the study is presented in table 3 1 even though the optimum contact times of the t10 method are lower compared to the cstr method the cstr method results in lower o3 toc dosing ratios see fig 3 1 and lower pv lccs see fig 3 2 if compared to the t10 method see figs 3 3 and 3 4 this observation shows that the o3 toc dosing ratio or o3 dose have a greater influence on the pv lcc in the form of capital and o m costs as compared to the capital cost implication of a larger contact tank 3 2 water quality risk analysis results the water quality risk analysis focused on the organic micropollutants that were above the recommended standard table 2 2 table 3 2 indicates the o3 toc dose required to reduce the organic micropollutants to within their standard based on the group indicator removal the highest o3 toc dose required was 1 5mgo3 toc for n nitroso dimethylamine ndma table 3 3 shows the organic micropollutant water quality risk analysis and profile before treatment as described in section 0 all the organic micropollutants had a medium risk profile no o3 or hydroxyl radical reaction rates were found for 1 7 dimethylxanthine and thus no pre or post treatment rating is provided table 3 4 shows the organic micropollutant water quality risk analysis and profile after treatment with an o3 toc dose ratio of 1 5 using the steps provided in section 2 7 the o3 process at the cape flats mar wrp can dose an o3 toc ratio of more than 1 5mgo3 mgtoc which is sufficient to reduce most of the organic micropollutants to within their standard table 3 4 indicates that all the organic micropollutants have a low risk profile after treatment except for ndma hence it can be concluded that the o 3 process at the cape flats mar wrp could theoretically lower the risk of more than 87 7 out of 8 of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wwtw final effluent that are found to be above their standard i e from medium risk to low risk and to within the standard this finding argues that the o 3 process can help produce safe drinking water regarding organic micropollutants however this risk assessment did not consider o3 oxidation organic micropollutant transformation products furthermore no consideration was given to the additional biological removal of organic micropollutants by the bac filtration process given that no removal prediction models were found however li et al 42 found that bac filtration reduced the toxicity caused by ozonation transformation products 4 conclusions the purpose of this paper was to find an o3 contact time that minimises the 20 year pv lcc including the capital and operation and maintenance o m cost for the o3 disinfection process furthermore the study set out to determine how effectively the o3 process can remove the organic micropollutants found in the cape flats wwtw final effluent these objectives had the collective aim to develop a framework to assess and optimize the o3 process to achieve this international costing models process validation methods t10 and cstr method organic micropollutant reaction rates theoretical o3 organic micropollutant removal models and a risk assessment model were used an o3 contact time that resulted in the lowest pv lcc at each treatment objective investigated was found using the t10 and cstr validation methods for a 40mld o3 process that receives 9 mg l of toc for the cstr method the optimum contact times varied between 5 and 18 min depending on the treatment objective and the o3 transfer efficiency for the t10 method the optimum contact times varied between 5 and 13 min depending on the treatment objective and the o3 transfer efficiency the optimum contact time for the t10 method was generally lower than the cstr method however the o3 toc dose ratios and pv lccs of the cstr method was considerably lower compared to the t10 method it was found that the o3 process can theoretically reduce the risk of more than 87 of the organic micropollutants with concentrations above their standard in the cape flats wwtw effluent after o3 treatment 7 of the 9 organic micropollutants 9 having concentrations above their standard were rated as low risk if the concentrations of the organic micropollutants after o3 treatment are considered the results showed that the o3 process can assist to produce safe drinking water with regards to organic micropollutants oxidation in multi barrier treatment train in addition to organic micropollutant oxidation if the ct value of a selected treatment objective is maintained with either the cstr or t10 method the o3 process can also assist in the inactivation of pathogens the current study developed a method to determine the most cost effective o3 contact time when the o3 decay rate and iod of an o3 process feed water are known this method can help determine the optimum contact time that results in lower o m and capital costs of o3 systems the water quality risk framework of this study can also be used in other applications e g concept studies on new or existing o3 processes with available water quality data furthermore the findings proved that the o3 process could be optimised by selecting the most cost efficient contact time based on eq 2 14 t10 method or eq 2 2 cstr method depending on the validation method both models developed in this study cost optimisation model and organic micropollutant risk rating model form a framework for evaluating future o3 processes the limitations of the current study were i the findings were only valid for a final effluent with the decay and iod characteristics as highlighted in table 2 3 ii the specific aspects of water quality ph alkalinity temperature etc were not considered iii the risk assessments were only conducted on the organic micropollutants found in the water quality results of two samples further expansion of the baseline water quality dataset for the cape flats wwtw final effluent would reveal the presence of additional organic micropollutants iv not all the organic micropollutants o3 and hydroxyl radicals second order reaction rates could be found v the grouping of elements to predict their removal could be inaccurate given the significant variations in the second order reaction rates of organic micropollutants sonntag and von gunten 33 and park et al 32 and vi the presence of organic micropollutant transformation products after treatment with o3 were not considered future research should focus on i the application and optimisation of the framework to find the most cost efficient o3 contact time for other o3 decay rates and iod values ii checking and comparing the actual o3 decay rate and iod of the filtered cape flats wwtw final effluent with the values determined in this study when the o3 process of the cape flats mar wrp is in operation iii comparing the actual removal of organic micropollutants with the values predicted in this study when the o3 process of the cape flats mar wrp is operational declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12984,final wastewater treatment plant effluent is widely recognised as a hazardous water source for human consumption as it may contain organic micropollutants and pathogens the advanced processes required to adequately remove them are costly and consequently it is crucial to investigate how the associated costs can be optimised one of the key treatment steps in the treatment train of the cape flats managed aquifer recharge mar water reclamation plant wrp is the advanced ozonation o3 treatment process the o3 process was assessed using the t10 and cstr methods the o3 toc dose ratio was used as the main parameter to compare and relate various o3 treatment objectives and assessment methods furthermore an o3 contact time optimisation was performed on the cape flats o3 process using capital and operation and maintenance o m costing models as well as process performance regression models the optimum contact time in terms of cost for 2 4 log virus inactivation by ozone and 1 3 log giardia inactivation by ozone was determined to be between 5 and 7 min by the cstr method and 5 min by the t10 method the optimum contact time in terms of cost for 1 3 log inactivation of cryptosporidium by ozone was determined to be between 8 and 18 min by the cstr method and between 6 and 13 min by the t10 method depending on the treatment objective and o3 transfer efficiency the o3 process of the cape flats mar wrp can theoretically reduce more than 87 of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wastewater treatment works wwtw final effluent keywords ozone optimization treatment efficiency o3

works λ the likelihood of a contaminant being above their standard μ the resulting consequence of consuming water containing levels of the contaminant above or below the standard 1 introduction in water treatment o3 is the second strongest oxidant after the hydroxyl radical oh 1 the most critical impact of o3 oxidation in water is the inactivation of pathogens i e pathogens and pollutants are attacked directly by o3 oxidation and indirectly by oh formed during the o3 decomposition process 2 the foundation of oxidation based disinfection processes in the united states us is the ct framework 3 the ct value is the product of residual o3 concentration c and contact time t the ct value developed by the us epa requires that for a specific log removal a stipulated ct value be maintained in the o3 system without a measurable ct value the quantification of bacteria and viruses inactivation are difficult and no inactivation of spore forming bacteria is achieved 3 furthermore chemical disinfection does not remove pathogens from the water but only inactivates them the inactivation level is a measure of the number of pathogens that are inactivated during disinfection and is quantified by the term log inactivation 4 o3 is becoming more popular for disinfection purposes as it can eliminate nearly all microorganisms including giardia and cryptosporidium 3 when o3 is injected into water a high initial uptake initial demand of o3 is commonly observed as it reacts with scavengers and readily reactive constituents in the water this initial demand is referred to as the instantaneous o3 demand iod 5 once the initial o3 demand is met an increase in the residual dissolved o3 concentration starts to occur the point at which an increase in o3 dosage results in an increase of the residual o3 concentration is defined as the o3 demand 2 consequently this residual o3 becomes a highly effective disinfectant over time residual o3 is the most critical parameter for disinfection as o3 oxidation is the primary pathway for the inactivation of pathogens 2 in contrast oh plays a relatively small role in the inactivation of resistant pathogens 6 the ct value is the foundation of oxidation based disinfection processes in the united states us 3 to achieve a specific log removal the ct value must be maintained throughout the system such that it complies with the requirements of the us epa log inactivation tables schulz et al 7 stipulate that the ct value be determined by the o3 residual values of the outlet of the o3 contact tank the t value in the ct concept is further defined to be the time it takes for 10 of particular concentration to pass through a contact basin otherwise called the t10 8 11 7 the t10 value is the hydraulic retention time multiplied by the baffling factor which accounts for flow short circuiting 9 maintaining a constant o3 residual at the end of the o3 contact tank can result in varying pathogen disinfection results this varying result occurs when the o3 residual is measured at the end of the contact tank as it takes a significant amount of time to notice a change in the o3 concentration due to a change in o3 dose or change in water quality subsequently allowing inefficiently disinfected lumps of water to pass through however this variation in disinfection efficiency is covered within the ct concept but can result in o3 overdosing 10 instead by measuring the residual o3 after the initial o3 demand phase the time required to adapt to the changes in flows can be reduced further preventing lumps of inefficiently disinfected water to escape o3 contact tanks can be divided into theoretical or physical chambers for the determination of the ct value in accordance with the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr from the us epa 8 furthermore the chambers partitions are distinguished by two types i a reactive chamber whereby o3 can react with the water and ii a dissolution chamber whereby o3 is dosed into the water dissolution chambers are further divided into i a co current o3 contact chamber in which the water and the gas bubbles flow in the same direction both upwards and ii into a counter current contact chamber in which the o3 bubbles flow upwards and the water downwards the ct value can be determined in four ways according to the lt2eswtr 8 the four ways are the t10 method the extended t10 method the cstr method and the extended cstr method however the current study focusses on the t10 and cstr methods with the following requirements i t10 method a no inactivation credit is given for the first dissolution chamber b the ct value can be calculated for the entire contact tank or for individual segments of the contact tank summed together c a decay test is recommended to determine t10 otherwise a baffling factor must be assumed ii cstr method a should be applied to each individual type of segment chamber b ideal to use when no tracer tests are available or when the contact tank has significant back mixing i e t10 hdt 5 where hdt hydraulic detention time selecting the most applicable ct value calculation method depends on i the availability of tracer test results hydraulic flow characterisation of the contact tank according to the us epa 8 lt2eswtr ii the configuration of the contact tank and iii the amount of process monitoring and analysis that a treatment plant plans to undertake when using the t10 method the dissolved o3 concentration c can be measured directly at the outlet of each contact chamber segment or alternatively determined indirectly by predicting the c value at the outlet of each contact chamber segment using the dissolved o3 concentration at the outlet of the contact tank lt2eswtr 2010 in general the t10 method underestimates the ct value obtained the ct value in its simplest form according to the t10 method can be determined with eq 1 1 8 1 1 t 10 ct value mg min l f baffling hdt c outlet where fbaffling baffling factor describing the baffling conditions of an o3 contact tank hdt hydraulic detention time coutlet residual o3 concentration at contact tank outlet the use of the cstr or extended cstr methods is recommended when no tracer studies are available additionally a combination of the ct value calculation methods can be used 8 in general the extended methods are more complex to use but can be programmed into a spreadsheet 8 in most cases the data from a tracer study used to quantify flow short circuiting for a specific tank i e t10 will not be available unless a pilot plant is built therefore the cstr method is useful when determining the ct value as it does not require the contact tank baffling factor which reduces the effective contact time used in the ct concept having a lower effective contact time reduces the ct value that is achievable at a specific ozone dose no tracer studies were available for the current study and a t10 hdt of 0 67 was used which is close to superior baffling conditions according to the baffling classification of the us epa 11 the choice of 0 67 for the t10 hdt is further strengthened by the lt2eswtr which found the t10 hdt or baffling factor which accounts for flow short circuiting to be 0 65 even in well baffled o3 contact tanks a correlation between the o3 dose required for disinfection and the o3 dose required for organic micropollutant oxidation exists and is influenced by the incoming total organic carbon toc concentration 3 the same o3 toc dose ratio produces similar organic micropollutant oxidation in different water matrices with high variations in water quality 3 furthermore the o3 toc dose ratio relates the o3 dose required for disinfection to the o3 dose required for organic micropollutant oxidation as shown in eqs 2 1 to 2 4 12 o3 decay in secondary effluent or in water with high dissolved organic matter is categorised by two energetically different stages 3 the first stage is a short typically 30s o3 demand phase in which o3 is quickly consumed caused by the instantaneous o3 demand iod the iod is influenced by organic matter and the decay rate can be predicted by second order kinetics 13 in the second stage after the initial period the decay rate resembles first order kinetics 14 furthermore the rate constant of the dissolved residual o3 decay decreases with a higher o3 dose during the second stage 5 conceptual level capital and operation and maintenance o m costing models linked to the flow and the o3 toc dose ratio defined by the american association of cost estimation as class 4 planning level is the foundation for cost optimization through the development of a 20 year life cycle cost lcc cash flow the costing models are designed to be used as a basis for comparison and they yield accuracies between 30 50 the foundation to estimate the removal of organic micropollutants is the o3 toc dose ratio and the o3 and oh reaction rates for each pollutant the primary objectives of the current study are to i investigate whether an optimum o3 contact time exists for which the present value pv of the 20 year discounted cash flow cost of the o3 system is at its lowest ii group the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wwtw final effluent based on their o3 and hydroxyl radical oh reaction rates iii estimate the presence of organic micropollutants in the final effluent of the cape flats wwtw before and after treatment with the o3 process based on removal prediction models and iv rate the safety of the water with a water quality risk analysis the four objectives above have the collective aim to provide a framework which can be applied to future projects to determine the optimum contact time ct as well as identify potential risks to water quality 2 methods and models 2 1 case study cape flats mar wrp the city of cape town experienced four years of water shortages 2015 2018 mainly due to a continuous 3 year drought 2015 2017 which represented a 1 400 year drought 15 and urbanisation resulting in increased water demand in response to the water shortages the city of cape town identified the managed aquifer recharge mar scheme of the cape flats aquifer as a viable alternative water source the cape flats mar water reclamation plant wrp forms part of the cape flats aquifer potable reuse scheme an indirect potable reuse scheme which will inject treated secondary effluent into the cape flats aquifer one of the most critical treatment processes in the cape flats mar wrp is the o3 biological active carbon o3 bac filtration process 16 the o3 bac filtration process is an essential step in this reuse scheme to remove pathogens and micro organics provided it can be applied and operated correctly the o3 process is also the most cost intensive process due to energy and liquid oxygen costs in the cape flats mar wrp treatment train therefore this treatment process is critical but costly and raises concerns about how the o3 bac process can be customised with regard to treatment objectives and optimised with regard to cost towards generating safe drinking water as part of a reuse treatment train 2 2 wastewater treatment facility the proposed site for the new cape flats mar wrp is situated within the boundaries of the existing cape flats wwtw the cape flats wwtw treats settled sewage through 4 process trains each train consists of two biological reactors and secondary settling tanks the cape flats wwtw consists of a 5 stage modified bardenpho activated sludge process furthermore the wwtw can be operated with or without primary settling tanks final treatment is achieved using an extensive maturation pond system however the wrp will abstract secondary settling tank effluent before the ponds a layout of the cape flats wwtw and wrp are presented in fig 2 1 2 3 water quality data two samples containing organic micropollutants were taken the first sample consisted of effluent from a maturation pond pond s4 taken when the reclamation plant planned to extract final effluent from the ponds the second sample consisted of sst effluent from reactors c and d the following water quality datasets were used i an organic micropollutant grab sample of effluent from pond s4 on 24 february 2018 analysed by eurofins and ii an organic micropollutant two hourly flow weighted sample of effluent from the ssts of reactors c and d on 1 december 2019 analysed by eurofins table 2 1 shows the list of organic micropollutant groups measured and includes their corresponding testing method the water quality tests were conducted to detect the organic micropollutants present in the cape flats wwtw final effluent see table 2 1 the number of organic micropollutants detected was 112 after the organic pollutants were detected the o3 and hydroxyl radical second order reaction rates o3 ko3 and koh for each of the organic micropollutants detected in the cape flats wwtw final effluent were identified values were found for 63 of the organic micropollutants and were arranged into five groups it is empirical to note that the reaction rate for organic micropollutants changes with ph however the reaction rate ph values were not considered as they lay outside the study s scope the water quality i e the organic micropollutants was assessed using the quality standards monitoring trigger level prescribed by the california state water resources control board 17 nine of the measured organic micropollutants were above their limit when compared with their respective standard table 2 2 summarises the maximum value detected of each organic micropollutant above the standard the standard limit and the minimum reduction required to be within the water quality standard 2 4 model equations a model was developed by gerrity et al 5 to predict the residual o3 concentrations in secondary and tertiary wastewater effluent and is shown in eq 2 1 as a function of the o3 dose concentration the toc concentration the iod time and the decay constant k table 2 3 shows typical values for the constants used 2 1 o zone residual mg l o 3 toc toc iod e kt eq 2 2 gives the ct value as a function of time toc iod and o3 dose as defined by gerrity et al 5 furthermore k is used to describe the dissolved residual o3 decay rate in eq 2 2 typical values for k and iod used for the wastewater characteristics of gerrity et al 5 are shown in table 2 3 2 2 o 3 ct mg min l o 3 toc toc iod k 1 e kt snyder et al 3 found that the ability of o3 to oxidise contaminants when compared to the hydroxyl radical oh varies depending on the contaminant in consideration these distinctions motivated snyder et al 3 to group organic micropollutants based on their mode of oxidation as a result they noticed that some contaminants are very susceptible to both o3 and oh oxidation others to only o3 oxidation or to oh oxidation and some neither to o3 nor oh oxidation 3 furthermore they found that for secondary effluent type water with higher organic matter concentrations oh forms rapidly from the reaction between o3 and organic matter therefore if all the groups are to be oxidised the o3 process must provide very high o3 dosages and high oh exposure table 2 4 shows the o3 and oh reaction rates applicable to each group including the o3 dosage ratio required for removal the removal efficiency achievable the method of removal and the number of organic micropollutants present in each group with the organic micropollutants o3 and oh second order reaction rates k values known the pollutants of table 2 2 were grouped as described in table 2 4 and shown in table 2 5 for 1 7 dimethylxanthine no reaction rate was found and thus no group was attached to this micropollutant the organic micropollutants groups found to be above their standard in the cape flats wwtw final effluent were groups 1 2 3 and 5 interestingly no group 4 micropollutants were found to be above their standard snyder et al 3 found that the same o3 toc dosage ratio produces similar results even with different ct values and high variations in water quality this makes the o3 toc dose ratio a particularly useful measure of organic micropollutant oxidation similarly uvabsorbance254 uva254 changes occurred at the same o3 dose ratio in different wastewater effluents snyder et al 3 further explained that o3 is highly effective in improving the visible colour of water measured by uvabsorbance at 436nm uvabsorbance can be measured in the visible light range of 436 nm or the invisible light range of 254 nm however in some cases they found that regardless of the o3 dose the relative improvement of measurements in the visible light spectrum were the same while the improvement of uvabsorbance due to the o3 process appears satisfactory in the visible light range the actual improvement measured in the invisible light range uva254 is significantly less consequently they concluded that the relative improvement in uv absorbance at 254 nm due to the o3 process remains the preferred way to assess the process efficacy and determine the optimum o3 dose snyder et al 34 proposed eq 2 3 to describe the uva254 improvement uva254 due to the o3 process based on the o3 toc dose ratio applied to the filtered final effluent 2 3 uv 254 100 0 5077 o 3 toc 0 5968 r 2 0 92 furthermore the link between uva254 and the removal of specific organic micropollutants is described by eq 2 4 34 2 4 1 c c 0 100 slope 1 uv uv 0 100 intercept where c0 organic micropollutant concentration before treatment c organic micropollutant concentration after treatment uv0 uva254 before treatment uv uva254 after treatment slope see snyder et al 34 intercept see snyder et al 34 in contrast it should further be noted that predicting the o3 oxidation of organic micropollutants is difficult when treating wastewater given the difficulty to quantify o3 and hydroxyl radical exposure during the rapid initial phase 32 the effectiveness of removing organic compounds with o3 significantly depends on the time and concentration of o3 and oh exposure i e the ct value 3 2 5 optimum contact time model the model used to assess whether there is an optimum o3 contact time in terms of capital and o m costs for the o3 disinfection process is discussed below in particular the research focused on the cstr method and the t 10 method the cstr method is described as an integrated approach and is implemented by dividing the o3 contact tank into segments and then measuring the residual o3 for each segment the residual o3 is then multiplied by the time it takes for the water to flow between virtual segments t fig 2 2 shows an example of an o3 decay curve through an o3 contact tank the blue columns in fig 2 2 represent the virtual t 1 min segments of the o3 contact tank when using the cstr method the t10 method eq 1 1 determines the ct value as the product of the total effective contact time and the residual o3 at the end of the contact tank for the entire contact tank depicted by the orange block in fig 2 2 an alternative use of the t10 method is to sum up the ct products of the individual segments of the contact tank similar to the cstr method however the t10 method implemented here is for the entire contact tank furthermore the o3 toc dose ratio for the two process performance validation methods t10 and cstr are calculated with the equations listed in table 2 6 2 6 low cost point a life cycle costs lcc analysis was done to find the lowest cost point optimal in terms of cost between residual o3 concentration c and o3 contact time t using the ct concept the longer the contact time t the higher the cost of the contact tank in contrast the larger the residual o3 concentration c the higher the o3 equipment capital and o m costs lccs are calculated as current present value pv costs year 2020 rand using the discounted cash flow method over the project lifetime of 20 years as presented by van dijk and van vuuren 35 the pv lcc calculations were done in microsoft excel using the excel functions as described in sections 4 2 and 4 6 of blank and tarquin 36 for present worth analysis of equal life alternatives for two or more alternatives the method accounts for the capital cost in the first year which is annualised and then added to the annual o m cost for the rest of the 20 years furthermore a discount rate of 6 was used

factor also plays a role in the ct value credited to the o3 disinfection process for the current study a baffling factor of 0 67 was used which implies superior flow distribution baffling according to us epa 11 a summary of the pv lcc input parameters is given in table 2 7 the objective of ozonation can be to target viruses giardia or cryptosporidium separately or as a combination of them for the low cost point investigation the disinfection objectives listed in table 2 8 were used but with 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation ct 22 5 mg min l being the base case the o3 dose for disinfection was determined as the product of the highest residual o3 concentration and the effective contact time ct value as required to achieve the log removal selected in table 2 8 table 2 9 presents the cost

adapt the cost functions for various contact times other than 5 min a cost function for contact times other than 5 min was derived and is shown in fig 2 3 various factors influence the o3 process nonetheless the factors focused on were the instantaneous o3 demand iod and the o3 decay rate k the o3 decay rate k is influenced by the o3 dose ratio o3 toc as is evident from the respective k values

eq 2 2 represents the cstr method i e the integrated method furthermore both equations were used to investigate the lowest cost points for the respective methods to investigate the existence of a lowest cost point at a specific contact time the parameters summarised in table 2 7 were used with the o3 toc dose ratio determined from eq 2 14 t10 method or eq 2 2 cstr integrated method and knowing the flowrate of the treatment plant the present value pv life cycle cost lcc of the system total cost over 20 years was determined this pv lcc capital and o m was used to investigate the existence of a lowest cost point in terms of both capital and operating costs at a specific contact time t the lowest cost point was also evaluated for the other disinfection treatment objectives of table 2 8 using the cstr method and the t10 method of table 2 6 2 7 organic micropollutant water quality risk assessment model the model used to conduct a water quality risk assessment of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wwtw final effluent was split into two phases the first phase was to determine the predicted removal of the organic micropollutants the second phase was to conduct a water quality risk profile on the identified organic micropollutants to indicate the water quality risk before and after organic micropollutant removal with the o3 process to predict the removal of contaminants using the o3 process the method proposed by snyder et al 34 see eqs 2 3 to 2 4 was implemented the steps to determine the percentage of an organic micropollutant that can be removed are described by the following steps 1 determine organic micropollutant target group table 2 5 2 determine o 3 toc from table 2 4 3 determine uva254 with eq 2 3 4 determine indication of removed with eq 2 4 the risk assessment was done on the organic micropollutants presented in table 2 2 and included the pre and post treated water pre treated water contains the organic micropollutants measured in the effluent of the cape flats wwtw and post treated water contains the residual organic micropollutants that remain after removal with the o3 process determined according to the steps above the water quality of the cape flats wwtw was evaluated against two criteria firstly the likelihood λ of a contaminant being above their standard and secondly the resulting consequence μ of consuming water containing levels of the contaminant above or below the standard for instance when a contaminant is below the standard it is deemed to have a moderate impact i e a minor impact for a large population table 2 12 the evaluation was done by rating an organic micropollutant according to the definitions of table 2 12 which gives λ and μ a score according to the score column the risk profile score is then obtained with the multiplication product of the λ and μ score the risk profile score categorises the risk rating on a risk profile according to table 2 13 the categories are no risk λ μ 1 low risk 1 λ μ 19 medium risk 19 λ μ 60 or high risk λ μ 60 the possible outcomes of the λ and μ multiplication product and the associated risk profile are shown in table 2 14 when the concentration of an organic micropollutant is over the standard the λ is scored almost certain and the μ is scored moderate giving it a medium risk profile if the μ of the organic micropollutant is still over its standard after treatment it is scored as above i e λ almost certain and μ moderate if the concentration of the organic micropollutant is below its standard after treatment the λ is scored unlikely and μ is scored moderate giving it a low risk profile the treatment parameters that are used in the risk assessment to predict the removal of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats filtered final effluent are presented in table 2 11 3 results and discussion 3 1 low cost point results the results are first presented in figs 3 1 to 3 4 for the base case a treatment objective of 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation with ct 22 5 mg min l and then for the other treatment objectives presented in table 2 8 in figs 3 5 and 3 6 evaluated according to the cstr and t10 method the results are valid for the parameters in table 2 7 using the cost equations of table 2 9 and the model described in section 2 6 the results are shown for an o3 transfer efficiency of 98 and 90 for the cstr method fig 3 1 gives the o3 toc ratio at various o3 contact times all required to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation fig 3 2 in turn gives the 20 year pv lcc associated with achieving 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation by using the cstr method the o3 toc dose ratio as determined by the cstr method in fig 3 1 reduces as the o3 contact time increases from 4 to 14 min after which the o3 toc dose ratio starts to plateau this plateau effect after 14 min contact time could be attributed to an equal impact of increased contact time and increasing o3 decay factor k on the o3 toc dose ratio the o3 toc dose ratio and contact time directly affect the capital cost through fig 2 3 and eq 2 5 and the o m cost through eq 2 6 as can be seen in fig 3 2 like the o3 toc dose ratio there is initially a pv lcc benefit to increase the o3 contact time from 4 to 14 min after which the benefit starts to diminish between a contact time of 4 14 min the relatively small capital cost to increase the o3 contact tank in comparison to the o m costs increases the t value contact time in the ct value which reduces the required c value residual o3 concentration required to achieve 22 5 mg min l and indirectly the pv lcc furthermore fig 3 2 reveals that the optimum contact time to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation with the cstr method is also 14 min with a negligible drop in cost after 14 min of contact time by directly comparing to the cstr method fig 3 3 gives the o3 toc ratio as determined by the t10 method at various o3 contact times required to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation fig 3 4 in turn shows the 20 year pv lcc associated with achieving 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation fig 3 3 shows that for the t10 method the lowest o3 toc dose ratios are between 12 and 16 min of o3 contact time between contact times of 4 12 min the o3 toc dose ratio drops due to the increased contact time t value on the ct value which governs the o3 toc dose ratio required whereas for contact times greater than 16 min the o3 toc dose ratio starts to rise again due to the greater effect of o3 decay as compared to contact time on the ct value which then starts to govern the o3 toc dose ratio required fig 3 4 further reveals that the optimal 20 year pv lcc point to achieve 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation is 12 min of contact time similar to the cstr method there is an initial benefit in pv lcc to increase the o3 contact time from 4 to 12 min however increasing the contact time further than 16 min reduces the pv lcc benefit of an increased contact time regarding the other treatment objectives table 2 8 the optimum contact times in terms of the lowest 20 year pv lcc are shown in fig 3 5 as determined by using the cstr method and fig 3 6 as determined by using the t10 method furthermore contact times below 5 min were not considered and the results are valid for the different conditions outlined in table 2 7 fig 3 5 reveals that the optimum contact time for 2 to 4 log virus inactivation by o3 including 1 to 3 log giardia inactivation by o3 lies between 5 and 7 min depending on the transfer efficiency determined using the cstr method in contrast the optimum contact time for 1 to 3 log inactivation of cryptosporidium lies between 8 and 18 min depending on the o3 transfer efficiency fig 3 6 presents the optimum contact times as determined by the t10 method and shows that for 2 to 4 log virus inactivation and 1 to 3 log giardia inactivation the optimum contact time lies at 5 min furthermore the optimum contact time for 1 to 3 log cryptosporidium inactivation lies between 6 and 13 min depending on the o3 transfer efficiency in general the cstr method requires longer o3 contact times and lower o3 toc dose ratios than the t10 method which requires shorter o3 contact times and higher o3 toc dose ratios it is critical to note that the optimum contact times observed in the results are only applicable to the o3 decay rates the iod and the parameters used for the evaluation in this study a summary of the optimum contact times found in the study is presented in table 3 1 even though the optimum contact times of the t10 method are lower compared to the cstr method the cstr method results in lower o3 toc dosing ratios see fig 3 1 and lower pv lccs see fig 3 2 if compared to the t10 method see figs 3 3 and 3 4 this observation shows that the o3 toc dosing ratio or o3 dose have a greater influence on the pv lcc in the form of capital and o m costs as compared to the capital cost implication of a larger contact tank 3 2 water quality risk analysis results the water quality risk analysis focused on the organic micropollutants that were above the recommended standard table 2 2 table 3 2 indicates the o3 toc dose required to reduce the organic micropollutants to within their standard based on the group indicator removal the highest o3 toc dose required was 1 5mgo3 toc for n nitroso dimethylamine ndma table 3 3 shows the organic micropollutant water quality risk analysis and profile before treatment as described in section 0 all the organic micropollutants had a medium risk profile no o3 or hydroxyl radical reaction rates were found for 1 7 dimethylxanthine and thus no pre or post treatment rating is provided table 3 4 shows the organic micropollutant water quality risk analysis and profile after treatment with an o3 toc dose ratio of 1 5 using the steps provided in section 2 7 the o3 process at the cape flats mar wrp can dose an o3 toc ratio of more than 1 5mgo3 mgtoc which is sufficient to reduce most of the organic micropollutants to within their standard table 3 4 indicates that all the organic micropollutants have a low risk profile after treatment except for ndma hence it can be concluded that the o 3 process at the cape flats mar wrp could theoretically lower the risk of more than 87 7 out of 8 of the organic micropollutants in the cape flats wwtw final effluent that are found to be above their standard i e from medium risk to low risk and to within the standard this finding argues that the o 3 process can help produce safe drinking water regarding organic micropollutants however this risk assessment did not consider o3 oxidation organic micropollutant transformation products furthermore no consideration was given to the additional biological removal of organic micropollutants by the bac filtration process given that no removal prediction models were found however li et al 42 found that bac filtration reduced the toxicity caused by ozonation transformation products 4 conclusions the purpose of this paper was to find an o3 contact time that minimises the 20 year pv lcc including the capital and operation and maintenance o m cost for the o3 disinfection process furthermore the study set out to determine how effectively the o3 process can remove the organic micropollutants found in the cape flats wwtw final effluent these objectives had the collective aim to develop a framework to assess and optimize the o3 process to achieve this international costing models process validation methods t10 and cstr method organic micropollutant reaction rates theoretical o3 organic micropollutant removal models and a risk assessment model were used an o3 contact time that resulted in the lowest pv lcc at each treatment objective investigated was found using the t10 and cstr validation methods for a 40mld o3 process that receives 9 mg l of toc for the cstr method the optimum contact times varied between 5 and 18 min depending on the treatment objective and the o3 transfer efficiency for the t10 method the optimum contact times varied between 5 and 13 min depending on the treatment objective and the o3 transfer efficiency the optimum contact time for the t10 method was generally lower than the cstr method however the o3 toc dose ratios and pv lccs of the cstr method was considerably lower compared to the t10 method it was found that the o3 process can theoretically reduce the risk of more than 87 of the organic micropollutants with concentrations above their standard in the cape flats wwtw effluent after o3 treatment 7 of the 9 organic micropollutants 9 having concentrations above their standard were rated as low risk if the concentrations of the organic micropollutants after o3 treatment are considered the results showed that the o3 process can assist to produce safe drinking water with regards to organic micropollutants oxidation in multi barrier treatment train in addition to organic micropollutant oxidation if the ct value of a selected treatment objective is maintained with either the cstr or t10 method the o3 process can also assist in the inactivation of pathogens the current study developed a method to determine the most cost effective o3 contact time when the o3 decay rate and iod of an o3 process feed water are known this method can help determine the optimum contact time that results in lower o m and capital costs of o3 systems the water quality risk framework of this study can also be used in other applications e g concept studies on new or existing o3 processes with available water quality data furthermore the findings proved that the o3 process could be optimised by selecting the most cost efficient contact time based on eq 2 14 t10 method or eq 2 2 cstr method depending on the validation method both models developed in this study cost optimisation model and organic micropollutant risk rating model form a framework for evaluating future o3 processes the limitations of the current study were i the findings were only valid for a final effluent with the decay and iod characteristics as highlighted in table 2 3 ii the specific aspects of water quality ph alkalinity temperature etc were not considered iii the risk assessments were only conducted on the organic micropollutants found in the water quality results of two samples further expansion of the baseline water quality dataset for the cape flats wwtw final effluent would reveal the presence of additional organic micropollutants iv not all the organic micropollutants o3 and hydroxyl radicals second order reaction rates could be found v the grouping of elements to predict their removal could be inaccurate given the significant variations in the second order reaction rates of organic micropollutants sonntag and von gunten 33 and park et al 32 and vi the presence of organic micropollutant transformation products after treatment with o3 were not considered future research should focus on i the application and optimisation of the framework to find the most cost efficient o3 contact time for other o3 decay rates and iod values ii checking and comparing the actual o3 decay rate and iod of the filtered cape flats wwtw final effluent with the values determined in this study when the o3 process of the cape flats mar wrp is in operation iii comparing the actual removal of organic micropollutants with the values predicted in this study when the o3 process of the cape flats mar wrp is operational declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
