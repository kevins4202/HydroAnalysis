1950,rapid and accurate urban flood forecasting with high temporal resolution is critical to address future flood risks under urbanization and climate change machine learning models are increasingly used for flood forecasting however they are limited in their ability to extract effective features from rainfall data and capture dynamic runoff processes this study proposes an attention mechanism based long short term memory lstm network named as alstm dw which uses double time sliding windows dtsw and a weighted mean square error wmse loss function the alstm dw model was applied to three urban flooding hotspots in shenzhen china and its effectiveness was verified through a series of comparative experiments the results obtained show that 1 the proposed model performs well with a coefficient of determination larger than 0 85 peak flow error smaller than 0 015 m and time to peak error smaller than 2 min on average in testing periods 2 the use of dtsw helps extract effective rainfall features and mitigate excessive fluctuations in forecasted hydrographs caused by over response to rainfall 3 adding the attention mechanism to the lstm network helps consider the varying contribution of each input factor over time and 4 the wmse improves the ability of the network to predict flood peaks with an average decrease of 88 and 54 in peak flow error and time to peak error respectively therefore the alstm dw model shows promising potential for providing accurate flood forecasting which can support effective flood emergency operations keywords deep learning dynamic process flooding high temporal resolution inundation sites sample imbalance data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction flooding is a destructive widespread and frequent natural hazard in human society knebl et al 2005 teng et al 2017 yang et al 2022 due to rapid urbanization and climate change frequent and intense flood events have become a major threat faced by many cities worldwide zhou et al 2019 dao et al 2020 urban flood forecasting plays an essential role in supporting emergency management and in developing strategies to mitigate future flood hazards rosenzweig et al 2021 flood models can be divided into data driven and process based models and the latter can be further divided into hydrological and hydrodynamic models hydrological models based on watershed hydrology are used for streamflow forecasting in the entire watershed or catchment area salvadore et al 2015 compared with hydrological models hydrodynamic models are able to consider the hydraulic characteristics of urban drainage systems and micro topographies devia et al 2015 brendel et al 2020 khanam et al 2021 nevertheless they require more computational time and higher terrain accuracy yang et al 2020 therefore it is a major challenge for high resolution process based models to provide both rapid and accurate urban flood predictions shen et al 2015 zounemat kermani et al 2020 to achieve rapid forecasting data driven models are often used as alternatives to hydrological hydrodynamic models because of their easy construction and high computational efficiency mosavi et al 2018 li willems 2020 fu et al 2022 the latest data driven models for urban flood prediction are reviewed and summarized in table 1 table 1 shows many data driven methods that have been applied in urban flood forecasting motta et al 2021 such as logistic regression li willems 2020 decision trees wu et al 2020 and random forests zahura et al 2020 in recent years neural networks have been widely used because of their capability to tackle non linear modeling tasks nourani and komasi 2013 deep neural networks dnns have also been used to improve predictive accuracy berkhahn et al 2019 kim han 2020 darabi et al 2021 siam et al 2022 for example convolutional neural networks were used to learn spatial features from catchment characteristics and rainfall guo et al 2021 löwe et al 2021 as an advanced recurrent neural network the lstm network is capable of capturing both periodic and random behavior of time series data enabling it to learn the input output relationship more accurately hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 mouatadid et al 2019 hu et al 2019 gude et al 2020 fang et al 2021 compared with other neural networks yang et al 2020 cheng et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b gao et al 2020 and process based models tian et al 2018 fan et al 2020 because of the scarcity of observed flood data in urban regions rené et al 2014 fu et al 2022 hydrological hydrodynamic models have been used to generate training samples by synthesizing a large number of simulated scenarios table 1 while some deep learning dl models for urban flood prediction have been trained using observed water depth records they have been found to predict only the occurrence of flooding li willems 2020 motta et al 2021 or maximum water depth of a flood event wu et al 2020 rather than the hydrograph of water depth table 1 to the best of our knowledge no research has investigated the capacity of dl in modeling urban flood dynamic processes using high variability observed rainfall and urban flood records at the minute scale challenges remain in dl based urban flood modeling the first is how to effectively extract features from input rainfall data previous research has used the following inputs rainfall factors which include rainfall intensity time series cheng et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b and statistics of rainfall intensity total rainfall maximum rainfall standard deviation skewness and kurtosis kim han 2020 meteorological factors temperature humidity and wind speed motta et al 2021 or underlying urban characteristic factors land use terrain zahura et al 2020 permeability wu et al 2020 topology löwe et al 2021 darabi et al 2021 and sewer network li willems 2020 table 1 among them rainfall factors are the most indispensable input factors for flood prediction however the urban flood mechanism is rarely considered in the construction of rainfall factors the second is properly capturing the dynamic response between rainfall and flooding because the high variability of rainfall data may induce excessive fluctuations in the output water depth with existing dl methods huang et al 2018 the third is that little attention has been paid to the sample imbalance problem in the dl based urban flood forecasting li et al 2021 in general the sizes of different flood water depth classes in the training data vary significantly that is there are far more low water depth records than high water depth records leading to underestimated high water depths man et al 2021 previous studies used loss functions such as mean absolute error mae zahura et al 2020 kim han 2020 mean square error mse löwe et al 2021 and root mean square error rmse berkhahn et al 2019 guo et al 2021 which didn t consider the sample imbalance in flood data this study presents a new deep learning model named alstm dw which is an attention mechanism based long short term memory att lstm network with double time sliding windows dtsw and a weighted mean square error wmse loss function this model is designed to address three critical challenges encountered in high temporal resolution urban flood prediction effective rainfall feature extraction dynamic capture of urban rainfall runoff response and mitigation of sample imbalance problems observed rainfall and water depth records from study sites are used to train and test the proposed model the performances of the proposed model are presented and discussed according to three evaluation metrics comparative experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the dtsw att lstm and wmse in improving model performance respectively 2 study sites and data 2 1 study sites shenzhen located in the south of guangdong province china is particularly vulnerable to flood disasters owning to its rapid urbanization and climate change zhou et al 2017 three flood prone sites located in the low lying sections of the highly urbanized downtown area were selected as study sites fig 1 site a is located at an intersection with a long flow path length and gentle slope sites b1 and b2 are located at interchanges under different concave down overpass bridges with short catchment distances and steep slopes compared to site b1 site b2 has denser buildings and larger low lying area 2 2 data 2 2 1 rainfall data rainfall data were collected from a local meteorological station close to the three flooded sites and the selected meteorological station is 1 78 km from site a 0 92 km from site b1 and 2 3 km from site b2 respectively rainfall was recorded at an interval of 1 min the amounts duration and maximum intensity of the five rainfall events range from 39 7 to 169 4 mm 55 to 980 min and 1 2 to 3 1 mm min at all sites respectively table 2 2 2 2 urban flood data water depth at the three flooded sites was measured using radar at an interval of 5 min a total of 31 rainfall events were recorded from july 2018 to july 2019 most of which did not cause flooding at the three sites because of the equipment failures only five flood events have a complete record and they occurred on august 18 september 16 and september 17 2018 as well as on april 11 and may 27 2019 the maximum water depth ranges from 0 10 to 0 20 0 55 to 1 37 and 0 29 to 1 08 m at sites a b1 and b2 respectively table 2 2 2 3 data processing there are 565 1774 and 1026 records for sites a b1 and b2 respectively records of each site were divided into training validation and testing sets the ratio of training and validation to testing sets was 3 1 three events were used for training and validation among which validation accounted for 0 1 leaving one event for testing flood events with the maximum and minimum peaks were included in the training and validation sets the max min normalization method was used to standardize the rainfall records and urban flood records to the range of 0 1 inverse normalization of the simulated water depth was required to restore their original magnitudes tensorflow and keras were used as deep learning frameworks and python3 7 was chosen as the programming language rectified linear units ding et al 2020 were used as the activation function in the dense layer behind the lstm layer 3 method 3 1 framework the proposed alstm dw model fig 2 comprises the dtsw scheme in the input module an attention mechanism based on lstm in the network module a wmse loss function and the ga in the optimization module the rainfall features are extracted in the input module and then entered into the network module to simulate the flood hydrograph the optimization module minimizes the error between the simulated and observed water depth data during the training period in this study separate models were trained for each site and the trained models were used for flood hydrograph prediction 3 1 1 double time sliding windows the time series can be separated into the general tendency fluctuations and noise elsner 2002 the general tendency of a time series refers to its long term behavior or pattern it can be characterized as the overall direction of the series reflecting whether the values are increasing decreasing or remaining relatively stable over time the fluctuations of a time series refer to the variability or changes in the values over time which can be regular or irregular the general tendency and fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in weather patterns human activities or natural disturbances the noise of a time series refers to random and unpredictable variations in the values that cannot be attributed to any identifiable factor noise can be caused by measurement errors sampling errors or other random influences urban runoff is generated when the cumulative rainfall exceeds a certain threshold p s considering the initial loss tularam and ilahee 2007 time of concentration mccuen et al 1984 and discharge capacity of inlets xia et al 2022 and t w 0 is defined to represent the time corresponding to the rainfall threshold cheng et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b in the water depth time series the general tendency up to time t is affected by the rainfall during the whole time sliding window t w t w 0 t o t which reflects the long term behavior of rainfall whereas the fluctuations at time t are mainly determined by the rainfall during the adjacent time sliding window t a t a 0 t o t which reflects the variability of rainfall in the lag time see fig 2 the dtsw scheme is proposed to extract dynamic rainfall characteristics using three input factors from t a including rainfall accumulation centroid hood et al 2007 and peak amplitude smith et al 2011 breinl et al 2021 as well as two input factors from t w including rainfall accumulation and centroid 1 x 1 t i t a 0 t p i 2 x 2 t i t a 0 t i p i i t a 0 t p i δ t 3 x 3 t p i p m i t a 0 t p i where x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent the accumulation centroid and peak amplitude of the rainfall in t a respectively t is the predicting time t a 0 is the starting time of the adjacent time sliding window t a 0 is greater than or equal to t w 0 i and p i represent the time and rainfall intensity during period t a respectively p i is the rainfall value greater than the average value p in period t a and m is the number of p i 4 v x 4 t i t w 0 t p i 5 x 5 t i t w 0 t i p i i t w 0 t p i δ t where x 4 and x 5 represent the accumulation and centroid of the rainfall in t w respectively t w 0 is the starting time of the whole time sliding window i and p i represent the time and rainfall intensity during period t w respectively 3 1 2 attention mechanism based lstm the lstm network was designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem of the basic rnn when handling the long distance dependence task it is capable of memorizing long term historical information through the cell state hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in flood forecasting the state of current water level is affected by the historical rainfall process as well as previous water level states the memory of long term or short term rainfall and flood information can be realized through the cell state unit of the lstm network and the degree of memory can be controlled using the gates kratzert et al 2018 however the contribution of each input rainfall factor to the water depth is different and changes over time indiscriminate consideration of the input rainfall factors may weaken their difference and ignore some key information the attention mechanism has been applied in previous studies ding et al 2020 noor et al 2022 which showed that it can selectively learn input information and perform better than the models without attention mechanism to capture the dynamic changes in the contribution of each input rainfall factor an attention mechanism based lstm network was used for urban flood forecasting 6 e t k w x t k b 7 α t k exp e t k k 1 n e t k 8 x t k α t k x t k where w is weight b is the bias of the raw attention weights and k represents different input factors as shown in fig 3 the attention mechanism structure was embedded following the input layer when the dense layer receives input factors x t k raw attention weights e t k are generated by the mapping function and normalized to calculate attention weights α t k through the softmax activation function as the output of the multiply layer x t k is obtained by combining the input factor with its corresponding attention weight the structure of the lstm neural network includes the memory cell state hidden layer state input gate forget gate and output gate the current input gate i t forget gate f t and output gate o t are generated respectively by considering current attention input x t and the previous state of hidden layer h t 1 through sigmoid activation function σ within the range of 0 1 the current memory cell state c t is determined by current input information g x t and the memory cell state at previous time c t 1 with the degree of update of g x t being determined by i t and the degree of forgetting of c t 1 being determined by f t the current hidden layer state h t is determined by c t through the hyperbolic tangent activation function tanh with the degree of output of c t being determined by o t finally h t is passed to the next moment fig 3 3 1 3 loss function the training of the neural networks is embedded into the parameter search using the ga michalewicz and schoenauer 1996 that is for each parameter setting a new neural network is trained the parameters that are optimized are the window parameters including t a and p s determining the size of t w in the input module as well as the hyper parameters including time steps dimension of output layer batch size and epochs in the neural network the window parameters of different flooding sites may be different considering the differences in catchment characteristics and drainage capacity during the training period an adaptive moment estimation method adam a variant of the gradient descent method was used to optimize the weights and biases of the neural network to minimize the loss function the reweight based method assigns different weights to samples from different depth categories to prevent the model from paying too much attention to majority categories and ignoring minority categories the weight value can be determined by prior knowledge or is equal to the inverse of the class frequency or effective class frequency wu et al 2021 previous research has shown that the water depth threshold on roadways is 0 10 m for high velocity floods shand et al 2011 which has been used to determine flood and non flood locations within a road segment data set a new loss function called the wmse was defined to mitigate the imbalance of urban flood samples fig 4 urban flood samples were divided equally into n groups according to the water depth threshold m 0 1 m in the sample groups the sample sizes of water depths above and below the water depth threshold were generally remarkably different samples with water depth greater than 0 1 m as the minority category were heavily under represented compared to those with water depth less than 0 1 m as the majority category however the minority category was more important than the majority category garcía et al 2014 in the case of balanced samples the proportion pr of samples in each interval group was expected to be the same 1 n thus the class frequencies of samples with water depth less than and greater than 0 1 m were expected to be 1 n and n 1 n respectively fig 4 to alleviate the imbalance of data sets with water depths above and below the threshold the cumulative errors of majority categories were assigned with small weights of α while those of minority categories were assigned with large weights of β mitigating the dominance of the majority categories in the training period 9 n p m 10 α 1 m 1 n 11 β 1 n m n 1 n 12 wmse q obs 0 1 α q obs q sim 2 q obs 0 1 β q obs q sim 2 where q is water depth p is the maximum value of the sample n is the number of total intervals m is the water depth threshold m 0 1 m n is the total number of samples and m is the total number of samples with water depth less than m thus α and β can be calculated using equations 10 and 11 and assigned to the loss term of the sample with water depth 0 1 m and water depth greater than 0 1 m respectively wmse can be estimated using equation 12 3 2 comparison models four comparative experiments were set up table 3 comparative experiment a was set up to verify the effectiveness of s111 alstm dw by comparing it with two models s422 and s342 s422 is the lstm network with time series of rainfall intensity as input zounemat kermani et al 2020 and s342 is the dnn network with statistics of rainfall intensity as input kim and han 2020 both of them used mse as loss functions the other three comparative experiments b c and d with one of the three modules changed are used to verify the effectiveness of the dtsw input scheme att lstm and wmse respectively in experiment b the time series of rain intensity statistics of rainfall intensity and rainfall factors from the single t a window were used for comparison with the dtsw scheme in the input module the window parameter t a and hyper parameters in all comparison models were optimized using the ga 1 rain intensity time series as input 13 r t p t 2 statistics of rainfall intensity as input 14 r t φ 1 p t a 0 p t a 0 1 p t φ 5 p t a 0 p t a 0 1 p t 1 5 where φ 1 5 are the five common statistics at time t cumulative amount peak value peak position skewness and kurtosis kim and han

comparison was a dnn which is widely used for rapid flood prediction zounemat kermani et al 2020 these two networks dnn and lstm without an attention mechanism were used for comparison in the network module 1 lstm as the network structure 17 q t 1 j r t r t 1 r t n q t where q t 1 is the water depth at time t 1 and function j represents the complex response between the water depth and rainfall 2

performance evaluation the three evaluation metrics used in this study considers not only the overall fitting trend but also the most concerned peak simulation in flood events which includes coefficient of determination r 2 nagelkerke 1991 peak error e p hu et al 2018 and time to peak error e t 21 r 2 1 t 1 n q obs t q sim t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where n is the number of samples q is the water depth m q is the average value of the water depth subscript obs represents the observed value and subscript sim represents the simulated value the simulation performance of the model is better when r 2 is larger and the calculated r 2 value can be negative when the regression line is worse than when the mean value is used 22 e p q obs p q sim p where q p is the peak value of water depth in a flood event 23 e t t obs p t sim p where t p is the time required to reach the peak water depth in min the simulation performance of the model is better when e p and e t were smaller 3 3 2 cross validation when the data set is small k fold cross validation can be used to maximize the size of the training set making full use of the data which is a more robust estimate of the model performance in this study the data set of a flood site was divided into four subsets each of which is an independently distributed rainfall flood event four fold cross validation tests were conducted at site b2 in each cross validation test three events were trained leaving one event for testing the urban flood events of site b2 on august 18 2018 september 16 2018 may 27 2019 and september 17 2018 were used as the testing set of cross validation tests a b c and d respectively 4 results in this section the training and testing results of different models are compared to evaluate the performance of the alstm dw model the evaluation system was used to quantify the overall accuracy and peak errors of the simulated results 4 1 evaluation of model performance we evaluated the prediction performance of the proposed model and compared its performance with s422 and s342 at three flooded sites for the performance of the proposed model fig 6 the average r2 is over 0 82 the average ep is below 0 053 m and the average et is around 10 min during the training period the average r2 reaches 0 85 the average ep is below 0 015 m and the average et is within 2 min in the testing period the proposed model fits the observed flood data well and yields a satisfactory performance compared to s342 and s422 the forecast ability of the proposed model is greatly improved with the r2 scores improved by 15 and 135 respectively peak error decreased by 73 and 91 respectively and the time to peak error decreased by 82 and 94 respectively fig 6 the simulated hydrographs of these two comparison models show excessive fluctuation which is the result of improper responses to frequent variations in rainfall fig 5 for the simulations at different flooded sites the prediction ability of s422 is significantly weakened at interchange type sites b1and b2 flooded sites compared with that of site a the time to peak error of s342 increases sharply at site b2 while the proposed model shows good and stable performance at each site 4 2 inter comparison of different modeling schemes the proposed model was further evaluated by conducting groups of control trials in terms of three aspects input scheme network structure and loss function the training results are listed in appendix a and the testing results for each input scheme are shown in figs 7 and 8 we first studied the impact of different input schemes on the model performance figs 7 and 8 s411 using rainfall intensity time series as input shows frequent fluctuations in the simulated hydrographs fig 7a 7b and 7c outlier behavior with r2 values below 0 fig 8a and large errors with et exceeding 30 min at two interchange sites fig 8c compared with the proposed model s411 has an average decrease of 110 in r2 and an average delay of 28 min in et for the model using statistics of rainfall intensity as the input s311 exhibits poor performance in peak prediction with an average increase of 211 in ep and an average delay of 11 min in et compared to the proposed model and the time to peak error even exceeds 50 min during prolonged rainfall events at site b2 fig 8c the prediction results of s211 which uses input factors from the ta window perform poorly on peak prediction at the three flooded sites fig 8b with an average increase of 0 1 m in ep we then explored the impact of different networks on the model performance figs 7 and 8 the models using dnn s131 and s141 exhibits an excessive fluctuation problem during the training period fig a3 and testing hydrographs fig 7d and 7f particularly at sites a and b2 and a large time to peak error average of 16 min in the training period fig a4 whereas the models using the lstm network s111 and s121 show better performance without excessive fluctuations in the hydrographs the testing performances of the models using dnn and lstm s111 and s131 are effectively improved by combining the attention mechanism with their r2 values increasing by approximately 0 13 at the interchange type flooded sites the peak error and time to peak error decreased by approximately 88 and 45 respectively on average fig 8d 8e and 8f finally we investigated the impact of different loss functions on the model performance figs 7 and 8 s112 using mse as the optimization target shows large errors with ep value exceeding 0 1 m and et exceeding 50 min at site b2 s111 using the wmse loss function has better performance at the three flooded sites which can be seen from its improved overall trend and peak prediction performance with an average increase of 0 1 in r2 and decreases of approximately 88 and 54 in ep and et respectively during the testing period fig 8g 8 h and 8i in addition the hydrographs of s111 show less fluctuations in the minute scale water depth prediction than those of s112 which can be seen in the performance at site b2 fig 7i 4 3 cross validation the four fold cross validation method was used to explore whether the prediction performance of the proposed model still performed well with different training data the proposed model performs the best in each cross validation test with the highest r2 value and the lowest peak error on average fig 9 moreover the proposed model alleviates the excessive fluctuation in the flood hydrograph caused by the high frequency changes in the rainfall data fig a7 the three metrics of dnn and lstm are similar in fig 8 while situations differ in the cross validation results the dnn model has poor performance with a low fitting degree and large time to peak error in tests a b and c fig 9 the weaknesses of the dnn are also reflected in the cross validation hydrographs fig a7g 7h and 7i where excessive fluctuations existed for the model using rainfall intensity time series as the input the prediction results deviate greatly from the observed data and the peak value is incorrectly predicted in terms of magnitude and timing in test a the rainfall event of the testing set is more intense and lasts longer than that of the training set resulting in a larger error in the peak value in the prediction results compared with the other tests in the cross validation fig 9b 5 discussion the effectiveness of the proposed model was verified through a series of inter comparison experiments 5 1 effect of input schemes on model performance the poor performance of the s411 model lies in the ignorance of the lag response to rainfall and the cumulative process of urban flooding when using the raw rainfall intensity as the input the outlier behavior and frequent fluctuation in the output hydrographs of s411 show its sensitivity to the penalty terms of the loss function and the high variation in rainfall data for a model using statistics of rainfall intensity as the input the expansion of input dimensions can help the model perform better predictions to a certain extent kim and han 2020 which has only been proven in the total overflow forecast on a daily scale however in the high temporal resolution process prediction in this study s311 using statistics of rainfall intensity as the input exhibits unstable performance in peak prediction therefore models that use these two input schemes cannot withstand the challenge of high time resolution prediction chang et al 2014 kim han 2020 moreover the poor prediction performance at the peak value of the model using input factors from the ta window s211 suggests that the factors in the tw window are indispensable for urban flood forecasting models the main differences between the dtsw input scheme and these three comparison input schemes are the consideration of the urban flood mechanism and the effective extraction of rainfall features which is the key to improving the model prediction capability this comparison reveals that the use of input factors extracted from ta and tw can better learn the complex response between rainfall and flooding effectively improve the prediction capability of the dl based urban flood model and mitigate the excessive fluctuation problem in forecasted flood hydrographs 5 2 effect of network structures on model performance the poor performance in cross validation and excessive fluctuations of the hydrographs in the dnns s131 and s141 are mainly because these models are driven only by the rainfall related inputs that originally bear high variations whereas the models using the lstm network s111 and s121 facilitate extra input information from the previously forecasted water depth resulting in better performance in addition the reason for the poor performance of models without the attention mechanism is that the indiscriminate consideration of each input factor weakens the difference between the input factors and ignores some key input information the attention mechanism can help the model assign different weights to input factors extract more critical information and enable the model to make more accurate judgments without incurring greater costs for the calculation and storage of the model ding et al 2020 this comparison indicates that using the attention mechanism combined with the lstm neural network helps mitigate the excessive fluctuation problem better captures the dynamic process of urban flooding and improves the forecasting ability of the dl based urban flood model 5 3 effect of loss functions on model performance the mse loss function considers every sample to be equally important in the training period which leads to an error of the minority sample water depth greater than 0 1 m being larger than that of the majority sample water depth less than 0 1 m fig 7g 7 h and 7i this comparison verifies that mitigating the sample imbalance problem by assigning different weights to unbalanced samples can effectively improve the peak prediction ability of dl based urban flood models 5 4 effectiveness of the proposed model the proposed model is flexible because the ga can automatically adjust parameters for different flooded sites pan et al 2022 the window parameters t a p s in the dtsw input scheme are important for improving the prediction ability of the dl based urban flood model the optimization result of p s for each flooded site is approximately around 6 mm table a1 the optimization result of t a for each flooded site reflect the lag time between precipitation and flooding in the catchment which is influenced by the local drainage capacity catchment area slope etc the performance characteristics of the different models under different cross validation tests are consistent and the proposed model performs the best the cross validation results show that a training set containing flood events with the maximum and minimum peaks of water depth is important for dl models to improve their forecasting ability when samples are limited fig 9 undoubtedly for dl models more flood events included in the training set can generate a better prediction performance therefore the long term collection of high quality rainfall and flood records of urban flood events used to expand the training set plays an important role in enhancing the robustness and applicability of the dl based urban flood model rené et al 2014 shen et al 2018 5 5 uncertainty and applicability of the proposed model the main sources of uncertainty include the input data and network training in this study we used four fold cross validation to handle data uncertainty by dividing the data set into four subsets and choosing one subset for testing and the rest for training considering the randomness of the weight initialization we conducted repeated experiments to verify the reliability of our testing results fig a8 the testing results of each comparison model in the repeated experiments were similar to those in the inter comparison experiments figs 6 and 8 collecting more rainfall and water depth data from different sources will be considered to mitigate the uncertainty of observational errors in the future in terms of applicability the proposed model can be combined with rainfall forecast products to perform urban flood predictions under different lead times it can be easily applied to different flooded sites in other urbanized regions by using local rainfall and flood data however there are some limitations to its application the proposed model cannot provide two dimensional information such as the flooded area because it only considers the time dimensional information of input data as a point prediction model that does not consider the spatial differences and interconnections between different flooded sites the proposed model should be trained for each site and used for prediction at the same site however previous research has shown that dl has a high capacity for transfer learning as demonstrated by streamflow prediction kratzert et al 2019 the transfer learning performance of the proposed model was tested in supplementary experiments where the model was trained using data from one flood site but was applied to predict water depth at the other two sites the results of these experiments are shown in fig a9 in future studies more urban flood records will be used to improve the accuracy of the alstm dw model moreover the applicability of the alstm dw model is expected to be further improved by considering the topology land use pipe network data and rainfall data from more rain gauges as inputs simultaneously 6 conclusions the existing deep learning based urban flood models for high temporal resolution prediction have three major challenges effective rainfall feature extraction dynamic capture of urban rainfall flooding response and mitigation of sample imbalance to address these challenges an attention mechanism based long short term memory network with a double time sliding windows input scheme and a weighted mean square error loss function was proposed the effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated by comparing with models of different architectures the following main conclusions were drawn 1 the proposed model successfully learns the complex relationship between urban flooding and rainfall making it the top performing model in predicting minute scale water depth dynamics compared to the other models tested in this study this is demonstrated by its remarkable r2 scores exceeding 0 85 and consistently low average peak error with an average of below 0 015 m for ep and 2 min for et 2 the model performance is greatly improved by utilizing the double time sliding windows input scheme additionally the attention mechanism based long short term network is effective in accurately capturing the dynamic flood process and reducing excessive fluctuations in the output hydrographs the peak prediction ability can be improved by assigning different weights to imbalanced samples 3 in terms of practical applications the proposed model can be readily employed to assess flood prone areas across different urban regions however its effectiveness can be enhanced through additional training with more urban flood records as well as by taking into account a greater range of spatial differences and interconnections between different flooded sites

1950,rapid and accurate urban flood forecasting with high temporal resolution is critical to address future flood risks under urbanization and climate change machine learning models are increasingly used for flood forecasting however they are limited in their ability to extract effective features from rainfall data and capture dynamic runoff processes this study proposes an attention mechanism based long short term memory lstm network named as alstm dw which uses double time sliding windows dtsw and a weighted mean square error wmse loss function the alstm dw model was applied to three urban flooding hotspots in shenzhen china and its effectiveness was verified through a series of comparative experiments the results obtained show that 1 the proposed model performs well with a coefficient of determination larger than 0 85 peak flow error smaller than 0 015 m and time to peak error smaller than 2 min on average in testing periods 2 the use of dtsw helps extract effective rainfall features and mitigate excessive fluctuations in forecasted hydrographs caused by over response to rainfall 3 adding the attention mechanism to the lstm network helps consider the varying contribution of each input factor over time and 4 the wmse improves the ability of the network to predict flood peaks with an average decrease of 88 and 54 in peak flow error and time to peak error respectively therefore the alstm dw model shows promising potential for providing accurate flood forecasting which can support effective flood emergency operations keywords deep learning dynamic

frequent natural hazard in human society knebl et al 2005 teng et al 2017 yang et al 2022 due to rapid urbanization and climate change frequent and intense flood events have become a major threat faced by many cities worldwide zhou et al 2019 dao et al 2020 urban flood forecasting plays an essential role in supporting emergency management and in developing strategies to mitigate future flood hazards rosenzweig et al 2021 flood models can be divided into data driven and process based models and the latter can be further divided into hydrological and hydrodynamic models hydrological models based on watershed hydrology are used for streamflow forecasting in the entire watershed or catchment area salvadore et al 2015 compared with hydrological models hydrodynamic models are able to consider the hydraulic characteristics of urban drainage systems and micro topographies devia et al 2015 brendel et al 2020 khanam et al 2021 nevertheless they require more computational time and higher terrain accuracy yang et al 2020 therefore it is a major challenge for high resolution process based models to provide both rapid and accurate urban flood predictions shen et al 2015 zounemat kermani et al 2020 to achieve rapid forecasting data driven models are often used as alternatives to hydrological hydrodynamic models because of their easy construction and high computational efficiency mosavi et al 2018 li willems 2020 fu et al 2022 the latest data driven models for urban flood prediction are reviewed and summarized in table 1 table 1 shows many data driven methods that have been applied in urban flood forecasting motta et al 2021 such as logistic regression li willems 2020 decision trees wu et al 2020 and random forests zahura et al 2020 in recent years neural networks have been widely used because of their capability to tackle non linear modeling tasks nourani and komasi 2013 deep neural networks dnns have also been used to improve predictive accuracy berkhahn et al 2019 kim han 2020 darabi et al 2021 siam et al 2022 for example convolutional neural networks were used to learn spatial features from catchment characteristics and rainfall guo et al 2021 löwe et al 2021 as an advanced recurrent neural network the lstm network is capable of capturing both periodic and random behavior of time series data enabling it to learn the input output relationship more accurately hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 mouatadid et al 2019 hu et al 2019 gude et al 2020 fang et al 2021 compared with other neural networks yang et al 2020 cheng et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b gao et al 2020 and process based models tian et al 2018 fan et al 2020 because of the scarcity of observed flood data in urban regions rené et al 2014 fu et al 2022 hydrological hydrodynamic models have been used to generate training samples by synthesizing a large number of simulated scenarios table 1 while some deep learning dl models for urban flood prediction have been trained using observed water depth records they have been found to predict only the occurrence of flooding li willems 2020 motta et al 2021 or maximum water depth of a flood event wu et al 2020 rather than the hydrograph of water depth table 1 to the best of our knowledge no research has investigated the capacity of dl in modeling urban flood dynamic processes using high variability observed rainfall and urban flood records at the minute scale challenges remain in dl based urban flood modeling the first is how to effectively extract features from input rainfall data previous research has used the following inputs rainfall factors which include rainfall intensity time series cheng et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b and statistics of rainfall intensity total rainfall maximum rainfall standard deviation skewness and kurtosis kim han 2020 meteorological factors temperature humidity and wind speed motta et al 2021 or underlying urban characteristic factors land use terrain zahura et al 2020 permeability wu et al 2020 topology löwe et al 2021 darabi et al 2021 and sewer network li willems 2020 table 1 among them rainfall factors are the most indispensable input factors for flood prediction however the urban flood mechanism is rarely considered in the construction of rainfall factors the second is properly capturing the dynamic response between rainfall and flooding because the high variability of rainfall data may induce excessive fluctuations in the output water depth with existing dl methods huang et al 2018 the third is that little attention has been paid to the sample imbalance problem in the dl based urban flood forecasting li et al 2021 in general the sizes of different flood water depth classes in the training data vary significantly that is there are far more low water depth records than high water depth records leading to underestimated high water depths man et al 2021 previous studies used loss functions such as mean absolute error mae zahura et al 2020 kim han 2020 mean square error mse löwe et al 2021 and root mean square error rmse berkhahn et al 2019 guo et al 2021 which didn t consider the sample imbalance in flood data this study presents a new deep learning model named alstm dw which is an attention mechanism based long short term memory att lstm network with double time sliding windows dtsw and a weighted mean square error wmse loss function this model is designed to address three critical challenges encountered in high temporal resolution urban flood prediction effective rainfall feature extraction dynamic capture of urban rainfall runoff response and mitigation of sample imbalance problems observed rainfall and water depth records from study sites are used to train and test the proposed model the performances of the proposed model are presented and discussed according to three evaluation metrics comparative experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the dtsw att lstm and wmse in improving model performance respectively 2 study sites and data 2 1 study sites shenzhen located in the south of guangdong province china is particularly vulnerable to flood disasters owning to its rapid urbanization and climate change zhou et al 2017 three flood prone sites located in the low lying sections of the highly urbanized downtown area were selected as study sites fig 1 site a is located at an intersection with a long flow path length and gentle slope sites b1 and b2 are located at interchanges under different concave down overpass bridges with short catchment distances and steep slopes compared to site b1 site b2 has denser buildings and larger low lying area 2 2 data 2 2 1 rainfall data rainfall data were collected from a local meteorological station close to the three flooded sites and the selected meteorological station is 1 78 km from site a 0 92 km from site b1 and 2 3 km from site b2 respectively rainfall was recorded at an interval of 1 min the amounts duration and maximum intensity of the five rainfall events range from 39 7 to 169 4 mm 55 to 980 min and 1 2 to 3 1 mm min at all sites respectively table 2 2 2 2 urban flood data water depth at the three flooded sites was measured using radar at an interval of 5 min a total of 31 rainfall events were recorded from july 2018 to july 2019 most of which did not cause flooding at the three sites because of the equipment failures only five flood events have a complete record and they occurred on august 18 september 16 and september 17 2018 as well as on april 11 and may 27 2019 the maximum water depth ranges from 0 10 to 0 20 0 55 to 1 37 and 0 29 to 1 08 m at sites a b1 and b2 respectively table 2 2 2 3 data processing there are 565 1774 and 1026 records for sites a b1 and b2 respectively records of each site were divided into training validation and testing sets the ratio of training and validation to testing sets was 3 1 three events were used for training and validation among which validation accounted for 0 1 leaving one event for testing flood events with the maximum and minimum peaks were included in the training and validation sets the max min normalization method was used to standardize the rainfall records and urban flood records to the range of 0 1 inverse normalization of the simulated water depth was required to restore their original magnitudes tensorflow and keras were used as deep learning frameworks and python3 7 was chosen as the programming language rectified linear units ding et al 2020 were used as the activation function in the dense layer behind the lstm layer 3 method 3 1 framework the proposed alstm dw model fig 2 comprises the dtsw scheme in the input module an attention mechanism based on lstm in the network module a wmse loss function and the ga in the optimization module the rainfall features are extracted in the input module and then entered into the network module to simulate the flood hydrograph the optimization module minimizes the error between the simulated and observed water depth data during the training period in this study separate models were trained for each site and the trained models were used for flood hydrograph prediction 3 1 1 double time sliding windows the time series can be separated into the general tendency fluctuations and noise elsner 2002 the general tendency of a time series refers to its long term behavior or pattern it can be characterized as the overall direction of the series reflecting whether the values are increasing decreasing or remaining relatively stable over time the fluctuations of a time series refer to the variability or changes in the values over time which can be regular or irregular the general tendency and fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in weather patterns human activities or natural disturbances the noise of a time series refers to random and unpredictable variations in the values that cannot be attributed to any identifiable factor noise can be caused by measurement errors sampling errors or other random influences urban runoff is generated when the cumulative rainfall exceeds a certain threshold p s considering the initial loss tularam and ilahee 2007 time of concentration mccuen et al 1984 and discharge capacity of inlets xia et al 2022 and t w 0 is defined to represent the time corresponding to the rainfall threshold cheng et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b in the water depth time series the general tendency up to time t is affected by the rainfall during the whole time sliding window t w t w 0 t o t which reflects the long term behavior of rainfall whereas the fluctuations at time t are mainly determined by the rainfall during the adjacent time sliding window t a t a 0 t o t which reflects the variability of rainfall in the lag time see fig 2 the dtsw scheme is proposed to extract dynamic rainfall characteristics using three input factors from t a including rainfall accumulation centroid hood et al 2007 and peak amplitude smith et al 2011 breinl et al 2021 as well as two input factors from t w including rainfall accumulation and centroid 1 x 1 t i t a 0 t p i 2 x 2 t i t a 0 t i p i i t a 0 t p i δ t 3 x 3 t p i p m i t a 0 t p i where x 1 x 2 and x 3 represent the accumulation centroid and peak amplitude of the rainfall in t a respectively t is the predicting time t a 0 is the starting time of the adjacent time sliding window t a 0 is greater than or equal to t w 0 i and p i represent the time and rainfall intensity during period t a respectively p i is the rainfall value greater than the average value p in period t a and m is the number of p i 4 v x 4 t i t w 0 t p i 5 x 5 t i t w 0 t i p i i t w 0 t p i δ t where x 4 and x 5 represent the accumulation and centroid of the rainfall in t w respectively t w 0 is the starting time of the whole time sliding window i and p i represent the time and rainfall intensity during period t w respectively 3 1 2 attention mechanism based lstm the lstm network was designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem of the basic rnn when handling the long distance dependence task it is capable of memorizing long term historical information through the cell state hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in flood forecasting the state of current water level is affected by the historical rainfall process as well as previous water level states the memory of long term or short term rainfall and flood information can be realized through the cell state unit of the lstm network and the degree of memory can be controlled using the gates kratzert et al 2018 however the contribution of each input rainfall factor to the water depth is different and changes over time indiscriminate consideration of the input rainfall factors may weaken their difference and ignore some key information the attention mechanism has been applied in previous studies ding et al 2020 noor et al 2022 which showed that it can selectively learn input information and perform better than the models without attention mechanism to capture the dynamic changes in the contribution of each input rainfall factor an attention mechanism based lstm network was used for urban flood forecasting 6 e t k w x t k b 7 α t k exp e t k k 1 n e t k 8 x t k α t k x t k where w is weight b is the bias of the raw attention weights and k represents different input factors as shown in fig 3 the attention mechanism structure was embedded following the input layer when the dense layer receives input factors x t k raw attention weights e t k are generated by the mapping function and normalized to calculate attention weights α t k through the softmax activation function as the output of the multiply layer x t k is obtained by combining the input factor with its corresponding attention weight the structure of the lstm neural network includes the memory cell state hidden layer state input gate forget gate and output gate the current input gate i t forget gate f t and output gate o t are generated respectively by considering current attention input x t and the previous state of hidden layer h t 1 through sigmoid activation function σ within the range of 0 1 the current memory cell state c t is determined by current input information g x t and the memory cell state at previous time c t 1 with the degree of update of g x t being determined by i t and the degree of forgetting of c t 1 being determined by f t the current hidden layer state h t is determined by c t through the hyperbolic tangent activation function tanh with the degree of output of c t being determined by o t finally h t is passed to the next moment fig 3 3 1 3 loss function the training of the neural networks is embedded into the parameter search using the ga michalewicz and schoenauer 1996 that is for each parameter setting a new neural network is trained the parameters that are optimized are the window parameters including t a and p s determining the size of t w in the input module as well as the hyper parameters including time steps dimension of output layer batch size and epochs in the neural network the window parameters of different flooding sites may be different considering the differences in catchment characteristics and drainage capacity during the training period an adaptive moment estimation method adam a variant of the gradient descent method was used to optimize the weights and biases of the neural network to minimize the loss function the reweight based method assigns different weights to samples from different depth categories to prevent the model from paying too much attention to majority categories and ignoring minority categories the weight value can be determined by prior knowledge or is equal to the inverse of the class frequency or effective class frequency wu et al 2021 previous research has shown that the water depth threshold on roadways is 0 10 m for high velocity floods shand et al 2011 which has been used to determine flood and non flood locations within a road segment data set a new loss function called the wmse was defined to mitigate the imbalance of urban flood samples fig 4 urban flood samples were divided equally into n groups according to the water depth threshold m 0 1 m in the sample groups the sample sizes of water depths above and below the water depth threshold were generally remarkably different samples with water depth greater than 0 1 m as the minority category were heavily under represented compared to those with water depth less than 0 1 m as the majority category however the minority category was more important than the majority category garcía et al 2014 in the case of balanced samples the proportion pr of samples in each interval group was expected to be the same 1 n thus the class frequencies of samples with water depth less than and greater than 0 1 m were expected to be 1 n and n 1 n respectively fig 4 to alleviate the imbalance of data sets with water depths above and below the threshold the cumulative errors of majority categories were assigned with small weights of α while those of minority categories were assigned with large weights of β mitigating the dominance of the majority categories in the training period 9 n p m 10 α 1 m 1 n 11 β 1 n m n 1 n 12 wmse q obs 0 1 α q obs q sim 2 q obs 0 1 β q obs q sim 2 where q is water depth p is the maximum value of the sample n is the number of total intervals m is the water depth threshold m 0 1 m n is the total number of samples and m is the total number of samples with water depth less than m thus α and β can be calculated using equations 10 and 11 and assigned to the loss term of the sample with water depth 0 1 m and water depth greater than 0 1 m respectively wmse can be estimated using equation 12 3 2 comparison models four comparative experiments were set up table 3 comparative experiment a was set up to verify the effectiveness of s111 alstm dw by comparing it with two models s422 and s342 s422 is the lstm network with time series of rainfall intensity as input zounemat kermani et al 2020 and s342 is the dnn network with statistics of rainfall intensity as input kim and han 2020 both of them used mse as loss functions the other three comparative experiments b c and d with one of the three modules changed are used to verify the effectiveness of the dtsw input scheme att lstm and wmse respectively in experiment b the time series of rain intensity statistics of rainfall intensity and rainfall factors from the single t a window were used for comparison with the dtsw scheme in the input module the window parameter t a and hyper parameters in all comparison models were optimized using the ga 1 rain intensity time series as input 13 r t p t 2 statistics of rainfall intensity as input 14 r t φ 1 p t a 0 p t a 0 1 p t φ 5 p t a 0 p t a 0 1 p t 1 5 where φ 1 5 are the five common statistics at time t cumulative amount peak value peak position skewness and kurtosis kim and han

performance evaluation the three evaluation metrics used in this study considers not only the overall fitting trend but also the most concerned peak simulation in flood events which includes coefficient of determination r 2 nagelkerke 1991 peak error e p hu et al 2018 and time to peak error e t 21 r 2 1 t 1 n q obs t q sim t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 where n is the number of samples q is the water depth m q is the average value of the water depth subscript obs represents the observed value and subscript sim represents the simulated value the simulation performance of the model is better when r 2 is larger and the calculated r 2 value can be negative when the regression line is worse than when the mean value is used 22 e p q obs p q sim p where q p is the peak value of water depth in a flood event 23 e t t obs p t sim p where t p is the time required to reach the peak water depth in min the simulation performance of the model is better when e p and e t were smaller 3 3 2 cross validation when the data set is small k fold cross validation can be used to maximize the size of the training set making full use of the data which is a more robust estimate of the model performance in this study the data set of a flood site was divided into four subsets each of which is an independently distributed rainfall flood event four fold cross validation tests were conducted at site b2 in each cross validation test three events were trained leaving one event for testing the urban flood events of site b2 on august 18 2018 september 16 2018 may 27 2019 and september 17 2018 were used as the testing set of cross validation tests a b c and d respectively 4 results in this section the training and testing results of different models are compared to evaluate the performance of the alstm dw model the evaluation system was used to quantify the overall accuracy and peak errors of the simulated results 4 1 evaluation of model performance we evaluated the prediction performance of the proposed model and compared its performance with s422 and s342 at three flooded sites for the performance of the proposed model fig 6 the average r2 is over 0 82 the average ep is below 0 053 m and the average et is around 10 min during the training period the average r2 reaches 0 85 the average ep is below 0 015 m and the average et is within 2 min in the testing period the proposed model fits the observed flood data well and yields a satisfactory performance compared to s342 and s422 the forecast ability of the proposed model is greatly improved with the r2 scores improved by 15 and 135 respectively peak error decreased by 73 and 91 respectively and the time to peak error decreased by 82 and 94 respectively fig 6 the simulated hydrographs of these two comparison models show excessive fluctuation which is the result of improper responses to frequent variations in rainfall fig 5 for the simulations at different flooded sites the prediction ability of s422 is significantly weakened at interchange type sites b1and b2 flooded sites compared with that of site a the time to peak error of s342 increases sharply at site b2 while the proposed model shows good and stable performance at each site 4 2 inter comparison of different modeling schemes the proposed model was further evaluated by conducting groups of control trials in terms of three aspects input scheme network structure and loss function the training results are listed in appendix a and the testing results for each input scheme are shown in figs 7 and 8 we first studied the impact of different input schemes on the model performance figs 7 and 8 s411 using rainfall intensity time series as input shows frequent fluctuations in the simulated hydrographs fig 7a 7b and 7c outlier behavior with r2 values below 0 fig 8a and large errors with et exceeding 30 min at two interchange sites fig 8c compared with the proposed model s411 has an average decrease of 110 in r2 and an average delay of 28 min in et for the model using statistics of rainfall intensity as the input s311 exhibits poor performance in peak prediction with an average increase of 211 in ep and an average delay of 11 min in et compared to the proposed model and the time to peak error even exceeds 50 min during prolonged rainfall events at site b2 fig 8c the prediction results of s211 which uses input factors from the ta window perform poorly on peak prediction at the three flooded sites fig 8b with an average increase of 0 1 m in ep we then explored the impact of different networks on the model performance figs 7 and 8 the models using dnn s131 and s141 exhibits an excessive fluctuation problem during the training period fig a3 and testing hydrographs fig 7d and 7f particularly at sites a and b2 and a large time to peak error average of 16 min in the training period fig a4 whereas the models using the lstm network s111 and s121 show better performance without excessive fluctuations in the hydrographs the testing performances of the models using dnn and lstm s111 and s131 are effectively improved by combining the attention mechanism with their r2 values increasing by approximately 0 13 at the interchange type flooded sites the peak error and time to peak error decreased by approximately 88 and 45 respectively on average fig 8d 8e and 8f finally we investigated the impact of different loss functions on the model performance figs 7 and 8 s112 using mse as the optimization target shows large errors with ep value exceeding 0 1 m and et exceeding 50 min at site b2 s111 using the wmse loss function has better performance at the three flooded sites which can be seen from its improved overall trend and peak prediction performance with an average increase of 0 1 in r2 and decreases of approximately 88 and 54 in ep and et respectively during the testing period fig 8g 8 h and 8i in addition the hydrographs of s111 show less fluctuations in the minute scale water depth prediction than those of s112 which can be seen in the performance at site b2 fig 7i 4 3 cross validation the four fold cross validation method was used to explore whether the prediction performance of the proposed model still performed well with different training data the proposed model performs the best in each cross validation test with the highest r2 value and the lowest peak error on average fig 9 moreover the proposed model alleviates the excessive fluctuation in the flood hydrograph caused by the high frequency changes in the rainfall data fig a7 the three metrics of dnn and lstm are similar in fig 8 while situations differ in the cross validation results the dnn model has poor performance with a low fitting degree and large time to peak error in tests a b and c fig 9 the weaknesses of the dnn are also reflected in the cross validation hydrographs fig a7g 7h and 7i where excessive fluctuations existed for the model using rainfall intensity time series as the input the prediction results deviate greatly from the observed data and the peak value is incorrectly predicted in terms of magnitude and timing in test a the rainfall event of the testing set is more intense and lasts longer than that of the training set resulting in a larger error in the peak value in the prediction results compared with the other tests in the cross validation fig 9b 5 discussion the effectiveness of the proposed model was verified through a series of inter comparison experiments 5 1 effect of input schemes on model performance the poor performance of the s411 model lies in the ignorance of the lag response to rainfall and the cumulative process of urban flooding when using the raw rainfall intensity as the input the outlier behavior and frequent fluctuation in the output hydrographs of s411 show its sensitivity to the penalty terms of the loss function and the high variation in rainfall data for a model using statistics of rainfall intensity as the input the expansion of input dimensions can help the model perform better predictions to a certain extent kim and han 2020 which has only been proven in the total overflow forecast on a daily scale however in the high temporal resolution process prediction in this study s311 using statistics of rainfall intensity as the input exhibits unstable performance in peak prediction therefore models that use these two input schemes cannot withstand the challenge of high time resolution prediction chang et al 2014 kim han 2020 moreover the poor prediction performance at the peak value of the model using input factors from the ta window s211 suggests that the factors in the tw window are indispensable for urban flood forecasting models the main differences between the dtsw input scheme and these three comparison input schemes are the consideration of the urban flood mechanism and the effective extraction of rainfall features which is the key to improving the model prediction capability this comparison reveals that the use of input factors extracted from ta and tw can better learn the complex response between rainfall and flooding effectively improve the prediction capability of the dl based urban flood model and mitigate the excessive fluctuation problem in forecasted flood hydrographs 5 2 effect of network structures on model performance the poor performance in cross validation and excessive fluctuations of the hydrographs in the dnns s131 and s141 are mainly because these models are driven only by the rainfall related inputs that originally bear high variations whereas the models using the lstm network s111 and s121 facilitate extra input information from the previously forecasted water depth resulting in better performance in addition the reason for the poor performance of models without the attention mechanism is that the indiscriminate consideration of each input factor weakens the difference between the input factors and ignores some key input information the attention mechanism can help the model assign different weights to input factors extract more critical information and enable the model to make more accurate judgments without incurring greater costs for the calculation and storage of the model ding et al 2020 this comparison indicates that using the attention mechanism combined with the lstm neural network helps mitigate the excessive fluctuation problem better captures the dynamic process of urban flooding and improves the forecasting ability of the dl based urban flood model 5 3 effect of loss functions on model performance the mse loss function considers every sample to be equally important in the training period which leads to an error of the minority sample water depth greater than 0 1 m being larger than that of the majority sample water depth less than 0 1 m fig 7g 7 h and 7i this comparison verifies that mitigating the sample imbalance problem by assigning different weights to unbalanced samples can effectively improve the peak prediction ability of dl based urban flood models 5 4 effectiveness of the proposed model the proposed model is flexible because the ga can automatically adjust parameters for different flooded sites pan et al 2022 the window parameters t a p s in the dtsw input scheme are important for improving the prediction ability of the dl based urban flood model the optimization result of p s for each flooded site is approximately around 6 mm table a1 the optimization result of t a for each flooded site reflect the lag time between precipitation and flooding in the catchment which is influenced by the local drainage capacity catchment area slope etc the performance characteristics of the different models under different cross validation tests are consistent and the proposed model performs the best the cross validation results show that a training set containing flood events with the maximum and minimum peaks of water depth is important for dl models to improve their forecasting ability when samples are limited fig 9 undoubtedly for dl models more flood events included in the training set can generate a better prediction performance therefore the long term collection of high quality rainfall and flood records of urban flood events used to expand the training set plays an important role in enhancing the robustness and applicability of the dl based urban flood model rené et al 2014 shen et al 2018 5 5 uncertainty and applicability of the proposed model the main sources of uncertainty include the input data and network training in this study we used four fold cross validation to handle data uncertainty by dividing the data set into four subsets and choosing one subset for testing and the rest for training considering the randomness of the weight initialization we conducted repeated experiments to verify the reliability of our testing results fig a8 the testing results of each comparison model in the repeated experiments were similar to those in the inter comparison experiments figs 6 and 8 collecting more rainfall and water depth data from different sources will be considered to mitigate the uncertainty of observational errors in the future in terms of applicability the proposed model can be combined with rainfall forecast products to perform urban flood predictions under different lead times it can be easily applied to different flooded sites in other urbanized regions by using local rainfall and flood data however there are some limitations to its application the proposed model cannot provide two dimensional information such as the flooded area because it only considers the time dimensional information of input data as a point prediction model that does not consider the spatial differences and interconnections between different flooded sites the proposed model should be trained for each site and used for prediction at the same site however previous research has shown that dl has a high capacity for transfer learning as demonstrated by streamflow prediction kratzert et al 2019 the transfer learning performance of the proposed model was tested in supplementary experiments where the model was trained using data from one flood site but was applied to predict water depth at the other two sites the results of these experiments are shown in fig a9 in future studies more urban flood records will be used to improve the accuracy of the alstm dw model moreover the applicability of the alstm dw model is expected to be further improved by considering the topology land use pipe network data and rainfall data from more rain gauges as inputs simultaneously 6 conclusions the existing deep learning based urban flood models for high temporal resolution prediction have three major challenges effective rainfall feature extraction dynamic capture of urban rainfall flooding response and mitigation of sample imbalance to address these challenges an attention mechanism based long short term memory network with a double time sliding windows input scheme and a weighted mean square error loss function was proposed the effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated by comparing with models of different architectures the following main conclusions were drawn 1 the proposed model successfully learns the complex relationship between urban flooding and rainfall making it the top performing model in predicting minute scale water depth dynamics compared to the other models tested in this study this is demonstrated by its remarkable r2 scores exceeding 0 85 and consistently low average peak error with an average of below 0 015 m for ep and 2 min for et 2 the model performance is greatly improved by utilizing the double time sliding windows input scheme additionally the attention mechanism based long short term network is effective in accurately capturing the dynamic flood process and reducing excessive fluctuations in the output hydrographs the peak prediction ability can be improved by assigning different weights to imbalanced samples 3 in terms of practical applications the proposed model can be readily employed to assess flood prone areas across different urban regions however its effectiveness can be enhanced through additional training with more urban flood records as well as by taking into account a greater range of spatial differences and interconnections between different flooded sites

1951,the construction of large scale dams creates tributary bays between the main and the tributary reservoirs the water temperature and water quality in the tributary reservoirs are inevitably affected by backflow from the main reservoir in this study the spatial temporal evolutions of water temperature biochemical oxygen demand bod and dissolved oxygen do in the baihetan reservoir and its four tributary reservoirs are investigated by building validating and applying the tbd temperature bod and do numerical model the results show that the influence of the main reservoir on its tributary reservoirs show seasonal patterns the water quality in the main reservoir is determined by inflow reaeration and temperature driven stratification all of which exhibit seasonal patterns stratification determines the fate of inflow after it enters the reservoir which leads to relatively low do concentration in the middle layer of the baihetan reservoir in summer and autumn for the tributary reservoirs water quality is also affected by the balancing between the upstream inflow and downstream backflow which varies both seasonally and as a function of the reservoir geometry these results have great significance in analyzing and understanding the environmental impact of large hydraulic projects which can be used as the basis for enacting hydraulic project plans and preserving the aquatic ecosystem in the reservoir areas keywords large stratified confluence reservoir dissolved oxygen temperature numerical simulation biochemical oxygen demand data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do is an important indicator that reflects the degree of pollution for environmental water bodies it serves as a key factor that affects the survival of aquatic organisms and the balance of aquatic ecosystems he et al 2014 failure to maintain a certain level of do in rivers causes damage to the aquatic ecosystem prasad et al 2014 talbot et al 2018 for example if the do concentration is less than 4 mg l many fish species will die due to anoxia if the do concentration is less than 2 mg l for several hours most fishes are unable to survive if the do concentration drops to zero the water body becomes black and smelly gunnarsli et al 2009 ruyet et al 2002 therefore to maintain the vital signs of fishes and the functionality of the aquatic ecosystem it is important to maintain the do concentration within a proper range the primary source of do in the water bodies is the oxygen in the atmosphere when do is consumed e g by respiration of aquatic organisms the water body keeps gaining oxygen from the atmosphere this process is termed re aeration the re aeration coefficient for rivers can be experimentally determined with the do balance method li et al 1992 the interference balance method and the trace method tsivoglou et al 1968 o connor 1983 related the re aeration coefficient to the wind speed based on the surface reconstruction theory dai et al 1995 built a linear relationship between the release coefficient of ammonia gas nh3 in ammonia water and the water temperature cheng et al 1995 proposed a relationship between the re aeration coefficient the mean flow speed and the mean kinetic energy at the free surface arora and keshari 2021 developed and validated a re aeration equation by modeling do in the yamuna river wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b performed a synthetic case study that assimilated observed do data in the hydrodynamic model of the seine river system nuruzzaman et al 2018 developed a re aeration rate equation for the pusu river in malaysia using a modified method based on flume sampling most of the existing studies focus on the do distribution and the re aeration processes in natural rivers or lakes reid et al 2015 nelson et al 2017 kaufman et al 2017 reeder et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b huai et al 2019 2020 bocaniov et al 2020 yang et al 2021 relatively few studies are targeted to the confluences in the reservoir systems chen et al 2013 in a reservoir system the spatial temporal variations of temperature bod do and bathymetry lead to complex hydrodynamic processes cardenas et al 2004 kaufman et al 2017 the rate and duration of water exchange between the main and the tributary reservoirs are the main factors affecting these processes which drive the transport of pollutants chang et al 2019 it has been recognized that the construction of dams has influence mostly negative on the water quality park et al 2014 chen et al 2020 in a multi reservoir system stratification stagnation and backflow from the main stream could deteriorate water quality in the tributary reservoirs ma et al 2016 zou et al 2017 in particular the level of stratification controls the vertical distribution of do which directly affects the evolution of water quality in the reservoirs zhao et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 in the past years multiple algae bloom events have been observed in the tributaries within the three gorges dam reservoir area ma et al 2016 it is thus of great scientific and practical importance to investigate the evolutions and interactions of temperature do and bod in reservoir systems especially at the confluence between the main and the tributary reservoirs in the present study following previous works of shen et al 2016 shen et al 2019 and shen et al 2021 which focused on the total dissolved gas in river channels and coastal sewage discharge a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic and water quality model to simulate temperature do and bod tbd was built for vertical cross sections of large scale deep water reservoirs the model is able to simulate the transport of non passive scalars e g do bod which allows us to investigate the distribution and transport of do at the confluence in a reservoir system previous studies mainly adopted the ce qual w2 w2 model to obtain the distribution of water quality in stratified reservoir zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019 in this work the proposed model is intentionally designed to describe the production consumption and degradation of do and bod it could be considered as an enhanced w2 model with the improved source item the model is tested at the newly built baihetan reservoir china and its four tributary reservoirs aiming at understanding the seasonal evolution patterns of do and bod in the reservoir system as well as the governing factors affecting these patterns the simulation results can provide foundations for further completing the water quality management model and the algae bloom warning system for the baihetan reservoir and its tributaries it can also provides scientific suggestions for the water quality research of other large scale water conservancy projects and the improvement measures of ecological environment impact 2 background the baihetan dam and reservoir is located in the main stream of the jinshajiang river in china it is the world s second largest hydropower plant second to the three gorges dam the average annual temperature precipitation and relative humidity are 21 7 c 715 9 mm and 63 respectively the annual rainfall days is approximately 100 the average annual flow rate of the jinshajiang river is 4190 m3 s with 3850 m3 s entering the baihetan reservoir measured at the wudongde dam after the baihetan hydropower plant is built the backwater length of the baihetan reservoir will be 182 km the maximum depth will exceed 240 m the reservoir area also includes four tributary reservoirs the heishui river the pudu river the xiaojiang river and the yili river the heishui river is located on the left bank of the main stream the other three tributaries are on the right bank the characteristics of these tributaries are presented in table 1 a summary of the annual average runoff in the main and tributary reservoirs is shown in table 2 full 3d hydrodynamic and water quality simulation of the entire reservoir area is impractical due to the extensive computational cost and strict requirements on mesh quality since the baihetan reservoir is long and narrow in shape 2d simulation of a vertical cross section is adequate in providing reasonable estimation of the do distribution in the present study the 2d simulation includes the exchange between the main tributary reservoirs and the backwater effects it provides spatial temporal predictions of the water quality in the entire baihetan reservoir area i e the main and all the tributary reservoirs 3 materials and methods this section describes the vertical 2d hydrodynamic and transport model we developed to simulate the temperature bod and do at river confluences in deep reservoir systems in the model the flow field is described using the 2d navier stokes equations with the rans turbulence closure the heat equation is used to describe temperature evolution in the reservoir water as well as across the water air interface these equations are well known and have been widely applied in existing reservoir models so they are not provided herein please refer to section 1 of the supporting information for the full forms of these equations in the following sections the novel features and the special treatments of the tbd model will be introduced which includes the water quality equation and the treatments of the bod do source terms 3 1 vertical 2d water quality model 3 1 1 the water quality equation the spatial temporal evolution do and bod is described using the width averaged transport equations 1 b η t x b d x η x z b d z η z u b η x w b η z b s η 2 b σ t x b d x σ x z b d z σ z u b σ x w b σ z b s σ where η mg l is the bod concentration σ mg l is the do concentration dx m2 s and dz m2 s are the horizontal and vertical eddy diffusivities s η mg l s is the source term of bod s σ mg l s is the source term of do 3 1 2 the source term bod consumes oxygen for degradation which is assumed to be a first order kinetic reaction the bod source term can be estimated as 3 s η k 1 t θ t 20 l b where k 1 t 1 s is the degradation coefficient of bod at 20 c the present study uses k 1 t 0 027d 1 following the water quality monitoring data of the three gorges dam reservoir area yu et al 2011 the influence of temperature on the degradation coefficient is corrected with the factor θ which is taken as 1 039 yu et al 2011 l b mg l is the bod concentration in the surface layer the source term includes photosynthesis and respiration of algae re aeration and degradation of bod these two processes are modeled as 4 s σ k g k r δ oa c a a s k 2

the do concentration a s m2 is the surface area k g 1 s is the growth rate of algae kr 1 s is the respiration rate of algae δ oa is the oxygen content coefficient of algae c a g m3 is the

5 7 k 2 t 1 895 v 0 657 h 1 35 1 0241 t 20 where v m s is the velocity h m is the water depth 3 2 discretization schemes different from feng et al 2013 who used finite difference method fdm method we apply the finite volume method fvm with a mixed scheme to discretize the differential equations compared with fdm fvm does not generate geometrically induced errors and fvm is more suitable for flow field with large gradient in stratified reservoirs the pimple algorithm osama and huckaby 2009 which merged the simple and piso is used to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations eq s1 the staggered grid is used to avoid checkerboard uneven pressure field the discretization of the free water surface equation adopts explicit scheme the discretization of the momentum equation employs a combining scheme where vertical diffusion is fully implicit while advection employs a time weighted central difference implicit scheme in the explicit part of the time weighted scheme a unique treatment was used for vertical advection which improves the overall accuracy the discretization of the transport equation is similar to that of the momentum equation in the calculation the navier stokes equations are solved first to create the flow field then this flow field is used to model the transport of temperature and water quality finally based on the updated temperature the flow field is corrected this process is iterated until the error margins of all equations are less than the predefined thresholds 3 3 model calibration and verification the baihetan hydropower plant has been put into operation on july of 2022 which is after the present study was conducted thus it is impractical and meaningless to collect do and bod data directly in the baihetan reservoir when it was under construction instead the proposed tbd model is validated using data collected in the shanmei and the daheiting reservoirs these two reservoirs are both long and narrow which is geometrically similar to the baihetan reservoir the following sections illustrate the configuration and the results of the mode verification tests 3 3 1 field data and caculation conditions of shanmei reservior the tbd model is first validated using field data collected at the shanmei reservoir chen 2012 the shanmei reservoir is located in the southeast china the top of the dam is 305 m long 8 m wide and the bottom of the dam is 312 8 m wide the total storage capacity is 655 million m3 it belongs to the subtropical marine monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 20 9 c in july and 12 1 c in january the annual sunshine hours vary from 1800 to 2200 the annual rainfall is 1600 mm the frost free period is 330 days the precipitation during the wet season from march to september accounts for 80 of the whole year the inter annual variation of precipitation is large the precipitation in wet years is less than half of that in dry years the shanmei reservoir is mainly developed for irrigation and water supply but it is also used for hydro power flood control and ecological purposes the normal water level in the reservoir is 96 5 m the maximum flood level in front of the dam is 102 1 m to model water quality in the shanmei reservoir the reservoir area is divided into 17 segments horizontal and 38 vertical cells the grid resolution is fixed at 1 5 m in the vertical direction the initial value is based on the measured value at the beginning of the simulation and the results in year 2008 are used to verify the water quality model the measured parameters include the temperature and do which were distributed in surface layer middle layer and bottom layer on may 4 july 2 and december 5 2008 the specific measurements are shown in table 3 3 3 2 field data and calculation conditions of daheiting reservior the tbd model was also validated using field data collected at the daheiting reservoir xu 2020 the water quality model is validated using field data collected at the daheiting reservoir daheiting reservoir is located on the main stream of luanhe river it is a large scale water conservancy project supplying water to tianjin tangshan and luanhe river across the river basin the drainage area is 35 000 km2 and the total storage capacity is 337 million m3 among them the basin area from panjiakou to daheting reservoir covers 1400 km2 it is a type ii annual regulating reservoir it assists the regulation of the water volume of panjiakou reservoir to improve the level of water supply in tianjin tangshan and other cities to create conditions daheiting reservoir is located in the warm temperate continental monsoon climate zone with hot and rainy summer and cold and dry winter in recent years the development of mining aquaculture tourism and infrastructure in the basin and surrounding areas of daheting reservoir has brought certain impacts on the ecological environment of the basin and daheting reservoir table 4 to model water quality in the daheiting reservoir the reservoir area is divided into 66 segments horizontal and 35 vertical cells the grid resolution is fixed at 1 m in the vertical direction the initial value is based on the measured value at the beginning of the simulation and the results in year 2018 are used to verify the water quality model the measured parameters include the temperature and do which were distributed in surface layer middle layer and bottom layer on may 16 july 18 and december 30 2018 the specific measurements are shown in table 3 3 3 3 model verification results fig 1 and fig 2 compare the two modeled and measured distribution of temperature and do in the vertical direction the two models tested are the proposed tbd temperature bod and do model and w2 ce qual w2 model the results show good model data agreement for tbd as well as their gradients in the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 the minimum temperature difference between the modeled and the measured results is presented in the surface layer on november 3 2009 of which the relative error is 3 the maximum difference is 14 on july 3 2009 at a depth of 20 m as shown in fig 2 the minimum and maximum differences of do between the modeled and measured data are 0 2 and 23 in the surface water respectively the calculated value of do concentration is a little higher than the measured value which may be due to the fact that the effect of sediment is not considered the sediments will decrease do concentration which will be further improved in our future works overall the validation results indicate that the proposed 2d water quality model tbd can be used to predict temperature and do evolutions in narrow deep reservoirs such as the baihetan reservoir in addition a quantile quantile plot with confidence intervals is used to check the applicability of the two models in temperature and do of shanmei validation and daheiting validation as shown in fig 3 it mainly shows the distribution of the data against the expected normal distribution if the data is normally distributed the points fall on the reference line otherwise the points deviate noticeably from the reference line in addition it is used to compare two samples model and experiment if the scatter plot is distributed around the line y x then the two samples are similarly distributed it can be seen that both the w2 and the proposed tbd models agree well with the measured values with the tbd model achieves better agreements in short the tbd model established in this study offers significant advantages over w2 model in simulations of seasonal density stratification in the two reservoirs although kurup et al 2000 found that w2 model is better than tisat while ostfeld and salomons 2005 presents a calibration model for w2 4 model application 4 1 configuration of the baihetan reservoir model the mesh and the computational domain of the baihetan reservoir area can be visualized in fig 4 it includes the main baihetan reservior and four tributary reserviors pudu xiaojiang yili and heishui reservior the characteristics of four tributaries are displayed in table 1 the horizontal grid fig 4b resolution ranges from 200 m to 1000 m the vertical grid resolution is fixed at 2 m as shown in fig 4c the number of grid cells used to resolve the main reservoir and its four tributary reservoirs are listed in table 5 under the normal water storage level the baihetan reservoir area is discretized into 466 108 rectangular grids the calculation time step ranges from 10 s to 60 s the inflow boundary conditions table 2 are enforced at all five reservoirs the do and bod concentrations at the inlets can be found in table 6 4 2 distribution of temperature and flow field in main and tributary reservoirs fig 5 and fig 6 show the temperature contours in the main and the tributary reservoirs on the 15th of april july october and january which corresponds to spring summer autumn and winter respectively fig 5 also displays the velocity vector in the five reservoirs in january stratification is observed in the main reservoir in july and october which is implied by the dense temperature contours ji et al 2017 stated that the stratification phenomena in the tributaries are most likely caused by the temperature difference between the main and the tributary reservoirs the average depth and surface width of the main reservoir are 126 m and 290 m respectively based on the discriminant method estimating the ratio of water temperature to the depth of the reservoir the main reservoir is a stratified reservoir the relative temperature between the inflow and the reservoir water determines the fate of inflow after entering the reservoir as shown in fig 5 in winter the inflow enters the middle layer of all five reservoirs forming two circulation zones in opposite directions above and below the injected inflow the upper circulation is generally larger especially for the pudu reservoir where the injection layer is close to the bottom the magnitude of velocity is larger in the thermocline than in other layers a similar flow field is reported in other tributary bays ji et al 2017 the backwater from the main reservoir forms a large counterclockwise circulation in the surface layer in each of the tributary bay implying that the exchange between the main and the tributary reservoirs occurs on a layer by layer pattern the main reservoir feeds the tributary reservoirs through the top and bottom layers while receiving tributary waters from the middle layer the analysis of the seasonal variation of temperature provides insights to the difference between the main reservoir and the tributary reservoirs fig 5 and fig 6 in january the temperature of the main reservoir reaches its minimum throughout the year the temperature gradient in the vertical direction is relatively uniform and stratification is weak all the tributaries exhibit similar temperature profiles where the temperature varies smoothly from about 16 c on the top layer to about 12 c in the bottom april is the warming season with a mean air temperature of 24 4 c and a net radiation of 226 5 w m2 this radiation value is the maximum throughout the year which drives a rapid increase of the reservoir temperature the main reservoir is transitioning towards a stratified reservoir similar phenomenon can be found in the tributaries where the temperature of the top layers begins to increase under strong radiation july is the main flooding season due to increased air temperature and cloud cover the surface water receives enhanced long wave radiation which results in an annual maximum surface temperature of 25 9 c in the main reservoir a thermocline can be found at about 80 m below the free surface the temperature decreases from more than 20 c above the thermocline layer to approximately 12 c below the thermocline layer the yili and heishui reservoirs show similar stratification patterns to the main reservoir the pudu reservoir becomes fully mixed with a nearly uniform temperature around 21 c the xiaojiang reservoir sees slightly increased temperature in the surface layer but no thermocline layer is found deep in the reservoir the different stratification behaviors in the tributary reservoirs are likely caused by their depth for deeper reservoirs like the yili the heishui and the main reservoirs radiation on the surface cannot penetrate through the depth of the reservoir resulting obvious stratification phenomenon in the vertical direction the cooling season spans from october to january during which the solar radiation air temperature and inflow temperature all rapidly decrease the water temperature in the reservoirs also decline again the yili heishui and the main reservoirs show similar patterns of temperature evolution where a mild temperature gradient is gradually formed above the thermocline the bottom temperature of the pudu and xiaojiang reservoirs also decrease the cold bottom layer of pudu reservoir extends to its inlet indicating that the inflow temperature is an important driver of the cooling process this can be confirmed in table 5 where the pudu reservoir has the lowest inflow temperature in october among the five reservoirs these observations indicate that depth is the key factor that affects stratification shallow reservoirs often do not stratify meanwhile the inflow to the main reservoir is much lower than the runoff during flood seasons thus the spillways are not open for flood discharge the bottom of the reservoir is not disturbed by inflow or discharge which further stabilizes the bottom temperature at around 12 c in the main reservoir 4 3 distribution of do and bod in the main and tributary reservoirs previous studies have shown that water temperature stratification can inhibit the exchange of water bodies in the vertical direction resulting in the stratification of dissolved oxygen and other water quality factors han et al 2000 elcis 2008 fig 7 shows the vertical do bod and temperature profiles near the baihetan dam as well as near the interfaces between the main reservoir and the four tributary reservoirs the inflow boundary conditions are also provided for illustration purposes the spatial distribution of do and bod in spring summer autumn and winter can be found in fig s1 s4 of the supplementary materials in the main reservoir determined by the relative temperature difference the inflow always enters the middle layer throughout the year fig 7c the corresponding bod exhibits peaks in the middle layer too the maximum bod is found in july where both the inflow rate and the inflow bod reach their yearly maximum the increase of bod consumes oxygen leading to reduced do concentration in the middle layer fig 7a due to strong stratification the bod and do in the bottom layer is relatively stable unaffected by the inflow and the temperature of the upper layers during most of the year the pudu reservoir is the shallowest of the five reservoirs which weakens temperature induced stratification fig 7f however the inflow to the pudu reservoir is greater than that of the deeper xiaojiang and yili reservoirs thus the inflow do has influence on the reservoir do as can be seen in fig 7d in january and october the cold inflow enters the bottom layer of pudu reservoir result in a decrease of bottom do in july the warm inflow enters the surface layer leading to a decrease of surface do april sees the minimum inflow over the year and the do is relatively stable in the vertical direction with slight increase at the surface due to re aeration the bod shows similar responses to inflow fig 7e similar to the pudu reservoir the xiaojiang reservoir is weakly stratified the inflow rate is smaller and its effects on do is not obvious in all four seasons the do profile is similar to the do of the main reservoir fig 7g s3 s4 indicating backflow from the main reservoir governs the do in the xiaojiang reservoir in january and april where the inflow bod is the largest the reservoir bod is much smaller in july the reservoir bod in the middle layer exceeds 2 mg l which is greater than the inflow bod fig 7h these are all evidences that illustrate the inflow is relatively unimportant in the xiaojiang reservoir the yili reservoir is stratified in july and october the inflow rate is the smallest in all five reservoirs as expected the inflow has weak influence on the bod and do and the backflow from the main reservoir becomes important a strong evidence is the sharp decrease of bod in the bottom layer in july and october which is consistent with the low bod in the stagnant bottom layer of the main reservoir fig 7k s1 s2 the heishui reservoir is the deepest tributary reservoir which exhibits similar vertical stratification to the main reservoir a stagnant bottom layer can be seen from the do and bod profiles fig 7l n in the middle layer both backflow and inflow have some influence resulting in strongly oscillatory vertical do profiles fig 7l again the maximum bod in july and october exceeds the inflow bod implying a dominant role of backflow in these seasons despite the inflow also reaches its maximum 4 4 analysis of the predicted water quality near the dam fig 8 a c and table s1 show the average surface and bottom values of do bod and temperature at the dam site over a year it can be seen that the water temperature and bod of the reservoir surface are generally higher than that of the reservoir bottom throughout the year while do of the reservoir surface are higher than that of the reservoir bottom from january to june the main reason lies in the strong radiation light and photosynthesis of the surface layer fig 8d 8f shows the comparison of do bod and temperature values in a year fig 8d and fig 8f show that the maximum value of do and the minimum value of water temperature are in march while the minimum value of do and the maximum value of water temperature are in september this is because the higher the temperature the more readily dissolved oxygen is consumed following eq 7 however there is no obvious linear relationship between bod and water temperature indicating other factors such as degradation and stratification are also important 4 5 spatial and temporal distribution of water quality 4 5 1 longitudinal distribution of water quality fig 9 and table 7 show the depth averaged temperature bod and do profiles in the baihetan reservoir it can be seen that the bod concentration is monotonically decreasing from the inlet to the dam because of degradation along the reservoir length and inflow from the tributary reservoirs this decreasing trend is more obvious in summer july and autumn october the concentration of bod slightly increases at the downstream of some tributary outlets due to the inflow from the sewage streams for example in january the bod concentration increased from 0 71 mg l to 0 81 mg l between xiaojiang and yili outlets the concentration of do in the main reservoir shows seasonal patterns but the longitudinal variation along the reservoir is relatively uniform indicating that do consumption is approximately balanced by the rate of re aeration along the main reservoir eq 6 and 7 suggest that the re aeration rate declines at high temperature which is consistent with the lower do concentration in july and october the temperature exhibits stronger seasonal variations near the inlet of the main reservoir the main reason is the relatively shallow depth which makes the water body more sensitive to the solar radiation 4 5 2 water quality changes with month the changes of velocity temperature bod and do concentration in twelve months at the three points thermocline layer 132 m 712 m top layer 106 m 770 m bottom layer 180 m 602 m of the baihetan main reservoir have been analyzed and displayed in fig 10 it can be seen that in all three layers displayed the peak velocity coincides with the peak bod concentration meaning that the bod near the dam mainly comes from advective transport from the inflow in winter the cold inflow enters the bottom layer leading to increased bottom bod in summer and autumn the warn inflow stays in the middle and top layers and the bottom bod monotonically decline due to degradation the temperature of the thermocline and the top layers change with time but the bottom temperature is relatively stable confirming that the main reservoir is strongly stratified in the thermocline and the top layers the do is low in summer and autumn which corresponds to the peaks of bod it indicates the consumption of do due to high bod is the main driver that leads to poor water quality in general the water quality from january to june is better than that from july to december fig 10b d 4 6 summary and discussion based on the above observations and analysis the primary mechanisms affecting do evolution in a reservoir can be summarized as in fig 11 the reservoirs in the baihetan system can be grouped into stratified and non stratified reservoirs the stratified reservoirs are typically deeper with a greater contact area with the main reservoir thus backflow from the reservoir strongly affects the do evolution e g xiaojiang yili and heishui reservoirs in the shallow non stratified reservoirs inflow from the upstream plays a more important role e g pudu reservoir it should be noted that fig 11 a and b only depict the situation of the baihetan reservoirs in more general cases the balancing between inflow and backflow is certainly determined by their relative magnitudes not by stratification the most important difference between the main fig 11c and the tributary reservoirs is that the baihetan dam prohibits backflow for the main reservoir thus bod carried by the inflow accumulates near the dam and keeps consuming do leading to poor water quality in the middle layer at the dam site figs s3 s4 the stratified reservoirs feature a stagnant bottom layer in which the water quality is relatively stable both spatially and temporally however the relative temperature between inflow and the reservoir water determines which layer the inflow enters if the inflow is cold it could enter the stagnant layer and deteriorates the water quality like the main reservoir in february fig 9c seasonal patterns of do evolution are observed in all reservoirs the main reasons are i seasonal temperature variation affects the rate of re aeration and consumption ii seasonal temperature variation determines the fate of inflow when entering the reservoir which affects the subsequent degradation and do consumption and iii the inflow rate do and bod are inherently different from month to month despite the stronger seasonal patterns in january april and july the do in all five reservoirs is greater than 6 5 mg l which satisfies case ⅱ sate environmental protection administration 2002 of the ambient quality standards relatively poor water quality is observed in october which is caused by the consumption of do incurred by the high bod inflow into the main reservoir from july to october 5 conclusion in the present study a horizontally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model tbd model is built and used to simulate seasonal evolution patterns of temperature bod and do concentrations in the baihetan reservoir and its four tributary reservoirs the tbd model considers the influence of temperature on the re aeration and consumption of do as well as on the degradation of bod since the baihetan hydropower plant was under construction when performing this study model validation is completed using field data collected at the shanmei reservoir and the daheiting reservoir both are deep and narrow reservoirs similar to the baihetan reservoir the major findings are summarized as follows seasonal variation of temperature induces stratification in the main and the two deeper tributary reservoirs yili and heishui reservoirs the stratification is stronger in summer and autumn associated with a rapid increase of surface temperature a stagnant layer exists in the bottom in which the temperature stays stable throughout the year the two shallow tributaries pudu and xiaojiang reservoirs are not stratified water quality i e do concentration is affected by multiple factors including stratification inflow from upstream reaeration and consumption for the tributary reservoirs backflow from the main reservoir also affects its water quality stratification determines the fate of inflow when entering the reservoir leading to non uniform do and bod profiles in the vertical direction generally water quality is poor in summer and autumn because i high temperature constrains reaeration and ii increased inflow with high bod concentration consumes do on the contrary the water quality is good in winter and spring for the deep tributary reservoirs the do concentration is strongly affected by backflow from the main reservoir for shallow tributary reservoirs the inflow do also have some influence the simulation results indicate the water quality in the main reservoir satisfies case ⅰ of the ambient quality standards in winter and spring and satisfies case ⅱ in summer and autumn this implies that in terms of do and bod the baihetan dam has relatively minor impact on water quality to further enhance the do concentration both atmospheric factors temperature and temperature induced stratification reaeration and degradation and hydrodynamic factors the balance between upstream inflow and downstream backflow should be analyzed in this manuscript we only discuss tbd distribution in the baihetan reservoir under certain inflow conditions in the future more inflow boundary conditions bed load and suspended load will be used additional sources of pollutants point sources and non point sources around the reservoir area need to be considered the response mechanism of tbd to the hydrological changes of the mainstream in jinsha river also need to be taken into further consideration with these factors included in the future we will be able to systematically evaluate if the discharge and the

1951,the construction of large scale dams creates tributary bays between the main and the tributary reservoirs the water temperature and water quality in the tributary reservoirs are inevitably affected by backflow from the main reservoir in this study the spatial temporal evolutions of water temperature biochemical oxygen demand bod and dissolved oxygen do in the baihetan reservoir and its four tributary reservoirs are investigated by building validating and applying the tbd temperature bod and do numerical model the results show that the influence of the main reservoir on its tributary reservoirs show seasonal patterns the water quality in the main reservoir is determined by inflow reaeration and temperature driven stratification all of which exhibit seasonal patterns stratification determines the fate of inflow after it enters the reservoir which leads to relatively low do concentration in the middle layer of the baihetan reservoir in summer and autumn for the tributary reservoirs water quality is also affected by the balancing between the upstream inflow and downstream backflow which varies both seasonally and as a function of the reservoir geometry these results have great significance in analyzing and understanding the environmental impact of large hydraulic projects which can be used as the basis for enacting hydraulic project plans and preserving the aquatic ecosystem in the reservoir areas keywords large stratified confluence reservoir dissolved oxygen temperature numerical simulation biochemical oxygen demand data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do is an important indicator that reflects the degree of pollution for environmental water bodies it serves as a key factor that affects the survival of aquatic organisms and the balance of aquatic ecosystems he et al 2014 failure to maintain a certain level of do in rivers causes damage to the aquatic ecosystem prasad et al 2014 talbot et al 2018 for example if the do concentration is less than 4 mg l many fish species will die due to anoxia if the do concentration is less than 2 mg l for several hours most fishes are unable to survive if the do concentration drops to zero the water body becomes black and smelly gunnarsli et al 2009 ruyet et al 2002 therefore to maintain the vital signs of fishes and the functionality of the aquatic ecosystem it is important to maintain the do concentration within a proper range the primary source of do in the water bodies is the oxygen in the atmosphere when do is consumed e g by respiration of aquatic organisms the water body keeps gaining oxygen from the atmosphere this process is termed re aeration the re aeration coefficient for rivers can be experimentally determined with the do balance method li et al 1992 the interference balance method and the trace method tsivoglou et al 1968 o connor 1983 related the re aeration coefficient to the wind speed based on the surface reconstruction theory dai et al 1995 built a linear relationship between the release coefficient of ammonia gas nh3 in ammonia water and the water temperature cheng et al 1995 proposed a relationship between the re aeration coefficient the mean flow speed and the mean kinetic energy at the free surface arora and keshari 2021 developed and validated a re aeration equation by modeling do in the yamuna river wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b performed a synthetic case study that assimilated observed do data in the hydrodynamic model of the seine river system nuruzzaman et al 2018 developed a re aeration rate equation for the pusu river in malaysia using a modified method based on flume sampling most of the existing studies focus on the do distribution and the re aeration processes in natural rivers or lakes reid et al 2015 nelson et al 2017 kaufman et al 2017 reeder et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b huai et al 2019 2020 bocaniov et al 2020 yang et al 2021 relatively few studies are targeted to the confluences in the reservoir systems chen et al 2013 in a reservoir system the spatial temporal variations of temperature bod do and bathymetry lead to complex hydrodynamic processes cardenas et al 2004 kaufman et al 2017 the rate and duration of water exchange between the main and the tributary reservoirs are the main factors affecting these processes which drive the transport of pollutants chang et al 2019 it has been recognized that the construction of dams has influence mostly negative on the water quality park et al 2014 chen et al 2020 in a multi reservoir system stratification stagnation and backflow from the main stream could deteriorate water quality in the tributary reservoirs ma et al 2016 zou et al 2017 in particular the level of stratification controls the vertical distribution of do which directly affects the evolution of water quality in the reservoirs zhao et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 in the past years multiple algae bloom events have been observed in the tributaries within the three gorges dam reservoir area ma et al 2016 it is thus of great scientific and practical importance to investigate the evolutions and interactions of temperature do and bod in reservoir systems especially at the confluence between the main and the tributary reservoirs in the present study following previous works of shen et al 2016 shen et al 2019 and shen et al 2021 which focused on the total dissolved gas in river channels and coastal sewage discharge a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic and water quality model to simulate temperature do and bod tbd was built for vertical cross sections of large scale deep water reservoirs the model is able to simulate the transport of non passive scalars e g do bod which allows us to investigate the distribution and transport of do at the confluence in a reservoir system previous studies mainly adopted the ce qual w2 w2 model to obtain the distribution of water quality in stratified reservoir zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019 in this work the proposed model is intentionally designed to describe the production consumption and degradation of do and bod it could be considered as an enhanced w2 model with the improved source item the model is tested at the newly built baihetan reservoir china and its four tributary reservoirs aiming at understanding the seasonal evolution patterns of do and bod in the reservoir system as well as the governing factors affecting these patterns the simulation results can provide foundations for further completing the water quality management model and the algae bloom warning system for the baihetan reservoir and its tributaries it can also provides scientific suggestions for the water quality research of other large scale water conservancy projects and the improvement measures of ecological environment impact 2 background the baihetan dam and reservoir is located in the main stream of the jinshajiang river in china it is the world s second largest hydropower plant second to the three gorges dam the average annual temperature precipitation and relative humidity are 21 7 c 715 9 mm and 63 respectively the annual rainfall days is approximately 100 the average annual flow rate of the jinshajiang river is 4190 m3 s with 3850 m3 s entering the baihetan reservoir measured at the wudongde dam after the baihetan hydropower plant is built the backwater length of the baihetan reservoir will be 182 km the maximum depth will exceed 240 m the reservoir area also includes four tributary reservoirs the heishui river the pudu river the xiaojiang river and the yili river the heishui river is located on the left bank of the main stream the other three tributaries are on the right bank the characteristics of these tributaries are presented in table 1 a summary of the annual average runoff in the main and tributary reservoirs is shown in table 2 full 3d hydrodynamic and water quality simulation of the entire reservoir area is impractical due to the extensive computational cost and strict requirements on mesh quality since the baihetan reservoir is long and narrow in shape 2d simulation of a vertical cross section is adequate in providing reasonable estimation of the do distribution in the present study the 2d simulation includes the exchange between the main tributary reservoirs and the backwater effects it provides spatial temporal predictions of the water quality in the entire baihetan reservoir area i e the main and all the tributary reservoirs 3 materials and methods this section describes the vertical 2d hydrodynamic and transport model we developed to simulate the temperature bod and do at river confluences in deep reservoir systems in the model the flow field is described using the 2d navier stokes equations with the rans turbulence closure the heat equation is used to describe temperature evolution in the reservoir water as well as across the water air interface these equations are well known and have been widely applied in existing reservoir models so they are not provided herein please refer to section 1 of the supporting information for the full forms of these equations in the following sections the novel features and the special treatments of the tbd model will be introduced which includes the water quality equation and the treatments of the bod do source terms 3 1 vertical 2d water quality model 3 1 1 the water quality equation the spatial temporal evolution do and bod is described using the width averaged transport equations 1 b η t x b d x η x z b d z η z u b η x w b η z b s η 2 b σ t x b d x σ x z b d z σ z u b σ x w b σ z b s σ where η mg l is the bod concentration σ mg l is the do concentration dx m2 s and dz m2 s are the horizontal and vertical eddy diffusivities s η mg l s is the source term of bod s σ mg l s is the source term of do 3 1 2 the source term bod consumes oxygen for degradation which is assumed to be a first order kinetic reaction the bod source term can be estimated as 3 s η k 1 t θ t 20 l b where k 1 t 1 s is the degradation coefficient of bod at 20 c the present study uses k 1 t 0 027d 1 following the water quality monitoring data of the three gorges dam reservoir area yu et al 2011 the influence of temperature on the degradation coefficient is corrected with the factor θ which is taken as 1 039 yu et al 2011 l b mg l is the bod concentration in the surface layer the source term includes photosynthesis and respiration of algae re aeration and degradation of bod these two processes are modeled as 4 s σ k g k r δ oa c a a s k 2

the do concentration a s m2 is the surface area k g 1 s is the growth rate of algae kr 1 s is the respiration rate of algae δ oa is the oxygen content coefficient of algae c a g m3 is the concentration of algae it should be noted that the two equations for the re aeration coefficient k 2 t isaacs et al 1969 arora and keshari 2021 are tested during model validation as 6 k 2 t 3 6 v h 1 5 7 k 2 t 1 895 v 0 657 h 1 35 1 0241 t 20 where v m s is the velocity h m is the water depth 3 2 discretization schemes different from feng et al 2013 who used finite difference method fdm method we apply the finite volume method fvm with a mixed scheme to discretize the differential equations compared with fdm fvm does not generate geometrically induced errors and fvm is more suitable for flow field with large gradient in stratified reservoirs the pimple algorithm osama and huckaby 2009 which merged the simple and piso is used to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations eq s1 the staggered grid is used to avoid checkerboard uneven pressure field the discretization of the free water surface equation adopts explicit scheme the discretization of the momentum equation employs a combining scheme where vertical diffusion is fully implicit while advection employs a time weighted central difference implicit scheme in the explicit part of the time weighted scheme a unique treatment was used for vertical advection which improves the overall accuracy the discretization of the transport equation is similar to that of the momentum equation in the calculation the navier stokes equations are solved first to create the flow field then this flow field is used to model the transport of temperature and water quality finally based on the updated temperature the flow field is corrected this process is iterated until the error margins of all equations are less than the predefined thresholds 3 3 model calibration and verification the baihetan hydropower plant has been put into operation on july of 2022 which is after the present study was conducted thus it is impractical and meaningless to collect do and bod data directly in the baihetan reservoir when it was under construction instead the proposed tbd model is validated using data collected in the shanmei and the daheiting reservoirs these two reservoirs are both long and narrow which is geometrically similar to the baihetan reservoir the following sections illustrate the configuration and the results of the mode verification tests 3 3 1 field data and caculation conditions of shanmei reservior the tbd model is first validated using field data collected at the shanmei reservoir chen 2012 the shanmei reservoir is located in the southeast china the top of the dam is 305 m long 8 m wide and the bottom of the dam is 312 8 m wide the total storage capacity is 655 million m3 it belongs to the subtropical marine monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 20 9 c in july and 12 1 c in january the annual sunshine hours vary from 1800 to 2200 the annual rainfall is 1600 mm the frost free period is 330 days the precipitation during the wet season from march to september accounts for 80 of the whole year the inter annual variation of precipitation is large the precipitation in wet years is less than half of that in dry years the shanmei reservoir is mainly developed for irrigation and water supply but it is also used for hydro power flood control and ecological purposes the normal water level in the reservoir is 96 5 m the maximum flood level in front of the dam is 102 1 m to model water quality in the shanmei reservoir the reservoir area is divided into 17 segments horizontal and 38 vertical cells the grid resolution is fixed at 1 5 m in the vertical direction the initial value is based on the measured value at the beginning of the simulation and the results in year 2008 are used to verify the water quality model the measured parameters include the temperature and do which were distributed in surface layer middle layer and bottom layer on may 4 july 2 and december 5 2008 the specific measurements are shown in table 3 3 3 2 field data and calculation conditions of daheiting reservior the tbd model was also validated using field data collected at the daheiting reservoir xu 2020 the water quality model is validated using field data collected at the daheiting reservoir daheiting reservoir is located on the main stream of luanhe river it is a large scale water conservancy project supplying water to tianjin tangshan and luanhe river across the river basin the drainage area is 35 000 km2 and the total storage capacity is 337 million m3 among them the basin area from panjiakou to daheting reservoir covers 1400 km2 it is a type ii annual regulating reservoir it assists the regulation of the water volume of panjiakou reservoir to improve the level of water supply in tianjin tangshan and other cities to create conditions daheiting reservoir is located in the warm temperate continental monsoon climate zone with hot and rainy summer and cold and dry winter in recent years the development of mining aquaculture tourism and infrastructure in the basin and surrounding areas of daheting reservoir has brought certain impacts on the ecological environment of the basin and daheting reservoir table 4 to model water quality in the daheiting reservoir the reservoir area is divided into 66 segments horizontal and 35 vertical cells the grid resolution is fixed at 1 m in the vertical direction the initial value is based on the measured value at the beginning of the simulation and the results in year 2018 are used to verify the water quality model the measured parameters include the temperature and do which were distributed in surface layer middle layer and bottom layer on may 16 july 18 and december 30 2018 the specific measurements are shown in table 3 3 3 3 model verification results fig 1 and fig 2 compare the two modeled and measured distribution of temperature and do in the vertical direction the two models tested are the proposed tbd temperature bod and do model and w2 ce qual w2 model the results show good model data agreement for tbd as well as their gradients in the vertical direction as shown in fig 1 the minimum temperature difference between the modeled and the measured results is presented in the surface layer on november 3 2009 of which the relative error is 3 the maximum difference is 14 on july 3 2009 at a depth of 20 m as shown in fig 2 the minimum and maximum differences of do between the modeled and measured data are 0 2 and 23 in the surface water respectively the calculated value of do concentration is a little higher than the measured value which may be due to the fact that the effect of sediment is not considered the sediments will decrease do concentration which will be further improved in our future works overall the validation results indicate that the proposed 2d water quality model tbd can be used to predict temperature and do evolutions in narrow deep reservoirs such as the baihetan reservoir in addition a quantile quantile plot with confidence intervals is used to check the applicability of the two models in temperature and do of shanmei validation and daheiting validation as shown in fig 3 it mainly shows the distribution of the data against the expected normal distribution if the data is normally distributed the points fall on the reference line otherwise the points deviate noticeably from the reference line in addition it is used to compare two samples model and experiment if the scatter plot is distributed around the line y x then the two samples are similarly distributed it can be seen that both the w2 and the proposed tbd models agree well with the measured values with the tbd model achieves better agreements in short the tbd model established in this study offers significant advantages over w2 model in simulations of seasonal density stratification in the two reservoirs although kurup et al 2000 found that w2 model is better than tisat while ostfeld and salomons 2005 presents a calibration model for w2 4 model application 4 1 configuration of the baihetan reservoir model the mesh and the computational domain of the baihetan reservoir area can be visualized in fig 4 it includes the main baihetan reservior and four tributary reserviors pudu xiaojiang yili and heishui reservior the characteristics of four tributaries are displayed in table 1 the horizontal grid fig 4b resolution ranges from 200 m to 1000 m the vertical grid resolution is fixed at 2 m as shown in fig 4c the number of grid cells used to resolve the main reservoir and its four tributary reservoirs are listed in table 5 under the normal water storage level the baihetan reservoir area is discretized into 466 108 rectangular grids the calculation time step ranges from 10 s to 60 s the inflow boundary conditions table 2 are enforced at all five reservoirs the do and bod concentrations at the inlets can be found in table 6 4 2 distribution of temperature and flow field in main and tributary reservoirs fig 5 and fig 6 show the temperature contours in the main and the tributary reservoirs on the 15th of april july october and january which corresponds to spring summer autumn and winter respectively fig 5 also displays the velocity vector in the five reservoirs in january stratification is observed in the main reservoir in july and october which is implied by the dense temperature contours ji et al 2017 stated that the stratification phenomena in the tributaries are most likely caused by the temperature difference between the main and the tributary reservoirs the average depth and surface width of the main reservoir are 126 m and 290 m respectively based on the discriminant method estimating the ratio of water temperature to the depth of the reservoir the main reservoir is a stratified reservoir the relative temperature between the inflow and the reservoir water determines the fate of inflow after entering the reservoir as shown in fig 5 in winter the inflow enters the middle layer of all five reservoirs forming two circulation zones in opposite directions above and below the injected inflow the upper circulation is generally larger especially for the pudu reservoir where the injection layer is close to the bottom the magnitude of velocity is larger in the thermocline than in other layers a similar flow field is reported in other tributary bays ji et al 2017 the backwater from the main reservoir forms a large counterclockwise circulation in the surface layer in each of the tributary bay implying that the exchange between the main and the tributary reservoirs occurs on a layer by layer pattern the main reservoir feeds the tributary reservoirs through the top and bottom layers while receiving tributary waters from the middle layer the analysis of the seasonal variation of temperature provides insights to the difference between the main reservoir and the tributary reservoirs fig 5 and fig 6 in january the temperature of the main reservoir reaches its minimum throughout the year the temperature gradient in the vertical direction is relatively uniform and stratification is weak all the tributaries exhibit similar temperature profiles where the temperature varies smoothly from about 16 c on the top layer to about 12 c in the bottom april is the warming season with a mean air temperature of 24 4 c and a net radiation of 226 5 w m2 this radiation value is the maximum throughout the year which drives a rapid increase of the reservoir temperature the main reservoir is transitioning towards a stratified reservoir similar phenomenon can be found in the tributaries where the temperature of the top layers begins to increase under strong radiation july is the main flooding season due to increased air temperature and cloud cover the surface water receives enhanced long wave radiation which results in an annual maximum surface temperature of 25 9 c in the main reservoir a thermocline can be found at about 80 m below the free surface the temperature decreases from more than 20 c above the thermocline layer to approximately 12 c below the thermocline layer the yili and heishui reservoirs show similar stratification patterns to the main reservoir the pudu reservoir becomes fully mixed with a nearly uniform temperature around 21 c the xiaojiang reservoir sees slightly increased temperature in the surface layer but no thermocline layer is found deep in the reservoir the different stratification behaviors in the tributary reservoirs are likely caused by their depth for deeper reservoirs like the yili the heishui and the main reservoirs radiation on the surface cannot penetrate through the depth of the reservoir resulting obvious stratification phenomenon in the vertical direction the cooling season spans from october to january during which the solar radiation air temperature and inflow temperature all rapidly decrease the water temperature in the reservoirs also decline again the yili heishui and the main reservoirs show similar patterns of temperature evolution where a mild temperature gradient is gradually formed above the thermocline the bottom temperature of the pudu and xiaojiang reservoirs also decrease the cold bottom layer of pudu reservoir extends to its inlet indicating that the inflow temperature is an important driver of the cooling process this can be confirmed in table 5 where the pudu reservoir has the lowest inflow temperature in october among the five reservoirs these observations indicate that depth is the key factor that affects stratification shallow reservoirs often do not stratify meanwhile the inflow to the main reservoir is much lower than the runoff during flood seasons thus the spillways are not open for flood discharge the bottom of the reservoir is not disturbed by inflow or discharge which further stabilizes the bottom temperature at around 12 c in the main reservoir 4 3 distribution of do and bod in the main and tributary reservoirs previous studies have shown that water temperature stratification can inhibit the exchange of water bodies in the vertical direction resulting in the stratification of dissolved oxygen and other water quality factors han et al 2000 elcis 2008 fig 7 shows the vertical do bod and temperature profiles near the baihetan dam as well as near the interfaces between the main reservoir and the four tributary reservoirs the inflow boundary conditions are also provided for illustration purposes the spatial distribution of do and bod in spring summer autumn and winter can be found in fig s1 s4 of the supplementary materials in the main reservoir determined by the relative temperature difference the inflow always enters the middle layer throughout the year fig 7c the corresponding bod exhibits peaks in the middle layer too the maximum bod is found in july where both the inflow rate and the inflow bod reach their yearly maximum the increase of bod consumes oxygen leading to reduced do concentration in the middle layer fig 7a due to strong stratification the bod and do in the bottom layer is relatively stable unaffected by the inflow and the temperature of the upper layers during most of the year the pudu reservoir is the shallowest of the five reservoirs which weakens temperature induced stratification fig 7f however the inflow to the pudu reservoir is greater than that of the deeper xiaojiang and yili reservoirs thus the inflow do has influence on the reservoir do as can be seen in fig 7d in january and october the cold inflow enters the bottom layer of pudu reservoir result in a decrease of bottom do in july the warm inflow enters the surface layer leading to a decrease of surface do april sees the minimum inflow over the year and the do is relatively stable in the vertical direction with slight increase at the surface due to re aeration the bod shows similar responses to inflow fig 7e similar to the pudu reservoir the xiaojiang reservoir is weakly stratified the inflow rate is smaller and its effects on do is not obvious in all four seasons the do profile is similar to the do of the main reservoir fig 7g s3 s4 indicating backflow from the main reservoir governs the do in the xiaojiang reservoir in january and april where the inflow bod is the largest the reservoir bod is much smaller in july the reservoir bod in the middle layer exceeds 2 mg l which is greater than the inflow bod fig 7h these are all evidences that illustrate the inflow is relatively unimportant in the xiaojiang reservoir the yili reservoir is stratified in july and october the inflow rate is the smallest in all five reservoirs as expected the inflow has weak influence on the bod and do and the backflow from the main reservoir becomes important a strong evidence is the sharp decrease of bod in the bottom layer in july and october which is consistent with the low bod in the stagnant bottom layer of the main reservoir fig 7k s1 s2 the heishui reservoir is the deepest tributary reservoir which exhibits similar vertical stratification to the main reservoir a stagnant bottom layer can be seen from the do and bod profiles fig 7l n in the middle layer both backflow and inflow have some influence resulting in strongly oscillatory vertical do profiles fig 7l again the maximum bod in july and october exceeds the inflow bod implying a dominant role of backflow in these seasons despite the inflow also reaches its maximum 4 4 analysis of the predicted water quality near the dam fig 8 a c and table s1 show the average surface and bottom values of do bod and temperature at the dam site over a year it can be seen that the water temperature and bod of the reservoir surface are generally higher than that of the reservoir bottom throughout the year while do of the reservoir surface are higher than that of the reservoir bottom from january to june the main reason lies in the strong radiation light and photosynthesis of the surface layer fig 8d 8f shows the comparison of do bod and temperature values in a year fig 8d and fig 8f show that the maximum value of do and the minimum value of water temperature are in march while the minimum value of do and the maximum value of water temperature are in september this is because the higher the temperature the more readily dissolved oxygen is consumed following eq 7 however there is no obvious linear relationship between bod and water temperature indicating other factors such as degradation and stratification are also important 4 5 spatial and temporal distribution of water quality 4 5 1 longitudinal distribution of water quality fig 9 and table 7 show the depth averaged temperature bod and do profiles in the baihetan reservoir it can be seen that the bod concentration is monotonically decreasing from the inlet to the dam because of degradation along the reservoir length and inflow from the tributary reservoirs this decreasing trend is more obvious in summer july and autumn october the concentration of bod slightly increases at the downstream of some tributary outlets due to the inflow from the sewage streams for example in january the bod concentration increased from 0 71 mg l to 0 81 mg l between xiaojiang and yili outlets the concentration of do in the main reservoir shows seasonal patterns but the longitudinal variation along the reservoir is relatively uniform indicating that do consumption is approximately balanced by the rate of re aeration along the main reservoir eq 6 and 7 suggest that the re aeration rate declines at high temperature which is consistent with the lower do concentration in july and october the temperature exhibits stronger seasonal variations near the inlet of the main reservoir the main reason is the relatively shallow depth which makes the water body more sensitive to the solar radiation 4 5 2 water quality changes with month the changes of velocity temperature bod and do concentration in twelve months at the three points thermocline layer 132 m 712 m top layer 106 m 770 m bottom layer 180 m 602 m of the baihetan main reservoir have been analyzed and displayed in fig 10 it can be seen that in all three layers displayed the peak velocity coincides with the peak bod concentration meaning that the bod near the dam mainly comes from advective transport from the inflow in winter the cold inflow enters the bottom layer leading to increased bottom bod in summer and autumn the warn inflow stays in the middle and top layers and the bottom bod monotonically decline due to degradation the temperature of the thermocline and the top layers change with time but the bottom temperature is relatively stable confirming that the main reservoir is strongly stratified in the thermocline and the top layers the do is low in summer and autumn which corresponds to the peaks of bod it indicates the consumption of do due to high bod is the main driver that leads to poor water quality in general the water quality from january to june is better than that from july to december fig 10b d 4 6 summary and discussion based on the above observations and analysis the primary mechanisms affecting do evolution in a reservoir can be summarized as in fig 11 the reservoirs in the baihetan system can be grouped into stratified and non stratified reservoirs the stratified reservoirs are typically deeper with a greater contact area with the main reservoir thus backflow from the reservoir strongly affects the do evolution e g xiaojiang yili and heishui reservoirs in the shallow non stratified reservoirs inflow from the upstream plays a more important role e g pudu reservoir it should be noted that fig 11 a and b only depict the situation of the baihetan reservoirs in more general cases the balancing between inflow and backflow is certainly determined by their relative magnitudes not by stratification the most important difference between the main fig 11c and the tributary reservoirs is that the baihetan dam prohibits backflow for the main reservoir thus bod carried by the inflow accumulates near the dam and keeps consuming do leading to poor water quality in the middle layer at the dam site figs s3 s4 the stratified reservoirs feature a stagnant bottom layer in which the water quality is relatively stable both spatially and temporally however the relative temperature between inflow and the reservoir water determines which layer the inflow enters if the inflow is cold it could enter the stagnant layer and deteriorates the water quality like the main reservoir in february fig 9c seasonal patterns of do evolution are observed in all reservoirs the main reasons are i seasonal temperature variation affects the rate of re aeration and consumption ii seasonal temperature variation determines the fate of inflow when entering the reservoir which affects the subsequent degradation and do consumption and iii the inflow rate do and bod are inherently different from month to month despite the stronger seasonal patterns in january april and july the do in all five reservoirs is greater than 6 5 mg l which satisfies case ⅱ sate environmental protection administration 2002 of the ambient quality standards relatively poor water quality is observed in october which is caused by the consumption of do incurred by the high bod inflow into the main reservoir from july to october 5 conclusion in the present study a horizontally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model tbd model is built and used to simulate seasonal evolution patterns of temperature bod and do concentrations in the baihetan reservoir and its four tributary reservoirs the tbd model considers the influence of temperature on the re aeration and consumption of do as well as on the degradation of bod since the baihetan hydropower plant was under construction when performing this study model validation is completed using field data collected at the shanmei reservoir and the daheiting reservoir both are deep and narrow reservoirs similar to the baihetan reservoir the major findings are summarized as follows seasonal variation of temperature induces stratification in the main and the two deeper tributary reservoirs yili and heishui reservoirs the stratification is stronger in summer and autumn associated with a rapid increase of surface temperature a stagnant layer exists in the bottom in which the temperature stays stable throughout the year the two shallow tributaries pudu and xiaojiang reservoirs are not stratified water quality i e do concentration is affected by multiple factors including stratification inflow from upstream reaeration and consumption for the tributary reservoirs backflow from the main reservoir also affects its water quality stratification determines the fate of inflow when entering the reservoir leading to non uniform do and bod profiles in the vertical direction generally water quality is poor in summer and autumn because i high temperature constrains reaeration and ii increased inflow with high bod concentration consumes do on the contrary the water quality is good in winter and spring for the deep tributary reservoirs the do concentration is strongly affected by backflow from the main reservoir for shallow tributary reservoirs the inflow do also have some influence the simulation results indicate the water quality in the main reservoir satisfies case ⅰ of the ambient quality standards in winter and spring and satisfies case ⅱ in summer and autumn this implies that in terms of do and bod the baihetan dam has relatively minor impact on water quality to further enhance the do concentration both atmospheric factors temperature and temperature induced stratification reaeration and degradation and hydrodynamic factors the balance between upstream inflow and downstream backflow should be analyzed in this manuscript we only discuss tbd distribution in the baihetan reservoir under certain inflow conditions in the future more inflow boundary conditions bed load and suspended load will be used additional sources of pollutants point sources and non point sources around the reservoir area need to be considered the response mechanism of tbd to the hydrological changes of the mainstream in jinsha river also need to be taken into further consideration with these factors included in the future we will be able to systematically evaluate if the discharge and the

1952,this paper presents a fractal based hydraulic model for unsaturated flow which includes the soil water retention curve swrc and relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc and considers the evolution of pore size distribution psd during soil deformation in this model soil psd is assumed to follow the fractal scaling law and soil deformation is characterized by a change in the fractal dimension and air entry value by combining the intrinsic constraint between void ratio and fractal dimension the fractal description of psd evolution during volumetric deformation of soils is clearly defined and the void ratio dependent swrc and rhcc are derived all model parameters can be calibrated from the swrc data of soils under two initial void ratios and can then be used to predict the swrc and rhcc of the soil under arbitrary deformation states eight experimental data sets including swrc and rhcc data under different initial void ratios are used to evaluate the proposed model results show that 1 the fractal based hydraulic model can well describe the influence of volumetric deformation on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils and 2 ignoring the evolution of psd during soil compression will significantly overestimate the water retention ability and hydraulic conductivity of soils keywords unsaturated soil water retention hydraulic conductivity fractal volumetric deformation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the constitutive relationship of hydraulic properties for unsaturated flow is generally represented by the soil water retention curve swrc and the relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc these constitutive relationships play a crucial role in modeling the coupled behavior between water air flow and deformation estimating the contribution of capillary pressure to shear strength and interpreting diffusion characteristics of the contaminant in soils in the early days some models were proposed to describe the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils e g brooks and corey 1964 mualem 1974 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 minasny et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 zhou and chen 2021 which can usually well reproduce the swrc and rhcc of soils with a neglectable volume change however for soils that undergo substantial volumetric deformation these models fail to describe the evolution of swrc and rhcc e g laliberte et al 1966 golubev and whittington 2018 driving by this limitation various improved hydraulic models have been proposed in the past decades ranging from parametric models to those involving specific theoretical considerations e g huang et al 1998 ng and pang 2000 gallipoli et al 2003 gallipoli et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 simms and yanful 2005 sun et al 2007 mašín 2010 hu et al 2013 gallipoli and bruno 2022 the former type of these models usually links the air entry value with the initial dry density or void ratio volumetric strain through an empirical function for example huang et al 1998 proposed an improved swrc model by inserting a one parameter function of void ratio into the bc model and then developed a density dependent rhcc model similarly gallipoli et al 2003 introduced a power function to the vg model to describe the influence of volumetric deformation on saturation based on the intrinsic constraints of saturation and volumetric deformation zhou et al 2012 presented a simple function related to the initial void ratio which can be combined with any existing water retention models to quantify the influence of the initial dry density on swrc the latter type of improved model is based on specific theoretical considerations based on network methods simms and yanful 2005 studied the influence of volume change on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils mašín 2010 used the effective stress principle to study the dependency of saturation on volumetric deformation and matric suction hu et al 2013 assumed that the psd in the deformed state could be obtained by scaling and shifting the psd in the reference state and derived an improved hydraulic model however due to the lack of a physical basis using empirical psd models or wrc models the parameters of these models have no clear physical meaning leading to limited adaptability and scalability due to the clear physical background the fractal scaling law has been widely used in modeling the psd pore roughness tortuosity and particle size distribution to study the hydraulic properties of porous media with different textures tyler and wheatcraft 1989 yu et al 2003 russell and buzzi 2012 russell 2014 khoshghalb et al 2015 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 for instance tyler and wheatcraft 1989 assumed a fractal based particle size distribution and developed an swrc model yu et al 2003 presented a permeability model for multiphase flow using fractal mathematics russell and buzzi 2012 adopted a cluster of nonuniform capillaries that obeyed the fractal scaling law to study the hysteresis behavior of swrc more recently chen et al 2021 developed a complete fractal hydraulic model including swrc and rhcc for unsaturated soils focusing on the influence of adsorbed components of matric potential although various fractal hydraulic models have been proposed it rarely involves the influence of volumetric deformation on hydraulic properties this paper presents a fractal based hydraulic model that considers the evolution of psd caused by the volumetric deformation of soils based on the intrinsic relationship between the areal fractal dimension d f and psd we extend the fractal scaling law by introducing the influence of volumetric deformation then a fractal based hydraulic model containing swrc and rhcc is derived for deformable unsaturated soils in the model all parameters can be calibrated from the swrc data and then used to predict the hydraulic conductivity of the soil finally eight experimental data sets of different soils are employed to validate the proposed hydraulic model 2 model development 2 1 fractal description of the evolution of psd the psd of soils plays an important role in their hydraulic properties which has been highlighted in many experimental and theoretical studies e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2005 various distribution functions have been proposed to describe the characteristics of psd such as lognormal distribution kosugi 1994 gamma distribution tuller and or 2001 gaussian distribution xu and torres verdín 2013 and fractal scaling law tyler and wheatcraft 1989 yu and cheng 2002 due to the clear physical background fractal based psd has been widely used in fluid flow and mass transfer yu and chen 2002 cihan et al 2009 guarracino et al 2014 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2022 experimental results e g lapierre et al 1990 simms and yanful 2005 ninjgarav et al 2007 show that volumetric deformation changes the psd of soils and then changes the areal fractal dimension therefore in this section we will define the fractal description of psd evolution during soil compression based on experimental evidence and then extend the fractal scaling law by introducing the influence of volumetric deformation adopted a representative element volume rev with height l 0 of soils in which the size of pores is distributed from r max the maximum radius of pores to r min the minimum radius of pores and obeys the fractal scaling law for simplicity the pore system within the rev is assumed to be a cluster of capillaries according to the fractal theory yu and li 2001 yu et al 2003 the cumulative number of pores n with a radius larger than r can be expressed as 1 n ε r r r max d f where r is the radius of pores ε is the measurement scale r max is the maximum radius of pores d f is the area fractal dimension of pores and subjects to 1 d f 2 the total number of pores within the rev n t can be obtained for eq 1 as n t r min r max d f the number of pores with radius r to r dr can be obtained by differentiating eq 1 that is 2 d n d f r max d f r d f 1 d r where d n 0 and the minus sign represents that the number of pores decreases with the increase of radius for porous media with a fractal psd the relationship between porosity ϕ and the area fractal dimension d f can be expressed as katz and thompson 1985 yu and li 2001 3a ϕ c r min r max d d f where ϕ e e 1 e is porosity and e is the void ratio d is the euclidean dimension equal to 2 for two dimensions and 3 for three dimensions c is a material constant as stated by yu and li 2001 c 1 is satisfied for exact self similarity porous media such as the sierpinski carpet and sierpinski gasket however soil with tortuous and irregular pores is statistically self similarity porous media c 1 eq 3a can be rearranged as 3b d f 2 ln e c 1 e ln r min ln r max for soils under a deformed state the area fractal dimension can be expressed as an equation similar to eq 3b that is 4a d f 2 ln e c 1 e ln r min ln r max where d f e r max and r min are the area fractal dimension void ratio the maximum radius of pores and the minimum radius of pores of soils under a deformed state respectively generally the larger pores of the soil will gradually decrease during compression while the size of the smallest pores is almost unchanged e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2004 nowamooz and masrouri 2010 therefore eq 4a can be rewritten as 4b d f 2 ln e c 1 e ln r min ln r max combining eq 3b and eq 4b yields 5 ln r max r max ln e c 1 e 2 d f ln e c 1 e 2 d f on the other hand khoshghalb et al 2015 analyzed the numerical simulation results of fractal porous media conducted by dodds and weitz 2002 and concluded that the maximum pore radius of fractal porous media has a linear relationship with the exponential function of its void ratio e that is 6 r max e η where η is a material parameter related to the characteristic of particle size distribution if the particle breakage of soils during compression is neglected η can be regarded as a constant from eq 6 one can obtain 7 r max r max e e η the evolution of areal fractal dimension with volumetric deformation can be obtained by substituting eq 7 into eq 5 that is 8 d f 2 2 d f ln e c 1 e ln e c 1 e η 2 d f ln e e fig 1 shows the comparison between experimental data and predicted curves by eq 8 and the results show good agreement this means that the extended model can well describe the influence of void ratio change on fractal dimension d f the cumulative volume v of pores with a radius larger than r can be obtained from eq 2 as 9 v v t r min r π r 2 l 0 d n r r min r max π r 2 l 0 d n r v t r 2 d f r min 2 d f r max 2 d f r min 2 d f where v t is the total pore volume therefore eqs 7 8 and 9 give the fractal description of psd evolution with volumetric deformation fig 2 shows the evolution of cumulative psd of the intact clay and the clay soil 1 during compression in which the solid lines are the predicted curves as shown the extended fractal scaling law can well describe the evolution of cumulative psd with volumetric deformation 2 2 density dependent swrc the relationship between pore radius r and capillary pressure s can be described by the young laplace equation e g fredlund and xing 1994 that is 10 s u a u w κ t s cos θ r where u a and u w are pore air and pore water pressure respectively κ is a geometry constant t s is the surface tension of the air water interface θ is the contact angle and it is assumed to be a constant in this study according to the young laplace equation the smaller the pore size the larger the capillary force this indicates that the smaller pores are filled with water preferentially for soils during wetting while the larger pores are drained preferentially during drying chen et al 2021 therefore there is a critical pore radius r c corresponding to a certain capillary pressure such that pores with a radius smaller than r c are filled with water while the others are filled with air for a given critical pore radius r c the saturation s r of the soil can be obtained from eq 2 as 11 s r r min r c π r 2 l 0 d n r r min r max π r 2 l 0 d n r r c r max 2 d f r min r max 2 d f 1 r min r max 2 d f inserting eq 3 and eq 10 into eq 11 yields 12 s r c s a s 2 d f e 1 e c e 1 e where s κt scosθ r c is the capillary pressure s a κt scosθ r max is the air entry value eq 12 is the swrc for soils under a given void ratio therefore the swrc of the soil under a deformed state can be obtained by combining eqs 7 8 10 and 12 that is 13 s r c α s e η 2 d f e 1 e c e 1 e where α s a e η related to the air entry value of soils under the reference state d f is the area fractal dimension of soils under a deformed state given by eq 8 e and e are the void ratio of soils under a deformed state and the reference state respectively 2 3 density dependent rhcc assuming that the fluid in soils is poiseuille flow and ignoring the interface resistance and body force the volumetric flow rate in a pore can be obtained from the hagen poiseuille equation bousfield and karles 2004 that is 14 q p r π r 4 8 μ δ p l t where q p is the volumetric flow rate of a single pore r is the radius of pores μ is the viscosity of pore water δ p is the hydraulic pressure drop l t is the tortuous length of the flow path which is affected by the degree of saturation based on the experimental results of burdine et al 1950 and the analytical value of wyllie and gardner 1958 brooks and corey 1964 suggested a relationship between the flow path length and the degree of saturation that is 15 l t s s r 2 l t u where l t s and l t u are the tortuous lengths of the flow path in the saturated and unsaturated states respectively a similar relationship between l t s and l t u can also be found in huang et al 1998 for soils under a saturated state it is assumed that the flow path length is equal to the length of the pores i e l t s l 0 therefore the total volumetric flow rate of the rev under a saturated state q t can be obtained by combining eq 2 and eq 15 that is 16 q t r min r max q p r d n r π δ p 8 μ l 0 d f r max d f 4 d f r max 4 d f r min 4 d f on the other hand q t can also be obtained from darcy s law 17 q t k s δ p l 0 a k s δ p l 0 a p ϕ r where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils a is the cross section area of the rev a p and ϕ r are the total pore area and porosity of the cross section of the rev respectively for simplicity ϕ r is assumed to be equal to the porosity of the rev i e ϕr ϕ combining eq 16 and eq 17 yields the saturated hydraulic conductivity that is 18 k s π ϕ 8 μ a p d f r max 4 4 d f 1 r min r max 4 d f where 2 4 d f 3 experimental results e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2004 nowamooz and masrouri 2010 show that for soils r min r max 10 2 therefore the term r min r max 4 d f is approximately equal to 0 and eq 18 can be reduced to 19a k s π ϕ 8 μ a p d f 4 d f r max 4 for saturated soils under a deformed state the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be expressed as 19b k s π ϕ 8 μ a p d f 4 d f r max 4 where a p is the total pore area of the cross section of the rev under a deformed state combining eq 19a and eq 19b yields 20 k s k s a p a p ϕ ϕ d f 4 d f d f 4 d f r max r max 4 the total pore area of the cross section of the rev can be obtained from eq 2 as 21 a p r min r max π r 2 d n r π d f r max d f 2 d f r max 2 d f r min 2 d f therefore a p a p can be expressed as 22 a p a p d f d f 2 d f 2 d f 1 r min r max 2 d f 1 r min r max 2 d f r max 2 r max 2 inserting eq 11 and eq 22 into eq 20 yields the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils under a deformed state that is 23 k s 2 d f 2 d f 4 d f 4 d f ϕ ϕ c ϕ c ϕ e e 2 η k s for soil under an unsaturated state the total volumetric flow rate of the rev q u t can be obtained by combining eq 2 and eq 15 that is 24 q u t r min r c q p r d n r π δ p 8 μ l t u d f r max d f 4 d f r c 4 d f r min 4 d f therefore the relative hydraulic conductivity of soils in an unsaturated state can be obtained by combining eqs 15 16 and 24 that is 25 k r q u t q t l 0 l t u r c r max 4 d f r min r max 4 d f 1 r min r max 4 d f where 4 d f 2 experimental results e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2004 nowamooz and masrouri 2010 showed that the value of r min r max of soils is smaller than 0 01 therefore the term r min r max 4 d f approximates to be zero inserting eq 11 and eq 15 into eq 25 yields 26 k r s r 2 s r 1 e c 1 e e c 1 e 4 d f 2 d f for soils with a large value of c the tortuosity and non uniformity of soil pores are very large the term e c 1 e approximates to be 0 and eq 26 can be reduced to 27 k r s r 3 2 2 d f interestingly eq 27 is similar to the typical bc model brooks and corey 1964 that is k r s r 3 2 λ where λ is an empirical parameter on the other hand it can be seen from eq 27 that the change in k r s r relationship with the void ratio is induced by the evolution of pore size distribution with volumetric deformation according to eq 26 the rhcc of soils under a deformed state can be obtained by combining eq 8 that is 28 k r s r 2 s r 1 e c 1 e e c 1 e 4 d f 2 d f where d f is given by eq 8 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils under a deformed state k u can be expressed as 29 k u k r k s the proposed density dependent rhcc model contains four parameters α η d f and c α is the parameter related to the air entry value of soils under the reference state d f is the area fractal dimension of soils under the reference state characterizing the psd of soils η is a material constant relating to the particle size distribution c is a material constant relating to the tortuosity and heterogeneity of pores all parameters can be calibrated from swrc data and then used to predict the rhcc of deformable unsaturated soils 3 validation and discussion eight experimental data of different soils ranging from sand to bentonite are used to evaluate the proposed model comprising clayey silty sand salager et al 2013 maryland clay burton et al 2014 kaolin sivakumar 2005 jossigny silt d onza et al 2011 speswhite kaolin raveendiraraj 2009 touchet silt loam and berlin coarse sand laliberte et al 1966 and columbia sandy loam leij et al 1996 among them five data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the density dependent swrc model the others are used to evaluate the performance of rhcc in which the model parameters are calibrated from the swrc data set the best fitted model parameters for all soils are summarized in table 1 3 1 evolution of swrc with volumetric deformation salager et al 2013 conducted a series of water retention tests on clayey silty sand using the axis translation and the vapor equilibrium technique the test soil comprises a mix of 10 clay 18 silt and 72 sand and the optimum water content of the soil is 14 5 the liquid and plastic limits of the soil are 25 and 14 5 respectively the specific gravity of the soil is 2 65 five samples with different void ratios namely 0 96 0 77 0 61 0 47 and 0 36 were prepared to study the influence of volumetric deformation on water retention properties the test results are shown in fig 3 the swrc data of the clayey silty samples under a void ratio of 0 96 and 0 77 are used to calibrate the model parameters for the soil sample under the reference state e 0 96 model parameters can be determined as d f 1 87 c 4 η 7 and α 0 23 kpa and then these parameters are directly used to predict the swrc of the soil under other void ratios as shown in fig 3 a for all soil samples with different void ratios the predicted curves agree well with the experimental data as discussed previously volumetric deformation affects the hydraulic properties of soils by changing their psds characterized by fractal dimension d f therefore fractal dimension d f should be changed with the void ratio as shown in fig 4 as seen d f increases with the increase of void ratio and the proposed model eq 8 provides a good prediction of the evolution of d f note that if this evolution of d f is ignored the saturation of soil under a given matric suction will be significantly overestimated see fig 3b for a constant suction the degree of saturation changes with volumetric deformation which also can be grasped by the proposed fractal swrc model four experimental data from different soils are used to further evaluate the proposed model as shown in fig 5 the physical property indices and grain size distribution of these four soils are summarized in table 2 for maryland clay the s r e data under s 900 kpa is employed to calibrate the model parameters the fractal dimension d f of the soil under the reference state e 0 7 is 1 78 and c η α can also be determined as 5 4 97 and 20 kpa respectively then these parameters are used to predict the s r e curves under other constant suction as shown in fig 5 a the predicted curves s 200 kpa and 100 kpa agree well with the measured data the other three soils also showed similar results as shown in fig 5 b d 3 2 evolution of rhcc with volumetric deformation laliberte et al 1966 performed a series of hydraulic properties tests on two soils named touchet silt loam and columbia sandy loam the touchet silt loam is a mixture of 15 clay 53 silt and 35 sand while the columbia sandy loam is a mixture of 11 clay 53 silt and 54 sand for these two test soils both swrc and rhcc data under different void ratios were measured as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 therefore it is possible to evaluate the ability of the proposed hydraulic model to predict the rhcc using parameters calibrated from the swrc data for the touchet silt loam the swrc data at a void ratio of 0 97 and 0 86 are used to calibrate the model parameters as shown in fig 6 a the area fractal dimension of the soil at the reference state e 0 97 is 1 30 the other parameters are listed in table 1 and then these parameters are used to predict the swrc and rhcc of the soil under other void ratios since the proposed hydraulic model can describe the variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity with volumetric deformation see fig 6c the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil can also be determined see fig 6d as shown in fig 6 a d the predicted curves agree well with the experimental data it is found that for the touchet silt loam under a given capillary pressure the relative hydraulic conductivity k r increases with the decrease of void ratio while the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s decreases during soil compression since the pore size of sandy soil is generally larger than that of silty soil the suction range and air entry value of columbia sandy loam fig 7 are smaller than that of touchet silt loam fig 6 at the same void ratio for columbia sandy loam at the reference state e 1 19 the area fractal dimension is 1 10 fig 7 b 7 c and 7 d show the predicted curves using the parameters see table 1 obtained from swrc data and an excellent agreement can be seen another set of such complete hydraulic properties data including swrc and rhcc was reported by leij et al 1996 as shown in fig 8 the fractal dimension of the soil at the reference state e 0 54 is determined as 1 02 fig 8 compares predicted curves and the experimental data at different compression states again the results indicate that the proposed model can well describe the dependence of hydraulic properties on the void ratio in summary these examples show that the fractal based hydraulic model for deformable unsaturated soil using an extended fractal scaling law to reflect the evolution of psd during soil compression can effectively explain the dependence of hydraulic properties on soil densities 3 3 model features analysis and discussion the proposed density dependent hydraulic model contains four parameters d f η c and α d f is the area fractal dimension of soils under the reference state characterizing the psd of soils η is a material constant related to the particle size distribution c is a material constant related to the tortuosity and heterogeneity of pores α is the parameter related to the air entry value of soils under the reference state calibration of the four model parameters requires at least the experimental results of swrc of soils at two different initial void ratios this experiment can be performed with a modified triaxial apparatus for unsaturated soils the axial translation technique or by using the filter paper method figs 8 10 show the influence of these parameters on the relative hydraulic conductivity 3 4 influences of the area fractal dimension d f fig 9 shows the influence of psd on the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils the value of d f at a given reference void ratio of soils with different textures is different for example as shown in fig 9 a soil a and soil b are two soils with different textures and the area fractal dimension d f at the reference state e 1 0 are 1 5 and 1 7 respectively the larger d f means the larger the volume proportion of small pores resulting in larger fluid resistance therefore soil a has a larger k u than soil b under the same saturation as shown in fig 9 b on the other hand volumetric deformation changes the psd of soils and d f changes accordingly as shown in fig 9 a for example for soil a the area fractal dimension decreases with the decrease in void ratio and k u also decreases during soil compression see fig 9b in addition it can be observed from fig 9 a that the slope of the fractal dimension versus void ratio curve d f e curve decreases for a given soil e g soil a this is because when the soil has a high void ratio soil compression results in the compression of all pores as a whole as a result the ratio of maximum to minimum pore size changes slowly as the void ratio decreases however as the void ratio decreases smaller pores become increasingly challenging to compress and the compressed pore space is mostly borne by the larger pores this causes the ratio of maximum to minimum pore size in the soil to change rapidly thus the slope of the d f e curve decreases gradually as the void ratio increases 3 5 influences of pore tortuosity and heterogeneity the influence of pore tortuosity and heterogeneity on hydraulic conductivity is illustrated in fig 10 the larger the value of c the greater the tortuosity and heterogeneity of the pores thus leading to larger fluid resistance therefore as shown in fig 10 a soils with a larger c have a smaller k u the void ratio e 1 0 is the given reference void ratio at which the fractal dimensions d f of soil a c 20 and soil b c 7 are equal d f 1 7 which means that both soils have the same pore size distribution at e 1 0 the reference void ratio is employed to facilitate the comparison of the variation pattern of d f for the two soils at different values of c if the c values of soil a and soil b are also equal the variation of d f with void ratio should be the same for both soils as shown in fig 10 b despite having different c values the differences in the d f e curves of the two soils are minor this is because parameter c primarily impacts pore tortuosity and has less influence on d f which is mainly affected by the pore size distribution on the other hand it can be seen from fig 10 b that the smaller the tortuosity of soil pores the larger the pore size distribution changes with the void ratio it is worth noting that the tortuosity and non uniformity of the void space can be quantitatively characterized through the intrusion extrusion cyclic mercury porosimetry iec mip tests zhang et al 2022 however it would be more advantageous for the study of the hydraulic properties of real soils if the pore space structure could be presented directly in three dimensions 3 6 influences of particle size distribution fig 11 shows the influence of particle size distribution on k u a smaller η means the soil has a larger proportion of small particles therefore the change in k u of the soil with η 3 during soil compression smaller than that of the soil with η 6 as shown in fig 11 a as explained above the slope of the d f e curve decreases as the void ratio increases indicating that the value of d f changes slowly as the void ratio increases beyond the reference void ratio additionally the value of η is associated with the particle size distribution of the soil whereby a smaller η denotes a soil with a greater proportion of small particles and small pores as a result the slope of the d f e curve for soil a η 3 is consistently lower than that of soil b η 6 at the reference void ratio of e 1 soil a and soil b have identical fractal dimensions d f as shown in fig 11 b when the void ratio exceeds the reference pore ratio e 1 0 the fractal dimensions d f of both soils change minimally resulting in a small difference in the d f values between the two soils it should be noted that the evolution of psd does not only affect the hydraulic properties of porous media but also changes other physical and chemical processes for example biomineralization induced by minerals produced by bacteria metabolism could change the pore size distribution of soils or rocks which can significantly reduce permeability and hence is beneficial to co2 geological storage cunningham et al 2009 phillips et al 2013 in the in situ oxidative remediation of contaminated sites the chemical reaction of potassium permanganate as a remediation agent will generate mno2 solid particles by products these by product particles will block soil pores and hence change the pore size distribution of soils leading to extremely limited remediation efficiency wang et al 2022 neglecting such changes can lead to wrong remediation frames and higher remediation costs in addition differences in pore size distribution caused by the accumulation of bacteria also have a significant impact on the efficiency of the biofilter yang et al 2020 the method proposed in this paper can also be a starting point for studying the impact of psd evolution on these physical and chemical processes 4 conclusions this paper presents a fractal based hydraulic model for deformable unsaturated soils including the swrc and rhcc based on the experimental evidence that the pore size distribution psd evolves during soil compression an extended fractal scaling law is proposed by introducing the influence of volumetric deformation then a fractal based swrc model for deformable unsaturated soils is presented in which a variable area fractal dimension is used to reflect the evolution of psd combined with the hagen poiseulle equation an rhcc model is obtained without introducing any new parameters there are four parameters with a clear physical meaning in the proposed model all of which can be calibrated from the swrc data and then used to predict the rhcc of the soil eight experimental data sets of soils ranging from sand to clay are employed to evaluate the proposed hydraulic model the results reveal that the proposed model can well describe the dependence of swrc and rhcc on the void ratio of unsaturated soils it is also found that ignoring the evolution of psd with soil compression will overestimate the ability of water retention and water conductivity of the soil credit authorship contribution statement ke chen conceptualization

1952,this paper presents a fractal based hydraulic model for unsaturated flow which includes the soil water retention curve swrc and relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc and considers the evolution of pore size distribution psd during soil deformation in this model soil psd is assumed to follow the fractal scaling law and soil deformation is characterized by a change in the fractal dimension and air entry value by combining the intrinsic constraint between void ratio and fractal dimension the fractal description of psd evolution during volumetric deformation of soils is clearly defined and the void ratio dependent swrc and rhcc are derived all model parameters can be calibrated from the swrc data of soils under two initial void ratios and can then be used to predict the swrc and rhcc of the soil under arbitrary deformation states eight experimental data sets including swrc and rhcc data under different initial void ratios are used to evaluate the proposed model results show that 1 the fractal based hydraulic model can well describe the influence of volumetric deformation on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils and 2 ignoring the evolution of psd during soil compression will significantly overestimate the water retention ability and hydraulic conductivity of soils keywords unsaturated soil water retention hydraulic conductivity fractal volumetric deformation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the constitutive relationship of hydraulic properties for unsaturated flow is generally represented by the soil water retention curve swrc and the relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc these constitutive relationships play a crucial role in modeling the coupled behavior between water air flow and deformation estimating the contribution of capillary pressure to shear strength and interpreting diffusion characteristics of the contaminant in soils in the early days some models were proposed to describe the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils e g brooks and corey 1964 mualem 1974 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 minasny et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 zhou and chen 2021 which can usually well reproduce the swrc and rhcc of soils with a neglectable volume change however for soils that undergo substantial volumetric deformation these models fail to describe the evolution of swrc and rhcc e g laliberte et al 1966 golubev and whittington 2018 driving by this limitation various improved hydraulic models have been proposed in the past decades ranging from parametric models to those involving specific theoretical considerations e g huang et al 1998 ng and pang 2000 gallipoli et al 2003 gallipoli et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 simms and yanful 2005 sun et al 2007 mašín 2010 hu et al 2013 gallipoli and bruno 2022 the former type of these models usually links the air entry value with the initial dry density or void ratio volumetric strain through an empirical function for example huang et al 1998 proposed an improved swrc model by inserting a one parameter function of void ratio into the bc model and then developed a density dependent rhcc model similarly gallipoli et al 2003 introduced a power function to the vg model to describe the influence of volumetric deformation on saturation based on the intrinsic constraints of saturation and volumetric deformation zhou et al 2012 presented a simple function related to the initial void ratio which can be combined with any existing water retention models to quantify the influence of the initial dry density on swrc the latter type of improved model is based on specific theoretical considerations based on network methods simms and yanful 2005 studied the influence of volume change on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils mašín 2010 used the effective stress principle to study the dependency of saturation on volumetric deformation and matric suction hu et al 2013 assumed that the psd in the deformed state could be obtained by scaling and shifting the psd in the reference state and derived an improved hydraulic model however due to the lack of a physical basis using empirical psd models or wrc models the parameters of these models have no clear physical meaning leading to limited adaptability and scalability due to the clear physical background the fractal scaling law has been widely used in modeling the psd pore roughness tortuosity and particle size distribution to study the hydraulic properties of porous media with different textures tyler and wheatcraft 1989 yu et al 2003 russell and buzzi 2012 russell 2014 khoshghalb et al 2015 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 for instance tyler and wheatcraft 1989 assumed a fractal based particle size distribution and developed an swrc model yu et al 2003 presented a permeability model for multiphase flow using fractal mathematics russell and buzzi 2012 adopted a cluster of nonuniform capillaries that obeyed the fractal scaling law to study the hysteresis behavior of swrc more recently chen et al 2021 developed a complete fractal hydraulic model including swrc and rhcc for unsaturated soils focusing on the influence of adsorbed components of matric potential although various fractal hydraulic models have been proposed it rarely involves the influence of volumetric deformation on hydraulic properties this paper presents a fractal based hydraulic model that considers the evolution of psd caused by the volumetric deformation of soils based on the intrinsic relationship between the areal fractal dimension d f and psd we extend the fractal scaling law by introducing the influence of volumetric deformation then a fractal based hydraulic model containing swrc and rhcc is derived for deformable unsaturated soils in the model all parameters can be calibrated from the swrc data and then used to predict the hydraulic conductivity of the soil finally eight experimental data sets of different soils are employed to validate the proposed hydraulic model 2 model development 2 1 fractal description of the evolution of psd the psd of soils plays an important role in their hydraulic properties which has been highlighted in many experimental and theoretical studies e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2005 various distribution functions have been proposed to describe the characteristics of psd such as lognormal distribution kosugi 1994 gamma distribution tuller and or 2001 gaussian distribution xu and torres verdín 2013 and fractal scaling law tyler and wheatcraft 1989 yu and cheng 2002 due to the clear physical background fractal based psd has been widely used in fluid flow and mass transfer yu and chen 2002 cihan et al 2009 guarracino et al 2014 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2022 experimental results e g lapierre et al 1990 simms and yanful 2005 ninjgarav et al 2007 show that volumetric deformation changes the psd of soils and then changes the areal fractal dimension therefore in this section we will define the fractal description of psd evolution during soil compression based on experimental evidence and then extend the fractal scaling law by introducing the influence of volumetric deformation adopted a representative element volume rev with height l 0 of soils in which the size of pores is distributed from r max the maximum radius of pores to r min the minimum radius of pores and obeys the fractal scaling law for simplicity the pore system within the rev is assumed to be a cluster of capillaries according to the fractal theory yu and li 2001 yu et al 2003 the cumulative number of pores n with a radius larger than r can be expressed as 1 n ε r r r max d f where r is the radius of pores ε is the measurement scale r max is the maximum radius of pores d f is the area fractal dimension of pores and subjects to 1 d f 2 the total number of pores within the rev n t can be obtained for eq 1 as n t r min r max d f the number of pores with radius r to r dr can be obtained by differentiating eq 1 that is 2 d n d f r max d f r d f 1 d r where d n 0 and the minus sign represents that the number of pores decreases with the increase of radius for porous media with a fractal psd the relationship between porosity ϕ and the area fractal dimension d f can be expressed as katz and thompson 1985 yu and li 2001 3a ϕ c r min r max d d f where ϕ e e 1 e is porosity and e is the void ratio d is the euclidean dimension equal to 2 for two dimensions and 3 for three dimensions c is a material constant as stated by yu and li 2001 c 1 is satisfied for exact self similarity porous media such as the sierpinski carpet and sierpinski gasket however soil with tortuous and irregular pores is statistically self similarity porous media c 1 eq 3a can be rearranged as 3b d f 2 ln e c 1 e ln r min ln r max for soils under a deformed state the area fractal dimension can be expressed as an equation similar to eq 3b that is 4a d f 2 ln e c 1 e ln r min ln r max where d f e r max and r min are the area fractal dimension void ratio the maximum radius of pores and the minimum radius of pores of soils under a deformed state respectively generally the larger pores of the soil will gradually decrease during compression while the size of the smallest pores is almost unchanged e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2004 nowamooz and masrouri 2010 therefore eq 4a can be rewritten as 4b d f 2 ln e c 1 e ln r min ln r max combining eq 3b and eq 4b yields 5 ln r max r max ln e c 1 e 2 d f ln e c 1 e 2 d f on the other hand khoshghalb et al 2015 analyzed the numerical simulation results of fractal porous media conducted by dodds and weitz 2002 and concluded that the maximum pore radius of fractal porous media has a linear relationship with the exponential function of its void ratio e that is 6 r max e η where η is a material parameter related to the characteristic of particle size distribution if the particle breakage of soils during compression is neglected η can be regarded as a constant from eq 6 one can obtain 7 r max r max e e η the evolution of areal fractal dimension with volumetric deformation can be obtained by substituting eq 7 into eq 5 that is 8 d f 2 2 d f ln e c 1 e ln e c 1 e η 2 d f ln e e fig 1 shows the comparison between experimental data and predicted curves by eq 8 and the results show good agreement this means that the extended model can well describe the influence of void ratio change on fractal dimension d f the cumulative volume v of pores with a radius larger than r can be obtained from eq 2 as 9 v v t r min r π r 2 l 0 d n r r min r max π r 2 l 0 d n r v t r 2 d f r min 2 d f r max 2 d f r min 2 d f where v t is the total pore volume therefore eqs 7 8 and 9 give the fractal description of psd evolution with volumetric deformation fig 2 shows the evolution of cumulative psd of the intact clay and the clay soil 1 during compression in which the solid lines are the predicted curves as shown the extended fractal scaling law can well describe the evolution of cumulative psd with volumetric deformation 2 2 density dependent swrc the relationship between pore radius r and capillary pressure s can be described by the young laplace equation e g fredlund and xing 1994 that is 10 s u a u w κ t s cos θ r where u a and u w are pore air and pore water pressure respectively κ is a geometry constant t s is the surface tension of the air water interface θ is the contact angle and it is assumed to be a constant in this study according to the young laplace equation the smaller the pore size the larger the capillary force this indicates that the smaller pores are filled with water preferentially for soils during wetting while the larger pores are drained preferentially during drying chen et al 2021 therefore there is a critical pore radius r c corresponding to a certain capillary pressure such that pores with a radius smaller than r c are filled with water while the others are filled with air for a given critical pore radius r c the saturation s r of the soil can be obtained from eq 2 as 11 s r r min r c π r 2 l 0 d n r r min r max π r 2 l 0 d n r r c r max 2 d f r min r max 2 d f 1 r min r max 2 d f inserting eq 3 and eq 10 into eq 11 yields 12 s r c s a s 2 d f e 1 e c e 1 e where s κt scosθ r c is the capillary pressure s a κt scosθ r max is the air entry value eq 12 is the swrc for soils under a given void ratio therefore the swrc of the soil under a deformed state can be obtained by combining eqs 7 8 10 and 12 that is 13 s r c α s e η 2 d f e 1 e c e 1 e where α s a e η related to the air entry value of soils under the reference state d f is the area fractal dimension of soils under a deformed state given by eq 8 e and e are the void ratio of soils under a deformed state and the reference state respectively 2 3 density dependent rhcc assuming that the fluid in soils is poiseuille flow and ignoring the interface resistance and body force the volumetric flow rate in a pore can be obtained from the hagen poiseuille equation bousfield and karles 2004 that is 14 q p r π r 4 8 μ δ p l t where q p is the volumetric flow rate of a single pore r is the radius of pores μ is the viscosity of pore water δ p is the hydraulic pressure drop l t is the tortuous length of the flow path which is affected by the degree of saturation based on the experimental results of burdine et al 1950 and the analytical value of wyllie and gardner 1958 brooks and corey 1964 suggested a relationship between the flow path length and the degree of saturation that is 15 l t s s r 2 l t u where l t s and l t u are the tortuous lengths of the flow path in the saturated and unsaturated states respectively a similar relationship between l t s and l t u can also be found in huang et al 1998 for soils under a saturated state it is assumed that the flow path length is equal to the length of the pores i e l t s l 0 therefore the total volumetric flow rate of the rev under a saturated state q t can be obtained by combining eq 2 and eq 15 that is 16 q t r min r max q p r d n r π δ p 8 μ l 0 d f r max d f 4 d f r max 4 d f r min 4 d f on the other hand q t can also be obtained from darcy s law 17 q t k s δ p l 0 a k s δ p l 0 a p ϕ r where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils a is the cross section area of the rev a p and ϕ r are the total pore area and porosity of the cross section of the rev respectively for simplicity ϕ r is assumed to be equal to the porosity of the rev i e ϕr ϕ combining eq 16 and eq 17 yields the saturated hydraulic conductivity that is 18 k s π ϕ 8 μ a p d f r max 4 4 d f 1 r min r max 4 d f where 2 4 d f 3 experimental results e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2004 nowamooz and masrouri 2010 show that for soils r min r max 10 2 therefore the term r min r max 4 d f is approximately equal to 0 and eq 18 can be reduced to 19a k s π ϕ 8 μ a p d f 4 d f r max 4 for saturated soils under a deformed state the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be expressed as 19b k s π ϕ 8 μ a p d f 4 d f r max 4 where a p is the total pore area of the cross section of the rev under a deformed state combining eq 19a and eq 19b yields 20 k s k s a p a p ϕ ϕ d f 4 d f d f 4 d f r max r max 4 the total pore area of the cross section of the rev can be obtained from eq 2 as 21 a p r min r max π r 2 d n r π d f r max d f 2 d f r max 2 d f r min 2 d f therefore a p a p can be expressed as 22 a p a p d f d f 2 d f 2 d f 1 r min r max 2 d f 1 r min r max 2 d f r max 2 r max 2 inserting eq 11 and eq 22 into eq 20 yields the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils under a deformed state that is 23 k s 2 d f 2 d f 4 d f 4 d f ϕ ϕ c ϕ c ϕ e e 2 η k s for soil under an unsaturated state the total volumetric flow rate of the rev q u t can be obtained by combining eq 2 and eq 15 that is 24 q u t r min r c q p r d n r π δ p 8 μ l t u d f r max d f 4 d f r c 4 d f r min 4 d f therefore the relative hydraulic conductivity of soils in an unsaturated state can be obtained by combining eqs 15 16 and 24 that is 25 k r q u t q t l 0 l t u r c r max 4 d f r min r max 4 d f 1 r min r max 4 d f where 4 d f 2 experimental results e g tanaka et al 2003 simms and yanful 2004 nowamooz and masrouri 2010 showed that the value of r min r max of soils is smaller than 0 01 therefore the term r min r max 4 d f approximates to be zero inserting eq 11 and eq 15 into eq 25 yields 26 k r s r 2 s r 1 e c 1 e e c 1 e 4 d f 2 d f for soils with a large value of c the tortuosity and non uniformity of soil pores are very large the term e c 1 e approximates to be 0 and eq 26 can be reduced to 27 k r s r 3 2 2 d f interestingly eq 27 is similar to the typical bc model brooks and corey 1964 that is k r s r 3 2 λ where λ is an empirical parameter on the other hand it can be seen from eq 27 that the change in k r s r relationship with the void ratio is induced by the evolution of pore size distribution with volumetric deformation according to eq 26 the rhcc of soils under a deformed state can be obtained by combining eq 8 that is 28 k r s r 2 s r 1 e c 1 e e c 1 e 4 d f 2 d f where d f is given by eq 8 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils under a deformed state k u can be expressed as 29 k u k r k s the proposed density dependent rhcc model contains four parameters α η d f and c α is the parameter related to the air entry value of soils under the reference state d f is the area fractal dimension of soils under the reference state characterizing the psd of soils η is a material constant relating to the particle size distribution c is a material constant relating to the tortuosity and heterogeneity of pores all parameters can be calibrated from swrc data and then used to predict the rhcc of deformable unsaturated soils 3 validation and discussion eight experimental data of different soils ranging from sand to bentonite are used to evaluate the proposed model comprising clayey silty sand salager et al 2013 maryland clay burton et al 2014 kaolin sivakumar 2005 jossigny silt d onza et al 2011 speswhite kaolin raveendiraraj 2009 touchet silt loam and berlin coarse sand laliberte et al 1966 and columbia sandy loam leij et al 1996 among them five data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the density dependent swrc model the others are used to evaluate the performance of rhcc in which the model parameters are calibrated from the swrc data set the best fitted model parameters for all soils are summarized in table 1 3 1 evolution of swrc with volumetric deformation salager et al 2013 conducted a series of water retention tests on clayey silty sand using the axis translation and the vapor equilibrium technique the test soil comprises a mix of 10 clay 18 silt and 72 sand and the optimum water content of the soil is 14 5 the liquid and plastic limits of the soil are 25 and 14 5 respectively the specific gravity of the soil is 2 65 five samples with different void ratios namely 0 96 0 77 0 61 0 47 and 0 36 were prepared to study the influence of volumetric deformation on water retention properties the test results are shown in fig 3 the swrc data of the clayey silty samples under a void ratio of 0 96 and 0 77 are used to calibrate the model parameters for the soil sample under the reference state e 0 96 model parameters can be determined as d f 1 87 c 4 η 7 and α 0 23 kpa and then these parameters are directly used to predict the swrc of the soil under other void ratios as shown in fig 3 a for all soil samples with different void ratios the predicted curves agree well with the experimental data as discussed previously volumetric deformation affects the hydraulic properties of soils by changing their psds characterized by fractal dimension d f therefore fractal dimension d f should be changed with the void ratio as shown in fig 4 as seen d f increases with the increase of void ratio and the proposed model eq 8 provides a good prediction of the evolution of d f note that if this evolution of d f is ignored the saturation of soil under a given matric suction will be significantly overestimated see fig 3b for a constant suction the degree of saturation changes with volumetric deformation which also can be grasped by the proposed fractal swrc model four experimental data from different soils are used to further evaluate the proposed model as shown in fig 5 the physical property indices and grain size distribution of these four soils are summarized in table 2 for maryland clay the s r e data under s 900 kpa is employed to calibrate the model parameters the fractal dimension d f of the soil under the reference state e 0 7 is 1 78 and c η α can also be determined as 5 4 97 and 20 kpa respectively then these parameters are used to predict the s r e curves under other constant suction as shown in fig 5 a the predicted curves s 200 kpa and 100 kpa agree well with the measured data the other three soils also showed similar results as shown in fig 5 b d 3 2 evolution of rhcc with volumetric deformation laliberte et al 1966 performed a series of hydraulic properties tests on two soils named touchet silt loam and columbia sandy loam the touchet silt loam is a mixture of 15 clay 53 silt and 35 sand while the columbia sandy loam is a mixture of 11 clay 53 silt and 54 sand for these two test soils both swrc and rhcc data under different void ratios were measured as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 therefore it is possible to evaluate the ability of the proposed hydraulic model to predict the rhcc using parameters calibrated from the swrc data for the touchet silt loam the swrc data at a void ratio of 0 97 and 0 86 are used to calibrate the model parameters as shown in fig 6 a the area fractal dimension of the soil at the reference state e 0 97 is 1 30 the other parameters are listed in table 1 and then these parameters are used to predict the swrc and rhcc of the soil under other void ratios since the proposed hydraulic model can describe the variation of saturated hydraulic conductivity with volumetric deformation see fig 6c the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil can also be determined see fig 6d as shown in fig 6 a d the predicted curves agree well with the experimental data it is found that for the touchet silt loam under a given capillary pressure the relative hydraulic conductivity k r increases with the decrease of void ratio while the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s decreases during soil compression since the pore size of sandy soil is generally larger than that of silty soil the suction range and air entry value of columbia sandy loam fig 7 are smaller than that of touchet silt loam fig 6 at the same void ratio for columbia sandy loam at the reference state e 1 19 the area fractal dimension is 1 10 fig 7 b 7 c and 7 d show the predicted curves using the parameters see table 1 obtained from swrc data and an excellent agreement can be seen another set of such complete hydraulic properties data including swrc and rhcc was reported by leij et al 1996 as shown in fig 8 the fractal dimension of the soil at the reference state e 0 54 is determined as 1 02 fig 8 compares predicted curves and the experimental data at different compression states again the results indicate that the proposed model can well describe the dependence of hydraulic properties on the void ratio in summary these examples show that the fractal based hydraulic model for deformable unsaturated soil using an extended fractal scaling law to reflect the evolution of psd during soil compression can effectively explain the dependence of hydraulic properties on soil densities 3 3 model features analysis and discussion the proposed density dependent hydraulic model contains four parameters d f η c and α d f is the area fractal dimension of soils under the reference state characterizing the psd of soils η is a material constant related to the particle size distribution c is a material constant related to the tortuosity and heterogeneity of pores α is the parameter related to the air entry value of soils under the reference state calibration of the four model parameters requires at least the experimental results of swrc of soils at two different initial void ratios this experiment can be performed with a modified triaxial apparatus for unsaturated soils the axial translation technique or by using the filter paper method figs 8 10 show the influence of these parameters on the relative hydraulic conductivity 3 4 influences of the area fractal dimension d f fig 9 shows the influence of psd on the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils the value of d f at a given reference void ratio of soils with different textures is different for example as shown in fig 9 a soil a and soil b are two soils with different textures and the area fractal dimension d f at the reference state e 1 0 are 1 5 and 1 7 respectively the larger d f means the larger the volume proportion of small pores resulting in larger fluid resistance therefore soil a has a larger k u than soil b under the same saturation as shown in fig 9 b on the other hand volumetric deformation changes the psd of soils and d f changes accordingly as shown in fig 9 a for example for soil a the area fractal dimension decreases with the decrease in void ratio and k u also decreases during soil compression see fig 9b in addition it can be observed from fig 9 a that the slope of the fractal dimension versus void ratio curve d f e curve decreases for a given soil e g soil a this is because when the soil has a high void ratio soil compression results in the compression of all pores as a whole as a result the ratio of maximum to minimum pore size changes slowly as the void ratio decreases however as the void ratio decreases smaller pores become increasingly challenging to compress and the compressed pore space is mostly borne by the larger pores this causes the ratio of maximum to minimum pore size in the soil to change rapidly thus the slope of the d f e curve decreases gradually as the void ratio increases 3 5 influences of pore tortuosity and heterogeneity the influence of pore tortuosity and heterogeneity on hydraulic conductivity is illustrated in fig 10 the larger the value of c the greater the tortuosity and heterogeneity of the pores thus leading to larger fluid resistance therefore as shown in fig 10 a soils with a larger c have a smaller k u the void ratio e 1 0 is the given reference void ratio at which the fractal dimensions d f of soil a c 20 and soil b c 7 are equal d f 1 7 which means that both soils have the same pore size distribution at e 1 0 the reference void ratio is employed to facilitate the comparison of the variation pattern of d f for the two soils at different values of c if the c values of soil a and soil b are also equal the variation of d f with void ratio should be the same for both soils as shown in fig 10 b despite having different c values the differences in the d f e curves of the two soils are minor this is because parameter c primarily impacts pore tortuosity and has less influence on d f which is mainly affected by the pore size distribution on the other hand it can be seen from fig 10 b that the smaller the tortuosity of soil pores the larger the pore size distribution changes with the void ratio it is worth noting that the tortuosity and non uniformity of the void space can be quantitatively characterized through the intrusion extrusion cyclic mercury porosimetry iec mip tests zhang et al 2022 however it would be more advantageous for the study of the hydraulic properties of real soils if the pore space structure could be presented directly in three dimensions 3 6 influences of particle size distribution fig 11 shows the influence of particle size distribution on k u a smaller η means the soil has a larger proportion of small particles therefore the change in k u of the soil with η 3 during soil compression smaller than that of the soil with η 6 as shown in fig 11 a as explained above the slope of the d f e curve decreases as the void ratio increases indicating that the value of d f changes slowly as the void ratio increases beyond the reference void ratio additionally the value of η is associated with the particle size distribution of the soil whereby a smaller η denotes a soil with a greater proportion of small particles and small pores as a result the slope of the d f e curve for soil a η 3 is consistently lower than that of soil b η 6 at the reference void ratio of e 1 soil a and soil b have identical fractal dimensions d f as shown in fig 11 b when the void ratio exceeds the reference pore ratio e 1 0 the fractal dimensions d f of both soils change minimally resulting in a small difference in the d f values between the two soils it should be noted that the evolution of psd does not only affect the hydraulic properties of porous media but also changes other physical and chemical processes for example biomineralization induced by minerals produced by bacteria metabolism could change the pore size distribution of soils or rocks which can significantly reduce permeability and hence is beneficial to co2 geological storage cunningham et al 2009 phillips et al 2013 in the in situ oxidative remediation of contaminated sites the chemical reaction of potassium permanganate as a remediation agent will generate mno2 solid particles by products these by product particles will block soil pores and hence change the pore size distribution of soils leading to extremely limited remediation efficiency wang et al 2022 neglecting such changes can lead to wrong remediation frames and higher remediation costs in addition differences in pore size distribution caused by the accumulation of bacteria also have a significant impact on the efficiency of the biofilter yang et al 2020 the method proposed in this paper can also be a starting point for studying the impact of psd evolution on these physical and chemical processes 4 conclusions this paper presents a fractal based hydraulic model for deformable unsaturated soils including the swrc and rhcc based on the experimental evidence that the pore size distribution psd evolves during soil compression an extended fractal scaling law is proposed by introducing the influence of volumetric deformation then a fractal based swrc model for deformable unsaturated soils is presented in which a variable area fractal dimension is used to reflect the evolution of psd combined with the hagen poiseulle equation an rhcc model is obtained without introducing any new parameters there are four parameters with a clear physical meaning in the proposed model all of which can be calibrated from the swrc data and then used to predict the rhcc of the soil eight experimental data sets of soils ranging from sand to clay are employed to evaluate the proposed hydraulic model the results reveal that the proposed model can well describe the dependence of swrc and rhcc on the void ratio of unsaturated soils it is also found that ignoring the evolution of psd with soil compression will overestimate the ability of water retention and water conductivity of the soil credit authorship contribution statement ke chen conceptualization

1953,we investigate how hydrologic land feedbacks and a hydrologic water management linkage impact land cover arrangements optimized within a multiobjective land cover design framework the framework integrates a spatially distributed and physically based hydrologic model for simulating surface and subsurface flow and land processes with a network based multi sector water resources management and allocation model both models used parflow pywr are open source the framework is applied to a hillslope problem to identify land cover patterns that optimize trade offs between water food energy and environment objectives results show trade offs depend on land cover composition and the spatial arrangement of land covers within the catchment total runoff volume and peak flow of runoff was found to change 3 and 2 fold respectively between optimized solutions as land cover composition and spatial patterns were altered to satisfy different combinations of objectives at the same time up to a 15 reduction in the total runoff volume and an 8 reduction in the peak flow of runoff were observed within optimized land cover patterns having equal composition but different spatial arrangements this emphasizes the impact on hydrologic behavior of the spatial location of land covers within a catchment the emergence of patterns in land cover distribution for different trade offs between objectives is driven by feedback mechanisms between subsurface hydrology and land processes which are implicitly linked to the properties of each land cover and the interactions between neighboring land covers through lateral groundwater flow the study demonstrates the added benefits of coupling distributed hydrologic models with water management simulation for multisector multicriteria land cover planning graphical abstract keywords land cover design distributed hydrology multiobjective optimization multisector dynamics parallel computing data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction vegetation influences the energy and moisture fluxes between land atmosphere and subsurface via 1 net radiation 2 evaporation and transpiration 3 interception of rainfall and 4 redistribution of moisture via root water uptake maxwell and miller 2005 kuffour et al 2020 as a result catchments with the same geomorphology but with varying land cover are likely to exhibit different local climatic properties such as diurnal temperature ranges as well hydrologic conditions on top of and below the surface siriwardena et al 2006 mao and cherkauer 2009 ultimately land cover and its spatial arrangement affects water resource availability in river basins thus impacting different sectors such as food and energy production as well as other environmental services d odorico et al 2018 informing land cover decisions is therefore a multiobjective problem because different sectors use the same resources and thus may be in conflict the task is additionally complicated by the complex nature of the interactions between land atmosphere and the subsurface dai et al 2003 assisting land cover decision making with computational models may therefore provide unreliable guidance if these models are unable to describe those interactions with sufficient level of fidelity on the other hand detailed and thus computationally expensive mechanistic models are likely to generate high computational overheads which might render them inapplicable in decision making frameworks however recent advancements in the accessibility and the affordability of high performance computing hpc combined with parallelization of numerical solvers e g richards et al 2005 kollet and maxwell 2006 shen and phanikumar 2010 enable gradual introduction of rigorous physically based simulation models into quantitative decision making frameworks another barrier to overcome when it comes to mechanistic hydrologic models is the increased number of parameters and measurements required for their identification in comparison to simpler e g behavioural models under a shortage of a sufficient amount and quality of calibration data we may end up with models with potentially large prediction uncertainty even though they are more physically sound this topic although not the subject of this discourse has been addressed in great detail in beven 2007 2019 hydrologic models range from lumped siriwardena et al 2006 delgado et al 2010 tong et al 2012 to semi distributed mccoll and aggett 2007 hundecha and bárdossy 2004 choi and deal 2008 he and hogue 2012 and distributed kollet and maxwell 2008 mao and cherkauer 2009 wijesekara et al 2012 condon and maxwell 2013 mikkelson et al 2013 penn et al 2016 bearup et al 2016 markovich et al 2016 and can be implemented within domains of different sizes from hill slopes mikkelson et al 2013 penn et al 2016 bearup et al 2016 markovich et al 2016 to whole catchments hundecha and bárdossy 2004 siriwardena et al 2006 mccoll and aggett 2007 choi and deal 2008 kollet and maxwell 2008 mao and cherkauer 2009 delgado et al 2010 he and hogue 2012 tong et al 2012 wijesekara et al 2012 the cited studies report strong links between land cover and hydrologic characteristics of a watershed and water budgets e g total overland flow and evapotranspiration et as well as its dynamic response e g short and long term storage and memory hundecha and bárdossy 2004 observed a reduction in peak runoff and total runoff volume resulting from afforestation tong et al 2012 concluded that the already prominent impacts of land cover change on the quantity and quality of water resources are further amplified under climate change choi and deal 2008 he and hogue 2012 investigated the impacts of urbanization on water resources using a semi distributed hydrologic model with land cover types having aggregated vegetation and soil permeability characteristics and concluded that urbanization caused decreased base flow and groundwater recharge in the watershed wijesekara et al 2012 demonstrated long term impacts of land cover changes on hydrologic processes in a watershed in canada öztürk et al 2013 used the model developed by wijesekara et al 2012 to conclude that the water budget was most sensitive to variations in precipitation and conversion between forest and agricultural lands julian and gardner 2014 reported that the characteristics of runoff patterns also depend on the watershed scale with small watersheds being driven by precipitation whilst bigger watersheds being more dependent on watershed processes such as short and long term storage and memory however these studies did not report on a how watershed hydrology is also dependent on spatial configurations of land cover within the catchments nor b on which processes drive the spatially distributed interactions between land cover and hydrology the latter of the two above research questions has been explored in several other studies performed with detailed mechanistic models providing physical description of surface and subsurface hydrology and vegetation dependent energy fluxes on the land surface using two dimensional 2d hillslope models these studies demonstrated the complexity of how vegetation interacts with soil and atmosphere consequently a compelling case was made for advancing integrated land cover hydrologic modelling frameworks via replacement of conceptual models with mechanistic models that can describe the intricate processes governing the interactions between the surface and the subsurface some of the notable findings of those studies are described below kollet and maxwell 2008 applied a three dimensional 3d variably saturated groundwater flow model parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 coupled with the common land model clm dai et al 2003 to study connections between groundwater dynamics and land surface energy balance components and demonstrated a strong coupling between a number of energy variables and the time varying water table depth wtd the authors found a critical wtd range related to vegetation root depth where a strong coupling exists between groundwater and land surface processes kollet and maxwell 2008 reported that additionally soil heterogeneity had a strong influence on et during dry periods in which et became limited by moisture in the shallow subsurface markovich et al 2016 applied the same model to alpine hillslopes and found that the responses were sensitive to the unsaturated zone retention parameters which in the case of alpine systems could indicate a mix of matrix or fracture flow the inter connectivity between groundwater and land processes was further explored in the context of water management by condon and maxwell 2013 who connected an optimization driven water allocation model to parflow the study demonstrated the added benefits of fully integrated water management tools on a case study where spatial and temporal variability in soil moisture predicted in the hydrologic model drove water allocations for irrigation hydrologic and land use models were also embedded within multi objective optimization frameworks the results showed trade offs between different bundles of land use decisions and water related objectives however the number of such studies to date have been limited and focused on agricultural applications one of the notable studies was done by lautenbach et al 2013 who investigated optimal tradeoffs between biodiesel production food crops production and water quality and quantity on a catchment level using the integrated river basin model swat arnold and fohrer 2005 connected to nsga ii deb et al 2002 multiobjective evolutionary algorithm fowler et al 2015 created a multiobjective optimal decision making framework for selecting crop types in a watershed using the modflow groundwater flow model integrated with supply and demand components of irrigated agriculture in order to maximize revenue minimize water use and maximize demand satisfaction the authors found optimal trade offs between the objectives and calculated the respective areas of each of the three crop types for each trade off the above two studies demonstrated the benefits of multi objective optimization with coupled hydrologic land models these studies described land use allocation with macroscopic quantities such as fractions of area per individual land use type or type of land use per cell what the studies were not able to demonstrate is how these different land uses should be spatially arranged within catchments due to the limitations imposed by the hydrologic landuse models being used the need for sophisticated hydrologic models in land use optimization was suggested by he and hogue 2012 who stated that land use decision making requires hydrologic models that consider spatio temporal watershed characteristics due to their capacity of enabling more accurate prediction of dynamic water balances in a watershed among the most recent developments sheikh et al 2021 attempted a multiobjective land use optimization with a distributed hydrologic model on a catchment scale and reported impact of land use patterns on surface runoff and sediment load several recent papers approached water energy food wef nexus studies with multiobjective optimization methods complemented with different methodological improvements for example guo et al 2022 used a distributed multi objective uncertain optimization model to develop comprehensive strategies for agricultural sustainability whilst handling stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties yue et al 2021 li et al 2022 ren et al 2022 performed wef nexus studies using multiobjective optimization the first two addressed uncertainty through adoption of lr type fuzzy numbers and me measure fuzzy chance constrained programming respectively whilst ren et al 2022 introduced objectives quantifying long term life cycle a notable paper was recently published by yang et al 2023 who used surrogate neural network models to leverage computational burden of storm water management models in multiobjective optimization applications it is likely that in the near future more researchers will adopt such approaches especially in combination with explainable deep learning techniques ras et al 2020 in order to keep computation within feasible time bounds whilst at the same time addressing problem of greater scale to our knowledge no study has assessed the impact of feedbacks between land and the subsurface on the spatial land cover patterns recommended by multi objective landcover optimization we used a land cover design framework that links a distributed mechanistic hydrologic and land surface model with a multi sector water management model and connects the two to a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea for a description of moea and multiobjective design we refer the reader to deb 2001 reed et al 2013 the framework allows finding spatial land cover designs that lead to optimal tradeoffs between multiple competing objectives we show how the spatial optimized land cover selections change as preferences between performance measures are shifted our aims are a to demonstrate how spatial land cover allocation decisions under competing objectives are influenced by bi directional interactions between land surface processes and groundwater dynamics and b to assess which of these processes have the largest influence on land management decisions we show that water table depths affect evapotranspiration differently depending on the vegetation type which has different root depths leading to distinct trade offs between land cover patterns for different objectives related to water energy food and environment 2 methods the flowchart visualizing how the distributed hydrologic model the water resources model and the multiobjective optimization algorithm are connected is shown in fig 1 the hydrologic model produces runoff as a response to atmospheric forcing and as a function of hydrologic parameters and land cover allocation the runoff becomes an input to the water resources model creating a one way interaction between both model components it is also possible to create a two way closed loop interaction by making decisions in the water resources model such as water abstractions that become sink terms in the hydrologic model dashed arrow in fig 1 the selected outputs and state variables from both models are used to formulate design criteria which become objective functions for the multi objective optimization algorithm because objectives are conflicting improvement of one objective causes deterioration of at least one other objective therefore the optimizer searches not for a single optimal land cover allocation solution but for the set of pareto optimal solutions a solution is said to be pareto optimal or nondominated if none of the objectives can be improved without degrading some of the other objectives to ensure that the results are close to the true pareto surface i e a global set of optimal solutions is found the optimization procedure is initialized from multiple starting points seeds those individual sets of nondominated solutions are filtered to produce a portfolio of optimal land cover configurations which can be further explored in different contexts related to the different objectives 2 1 theoretical background on the land surface mass and heat exchange processes driving the watershed hydrology are dependent on land cover and on groundwater levels as conceptually described in fig 2 the schematic is borrowed from kollet and maxwell 2008 who divided the hillslope into three zones characterized by the availability of water for evapotranspiration at the land surface the schematic illustrates from a conceptual point of view why watershed hydrology is dependent on spatial configurations of land covers and consequently why distributed hydrologic and land models may be required in multi criteria land cover and land use design the rates of evapotranspiration et change with groundwater levels differently for different types of vegetation as a result of an interplay between water availability and rooting depth in zone 1 the water table is shallow and et is never water limited in zone 2 access to groundwater by some of the vegetation types such as crops or grass having shorter root depths become water limited whilst biological activity of other vegetation types such as trees remains not water limited in zone 3 groundwater is deep and thus disconnected from the land surface resulting in land processes being less dependent on subsurface hydrology a more thorough explanation of the influence of groundwater dynamics on land surface processes in a distributed coupled hydrologic land model can be found in kollet and maxwell 2008 2 2 computational implementation the multiobjective optimization framework proposed in this paper was implemented by connecting two standalone models into an integrated simulator a a distributed variably saturated groundwater flow simulator parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 coupled with a land surface model clm dai et al 2003 oleson et al 2010 b a free open source python based water resources modelling library pywr tomlinson et al 2020 the code for connecting pywr with parflow is written in python in each simulation run parflow is called as an external process from within python using subprocess run after successful execution of the parflow model runoff time series are extracted from parflow s output files pywr which is written in python is then executed using the extracted runoff data as input the simulation environment for sequential execution of parflow and pywr is wrapped by the wrapper class that facilitates exchange of data between both models and the moea algorithm in each model evaluation moea receives objective function values from both models and sets the configuration of land covers which are then written into parflow s land cover input file using jinja templating engine jinja templating engine 0000 2 2 1 parflow clm parflow clm models variably saturated subsurface flow with overland flow kollet and maxwell 2006 in a fully coupled manner and captures the functional relationships between groundwater dynamics and water and energy fluxes on land surface maxwell and miller 2005 kollet and maxwell 2008 by replacing the soil column root zone soil moisture formulation in clm with the parflow formulation leading to more realistic behaviour that more closely matches observations maxwell and miller 2005 parflow implements richards equation for variably saturated 3d subsurface flow and shallow water equations for surface flow the capabilities of parflow to simulate coupled surface subsurface flow are described in detail in kuffour et al 2020 clm models vegetation processes describing energy and water exchange between surface and atmosphere as plant function types specified by optical morphological and physiological properties clm accounts for the thermodynamic equilibrium of the soil air at the interface with the matrix potential and turbulent transport based on the monin obukhov similarity theory monin and obukhov 1954 the phenological states of vegetation types e g the growth phase and the ripening phase of crops are simulated via the leaf area index lai and steam area index sai based on their maximum and minimum values and an empirical parameterization resulting in time varying evapotranspiration over the growing season the root density distribution in the subsurface is modelled with a sum of exponential functions and is uniquely parameterized for different land cover types a detailed description of the land processes included in the parflow s clm implementation can be found in maxwell and miller 2005 2 2 2 pywr pywr tomlinson et al 2020 is a model library for the simulation of managed water resource systems it uses a linear programming formulation to simulate least cost water allocations at each simulation time step as a function of allocation penalties rules and constraints in this case study pywr is used for calculating water mass balances in a hydroelectric reservoir the extent of flooding in a stretch of the river connecting runoff from the hillslope to the hydroelectric reservoir and the amount of hydropower hp generated in the hydroelectric reservoir 2 3 case study the conceptual multi sector human natural system design problem described in this paper is applied to a simple synthetic system five conflicting socioeconomic dimensions are implemented in the multi objective optimization the water resources dimension is represented with two objectives 1 related to the propensity of the system to flood and 2 related to total annual runoff volume the latter quantity correlates with hydropower production in the hydroelectric reservoir 3 the second energy dimension is solar power potential which is set to be proportional to the area of bare soil in the catchment it is assumed that land surface underneath solar panels in our hypothetical semi arid area see section 2 3 3 will eventually become barren due to lesser availability of sunlight and elevated levels of heat 4 the food production dimension is approximated by the area of the catchment covered with rain fed agriculture 5 a proxy for ecosystem health quantifies the number of distinct land cover types within the catchment excluding bare soil 2 3 1 case study model structure the structure of parflow clm and pywr models implemented in the case study and the connections between the models and the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea are visualized in a block diagram in fig 3 the computational domain of parflow clm is a 2d hillslope which simplifies the analysis and interpretation of results compared to a 3d catchment especially with regards to the relationships between lateral subsurface flow wtd and et by removing one spatial dimension whilst still retaining the required subsurface flow complexity the hillslope is divided into ten cells indexed from 0 to 9 the model interacts with the atmosphere via bi directional exchange of the energy and water mass fluxes at the land surface and is linked with the upstream parts of the catchment via base flow q b the terrain has a slope that is sufficiently large to induce groundwater limited conditions in the upstream sections of the hillslope the pywr water allocation model is represented by a graph of connected nodes with directed edges representing transfers of water between the nodes following set rules and priorities the city node representing a river section with a weir is modelled as a long shallow trapezoidal reservoir with an overflow the amount of overflow is proportional to h 0 5 where h is the height of water above the weir the inclined sides of the reservoir represent the river banks the reservoir node models a hydroelectric reservoir which stores and directs the water to a hydropower turbine node the turbine node calculates the generated hydroelectric energy as a function of water volume and the difference between turbine elevation and water level in the reservoir node the flow of water q h p is allocated to the turbine node in every time step following a release control curve that defines the relationship between q h p and the volume of water in the reservoir v in case the volume of water exceeds the reservoir s capacity and the calculated release exceeds the maximum allowed throughput of the turbine the excess water q s is directed to the estuary via the spill node the rain and the evaporation nodes model the additional sources and sinks of water due to precipitation q r and evaporation q e from the water surface respectively rain and evaporation nodes do not feature in the city node due to its small surface area and thus negligible effects of surface dependent rain and evaporation processes on the overall water mass balance the rain source q r and evaporation sink q e are derived from the meteorological input time series that drive the hydrologic response of parflow clm q r is calculated directly from rainfall whilst q e is computed using the penman monteith equation penman and keen 1948 allen 2005 the input q i n to pywr is equal to the daily average of the hourly runoff time series output from parflow clm after every simulation model evaluation of the coupled parflow clm pywr model values of all five objective functions f i x see next section are calculated and passed to the moea as a vector f x in each iteration moea adjusts the 10 1 input vector x of land cover types and passes the updated sequence x n e w to parflow clm 2 3 2 optimization implementation out of five objectives three are calculated in parflow clm number of cells with crops f 3 number of cells with bare soil f 4 and land cover diversity f 5 the remaining two objectives i e annual hydropower production f 1 and flood extent f 2 are calculated in pywr in the turbine and in the city node respectively the multiobjective optimization problem mop is formulated as follows 1 max x f x f 1 x f 2 x f 3 x f 4 x f 5 x x ω where ω denotes the solution space i e all possible land cover configurations in the hillslope f i x denotes the i th objective function and f x denotes the set of all objective functions for solution x x is represented as a 10 1 vector in which each element x j for j 0 9 defines the type of land cover allocated to the j th cell the land cover type is encoded as an integer value i e x 0 for mixed forests x 1 for grasslands x 2 for croplands and x 3 for bare soil the mixed forest type in clm is parameterized to represent a mixture of coniferous deciduous and evergreen broad leaved species grasslands and croplands represent vegetation types with short root depths rds the five objective functions are defined as follows 2 f 1 x 2 4 1 0 7 k 1 365 η t ρ g q h p k x h k z t where q h p k and h k are respectively flow rate through hydropower turbine and water level in the hydroelectric reservoir in k th daily timestep z t is the turbine elevation η t is the turbine s total efficiency ρ is the water s density and g is the gravitational constant 2 4 1 0 7 is the conversion coefficient required to obtain hydropower production in mwh assuming that all variables in the hydropower equation on the right side of the summation symbol are given in si units the flow released from the reservoir to the turbine q h p k f h p v h p k is calculated for each timestep in pywr using a piecewise linear release curve f h p relating the released flow to the volume of water in the reservoir 3 f 2 x max k 1 a f l o o d k x k 1 365 the flooded area in k th timestep a f l o o d k is multiplied by 1 to minimize the extent of flooding since the problem is posed as a maximization problem a f l o o d is calculated in the city node using a bathymetric curve a f l o o d k f f l o o d v c i t y k where f f l o o d is a function derived from geometric dimensions of the reservoir and v c i t y k denotes the volume of water stored in the city node in k th timestep using iverson bracket notation 4 f 3 x x x x 2 calculates the number of cells in solution x allocated to rain fed croplands which are coded in the algorithm with integer number 2 similarly 5 f 4 x x x x 3 describes the number of cells in solution x allocated to bare soil 6 f 5 x card x x x 3 where card denotes cardinality of a set models land cover diversity as a number of unique land cover types in the solution x excluding bare soil for this search based design application we used a dominance based many objective evolutionary optimization algorithm called nsga iii deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 2 3 3 model inputs and parameters five important meteorological variables out of 8 variables in total that form the input to parflow clm pywr are plotted in fig 4 due to high computational complexity of our study imposed by parflow clm and moea the input timeseries were limited to a single year at an hourly time step the meteorological inputs are representative of a subtropical semi arid zone this setting is chosen to allow testing the sensitivity of land and subsurface interactions in an environment exhibiting high variability in atmospheric conditions such as inter and intra day temperatures and solar irradiation as well as sporadic precipitation patterns with periods of droughts catchments in semi arid zones are characterized by high temporal variability of various hydrologic variables that drive the processes on the land surface such as soil moisture content and water table depth wtd consequently the vegetation driven energy fluxes at the surface may vary significantly in response to changes in evapotranspiration throughfall and infiltration thus having an impact on subsurface hydrology based on this setting we are able to test the model s behaviour under a range of conditions with et intermittently limited by shallow soil moisture deficits and with seasonal water shortages affecting water table levels we shall see that as table level depths affect et differently depending on the vegetation type as illustrated conceptually in fig 2 interesting tradeoffs emerge between land cover patterns for different objectives the plotted variables from top to bottom are precipitation p temperature t specific humidity s h short wave radiation r s and long wave radiation r l the catchment is characterized with high shortwave radiation with an average annual value of approximately 300 w m 2 and slight and moderate rainfall throughout the year with longer dry periods in the winter months the temperature in degrees celsius ranges from high and mid 30 s in summer months to small negative values in winter months with an annual average of approximately 18 c humidity when converted from specific to relative ranges between 30 and 85 depending on the period of the year the hillslope also receives base flow q b 120 m 3 d equivalent to flux v b 0 0288 m h uniformly distributed along the bottom boundary of the hillslope base flow represents groundwater contribution from hypothetical upstream sections of a larger catchment within which our study is situated the parameters of parflow clm and pywr models are listed in table 1 the hydraulic conductivity is representative of typical medium to coarse sands whose hydraulic coefficients range between 3 10 4 m h and 1 8 m h for medium sands and 22 m h for coarse sands the porosity is in the upper end of values for sandy soil types whose porosities typically lie between 0 25 and 0 50 soil heterogeneity was not modelled in order to allow easier interpretation of final results the manning s coefficient n h 0 20 s m 1 3 set for the hillslope is representative of forests and shrublands whilst n r 0 03 s m 1 3 set for the river section is characteristic of coarse sand river bed arcement and schneider 1989 the parameters of the clm model listed in table 1 were assigned default values set in parflow clm maxwell and miller 2005 vegetation classes implemented in parflow clm follow igbp land cover type classification igbp 0000 and additionally include an additional land cover type representing bare soil the parameters of all vegetation classes are provided as supporting data in file drv vegp dat the relationship between the volume and the water level as well as the water surface area for the hydroelectric reservoir are

4102 m 2 2 3 4 computation the optimization algorithm nsga iii deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 was implemented in a framework for evolutionary computing in python called platypus hadka 2015 parallelization support in platypus allowed us to perform the study on multiple computer nodes using message parsing interface mpi with python s native mpi4py mpi4py 0000 all simulation and optimization runs were conducted on a high performance computing hpc cluster hosted at the university of manchester the study was run on 144 cores using high performance nodes of 2 12 core intel xeon e5 2690 v3 2 60 ghz 128 gb ram parallelization was implemented by dividing the population of candidate solutions inside the genetic algorithm ga into isolated islands of sub populations evaluation of each population member required a simulation of one instance of the integrated parflow clm pywr model each simulation was run for the duration of 3 physical years repeating the one year long meteorological input first two years of the simulation were used to attain an approximation of a dynamic equilibrium the results obtained in the third year of the simulation were used to calculate the objectives each simulation run was started with the same set of initial conditions optimization was started from 5 randomly generated initial populations seeds of size 132 with 140 000 function evaluations per seed the running time of each optimization per seed was approx 7 days at the end of all five optimization runs non dominated sorting was performed on the nondominated solutions collected from all five seeds the final result is a pareto optimal surface composed of 145 nondominated solutions a 2 year spinup was sufficient to attain 1 convergence in land surface variables i e latent sensible and ground heat fluxes upward long wave radiation ground surface temperature and bottom layer temperature convergence criterion is set as annual relative difference between output variables states in consecutive years these results are in agreement with the studies of ajami et al 2014 seck et al 2015 which were based on parflow clm and reported that 2 9 6 and 5 years of spin up were sufficient to achieve 1 convergence between start and end day of a year long simulation in groundwater gw storage unsaturated storage and water storage within clm model and root zone respectively restricting the simulation to 1 physical year following a 2 year spinup was required due to a significant execution times of parflow clm and b np hard complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem at hand serafini 1987 3 results and discussion the results are presented and discussed in three subsections 1 we provide plots illustrating tradeoffs between the multiple objectives of our hypothetical land cover design problem these plots convey information about the impact of land cover selection on different multi sector services 2 we illustrate the spatial land cover patterns generated by the optimization results which show how catchments with the same aggregate land cover composition but with different spatial distributions exhibit different hydrologic behaviour 3 we discuss which hydrologic and land processes have the largest impact on land cover selection and present the argument for wider application of distributed hydrologic land models in land use planning studies with water dependent benefit functions 3 1 trade offs between multiple competing objectives the tradeoffs between 145 identified nondominated solutions are visualized in a parallel axis plot in fig 5 the objectives are plotted on the first five axes the last two axes visualize the auxiliary variables representing the number of cells with land cover types not used in the calculation of any of the objective functions the direction of preference for each objective is indicated with a black arrowhead positioned at the top of each axis fig 5 demonstrates that tradeoffs exist between all five objectives and different objectives are favoured by different land cover types for example generation of larger amounts of hydroelectric energy which is proportional to total runoff volume comes at the cost of lower food production lower land cover diversity and lesser solar power generation potential land cover designs with high hydropower production are also prone to more flooding since land cover configurations that lead to large annual runoff volumes tend to also produce higher peak flows the highest annual hydropower is produced when most of the land is allocated to grasslands due to grasslands having the lowest et out of all four land cover types used in this study a negative correlation exists between runoff and total bare soil area because conversely to grasslands this land use type has the highest et out of the four land use types considered note in the applied parameterization of bare soil evaporation resistance to vapour transport in the soil is neglected which results in high evaporation rates at the thermodynamic equilibrium of free water in contact with the atmosphere solutions with significant area allocated to crops thus benefiting food production are characterized by moderate hydropower generation moderate to high flooding and small to moderate solar power sp potential improving land cover diversity by definition requires a mix of all types of vegetation which have different properties and favour different objectives hence solutions with high land cover diversity generate balanced quantities of solar power hydropower and crops to gain a better insight into the topology of the pareto optimal surface the solutions were also plotted in a cartesian coordinate system using three different projections in fig 6 the 2d projections in subplot b and subplot c illustrate respectively the shape of the relationship between hydropower production and the extent of flooding and the relationship between the amount of bare soil and hydropower the relationship between hydropower and the extent of flooding is monotonic and concave down with a plateau in the curve suggesting that above a certain threshold further increase in runoff does not produce higher peak flows this suggests a presence of a cluster composed of combinations of land cover types which produce high overall runoffs but proportionally lower peak flows this cluster is marked in the subplots as cluster 1 cluster 1 is composed of nondominated solutions representing the hillslope covered predominantly with grasslands with a small fraction of bare soil land cover diversity of one indicates absence of any other land cover types i e forests or croplands on the opposite side of the pareto front lies cluster 3 composed of nondominated solutions generating the least runoff and producing the least flooding these solutions represent designs with large area of bare soil with addition of croplands and forests and favour solar power generation at the cost of lower land cover diversity and hydropower and crop production cluster 2 represents intermediate land cover design scenarios which benefit all five objectives to similar degrees solutions in cluster 2 thus have moderate land cover diversities and moderate hydropower solar power and food production potentials as a consequence of featuring a mix of several land cover types each satisfying different objectives interaction between land and groundwater depth is dependent on the vegetation soil evaporation ratio resulting from an interplay of a number of vegetation dependent parameters such as leaf area index lai and root depth rd since evaporation from soil and evapotranspiration through vegetation are driven by different processes land uses with different vegetation soil evaporation ratios exhibit different dynamic responses to changes in atmospheric conditions such as rainfall temperature radiation or humidity dynamic response of a land use to rainfall will affect how much water is absorbed and evaporated vs how much recharges the groundwater system and contributes to river flow the concave up shape of the curve in fig 6 can be explained by these differences as grasslands have lower et than croplands the amount of water retained in the subsurface in grassland dominated catchments is higher leading to larger overall runoff however since grasslands compared to crops evaporate proportionally more from soil than via transpiration their response to high intensity short rainfalls is different the subsurface under grasslands dominated land is characterized with lower gw levels and lower shallow soil moisture consequently in case of rainfall less water recharges the groundwater thus producing moderate increase in river flow ultimately the response of grasslands is less flashy than that of croplands the above results qualitatively agree on a macroscopic scale with the results of the earlier studies based on more aggregated models in particular the results corroborate the findings of isik et al 2013 niu and sivakumar 2014 who reported that hydrology of forest dominated areas was less flashy and with lower average flows whilst average and peak flow increased for pasture dominated areas the results also agree with the findings of mao and cherkauer 2009 who reported the lowest spring total runoff in forest dominated areas due to higher annual et whilst grasslands and croplands had higher spring total runoffs because of their lower et losses the outputs presented above result from aggregating spatially distributed results which can be explored further and unveil more information about the relationships between spatial arrangements of land cover and the catchment s behaviour 3 2 spatial distribution of land covers on the hillslope the three clusters marked in fig 6 can also be found through visual inspection of the heatmaps in fig 7 and fig 8 these figures describe how land uses are distributed along the length of the hillslope all five heatmaps can be inspected along the x axis to observe how optimized land cover patterns change with each objective as well as along the y axis to see land cover distribution along the hillslope to aid the latter the plots are divided into two regions in the y direction with the border between the two regions marked with two red pins on opposite sides of each heatmap the upper region corresponds to zone 3 in fig 2 in which groundwater level begins to fall below the maximum root zone depth creating water limited conditions suppressing et for all vegetation types the results in each heatmap are processed along both directions since this case study is based on a synthetic 2d hillslope the results cannot be directly transferred onto a full scale catchment however they reflect the behaviour of the coupled land hydrologic system including its plant functional types in parflow clm which were validated in previous studies this study investigates what processes are responsible for the identified patterns in the solutions and the results can be used to provide an indication of potential behaviour of more complex computational domains representative of real world catchments the heat maps constitute a complementary source of information to parallel axis and pareto surface plots introduced in the previous section as the nondominated solutions are individually sorted by the values of every objective function they show how optimized spatial land cover allocations change as one objective is progressively favoured over the others the heatmaps allow investigating each solution in a spatial dimension to answer questions such as whether a specific parts of the catchment favour certain land cover types b certain land cover types should be positioned next to each other c multiple solutions exist with the same aggregate land cover areas but different spatial allocations and d a change in land cover in one isolated place within the catchment can significantly alter its behaviour in fig 7 there are a number of solutions which have the same composition of land covers but produce different runoffs and or peak flows depending on where the different land covers are placed within the hillslope figs 7 and 8 indicate that the preferred location for grasslands and croplands is in zone 3 placing these two land cover types having the lowest et out of all four land cover types considered in this study in the part of the hillslope where et is additionally water limited minimizes total et maximizes recharge base flow and discharge and thus maximizes hydropower production introduction of croplands additionally improves the agricultural production objective for the selected objectives and land cover types most efficient land cover designs include a mix of croplands grasslands and bare soil bare soil tends to appear first in the lower sections of the hillslope in conjunction with grasslands and crops as respectively hydropower and food production objectives are gradually traded off for solar power and for mitigating the risk of flooding looking at fig 9 which shows the variability of mean annual wtds per land cover type and cell groundwater level under bare soil is the lowest out of all four land cover types considered as bare soil has the highest et consequently placing bare soil just upstream of grasslands and croplands creates a drop in the water level further down in the hillslope creating water limited conditions for these two land cover types ultimately producing overall lowest total et lower than if bare soil was placed at the very top of the hillslope the information about the gw levels and its variability for different land cover arrangements becomes especially useful when groundwater levels are an important factor in land use optimization e g when one or more objectives are related to water abstraction from the subsurface since many solutions feature the same number of cells with bare soil see upper subplot in fig 8 repeated solutions are sorted in the direction of decreasing runoff as et of bare soil is high due to the applied parameterization and therefore water level underneath the hillslope with predominantly bare soil cover is low mixing croplands and grasslands into catchments dominated by bare soil increases total runoff only negligibly for this reason the optimizer chooses instead to co locate bare soil with forests which can evaporate large amounts of water due to their extensive root system the preferred strategy is to improve flood mitigation objective whilst increasing land cover diversity as the bare soil area gradually decreases solutions begin to feature croplands which further improve land cover diversity and additionally benefit the food production objective finally a pattern emerges where initially bare soil is co located with grasslands to benefit runoff and later with croplands which although generate less runoff than grasslands benefit agricultural food production objective this pattern repeats in steps as the number of cells with bare soil is reduced one by one while solutions with equal areas of bare soil are sorted in the direction of decreasing hydropower production croplands evaporate significantly less water than forests and bare soil albeit more than grasslands therefore land cover designs dominated by croplands tend to produce intermediate hydropower earlier results demonstrated that croplands produce higher peak flows with respect to total runoff than grasslands i e lead to flashier runoff responses what follows croplands are co located with bare soil in order to reduce peak flows and thus the extent of flooding if we investigate land cover allocations in the direction of decreasing agricultural production croplands initially cover an entire hillslope gradually they are replaced with bare soil thus benefiting solar power and reducing the risk of flooding at the cost of food production as previously bare soil is preferably placed in the lower parts of the hillslope where ground water levels are at their highest while grasslands tend to be positioned in the upper parts of the hillslope scenarios with lower fractions of croplands in the hillslope feature forests to increase land cover diversity it is intuitive that the scenarios with the highest land cover diversity scores feature a mixture of all land cover types interestingly those scenarios are also abundant in forests inclusion of forests not only ensures reaching the maximum diversity score of 3 but also improves the flood control objective due to forests high et potential hence land cover diversity and flood control objectives are in this case positively correlated the preference of a given land cover type over others with relation to the proximity to groundwater can be partly explained by looking at fig 10 that describes the relationship between et and its soil and vegetation evaporation components vs water table depth wtd while on average et for the considered land use types follows the order bare soil mixed forests croplands grasslands the relative differences between them are not constant alongside the hillslope the benefit of choosing a certain land use type over another for a given objective may therefore be different in magnitude or even in sign depending on where in the catchment the decision is made for example in the parts of the hillslope where groundwater levels are high et of bare soil exceeds that of a forest as shallow soil moisture dependent evaporation from land dominates over transpiration through stomatal apertures of leaves however once evaporation from land becomes limited by shallow soil moisture et from bare soil decreases sharply whilst et of forests remain high as trees are still able to access ground water at lower levels via their root system consequently if reduction of runoff is desired the results suggest that bare soil should be placed in the lower parts of the catchment because this will lead to the highest increase of et overall as well as relative to other land use types in particular forests other mechanisms impacting spatial land cover allocations in a catchment include the effects of upstream decisions on the hydrologic conditions downstream via lateral flow as discussed earlier in this section 3 3 effects of land cover distribution within solutions having the same land cover composition the effects of varying the location of different land cover types on the hillslope on its hydrologic performance are shown in the left subfigure of fig 11 the figure describes the relationship between two objectives the annual hp production and the maximum annual flooded area for solutions with equal land cover composition but different land cover arrangements the remaining three objectives are invariant to land cover arrangements as they depend on the total number of land covers and not on their positions the figure shows up to 16 difference in annual hp production among solutions having the same land cover composition see solutions with a mix of bare soil and grasslands maximum annual flooded area which is proportional to peak flow is less dependent on land cover arrangements in this example albeit we can still observe differences up to 8 these variations are mainly driven by the placement of first and foremost bare soil and to a lesser degree forests i e the vegetation types associated with largest et the right subfigure of fig 11 shows the histograms and kernel density estimates kdes of the mean distance between each land cover and the river and corroborates that bare soil and forests are the two land cover types most spread along the hillslope as indicated by their wide distributions both are also left skewed thus indicating the preference for allocating them in the lower part of the hillslope on the other hand grasslands and croplands have right skewed distributions indicating that their preferred placement is further up in the hillslope bare soil is the mostly featured land cover type in the set of nondominated solution indicating that bare soil has the most utility in our problem formulation for optimally balancing the chosen objectives given land cover indices j 1 4 the mean distance d l j between each land cover type l j in k th nondominated solution x k and the river has been calculated as the sum of indices i of cells with land cover l j divided by the total number of cells with land cover l j allocated in the hillslope card is a set cardinality operator 7 d l j i 0 i 9 i x i k l j card x i k x k x i k l j in summary the results show that in order to optimally balance the applied objectives the location and combination of the different land covers types in the hillslope is important as already reported in warburton et al 2012 costa et al 2003 and may be difficult to predict using expert knowledge due to nonlinear feedbacks of subsurface hydrology with the land processes and the lateral groundwater flow that are hard to envisage without detailed models in the simulations these results depend on the parameterization of evapotranspiration in the applied model and the representation of hydrology and hydrogeology of the hillslope or watershed 3 4 limitations and future research directions the main limitation of this study is related to a the speed of execution of parflow clm and b the computational complexity and multi dimensionality of multiobjective combinatorial land use optimization this study showed that even for a rather simple catchment geometry restricted pool of available land cover types and short time horizons the number of unction evaluations required by moea for convergence was large enough that the optimization study had to be run for 7 days on multi processor architectures the first limitation could be mitigated by improving the manner in which coupled hydrologic land and water resources models and moeas are spawned across multiple central processing units cpus and graphics processing units gpus and exchange data with each other in this study the exchange of data between parflow and pywr happened via binary files which might have slowed down the simulation execution times by i o bound file reading and writing processes another potential solution could involve researching numerical schemes for solving hydrologic and energy exchange flux equations that are stable for longer time steps than currently employed hourly step thus reducing the number of computational time steps required to run hydrologic simulations the second barrier could be tackled at a the algorithmic level via development of custom algorithms specific to combinatorial land use optimization problems as well as b the choice and fine tuning best suited existing algorithms application specific moeas might include e g custom crossover and mutation operators mohammadi et al 2015 or additional geometric operators garcía et al 2017 that generate solutions with appropriate compactness compatibility and contiguousness properties that satisfy feasibility requirements specific to land use planning directly within the algorithm on the other hand application of constraints within existing gas could be implemented e g via application of penalty functions to degrade the fitness value of infeasible solutions or via incorporation of repair mechanisms for infeasible individuals cao et al 2012 a promising avenue towards increased scalability of the proposed framework is in learning surrogate e g deep learning models which can emulate the behaviour of models such as parflow clm at significantly higher speeds the recent advancements in deep learning proved their applicability of solving high dimensional partial differential equations such fluid dynamic equations see e g morrison and kutz 2022 and assisting with order reduction of highly dimensional dynamic models baddoo et al 2021 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the benefits of using a mechanistic distributed land and hydrologic model combined with a water resources model for land use planning in multisector systems the wef land cover design framework attempts to consider the feedbacks between land and subsurface and the link between hydrology and water management although the study was designed as a proof of concept and carried out on a simplified hillslope model with homogeneous subsurface conditions it retained the required subsurface flow complexity including lateral flow we hypothesize that the main findings related to impacts of land cover arrangements on pareto optimal solutions will also apply in a qualitative sense to more complex watersheds and we make suggestions for overcoming the computational challenges this would imply potential extensions to this framework could include 1 land cover planning with other water related objectives such as e g erosion sediment transport 2 studies with bi directional interactions between hydrologic and water resources e g including diversions and ground water pumping 3 studies with larger numbers of decision variables e g for joint optimization of land cover and water management practices such as hydroelectric reservoir operation 4 analysis of impact of subsurface heterogeneity 5 supplementary material the optimization results can be explored in an interactive manner and downloaded in csv

1953,we investigate how hydrologic land feedbacks and a hydrologic water management linkage impact land cover arrangements optimized within a multiobjective land cover design framework the framework integrates a spatially distributed and physically based hydrologic model for simulating surface and subsurface flow and land processes with a network based multi sector water resources management and allocation model both models used parflow pywr are open source the framework is applied to a hillslope problem to identify land cover patterns that optimize trade offs between water food energy and environment objectives results show trade offs depend on land cover composition and the spatial arrangement of land covers within the catchment total runoff volume and peak flow of runoff was found to change 3 and 2 fold respectively between optimized solutions as land cover composition and spatial patterns were altered to satisfy different combinations of objectives at the same time up to a 15 reduction in the total runoff volume and an 8 reduction in the peak flow of runoff were observed within optimized land cover patterns having equal composition but different spatial arrangements this emphasizes the impact on hydrologic behavior of the spatial location of land covers within a catchment the emergence of patterns in land cover distribution for different trade offs between objectives is driven by feedback mechanisms between subsurface hydrology and land processes which are implicitly linked to the properties of each land cover and the interactions between neighboring land covers through lateral groundwater flow the study demonstrates the added benefits of coupling distributed hydrologic models with water management simulation for multisector multicriteria land cover planning graphical abstract keywords land cover design distributed hydrology multiobjective optimization multisector dynamics parallel computing data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction vegetation influences the energy and moisture fluxes between land atmosphere and subsurface via 1 net radiation 2 evaporation and transpiration 3 interception of rainfall and 4 redistribution of moisture via root water uptake maxwell and miller 2005 kuffour et al 2020 as a result catchments with the same geomorphology but with varying land cover are likely to exhibit different local climatic properties such as diurnal temperature ranges as well hydrologic conditions on top of and below the surface siriwardena et al 2006 mao and cherkauer 2009 ultimately land cover and its spatial arrangement affects water resource availability in river basins thus impacting different sectors such as food and energy production as well as other environmental services d odorico et al 2018 informing land cover decisions is therefore a multiobjective problem because different sectors use the same resources and thus may be in conflict the task is additionally complicated by the complex nature of the interactions between land atmosphere and the subsurface dai et al 2003 assisting land cover decision making with computational models may therefore provide unreliable guidance if these models are unable to describe those interactions with sufficient level of fidelity on the other hand detailed and thus computationally expensive mechanistic models are likely to generate high computational overheads which might render them inapplicable in decision making frameworks however recent advancements in the accessibility and the affordability of high performance computing hpc combined with parallelization of numerical solvers e g richards et al 2005 kollet and maxwell 2006 shen and phanikumar 2010 enable gradual introduction of rigorous physically based simulation models into quantitative decision making frameworks another barrier to overcome when it comes to mechanistic hydrologic models is the increased number of parameters and measurements required for their identification in comparison to simpler e g behavioural models under a shortage of a sufficient amount and quality of calibration data we may end up with models with potentially large prediction uncertainty even though they are more physically sound this topic although not the subject of this discourse has been addressed in great detail in beven 2007 2019 hydrologic models range from lumped siriwardena et al 2006 delgado et al 2010 tong et al 2012 to semi distributed mccoll and aggett 2007 hundecha and bárdossy 2004 choi and deal 2008 he and hogue 2012 and distributed kollet and maxwell 2008 mao and cherkauer 2009 wijesekara et al 2012 condon and maxwell 2013 mikkelson et al 2013 penn et al 2016 bearup et al 2016 markovich et al 2016 and can be implemented within domains of different sizes from hill slopes mikkelson et al 2013 penn et al 2016 bearup et al 2016 markovich et al 2016 to whole catchments hundecha and bárdossy 2004 siriwardena et al 2006 mccoll and aggett 2007 choi and deal 2008 kollet and maxwell 2008 mao and cherkauer 2009 delgado et al 2010 he and hogue 2012 tong et al 2012 wijesekara et al 2012 the cited studies report strong links between land cover and hydrologic characteristics of a watershed and water budgets e g total overland flow and evapotranspiration et as well as its dynamic response e g short and long term storage and memory hundecha and bárdossy 2004 observed a reduction in peak runoff and total runoff volume resulting from afforestation tong et al 2012 concluded that the already prominent impacts of land cover change on the quantity and quality of water resources are further amplified under climate change choi and deal 2008 he and hogue 2012 investigated the impacts of urbanization on water resources using a semi distributed hydrologic model with land cover types having aggregated vegetation and soil permeability characteristics and concluded that urbanization caused decreased base flow and groundwater recharge in the watershed wijesekara et al 2012 demonstrated long term impacts of land cover changes on hydrologic processes in a watershed in canada öztürk et al 2013 used the model developed by wijesekara et al 2012 to conclude that the water budget was most sensitive to variations in precipitation and conversion between forest and agricultural lands julian and gardner 2014 reported that the characteristics of runoff patterns also depend on the watershed scale with small watersheds being driven by precipitation whilst bigger watersheds being more dependent on watershed processes such as short and long term storage and memory however these studies did not report on a how watershed hydrology is also dependent on spatial configurations of land cover within the catchments nor b on which processes drive the spatially distributed interactions between land cover and hydrology the latter of the two above research questions has been explored in several other studies performed with detailed mechanistic models providing physical description of surface and subsurface hydrology and vegetation dependent energy fluxes on the land surface using two dimensional 2d hillslope models these studies demonstrated the complexity of how vegetation interacts with soil and atmosphere consequently a compelling case was made for advancing integrated land cover hydrologic modelling frameworks via replacement of conceptual models with mechanistic models that can describe the intricate processes governing the interactions between the surface and the subsurface some of the notable findings of those studies are described below kollet and maxwell 2008 applied a three dimensional 3d variably saturated groundwater flow model parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 coupled with the common land model clm dai et al 2003 to study connections between groundwater dynamics and land surface energy balance components and demonstrated a strong coupling between a number of energy variables and the time varying water table depth wtd the authors found a critical wtd range related to vegetation root depth where a strong coupling exists between groundwater and land surface processes kollet and maxwell 2008 reported that additionally soil heterogeneity had a strong influence on et during dry periods in which et became limited by moisture in the shallow subsurface markovich et al 2016 applied the same model to alpine hillslopes and found that the responses were sensitive to the unsaturated zone retention parameters which in the case of alpine systems could indicate a mix of matrix or fracture flow the inter connectivity between groundwater and land processes was further explored in the context of water management by condon and maxwell 2013 who connected an optimization driven water allocation model to parflow the study demonstrated the added benefits of fully integrated water management tools on a case study where spatial and temporal variability in soil moisture predicted in the hydrologic model drove water allocations for irrigation hydrologic and land use models were also embedded within multi objective optimization frameworks the results showed trade offs between different bundles of land use decisions and water related objectives however the number of such studies to date have been limited and focused on agricultural applications one of the notable studies was done by lautenbach et al 2013 who investigated optimal tradeoffs between biodiesel production food crops production and water quality and quantity on a catchment level using the integrated river basin model swat arnold and fohrer 2005 connected to nsga ii deb et al 2002 multiobjective evolutionary algorithm fowler et al 2015 created a multiobjective optimal decision making framework for selecting crop types in a watershed using the modflow groundwater flow model integrated with supply and demand components of irrigated agriculture in order to maximize revenue minimize water use and maximize demand satisfaction the authors found optimal trade offs between the objectives and calculated the respective areas of each of the three crop types for each trade off the above two studies demonstrated the benefits of multi objective optimization with coupled hydrologic land models these studies described land use allocation with macroscopic quantities such as fractions of area per individual land use type or type of land use per cell what the studies were not able to demonstrate is how these different land uses should be spatially arranged within catchments due to the limitations imposed by the hydrologic landuse models being used the need for sophisticated hydrologic models in land use optimization was suggested by he and hogue 2012 who stated that land use decision making requires hydrologic models that consider spatio temporal watershed characteristics due to their capacity of enabling more accurate prediction of dynamic water balances in a watershed among the most recent developments sheikh et al 2021 attempted a multiobjective land use optimization with a distributed hydrologic model on a catchment scale and reported impact of land use patterns on surface runoff and sediment load several recent papers approached water energy food wef nexus studies with multiobjective optimization methods complemented with different methodological improvements for example guo et al 2022 used a distributed multi objective uncertain optimization model to develop comprehensive strategies for agricultural sustainability whilst handling stochastic and fuzzy uncertainties yue et al 2021 li et al 2022 ren et al 2022 performed wef nexus studies using multiobjective optimization the first two addressed uncertainty through adoption of lr type fuzzy numbers and me measure fuzzy chance constrained programming respectively whilst ren et al 2022 introduced objectives quantifying long term life cycle a notable paper was recently published by yang et al 2023 who used surrogate neural network models to leverage computational burden of storm water management models in multiobjective optimization applications it is likely that in the near future more researchers will adopt such approaches especially in combination with explainable deep learning techniques ras et al 2020 in order to keep computation within feasible time bounds whilst at the same time addressing problem of greater scale to our knowledge no study has assessed the impact of feedbacks between land and the subsurface on the spatial land cover patterns recommended by multi objective landcover optimization we used a land cover design framework that links a distributed mechanistic hydrologic and land surface model with a multi sector water management model and connects the two to a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea for a description of moea and multiobjective design we refer the reader to deb 2001 reed et al 2013 the framework allows finding spatial land cover designs that lead to optimal tradeoffs between multiple competing objectives we show how the spatial optimized land cover selections change as preferences between performance measures are shifted our aims are a to demonstrate how spatial land cover allocation decisions under competing objectives are influenced by bi directional interactions between land surface processes and groundwater dynamics and b to assess which of these processes have the largest influence on land management decisions we show that water table depths affect evapotranspiration differently depending on the vegetation type which has different root depths leading to distinct trade offs between land cover patterns for different objectives related to water energy food and environment 2 methods the flowchart visualizing how the distributed hydrologic model the water resources model and the multiobjective optimization algorithm are connected is shown in fig 1 the hydrologic model produces runoff as a response to atmospheric forcing and as a function of hydrologic parameters and land cover allocation the runoff becomes an input to the water resources model creating a one way interaction between both model components it is also possible to create a two way closed loop interaction by making decisions in the water resources model such as water abstractions that become sink terms in the hydrologic model dashed arrow in fig 1 the selected outputs and state variables from both models are used to formulate design criteria which become objective functions for the multi objective optimization algorithm because objectives are conflicting improvement of one objective causes deterioration of at least one other objective therefore the optimizer searches not for a single optimal land cover allocation solution but for the set of pareto optimal solutions a solution is said to be pareto optimal or nondominated if none of the objectives can be improved without degrading some of the other objectives to ensure that the results are close to the true pareto surface i e a global set of optimal solutions is found the optimization procedure is initialized from multiple starting points seeds those individual sets of nondominated solutions are filtered to produce a portfolio of optimal land cover configurations which can be further explored in different contexts related to the different objectives 2 1 theoretical background on the land surface mass and heat exchange processes driving the watershed hydrology are dependent on land cover and on groundwater levels as conceptually described in fig 2 the schematic is borrowed from kollet and maxwell 2008 who divided the hillslope into three zones characterized by the availability of water for evapotranspiration at the land surface the schematic illustrates from a conceptual point of view why watershed hydrology is dependent on spatial configurations of land covers and consequently why distributed hydrologic and land models may be required in multi criteria land cover and land use design the rates of evapotranspiration et change with groundwater levels differently for different types of vegetation as a result of an interplay between water availability and rooting depth in zone 1 the water table is shallow and et is never water limited in zone 2 access to groundwater by some of the vegetation types such as crops or grass having shorter root depths become water limited whilst biological activity of other vegetation types such as trees remains not water limited in zone 3 groundwater is deep and thus disconnected from the land surface resulting in land processes being less dependent on subsurface hydrology a more thorough explanation of the influence of groundwater dynamics on land surface processes in a distributed coupled hydrologic land model can be found in kollet and maxwell 2008 2 2 computational implementation the multiobjective optimization framework proposed in this paper was implemented by connecting two standalone models into an integrated simulator a a distributed variably saturated groundwater flow simulator parflow ashby and falgout 1996 jones and woodward 2001 coupled with a land surface model clm dai et al 2003 oleson et al 2010 b a free open source python based water resources modelling library pywr tomlinson et al 2020 the code for connecting pywr with parflow is written in python in each simulation run parflow is called as an external process from within python using subprocess run after successful execution of the parflow model runoff time series are extracted from parflow s output files pywr which is written in python is then executed using the extracted runoff data as input the simulation environment for sequential execution of parflow and pywr is wrapped by the wrapper class that facilitates exchange of data between both models and the moea algorithm in each model evaluation moea receives objective function values from both models and sets the configuration of land covers which are then written into parflow s land cover input file using jinja templating engine jinja templating engine 0000 2 2 1 parflow clm parflow clm models variably saturated subsurface flow with overland flow kollet and maxwell 2006 in a fully coupled manner and captures the functional relationships between groundwater dynamics and water and energy fluxes on land surface maxwell and miller 2005 kollet and maxwell 2008 by replacing the soil column root zone soil moisture formulation in clm with the parflow formulation leading to more realistic behaviour that more closely matches observations maxwell and miller 2005 parflow implements richards equation for variably saturated 3d subsurface flow and shallow water equations for surface flow the capabilities of parflow to simulate coupled surface subsurface flow are described in detail in kuffour et al 2020 clm models vegetation processes describing energy and water exchange between surface and atmosphere as plant function types specified by optical morphological and physiological properties clm accounts for the thermodynamic equilibrium of the soil air at the interface with the matrix potential and turbulent transport based on the monin obukhov similarity theory monin and obukhov 1954 the phenological states of vegetation types e g the growth phase and the ripening phase of crops are simulated via the leaf area index lai and steam area index sai based on their maximum and minimum values and an empirical parameterization resulting in time varying evapotranspiration over the growing season the root density distribution in the subsurface is modelled with a sum of exponential functions and is uniquely parameterized for different land cover types a detailed description of the land processes included in the parflow s clm implementation can be found in maxwell and miller 2005 2 2 2 pywr pywr tomlinson et al 2020 is a model library for the simulation of managed water resource systems it uses a linear programming formulation to simulate least cost water allocations at each simulation time step as a function of allocation penalties rules and constraints in this case study pywr is used for calculating water mass balances in a hydroelectric reservoir the extent of flooding in a stretch of the river connecting runoff from the hillslope to the hydroelectric reservoir and the amount of hydropower hp generated in the hydroelectric reservoir 2 3 case study the conceptual multi sector human natural system design problem described in this paper is applied to a simple synthetic system five conflicting socioeconomic dimensions are implemented in the multi objective optimization the water resources dimension is represented with two objectives 1 related to the propensity of the system to flood and 2 related to total annual runoff volume the latter quantity correlates with hydropower production in the hydroelectric reservoir 3 the second energy dimension is solar power potential which is set to be proportional to the area of bare soil in the catchment it is assumed that land surface underneath solar panels in our hypothetical semi arid area see section 2 3 3 will eventually become barren due to lesser availability of sunlight and elevated levels of heat 4 the food production dimension is approximated by the area of the catchment covered with rain fed agriculture 5 a proxy for ecosystem health quantifies the number of distinct land cover types within the catchment excluding bare soil 2 3 1 case study model structure the structure of parflow clm and pywr models implemented in the case study and the connections between the models and the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea are visualized in a block diagram in fig 3 the computational domain of parflow clm is a 2d hillslope which simplifies the analysis and interpretation of results compared to a 3d catchment especially with regards to the relationships between lateral subsurface flow wtd and et by removing one spatial dimension whilst still retaining the required subsurface flow complexity the hillslope is divided into ten cells indexed from 0 to 9 the model interacts with the atmosphere via bi directional exchange of the energy and water mass fluxes at the land surface and is linked with the upstream parts of the catchment via base flow q b the terrain has a slope that is sufficiently large to induce groundwater limited conditions in the upstream sections of the hillslope the pywr water allocation model is represented by a graph of connected nodes with directed edges representing transfers of water between the nodes following set rules and priorities the city node representing a river section with a weir is modelled as a long shallow trapezoidal reservoir with an overflow the amount of overflow is proportional to h 0 5 where h is the height of water above the weir the inclined sides of the reservoir represent the river banks the reservoir node models a hydroelectric reservoir which stores and directs the water to a hydropower turbine node the turbine node calculates the generated hydroelectric energy as a function of water volume and the difference between turbine elevation and water level in the reservoir node the flow of water q h p is allocated to the turbine node in every time step following a release control curve that defines the relationship between q h p and the volume of water in the reservoir v in case the volume of water exceeds the reservoir s capacity and the calculated release exceeds the maximum allowed throughput of the turbine the excess water q s is directed to the estuary via the spill node the rain and the evaporation nodes model the additional sources and sinks of water due to precipitation q r and evaporation q e from the water surface respectively rain and evaporation nodes do not feature in the city node due to its small surface area and thus negligible effects of surface dependent rain and evaporation processes on the overall water mass balance the rain source q r and evaporation sink q e are derived from the meteorological input time series that drive the hydrologic response of parflow clm q r is calculated directly from rainfall whilst q e is computed using the penman monteith equation penman and keen 1948 allen 2005 the input q i n to pywr is equal to the daily average of the hourly runoff time series output from parflow clm after every simulation model evaluation of the coupled parflow clm pywr model values of all five objective functions f i x see next section are calculated and passed to the moea as a vector f x in each iteration moea adjusts the 10 1 input vector x of land cover types and passes the updated sequence x n e w to parflow clm 2 3 2 optimization implementation out of five objectives three are calculated in parflow clm number of cells with crops f 3 number of cells with bare soil f 4 and land cover diversity f 5 the remaining two objectives i e annual hydropower production f 1 and flood extent f 2 are calculated in pywr in the turbine and in the city node respectively the multiobjective optimization problem mop is formulated as follows 1 max x f x f 1 x f 2 x f 3 x f 4 x f 5 x x ω where ω denotes the solution space i e all possible land cover configurations in the hillslope f i x denotes the i th objective function and f x denotes the set of all objective functions for solution x x is represented as a 10 1 vector in which each element x j for j 0 9 defines the type of land cover allocated to the j th cell the land cover type is encoded as an integer value i e x 0 for mixed forests x 1 for grasslands x 2 for croplands and x 3 for bare soil the mixed forest type in clm is parameterized to represent a mixture of coniferous deciduous and evergreen broad leaved species grasslands and croplands represent vegetation types with short root depths rds the five objective functions are defined as follows 2 f 1 x 2 4 1 0 7 k 1 365 η t ρ g q h p k x h k z t where q h p k and h k are respectively flow rate through hydropower turbine and water level in the hydroelectric reservoir in k th daily timestep z t is the turbine elevation η t is the turbine s total efficiency ρ is the water s density and g is the gravitational constant 2 4 1 0 7 is the conversion coefficient required to obtain hydropower production in mwh assuming that all variables in the hydropower equation on the right side of the summation symbol are given in si units the flow released from the reservoir to the turbine q h p k f h p v h p k is calculated for each timestep in pywr using a piecewise linear release curve f h p relating the released flow to the volume of water in the reservoir 3 f 2 x max k 1 a f l o o d k x k 1 365 the flooded area in k th timestep a f l o o d k is multiplied by 1 to minimize the extent of flooding since the problem is posed as a maximization problem a f l o o d is calculated in the city node using a bathymetric curve a f l o o d k f f l o o d v c i t y k where f f l o o d is a function derived from geometric dimensions of the reservoir and v c i t y k denotes the volume of water stored in the city node in k th timestep using iverson bracket notation 4 f 3 x x x x 2 calculates the number of cells in solution x allocated to rain fed croplands which are coded in the algorithm with integer number 2 similarly 5 f 4 x x x x 3 describes the number of cells in solution x allocated to bare soil 6 f 5 x card x x x 3 where card denotes cardinality of a set models land cover diversity as a number of unique land cover types in the solution x excluding bare soil for this search based design application we used a dominance based many objective evolutionary optimization algorithm called nsga iii deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 2 3 3 model inputs and parameters five important meteorological variables out of 8 variables in total that form the input to parflow clm pywr are plotted in fig 4 due to high computational complexity of our study imposed by parflow clm and moea the input timeseries were limited to a single year at an hourly time step the meteorological inputs are representative of a subtropical semi arid zone this setting is chosen to allow testing the sensitivity of land and subsurface interactions in an environment exhibiting high variability in atmospheric conditions such as inter and intra day temperatures and solar irradiation as well as sporadic precipitation patterns with periods of droughts catchments in semi arid zones are characterized by high temporal variability of various hydrologic variables that drive the processes on the land surface such as soil moisture content and water table depth wtd consequently the vegetation driven energy fluxes at the surface may vary significantly in response to changes in evapotranspiration throughfall and infiltration thus having an impact on subsurface hydrology based on this setting we are able to test the model s behaviour under a range of conditions with et intermittently limited by shallow soil moisture deficits and with seasonal water shortages affecting water table levels we shall see that as table level depths affect et differently depending on the vegetation type as illustrated conceptually in fig 2 interesting tradeoffs emerge between land cover

characterized with high shortwave radiation with an average annual value of approximately 300 w m 2 and slight and moderate rainfall throughout the year with longer dry periods in the winter months the temperature in degrees celsius ranges from high and mid 30 s in summer months to small negative values in winter months with an annual average of approximately 18 c humidity when converted from specific to relative ranges between 30 and 85 depending on the period of the year the hillslope also receives base flow q b 120 m 3 d equivalent to flux v b 0 0288 m h uniformly distributed along the

parallelization support in platypus allowed us to perform the study on multiple computer nodes using message parsing interface mpi with python s native mpi4py mpi4py 0000 all simulation and optimization runs were conducted on a high performance computing hpc cluster hosted at the university of manchester the study was run on 144 cores using high performance nodes of 2 12 core intel xeon e5 2690 v3 2 60 ghz 128 gb ram parallelization was implemented by dividing the population of candidate solutions inside the genetic algorithm ga into isolated islands of sub populations evaluation of each population member required a simulation of one instance of the integrated parflow clm pywr model each simulation was run for the duration of 3 physical years repeating the one year long meteorological input first two years of the simulation were used to attain an approximation of a dynamic equilibrium the results obtained in the third year of the simulation were used to calculate the objectives each simulation run was started with the same set of initial conditions optimization was started from 5 randomly generated initial populations seeds of size 132 with 140 000 function evaluations per seed the running time of each optimization per seed was approx 7 days at the end of all five optimization runs non dominated sorting was performed on the nondominated solutions collected from all five seeds the final result is a pareto optimal surface composed of 145 nondominated solutions a 2 year spinup was sufficient to attain 1 convergence in land surface variables i e latent sensible and ground heat fluxes upward long wave radiation ground surface temperature and bottom layer temperature convergence criterion is set as annual relative difference between output variables states in consecutive years these results are in agreement with the studies of ajami et al 2014 seck et al 2015 which were based on parflow clm and reported that 2 9 6 and 5 years of spin up were sufficient to achieve 1 convergence between start and end day of a year long simulation in groundwater gw storage unsaturated storage and water storage within clm model and root zone respectively restricting the simulation to 1 physical year following a 2 year spinup was required due to a significant execution times of parflow clm and b np hard complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem at hand serafini 1987 3 results and discussion the results are presented and discussed in three subsections 1 we provide plots illustrating tradeoffs between the multiple objectives of our hypothetical land cover design problem these plots convey information about the impact of land cover selection on different multi sector services 2 we illustrate the spatial land cover patterns generated by the optimization results which show how catchments with the same aggregate land cover composition but with different spatial distributions exhibit different hydrologic behaviour 3 we discuss which hydrologic and land processes have the largest impact on land cover selection and present the argument for wider application of distributed hydrologic land models in land use planning studies with water dependent benefit functions 3 1 trade offs between multiple competing objectives the tradeoffs between 145 identified nondominated solutions are visualized in a parallel axis plot in fig 5 the objectives are plotted on the first five axes the last two axes visualize the auxiliary variables representing the number of cells with land cover types not used in the calculation of any of the objective functions the direction of preference for each objective is indicated with a black arrowhead positioned at the top of each axis fig 5 demonstrates that tradeoffs exist between all five objectives and different objectives are favoured by different land cover types for example generation of larger amounts of hydroelectric energy which is proportional to total runoff volume comes at the cost of lower food production lower land cover diversity and lesser solar power generation potential land cover designs with high hydropower production are also prone to more flooding since land cover configurations that lead to large annual runoff volumes tend to also produce higher peak flows the highest annual hydropower is produced when most of the land is allocated to grasslands due to grasslands having the lowest et out of all four land cover types used in this study a negative correlation exists between runoff and total bare soil area because conversely to grasslands this land use type has the highest et out of the four land use types considered note in the applied parameterization of bare soil evaporation resistance to vapour transport in the soil is neglected which results in high evaporation rates at the thermodynamic equilibrium of free water in contact with the atmosphere solutions with significant area allocated to crops thus benefiting food production are characterized by moderate hydropower generation moderate to high flooding and small to moderate solar power sp potential improving land cover diversity by definition requires a mix of all types of vegetation which have different properties and favour different objectives hence solutions with high land cover diversity generate balanced quantities of solar power hydropower and crops to gain a better insight into the topology of the pareto optimal surface the solutions were also plotted in a cartesian coordinate system using three different projections in fig 6 the 2d projections in subplot b and subplot c illustrate respectively the shape of the relationship between hydropower production and the extent of flooding and the relationship between the amount of bare soil and hydropower the relationship between hydropower and the extent of flooding is monotonic and concave down with a plateau in the curve suggesting that above a certain threshold further increase in runoff does not produce higher peak flows this suggests a presence of a cluster composed of combinations of land cover types which produce high overall runoffs but proportionally lower peak flows this cluster is marked in the subplots as cluster 1 cluster 1 is composed of nondominated solutions representing the hillslope covered predominantly with grasslands with a small fraction of bare soil land cover diversity of one indicates absence of any other land cover types i e forests or croplands on the opposite side of the pareto front lies cluster 3 composed of nondominated solutions generating the least runoff and producing the least flooding these solutions represent designs with large area of bare soil with addition of croplands and forests and favour solar power generation at the cost of lower land cover diversity and hydropower and crop production cluster 2 represents intermediate land cover design scenarios which benefit all five objectives to similar degrees solutions in cluster 2 thus have moderate land cover diversities and moderate hydropower solar power and food production potentials as a consequence of featuring a mix of several land cover types each satisfying different objectives interaction between land and groundwater depth is dependent on the vegetation soil evaporation ratio resulting from an interplay of a number of vegetation dependent parameters such as leaf area index lai and root depth rd since evaporation from soil and evapotranspiration through vegetation are driven by different processes land uses with different vegetation soil evaporation ratios exhibit different dynamic responses to changes in atmospheric conditions such as rainfall temperature radiation or humidity dynamic response of a land use to rainfall will affect how much water is absorbed and evaporated vs how much recharges the groundwater system and contributes to river flow the concave up shape of the curve in fig 6 can be explained by these differences as grasslands have lower et than croplands the amount of water retained in the subsurface in grassland dominated catchments is higher leading to larger overall runoff however since grasslands compared to crops evaporate proportionally more from soil than via transpiration their response to high intensity short rainfalls is different the subsurface under grasslands dominated land is characterized with lower gw levels and lower shallow soil moisture consequently in case of rainfall less water recharges the groundwater thus producing moderate increase in river flow ultimately the response of grasslands is less flashy than that of croplands the above results qualitatively agree on a macroscopic scale with the results of the earlier studies based on more aggregated models in particular the results corroborate the findings of isik et al 2013 niu and sivakumar 2014 who reported that hydrology of forest dominated areas was less flashy and with lower average flows whilst average and peak flow increased for pasture dominated areas the results also agree with the findings of mao and cherkauer 2009 who reported the lowest spring total runoff in forest dominated areas due to higher annual et whilst grasslands and croplands had higher spring total runoffs because of their lower et losses the outputs presented above result from aggregating spatially distributed results which can be explored further and unveil more information about the relationships between spatial arrangements of land cover and the catchment s behaviour 3 2 spatial distribution of land covers on the hillslope the three clusters marked in fig 6 can also be found through visual inspection of the heatmaps in fig 7 and fig 8 these figures describe how land uses are distributed along the length of the hillslope all five heatmaps can be inspected along the x axis to observe how optimized land cover patterns change with each objective as well as along the y axis to see land cover distribution along the hillslope to aid the latter the plots are divided into two regions in the y direction with the border between the two regions marked with two red pins on opposite sides of each heatmap the upper region corresponds to zone 3 in fig 2 in which groundwater level begins to fall below the maximum root zone depth creating water limited conditions suppressing et for all vegetation types the results in each heatmap are processed along both directions since this case study is based on a synthetic 2d hillslope the results cannot be directly transferred onto a full scale catchment however they reflect the behaviour of the coupled land hydrologic system including its plant functional types in parflow clm which were validated in previous studies this study investigates what processes are responsible for the identified patterns in the solutions and the results can be used to provide an indication of potential behaviour of more complex computational domains representative of real world catchments the heat maps constitute a complementary source of information to parallel axis and pareto surface plots introduced in the previous section as the nondominated solutions are individually sorted by the values of every objective function they show how optimized spatial land cover allocations change as one objective is progressively favoured over the others the heatmaps allow investigating each solution in a spatial dimension to answer questions such as whether a specific parts of the catchment favour certain land cover types b certain land cover types should be positioned next to each other c multiple solutions exist with the same aggregate land cover areas but different spatial allocations and d a change in land cover in one isolated place within the catchment can significantly alter its behaviour in fig 7 there are a number of solutions which have the same composition of land covers but produce different runoffs and or peak flows depending on where the different land covers are placed within the hillslope figs 7 and 8 indicate that the preferred location for grasslands and croplands is in zone 3 placing these two land cover types having the lowest et out of all four land cover types considered in this study in the part of the hillslope where et is additionally water limited minimizes total et maximizes recharge base flow and discharge and thus maximizes hydropower production introduction of croplands additionally improves the agricultural production objective for the selected objectives and land cover types most efficient land cover designs include a mix of croplands grasslands and bare soil bare soil tends to appear first in the lower sections of the hillslope in conjunction with grasslands and crops as respectively hydropower and food production objectives are gradually traded off for solar power and for mitigating the risk of flooding looking at fig 9 which shows the variability of mean annual wtds per land cover type and cell groundwater level under bare soil is the lowest out of all four land cover types considered as bare soil has the highest et consequently placing bare soil just upstream of grasslands and croplands creates a drop in the water level further down in the hillslope creating water limited conditions for these two land cover types ultimately producing overall lowest total et lower than if bare soil was placed at the very top of the hillslope the information about the gw levels and its variability for different land cover arrangements becomes especially useful when groundwater levels are an important factor in land use optimization e g when one or more objectives are related to water abstraction from the subsurface since many solutions feature the same number of cells with bare soil see upper subplot in fig 8 repeated solutions are sorted in the direction of decreasing runoff as et of bare soil is high due to the applied parameterization and therefore water level underneath the hillslope with predominantly bare soil cover is low mixing croplands and grasslands into catchments dominated by bare soil increases total runoff only negligibly for this reason the optimizer chooses instead to co locate bare soil with forests which can evaporate large amounts of water due to their extensive root system the preferred strategy is to improve flood mitigation objective whilst increasing land cover diversity as the bare soil area gradually decreases solutions begin to feature croplands which further improve land cover diversity and additionally benefit the food production objective finally a pattern emerges where initially bare soil is co located with grasslands to benefit runoff and later with croplands which although generate less runoff than grasslands benefit agricultural food production objective this pattern repeats in steps as the number of cells with bare soil is reduced one by one while solutions with equal areas of bare soil are sorted in the direction of decreasing hydropower production croplands evaporate significantly less water than forests and bare soil albeit more than grasslands therefore land cover designs dominated by croplands tend to produce intermediate hydropower earlier results demonstrated that croplands produce higher peak flows with respect to total runoff than grasslands i e lead to flashier runoff responses what follows croplands are co located with bare soil in order to reduce peak flows and thus the extent of flooding if we investigate land cover allocations in the direction of decreasing agricultural production croplands initially cover an entire hillslope gradually they are replaced with bare soil thus benefiting solar power and reducing the risk of flooding at the cost of food production as previously bare soil is preferably placed in the lower parts of the hillslope where ground water levels are at their highest while grasslands tend to be positioned in the upper parts of the hillslope scenarios with lower fractions of croplands in the hillslope feature forests to increase land cover diversity it is intuitive that the scenarios with the highest land cover diversity scores feature a mixture of all land cover types interestingly those scenarios are also abundant in forests inclusion of forests not only ensures reaching the maximum diversity score of 3 but also improves the flood control objective due to forests high et potential hence land cover diversity and flood control objectives are in this case positively correlated the preference of a given land cover type over others with relation to the proximity to groundwater can be partly explained by looking at fig 10 that describes the relationship between et and its soil and vegetation evaporation components vs water table depth wtd while on average et for the considered land use types follows the order bare soil mixed forests croplands grasslands the relative differences between them are not constant alongside the hillslope the benefit of choosing a certain land use type over another for a given objective may therefore be different in magnitude or even in sign depending on where in the catchment the decision is made for example in the parts of the hillslope where groundwater levels are high et of bare soil exceeds that of a forest as shallow soil moisture dependent evaporation from land dominates over transpiration through stomatal apertures of leaves however once evaporation from land becomes limited by shallow soil moisture et from bare soil decreases sharply whilst et of forests remain high as trees are still able to access ground water at lower levels via their root system consequently if reduction of runoff is desired the results suggest that bare soil should be placed in the lower parts of the catchment because this will lead to the highest increase of et overall as well as relative to other land use types in particular forests other mechanisms impacting spatial land cover allocations in a catchment include the effects of upstream decisions on the hydrologic conditions downstream via lateral flow as discussed earlier in this section 3 3 effects of land cover distribution within solutions having the same land cover composition the effects of varying the location of different land cover types on the hillslope on its hydrologic performance are shown in the left subfigure of fig 11 the figure describes the relationship between two objectives the annual hp production and the maximum annual flooded area for solutions with equal land cover composition but different land cover arrangements the remaining three objectives are invariant to land cover arrangements as they depend on the total number of land covers and not on their positions the figure shows up to 16 difference in annual hp production among solutions having the same land cover composition see solutions with a mix of bare soil and grasslands maximum annual flooded area which is proportional to peak flow is less dependent on land cover arrangements in this example albeit we can still observe differences up to 8 these variations are mainly driven by the placement of first and foremost bare soil and to a lesser degree forests i e the vegetation types associated with largest et the right subfigure of fig 11 shows the histograms and kernel density estimates kdes of the mean distance between each land cover and the river and corroborates that bare soil and forests are the two land cover types most spread along the hillslope as indicated by their wide distributions both are also left skewed thus indicating the preference for allocating them in the lower part of the hillslope on the other hand grasslands and croplands have right skewed distributions indicating that their preferred placement is further up in the hillslope bare soil is the mostly featured land cover type in the set of nondominated solution indicating that bare soil has the most utility in our problem formulation for optimally balancing the chosen objectives given land cover indices j 1 4 the mean distance d l j between each land cover type l j in k th nondominated solution x k and the river has been calculated as the sum of indices i of cells with land cover l j divided by the total number of cells with land cover l j allocated in the hillslope card is a set cardinality operator 7 d l j i 0 i 9 i x i k l j card x i k x k x i k l j in summary the results show that in order to optimally balance the applied objectives the location and combination of the different land covers types in the hillslope is important as already reported in warburton et al 2012 costa et al 2003 and may be difficult to predict using expert knowledge due to nonlinear feedbacks of subsurface hydrology with the land processes and the lateral groundwater flow that are hard to envisage without detailed models in the simulations these results depend on the parameterization of evapotranspiration in the applied model and the representation of hydrology and hydrogeology of the hillslope or watershed 3 4 limitations and future research directions the main limitation of this study is related to a the speed of execution of parflow clm and b the computational complexity and multi dimensionality of multiobjective combinatorial land use optimization this study showed that even for a rather simple catchment geometry restricted pool of available land cover types and short time horizons the number of unction evaluations required by moea for convergence was large enough that the optimization study had to be run for 7 days on multi processor architectures the first limitation could be mitigated by improving the manner in which coupled hydrologic land and water resources models and moeas are spawned across multiple central processing units cpus and graphics processing units gpus and exchange data with each other in this study the exchange of data between parflow and pywr happened via binary files which might have slowed down the simulation execution times by i o bound file reading and writing processes another potential solution could involve researching numerical schemes for solving hydrologic and energy exchange flux equations that are stable for longer time steps than currently employed hourly step thus reducing the number of computational time steps required to run hydrologic simulations the second barrier could be tackled at a the algorithmic level via development of custom algorithms specific to combinatorial land use optimization problems as well as b the choice and fine tuning best suited existing algorithms application specific moeas might include e g custom crossover and mutation operators mohammadi et al 2015 or additional geometric operators garcía et al 2017 that generate solutions with appropriate compactness compatibility and contiguousness properties that satisfy feasibility requirements specific to land use planning directly within the algorithm on the other hand application of constraints within existing gas could be implemented e g via application of penalty functions to degrade the fitness value of infeasible solutions or via incorporation of repair mechanisms for infeasible individuals cao et al 2012 a promising avenue towards increased scalability of the proposed framework is in learning surrogate e g deep learning models which can emulate the behaviour of models such as parflow clm at significantly higher speeds the recent advancements in deep learning proved their applicability of solving high dimensional partial differential equations such fluid dynamic equations see e g morrison and kutz 2022 and assisting with order reduction of highly dimensional dynamic models baddoo et al 2021 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the benefits of using a mechanistic distributed land and hydrologic model combined with a water resources model for land use planning in multisector systems the wef land cover design framework attempts to consider the feedbacks between land and subsurface and the link between hydrology and water management although the study was designed as a proof of concept and carried out on a simplified hillslope model with homogeneous subsurface conditions it retained the required subsurface flow complexity including lateral flow we hypothesize that the main findings related to impacts of land cover arrangements on pareto optimal solutions will also apply in a qualitative sense to more complex watersheds and we make suggestions for overcoming the computational challenges this would imply potential extensions to this framework could include 1 land cover planning with other water related objectives such as e g erosion sediment transport 2 studies with bi directional interactions between hydrologic and water resources e g including diversions and ground water pumping 3 studies with larger numbers of decision variables e g for joint optimization of land cover and water management practices such as

1954,the impact of large reservoir construction on the basin water cycle ecological environment and engineering safety needs to be studied urgently especially the evolution of the hyporheic zone in the dam site area connecting the basin sw gw few hyporheic zone research investigates the evolution of sw gw interaction in a certain period of large reservoirs the xiluodu reservoir located in the yangtze river s upper reaches has a dam height of 285 5 m and covers a basin area of 454 400 km2 the isotope balance calculation of water samples demonstrates that following impoundment the upper boundary lower boundary and extension width of the hyporheic zone expands from 370 395 m 320 330 m and 125 m to 560 600 m 370 390 m and 200 m respectively meanwhile the upstream increment is bigger than downstream increment both temperature tracing and hydrodynamic methods show that the hyporheic flow velocity increases about three times during the initial impoundment cycle and then gradually fallbacks the hydrochemistry of hyporheic zone water which changed significantly was strongly related to the season depth of burial and distance perpendicular to river but not to distance along river the biological activities in the hyporheic zone strengthened after impoundment and gradually changed from the initial impoundment nitrification dominated to denitrification dominated the sw gw interaction shifts from alternating upwelling and downwelling to continuous downwelling according to the computation of increasing no 3 flux the study helps better understand scientific and technical concerns such as the evolution of the hyporheic zone river valley contraction and dam foundation leakage in the xiluodu reservoir meantime the thoughts and approaches would also be useful to other

must incorporate both above and below ground components of rivers erostate et al 2020 marmonier et al 2020 for a long time our understanding of rivers was restricted to surface water sw and groundwater gw until orghidan first proposed the hyporheic zone hz and systematically presented the basic concepts and contents orghidan 1959 people gradually realized that the difference in the seepage temperature hydrochemistry field between sw and gw is not a mutation interface but a transition zone boano et al 2014 boulton et al 1998 chen et al 2018 sophocleous 2002 for now in hydrology the hz is a saturated area where sw and gw mix occupying central position among the river channel the lateral riparian zone and gw krause et al 2022 ranalli and macalady 2010 in ecology the hz is an ecological transition zone between rivers and riparian zone terrestrial habitats a multiphase space combining solid sediment liquid water and biological microbiota and invertebrates phases merill and tonjes 2014 peralta maraver et al 2018 the relatively large pore area and surface of the hz positively increase the hz organism s habitats stanford and ward 1988 wondzell 2011 because of its unique hydrological mechanism the hz has essential hydrological regulation environmental buffering and ecological protection functions hence it has received increasing attention from multidisciplinary researchers in recent years krause et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 emphasizing containing sw is a key difference between hz and gw meanwhile triska quantified the definition of the hz by determining that hz comprises more than 10 but less than 98 of sw triska et al 1989 the extent of the hz is difficult to determine because it is a transition zone between sw and gw which both are in a constant change state thus the extent of hz is dynamically changing in spatial and temporal dimensions conant uses temperature traces to determine the existence and extent of hz conant 2004 todd determined the boundary of the hz based on the vertical variation of stable isotopes in the hz porewater which were found to be quite comparable to utilizing cl aseltyne et al 2006 using tracers in conjunction with instantaneous impoundment models which are still based on the sw gw mixing ratio to calculate the extent of the hz has become increasingly popular as computer technology has advanced engelhardt et al 2011 ward et al 2010 in addition the extent of the hz can also be determined based on the difference in conductivity density and other physical properties of the different water cardenas and markowski 2011 westbrook et al 2005 hydrodynamic conditions are major drivers of material and energy exchange within the hz controlling the sw gw exchange deuerling et al 2018 johnson et al 2014 and the mixing ratio chen et al 2014 su et al 2015 it also controls the distribution of substances entering the hz with water flow which will change the redox conditions and physicochemical habitat characteristics as well as the biogeochemistry in the hz xie et al 2015 as one of the important indicators to characterize the hydrodynamic conditions the hyporheic exchange flux hz flux can reflect the water exchange between sw and gw cranswick et al 2014 because heat is transported via hyporheic zone water hzw exchange observing the spatial and temporal fluctuation of hz temperature is an excellent technique for calculating hyporheic exchange velocity hz velocity and processes shih and wu 2020 suzuki suzuki 1960 and stallman stallman 1965 respectively developed the algebraic and analytical solutions of the one dimensional transient heat transport equation to compute the vertical hz flux using the periodic variated hz temperature at present the one dimensional analytical model has been widely utilized in the calculation and evaluation of regional sw and gw resources ju et al 2018 while more and more methods are being raised kalbus et al 2006 including the hydrochemical method ladouche and weng 2005 the permeability coefficient method landon et al 2001 the isotope tracing method su et al 2015 yin et al 2011 the numerical simulation method xie and batlle aguilar 2017 hydraulic gradient method chen et al 2014 etc the environmental characteristics within the hz shape not only the distribution transport and transformation of elements biehler et al 2020 but also the biological activity of enzymes in the hz graham et al 2018 li et al 2020 and then affect the hz biogeochemical processes zhu et al 2020 the hydrochemical composition of hz porewater fluctuates in a corresponding gradient owing to the combined effect of hydrodynamic and physicochemical in the hz which could be evaluated by the spatial and temporal variations in the hz main ions concentration this gradient change can assist to explain the formation and evolution of the hz porewater and determine the structure and extent of the hz engel et al 2019 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 xiao et al 2019 nitrate

al 2017 the hz plays a significate role in river nitrate transport which directly affect by dissolved oxygen do whereas hydrodynamic conditions affect do by influencing the hz internal environment hester et al 2014 it can propose countermeasures for the prevention and solution of nitrogen pollution in sw gw by evaluating nitrate transport in the hz in addition to investigating the biogeochemical processes in the hz harris et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2018 there are few studies on nitrate transport in specific regions especially in the hz where exist the sw gw interaction xiluodu reservoir is the third largest hydropower project in the world with a basin area of 454 400 km2 and has wide ecological impacts it is related to the fisheries agriculture and residents life across the basin especially the evolution of the ecological environment within the dam site area where the hz is an important component connecting sw and gw the evolution of the seepage hydrochemical characteristics of the hz also greatly affects the safety and stability of this large engineering such as the river valley contraction the dam foundation leakage and other engineering problems chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 the hz studies are mainly focused on large scale basin water and a certain moment but few of them study the evolution of the sw gw interaction in large reservoir dam site areas during a certain period zhou et al 2021 therefore this paper takes the xiluodu reservoir as a case study and aims to i clarify the hz extent hz exchange velocity and nitrate transport based on the isotope balance calculation water temperature tracing and exchange flux computation respectively ii determine the evolution of seepage hydrochemistry biological characteristics of the hz caused by large reservoir impoundment iii establish the foundation for the later study of river valley contraction and other engineering problems in the large reservoir area the research thoughts and approaches in the case study are not only suitable for the xiluodu reservoir but also applicable and instructive for the study of other similar large reservoirs 2 study area 2 1 project overview the xiluodu dam

year average river level in the dam site area are around 357 m and 370 395 m respectively after impoundment the upstream reservoir and downstream river levels are between 540 600 m and 370 390 m respectively it is worth mentioning that the width of the downstream river remained constant after impoundment even though the impoundment increased the width of the upstream reservoir surface to about 490 m 2 2 geological conditions the dam area belongs to the leibo yongshan syncline basin which comprises three successive relative water resistant strata and three permeable strata they are the sand shale strata of the upper permian xuanwei formation p2x red claystone strata p2βn and silurian mud shale strata s the quaternary loose accumulation strata q emeishan basalt strata of the upper permian p2β and yangxin limestone strata of the upper permian maokou formation p1m respectively zhou et al 2022 the p2β strata is a 14 strata land phase basaltic volcanic flow with intermittent multi phase overflow with a total thickness of 490 520 m in the dam site area and is directly connected to the river reservoir the p1m and the s strata are primarily buried beneath the dam foundation with elevations typically less than 250 m and separated from the overlying p2β by p2βn strata the p2x and q strata are mainly above the basalt with the elevation usually exceeding 650 m none of the above four strata has a direct hydraulic connection with the jinsha river whose level is between 370 and 600 m before and after impoundment so they are not considered in this paper zhou et al 2021 the riverbed alluvium is generally about 15 20 m thick and its composition is mainly basalt in summary the main water storage medium in the dam site area hz is the basalt aquifer p2β 2 3 sampling and monitoring a comprehensive geological investigation was conducted at xiluodu reservoir from 1992 to 2000 56 sets of sw hzw and gw samples were collected by drilling from the riverbed and river banks in the dam site area with some samples locations shown in fig 2 blue points a total of 25 sets of sw upstream reservoir water usw downstream river water dsw hzw and gw samples were collected in two batches nearby from 2018 to 2021 with location in fig 2 red points the ph values of all the aforementioned samples were measured in situ using an acidic ph temperature measure instrument hi9124 hanna instrument while the portable water quality instrument multi3420 measured the total dissolved solid tds electrical conductance ec and dissolved oxygen do of samples and all measured values were averaged after three measurements the main hydrochemical components na k ca2 and mg2 were determined using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry while so 4 2 cl and no 3 were analyzed by ion chromatography lc 10a shimadzu hco 3 by titration with positive and negative charge balance errors less than 10 an lgr isotope analyzer was used to detect stable isotopes and the results were represented as the vienna mean standard for seawater vsmow in addition two long term monitoring points j11 1 j11 3 were installed in the upstream hz uhz and downstream hz dhz in 2010 respectively to monitor the hz water pressure and temperature for investigating the impoundment influence the seepage sensor gk4500s keikang usa and temperature sensor gk4400wp keikang usa were set at each of the deep and shallow sections of two monitoring locations and all data was transmitted to the central control system in real time via the fiber optic cable the dynamic changes in sw level and temperature are monitored from the hydrological observation stations upstream and downstream of the xiluodu reservoir 3 research methods 3 1 mapping the hyporheic zone mapping the hz extent is a prerequisite for evaluating the hz seepage and hydrochemical characteristics in the dam site area and the hz extent should consist of two dimensions the upper and lower boundary vertical and the extension width horizontal the current quantitative hz description is mainly based on triska s definition triska et al 1989 therefore the hzw can be determined by calculating whether the sw content in samples is between 10 and 98 engelhardt et al 2011 hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope content can reflect the mixing ratio of different water and is more stable and reliable than chemical ions so it is a good tracer to understand the origin and evolution of different water liu et al 2014 zhao and li 2017 zhou et al 2021 the stable isotope content in hzw mainly depends on the stable isotope content and mixing ratio of the two terminal water upper sw and lower gw so the mixing ratio of sw and gw at the sampling site can be inferred by the stable isotope content of collecting samples using the isotope mass balance equation below 1 δ 1 n 1 δ 2 n 2 δ n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 where δ 1 δ 2 and δ are the isotopic values δ 18o or δd in sw gw and samples respectively and η 1 and η 2 are the mixing ratios of sw and gw in the samples respectively by calculating the mixing ratio of all collected samples the hz extent in the dam site area can be quantified including the depth and width 3 2 calculating the hyporheic zone exchange flux the hydrodynamic conditions control the water exchange and mixing ratio between sw and gw the retention time and distribution patterns of materials and the physicochemical habitat characteristics within the hz deuerling et al 2018 therefore investigating the hz hydrodynamic characteristics is essential to clarify complex biogeochemical processes xie et al 2015 heat is a natural tracer that not only conducts diffusely through the hz medium but also convectively transports along with the hzw hence temperature tracer can be used to calculate the exchange velocity of sw hz interaction hyporheic exchange velocity zhang et al 2020 the heat exchange process in the hz can be described by a convective heat transfer model and the one dimensional heat transport model is established under the following assumptions i the water flow is parallel to the z axis vertical direction ii the thermal characteristics of the medium and water flow remain constant in both space and time iii the heat transfer occurs only in the z axis and iv the temperature of the water is always the same as that of the rock in contact the mathematical model of heat transport in the hz is as follows 2 λ e ρ c 2 t z 2 q ρ w c w ρ c t z t t where t is the temperature at depth z c t is time s z is the sediment depth m q is the flow velocity of porewater along the depth direction positive downward m s cw is the specific heat capacity per volume of water j kg c 1 c is the specific heat capacity per volume of the sediment j kg c 1 λe is the heat transfer coefficient of the sediment j s cm c 1 due to the complex structure of saturated porous media in the hz the hyporheic exchange has a high spatial variability vogt et al 2010 additionally the heat transport process is related to diurnal temperature difference seasonal temperature rainfall and snowfall vogt et al 2010 which makes eq 2 is more difficult to solve at present the representative analytical solutions of this model mainly include hatch solution hatch et al 2006 keery solution keery et al 2007 mccallum solution mccallum et al 2012 and luce solution luce et al 2013 the first two are the most widely used hatch established a time series analysis model using the amplitude decay and phase shift of the temperature time series curve to calculate the vertical hyporheic exchange velocity hatch et al 2006 the

the fluctuation amplitude phase lag and thermal dispersion and it can determine the magnitude and direction of the flow velocity with higher accuracy briggs et al 2014b both solutions include both amplitude and phase methods and numerous studies have shown that the two methods often fail to obtain consistent estimates irvine et al 2015 in contrast the amplitude method can estimate the velocities of both upward and downward flows with high applicability and fewer errors cuthbert and mackay 2013 in summary this paper uses the hatch amplitude method to calculate the hyporheic exchange velocity 3 3 determining the hyporheic zone no 3 fluxes evaluating no 3 transport in the hz can propose countermeasures for the prevention and solution of nitrogen pollution in sw gw harris et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2018 to quantify the no 3 hyporheic flux between hzw and sw and determine the migration and transformation processes of no 3 in the sw gw interaction the following equation was used for calculation 9 f net no 3 q c no 3 where fnet no 3 is the net no 3 flux between hzw and sw g d c no 3 is the no 3 concentration in the migrating sample sw in the downwelling and hzw in the upwelling g l q is the net flow flux between hzw and sw indicates downwelling indicates upwelling calculated using darcy s law l d the calculation of q is based on the water level of sw and hzw at the same moment with sampling 4 results 4 1 mapping the hyporheic zone before and after impoundment take the calculation before impoundment as an example according to the methods in section 3 1 it can be seen that each sample collected from underground is basically on both sides of the line with a relatively high correlation in the δ 18o δd figure fig 3 indicating that all underground samples are recharged by local water the δ 18o and δd values of the underground samples ranged between 10 24 to 7 93 and 77 00 to 55 10 respectively the δ 18o values of samples above 201 34 m varied substantially whereas the section below tended to remain stable indicating that the below section was mainly gw and the underground samples from the riverbed to 201 34 m were probably sw gw mixture that is possible hz extent according to eq 1 the mixing ratio of sw and gw at different sampling points was computed table 1 where the δ 18o and δd values of sw and gw were averaged as 14 33 104 60 8 48 58 3 respectively combining table 1 with the location of samples fig 2 it can be seen that the proportion of sw decreases as the sample elevation decreases while the opposite is true for groundwater the proportion of sw in the underground samples above 330 m is significantly greater than 10 which is considered hz according to definition while that below 320 m is significantly less than 10 which is gw therefore the hz lower boundary in the dam site area is between 320 and 330 m in elevation before impoundment since the multi year average river level is 370 395 m before impoundment the lateral riparian zone lrz below 395 m will also connect to the river and is the hz the hz upper boundary in the dam site area is 370 395 m the sw proportion in the hz of lrz is low compared with the same elevation samples under the riverbed table 1 mostly because the interaction between sw and hz weakens as moves away from the river bank causing the hz elevation to rise comparing fig 2 table 1 the proportion of sw at pd8 and pd82 which are about 125 m away from the river bank is slightly more than 10 indicating that the hz has extended to 125 m on both banks before impoundment in summary before impoundment it is determined that the hz upper and lower boundary is between 370 395 m and 320 330 m in elevation in the dam site area respectively with the horizontal direction extending almost 125 m from both banks after impoundment the reservoir water level fluctuates from 540 m to 600 m and the river width increases from 120 m to 490 m the upper boundary of uhz and dhz is 560 600 m and 370 390 m respectively the lower boundary of uhz and dhz is between 300 310 m and 320 328 m in elevation table 1 respectively according to the same computed method employed pre impoundment both indicate that the uhz was greatly expanded vertically while the dhz was almost unchanged the sw proportions in the uhz samples at 330 m elevation were 74 50 δd and 62 09 δ 18o which were much higher than that of samples in the same location before impoundment table 1 showing that the uhz increased vertically those in the dhz at 330 m elevation were 48 02 δd and 29 04 δ 18o which were the same as the corresponding positions before impoundment due to the limitation of site conditions the samples were concentrated in the reservoir area the calculation shows that the uhz horizontal direction extends at least 200 m from both original banks according to the collected samples while that of dhz is 166 m the increasing vertical extension of uhz is directly connected to the enhanced interaction between the reservoir water and the uhz water uhzw due to the raised reservoir level and the increased reservoir surface width 4 2 the hyporheic zone hydrodynamic characteristics before and after impoundment 4 2 1 the temperature tracing method using the temperature tracing method to calculate the hyporheic zone exchange zone is shown in section 3 2 this calculation was conducted by the vflux program which is the most widely used program for calculating the vertical hyporheic exchange velocity in the hz gordon et al 2012 the parameters required for the calculation process were mainly determined by field and indoor tests zhou et al 2022 the effective heat transfer coefficient λ sat thermal dispersion β specific heat capacity of water c w and sediment c and porosity of saturated sediment n are 0 00522 cal s cm c 1 0 001 m 1 kcal kg c 1 0 2084 kcal kg c 1 0 20 respectively to calculate the hz velocity between sw and hzw in the upstream and downstream of the dam site area before and after impoundment two temperature monitoring points were set up j11 1 j11 3 fig 2 the monitoring started in august 2010 so this calculation started on september 1 2010 which took as the t 0 t 0 d and may 31 2021 as the end of the calculation t 1 t 3193 d since the whole monitoring process takes too long too many data points may affect the calculation accuracy thus take the beginning of impoundment december 20 2012 as the cut off point and select three presentative periods for computation that is before impoundment june 9 2012 december 20 2012 after impoundment december 20 2012 february 5 2015 and stable impoundment cycle february 19 2019 may 5 2019 the calculation results are shown in fig 4 4 2 2 the hydrodynamic method darcy s law is employed to calculate the same period hyporheic exchange velocities from t 0 to t 1 based on the sw and hzw levels obtained from long term monitoring at j11 1 and j11 3 to verify the reliability of the temperature tracing method the sediment permeability coefficient in the uhz is 0 091 m d based on the field test results while that of the dhz decreased to 0 0085 m d due to sediment accumulation chen et al 2021 dam foundation impermeability curtain zhou et al 2022 the calculation results based on the hydraulic method are shown in fig 5 4 2 3 the hyporheic exchange velocity in different periods fig 4 shows that the uhz and dhz velocity in the dam site area before impoundment is between 0 008 0 03 and 0 002 0 009 m d respectively with dhz slower than uhz after impoundment t 950 d the uhz velocity starts to increase suddenly to 0 01 0 08 m d indicating that impoundment influences start to show up correspondingly the dhz velocity also starts to increase rapidly to 0 005 0 03 m d t 1300 d owing to the impoundment after six stable impoundment cycles t 3100 d the uhz and dhz velocity which is between 0 009 0 03 and 0 003 0 009 m d respectively all fall back to their pre impoundment values according to the temperature method the uhz and dhz velocities began to shift and increase dramatically at 100 and 450 days after the impoundment commenced december 20 2012 respectively and both of them have already returned to pre impoundment levels around 1320 days after the impoundment began fig 4 the hydraulic method further reveals that the uhz and dhz velocity start to decline slowly following the peak generated by impoundment and the uhz velocity gradually recovers to the pre impoundment level at roughly t 1750 d fig 5 while the dhz at around t 3200 d comparing fig 4 and fig 5 the two methods computation results are almost the same within the same magnitude and the changing trends of velocity in different locations and periods are virtually identical corroborating the dependability of the calculation results 4 3 the hyporheic zone biogeochemical characteristics before and after impoundment the hz environmental characteristics not only affect the present form and transport of elements but also influence the biological activity of enzymes which in turn affects the biogeochemical processes in the hz li et al 2020 therefore the study of the environmental and hydrochemical characteristics of hz porewater is the basis for an in depth study of the complex biogeochemical processes in the hz 4 4 temporal variation of major ion characteristics 1 before impoundment based on the hz extent determined in section 4 1 the piper diagrams of sw and hzw in the dam site area can be obtained fig 6 a sw and hzw have ph values of 7 9 and 7 8 respectively indicating that they are slightly alkaline their tds concentrations are 154 93 and 188 29 mg l respectively the hydrochemistry types of both sw and hzw are mainly hco3 ca mg fig 6a indicating that there is no obvious hydrochemistry evolutionary occurred during the sw hzw interaction before impoundment this is consistent with the gibbs diagram fig 7 demonstrates that the hydrochemistry of both sw and hzw is primarily driven by rock water dominance rwd rather than atmospheric precipitation dominance apd or evaporation concentration dominance ecd the γ na cl and γ hco 3 so 4 2 ca2 mg2 values in hzw are mostly larger than 0 fig 8 a and are mainly concentrated near the straight line y x while the opposite is true for sw in general indicating that cation exchange and adsorption cea is demonstrable in hzw and relatively weak in sw 2 after impoundment after impoundment the reservoir level rose by more than 200 m and the dam separated the dam site area into upstream and downstream parts cluster analysis was performed separately for the two batches of collected samples and revealed consistent results that all samples are divided into three main categories according to the hydrochemical characteristics fig 9 namely sw uhzw and dhz water dhzw the sw comprises upstream sw reservoir water usw and downstream sw river water dsw which have the similar hydrochemical features the ph values of usw dsw uhzw and dhzw were 8 02 8 06 8 09 and 8 12 which were marginally higher than pre impoundment the tds contents were 326 25 331 48 305 85 and 248 55 mg l respectively which were significantly higher than pre impoundment the hydrochemistry type of samples is more complicated as seen in fig 6 with usw and dsw both showing hco3 cl ca mg dhzw presenting hco3 ca and uhzw displaying hco3 ca na the dsw and usw properties after impoundment are essentially identical suggesting that the dsw is primarily recharged by dsw the disparities between dhzw uhzw and sw suggest that the hydrochemical properties evolved during the sw gw interaction and the degree of upstream and downstream consistency is not uniform the hydrochemistry of all water is still mainly impacted by rwd fig 10 but apd and ecd have a greater influence than pre impoundment the cea in the sw stays relatively weak uhzw is relatively weaker than pre impoundment while dhzw remains demonstrable fig 8 which corresponds to dhzw s larger na k concentration than uhzw fig 6 3 different seasons the hydrochemistry data in the dry season march april 2000 and the rainy season august 2000 were selected to study the hz hydrochemical features in different seasons fig 11 the ph of dry season hzw dry hzw and rainy season hzw rainy hzw were 7 51 and 8 15 respectively the tds content was 141 19 and 160 31 mg l both of which were higher in the rainy season which was mainly related to the elevated river level and significantly enhanced sw gw interaction in the rainy season the hydrochemistry type of dry and rainy hzw is hco3 ca mg fig 11a the dry hzw mainly falls in the first quadrant although not completely near the y x line while the rainy hzw primarily in the second quadrant fig 11b indicating that the stronger cea in the dry season which is consistent with the higher na k content in the dry hzw the contents of cl so 4 2 na and k in the hzw on the right bank are higher than left fig 11a which may be attributed to the stronger cea on the right bank fig 11b caused by the right angle turn at the doushaxi ditch fig 1 4 5 spatial variation of the major ion characteristics 1 the distance perpendicular to the river the hydrochemistry characteristics of hzw changed significantly in the direction perpendicular to the river fig 12 with the increase of distance from the bank the contents of ca2 mg2 and hco 3 in hzw decreased continuously the contents of k na increased gradually and the contents of cl and so 4 2 increased slightly this phenomenon is mainly due to increased water rock interaction wri and cea which makes ca2 and mg2 in hzw exchange k and na in the sediment the ca2 is exchanged into the sediment mainly in caco3 formation so the content of hco3 also decreases continuously it illustrates that away from the bank the association between sw and hzw declines as does the hz depth table 1 2 different burial depths fig 13 shows the main ion contents of hzw at different burial depths from top to bottom for p2β5 to p2β1 at the same location in general as depth increases the value of tds ca2 mg2 hco 3 na and so 4 2 of hzw all increase to different extents due to the enhanced wri and the lower gw recharge causing the difference between hzw and sw to gradually grow therefore as depth increases the correlation and interaction between sw and hzw both decline and the sw proportion in hzw eventually decrease to 10 indicating that the lower boundary of the hz has been reached while the porewater below the boundary is primarily dominated by gw the differences between the left and right banks are related to the basaltic strata tending to be downstream of the left bank in the dam area 3 the distance along the river before impoundment the main ion contents of hzw are close to each other along the river fig 14 indicating that the hzw is uniformly distributed along the river within the dam site area in contrast the characteristics of uhzw and dhzw after impoundment are somewhat different fig 6 fig 8 and both are different from the corresponding location pre impoundment indicating that impoundment has modified the regional hzw characteristics the distinction between uhzw and dhzw is due to artificial structures such as arch dams and impermeable curtains which weaken the formerly strong hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream hz 4 6 characteristics and transport of no 3 in the hyporheic zone before impoundment the no 3 concentration in sw and hzw is between 2 5 5 5 and 4 7 mg l respectively with sw having a greater concentration fig 15 a the no 3 concentration in rainy hzw is 0 5 3 mg l larger than that in dry hzw and the no 3 concentration generally show a positive correlation with do content the difference in no 3 concentration between hzw and sw on the left and right bank is between 3 4 and 0 5 1 5 mg l respectively demonstrating stronger hydraulic interaction and connection between sw and hzw on the right bank after impoundment the no 3 concentration of sw and hzw ranged between 1 5 4 5 and 0 5 3 5 mg l respectively both smaller than pre impoundment particularly in hzw which was substantially lower fig 15b the no 3 concentration difference between hzw and sw upstream is between 0 5 1 mg l while that is 2 5 3 5 mg l downstream showing a better hydraulic connection between dsw and dhzw it is noteworthy that the greater do content in the rainy season with the lower no 3 concentration 0 5 2 5 mg l fig 15c illustrates the negative correlation between the no 3 concentration and do content since cl is conservative no 3 cl could be used to assist in discerning the concentration and dilution effects of water no 3 cl 1 indicates the concentrating effect and nitrification with no 3 increases and vice versa the ratio of samples was generally greater than 1 in the dry season and less than 1 in the rainy season fig 15 which also showed that the no 3 content was higher in the dry season in agreement with fig 15c the no 3 flux can be calculated by eq 9 as mentioned in section 3 3 since the content of hz expanded significantly after impoundment to better reflect the migration law the net no 3 flux calculated is the per area flux table 2 the entire dam site region should be separated into distinct zones to compare no 3 flux differences in different periods and locations it was divided using the dam axis area as the boundary which encompasses the area from the hyperbolic arch dam to the second dam dam axis figs 1 2 and upstream and downstream are determined respectively the same setting was utilized before impoundment owing to numerous hydroelectric buildings and seepage control structures the flux in the dam axis area after impoundment is not discussed before impoundment the river level is low in the dry season so the net no 3 flux is negative and vice versa table 2 in general the net no 3 flux diminishes steadily along the river after impoundment the reservoir level rises and it is continuously recharged hz so the net no 3 flux is always positive in both seasons which is consistent with the hzw velocity fig 4 because of the increased hyporheic exchange flow between sw and hzw the net no 3 flux rose dramatically after impoundment the upstream net no 3 flux is still larger than the downstream which is also related to the lower water level difference between dsw and dhzw both the no 3 per area flux table 2 and the hz extent increase fig 2 after impoundment suggesting that the no 3 net flux is substantially larger after impoundment than before 5 discussions the hz strata in the dam site area were determined to be the riverbed sedimentary layer and the basalt strata on both banks and below sedimentary based on the field tests and geological conditions which are derived from a vast number of boreholes fig 16 according to triska s definition the hz extent in the dam site area was quantitatively calculated by stable isotope δ 18o δd before impoundment the upper and lower boundary of hz is 370 395 and 320 330 m in elevation respectively with a horizontal width of 125 m from the river bank fig 1 fig 16 as the reservoir level rises after impoundment the width of the reservoir surface increases from the original 120 m to about 490 m making the horizontal width of the uhz and dhz extend to at least 200 and 166 m from the original river bank respectively similarly the elevated reservoir level increases the hydraulic gradient and connection between sw and hzw so the vertical hz depth also increases the upper and lower boundary of uhz is between 560 600 and 300 310 m in elevation respectively while that of the dhz ranges between 370 390 and 320 328 m the fluctuation of uhz and dhz is inconsistent because uhz is directly connected to usw whereas the connection between dhz and usw is through seepage around the dam or reservoir drainage the impoundment modifies the regional hydrogeological conditions which in turn alters the seepage field in the dam site area and the temperature and hydrochemistry fields in the seepage field are also transformed with it firstly the impoundment converts the seasonal mutual replenishment between sw hzw pre impoundment i e the alternating upwelling and downwelling to the continuous replenishment of sw to hzw which is always downwelling fig 16 continuous downwelling also leads to the positive value of net no 3 flux between sw hzw after impoundment table 2 secondly the raised reservoir level increased the seepage difference between sw hzw hence the hyporheic velocity of uhz and dhz increased substantially at about 100 d and 450 d after impoundment began december 20 2012 respectively fig 4 fig 5 thirdly because the hzw level rises continually with the reservoir s uninterrupted replenishment the seepage differential between sw hzw continues to decrease once the reservoir level reaches the stable cycle i e the reservoir level fluctuates periodically 540 600 m therefore the hyporheic velocity of uhz and dhz gradually returns to the same magnitude as pre impoundment and achieves a new stable state fig 5 both changes in the hyporheic velocity of uhz and dhz lag behind variations in reservoir level whereas the combined effect of the artificially impermeable structures as well as the sediment accumulation induced by the impoundment diminishes the originally intimate hydraulic connection between the uhzw and dhzw as a result the hyporheic velocity of dhzw had a more prominent hysteretic effect than the uhzw throughout both the initial rise and later fallback phases with the change of the seepage field the hydrochemical characteristics also change firstly the chemical characteristics ph tds ion content of sw and hzw are almost the same pre impoundment fig 6a showing a strong correlation because of the increasing hyporheic flow between sw hzw after impoundment the wri was continually reinforced causing the tds and each ion content of sw and hzw to climb to varying degrees fig 6b and the hydrochemistry types tend to be diverse secondly rwd was primarily responsible for the hydrochemistry of sw and hzw before impoundment fig 7 after impoundment the reservoir surface expanded and sw is subject to enhanced atmospheric precipitation and evapotranspiration resulting in increased ecd and apd effects in sw and hzw fig 10 in general the cea was consistently weak in sw but it is generally strong in hzw due to the wri fig 8 thirdly samples were categorized into sw and hzw because of minimal hydrochemistry differences between uhzw and dhzw before impoundment the dsw is primarily derived from the usw and has similar hydrochemistry after impoundment fig 6 therefore all samples were classified as the sw uhzw and dhzw fig 9 the uhzw primarily is recharged by usw with the high water level so the uhzw hydrochemistry is more usw while the dhzw is simultaneously affected by dsw and gw fig 8 therefore the uhzw and dhzw exhibit distinct evolutionary trends fourthly the main hydrochemistry of hzw before and after impoundment are strongly connected to the season depth of burial distance perpendicular to the river etc the closer to the rainy season the lower burial depth and the closer to the river bank the more similar hzw hydrochemistry is to sw and the more distinct it is from gw because the dam site area is only a small portion of the whole basin there is no evident association between the distance along the river and the hzw hydrochemistry in the dam site area as the impoundment not only the hydrochemistry field will change but also the biological field the riverbed is home to a diverse range of benthic animals whereas the hz is dominated by invertebrates and microbes that dwell in the pores of the sediments the water level difference between sw and hzw before impoundment has a seasonal effect i e alternating upwelling and downwelling fig 16 the downwelling carries oxygen nutrients organic matter and tiny invertebrates into the hz while upwelling can transfer nutrients to the riverbed which affects the primary productivity of algae and benthic community composition in the riverbed fig 16 as a result the alternating upwelling and downwelling stimulated biological activity in the riverbed and the hz resulting in positive and negative no 3 content table 2 fig 16 following impoundment the reservoir level rises and sw unidirectionally recharges hzw resulting in only downwelling as a response a substantial amount of oxygen invertebrates and microbes contained in sw flowed into the hz with the downwelling at the initial impoundment the organisms in the hz mostly conduct nitrification reactions with high do content causing the no 3 concentration to climb because of the substantial increase in the surface area of the pores requisite for microbial biological activities in the hz i e the increase in hz habitat the content and intensity of microbial activities are increasing because of the reduced do content caused by increased oxygen consumption for biological activities the organisms begin to convert to denitrification and the no 3 concentration drops fig 15 and the elemental n in the hz constantly escape in the form of nitrogen by denitrification the reservoir impoundment enables the downwelling to transport a significant number of microorganisms nutrients and oxygen into the hz in general hence enhancing the intensity of biological activities in the hz to some extent as shown in fig 16 the hz consists of the riverbed sedimentary and the shallow basalt but following impoundment the uhz comprises deeper and more basalt with more basalt and larger hz content the connecting surface of sw gw increases the hz lines in fig 16 meantime the increased water level difference between sw hzw accelerated the hyporheic flow velocity the larger connecting surface and hyporheic flow velocity mean more substance and energy exchange can transport from sw to hzw which ultimately exchange with gw as well as strengthened wri the transported sw which contains massive different ions and organisms and the strengthened wri lead to the evolution of the hydrochemistry of hz and make it takes on more biological habitat functions the basalt s low permeability and manmade water blocking constructions like dams and seepage curtains cause the weakened hydraulic connection and discontinuous seepage biogeochemistry fields of the uhz and dhz as the saturation line shows fig 16 the basalt aquifers below the water level of jinsha river are saturated pre impoundment the reservoir water level rises significantly within a short period post impoundment and the change of basalt water level on both banks is small due to the low permeability especially away from the bank the basalt water level will gradually grow to a certain amount in a vast region on both banks with the continuous impoundment i e the hz extent will develop further along with the increased saturated area of the basalt aquifer it is worth noting that the non sw component within the hz mainly comes from precipitation infiltration vadose zone water and leakage recharge due to the rise limestone level in summary before and after water impoundment there is a continuous and remarkable connection between sw and hzw including the comprehensive connection of seepage hydrochemistry and biological activities the impoundment impact the hydrogeological structures regional seepage field hydrochemistry characteristics of sw and hzw and the type and intensity of biological activities in the dam site area the evolution of these fields may also affect the safety and stability of the whole project for example the river valley contraction is closely related to the evolution of the regional seepage field of the hz 6 conclusions this paper investigates the characteristics and evolution of the seepage field temperature hydrochemical and biological field of sw hzw and gw in the xiluodu dam site area before and after impoundment based on various methods such as temperature tracing hydrodynamic cluster analysis and stable isotopes mass balance the sw hzw interaction is quantitatively investigated the research thoughts and methods used in this case will be helpful and applicable to other comparable large reservoirs the main conclusions are as follows 1 after impoundment the hz expands vertically and horizontally to the deeper riverbed and lateral riparian zone respectively especially the uhz 2 the sw hzw interaction in the dam site area changes from alternating upwelling and downwelling to continuous downwelling according to the hyporheic flow velocity and no 3 flux the hyporheic velocity between sw and hzw increases about three times after the initial impoundment and then fallback gradually based on the temperature tracing method using the monitored sw hzw temperature during both the initial rising and subsequent descent stages the change in hyporheic velocity of dhzw lags behind that of uhzw 3 the ph tds and ions contents of sw and hzw increased significantly after impoundment and the hydrochemistry type also changed the division of hzw changed from one category pre impoundment to two categories post impoundment uhzw and dhzw due to upstream and downstream discontinuity caused by artificial facilities the hydrochemistry of sw and hzw used to be mainly controlled by rwd while it evolved toward ecd and apd post impoundment the hzw hydrochemistry is strongly related to the season burial depth and distance perpendicular to the river but not to distance along river 4 the net no 3 flow between sw and hzw rises the enlarged hz pore surface area following impoundment enhances the intensity of biological processes in the hz which shifts from nitrification at the initial impoundment to denitrification at the later stage credit authorship contribution statement ziwen zhou methodology data curation writing original draft writing review editing zhifang zhou

1954,the impact of large reservoir construction on the basin water cycle ecological environment and engineering safety needs to be studied urgently especially the evolution of the hyporheic zone in the dam site area connecting the basin sw gw few hyporheic zone research investigates the evolution of sw gw interaction in a certain period of large reservoirs the xiluodu reservoir located in the yangtze river s upper reaches has a dam height of 285 5 m and covers a basin area of 454 400 km2 the isotope balance calculation of water samples demonstrates that following impoundment the upper boundary lower boundary and extension width of the hyporheic zone expands from 370 395 m 320 330 m and 125 m to 560 600 m 370 390 m and 200 m respectively meanwhile the upstream increment is bigger than downstream increment both temperature tracing and hydrodynamic methods show that the hyporheic flow velocity increases about three times during the initial impoundment cycle and then gradually fallbacks the hydrochemistry of hyporheic zone water which changed significantly was strongly related to the season depth of burial and distance perpendicular to river but not to distance along river the biological activities in the hyporheic zone strengthened after impoundment and gradually changed from the initial impoundment nitrification dominated to denitrification dominated the sw gw interaction shifts from alternating upwelling and downwelling to continuous downwelling according to the computation of increasing no 3 flux the study helps better understand scientific and technical concerns such as the evolution of the hyporheic zone river valley contraction and dam foundation leakage in the xiluodu reservoir meantime the thoughts and approaches would also be useful to other

coexistence between humans and nature chen et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 the human race is born and nourished by rivers which are important and complex three dimensional ecosystems boulton 2000 all components of river ecosystems including those below the surface are critical to river ecological processes and functions hancock et al 2005 therefore the evaluation and management of river ecosystem must incorporate both above and below ground components of rivers erostate et al 2020 marmonier et al 2020 for a long time our understanding of rivers was restricted to surface water sw and groundwater gw until orghidan first proposed the hyporheic zone hz and systematically presented the basic concepts and contents orghidan 1959 people gradually realized that the difference in the seepage temperature hydrochemistry field between sw and gw is not a mutation interface but a transition zone boano et al 2014 boulton et al 1998 chen et al 2018 sophocleous 2002 for now in hydrology the hz is a saturated area where sw and gw mix occupying central position among the river channel the lateral riparian zone and gw krause et al 2022 ranalli and macalady 2010 in ecology the hz is an ecological transition zone between rivers and riparian zone terrestrial habitats a multiphase space combining solid sediment liquid water and biological microbiota and invertebrates phases merill and tonjes 2014 peralta maraver et al 2018 the relatively large pore area and surface of the hz positively increase the hz organism s habitats stanford and ward 1988 wondzell 2011 because of its unique hydrological mechanism the hz has essential hydrological regulation environmental buffering and ecological protection functions hence it has received increasing attention from multidisciplinary researchers in recent years krause et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 emphasizing containing sw is a key difference between hz and gw meanwhile triska quantified the definition of the hz by determining that hz comprises more than 10 but less than 98 of sw triska et al 1989 the extent of the hz is difficult to determine because it is a transition zone between sw and gw which both are in a constant change state thus the extent of hz is dynamically changing in spatial and temporal dimensions conant uses temperature traces to determine the existence and extent of hz conant 2004 todd determined the boundary of the hz based on the vertical variation of stable isotopes in the hz porewater which were found to be quite comparable to utilizing cl aseltyne et al 2006 using tracers in conjunction with instantaneous impoundment models which are still based on the sw gw mixing ratio to calculate the extent of the hz has become increasingly popular as computer technology has advanced engelhardt et al 2011 ward et al 2010 in addition the extent of the hz can also be determined based on the difference in conductivity density and other physical properties of the different water cardenas and markowski 2011 westbrook et al 2005 hydrodynamic conditions are major drivers of material and energy exchange within the hz controlling the sw gw exchange deuerling et al 2018 johnson et al 2014 and the mixing ratio chen et al 2014 su et al 2015 it also controls the distribution of substances entering the hz with water flow which will change the redox conditions and physicochemical habitat characteristics as well as the biogeochemistry in the hz xie et al 2015 as one of the important indicators to characterize the hydrodynamic conditions the hyporheic exchange flux hz flux can reflect the water exchange between sw and gw cranswick et al 2014 because heat is transported via hyporheic zone water hzw exchange observing the spatial and temporal fluctuation of hz temperature is an excellent technique for calculating hyporheic exchange velocity hz velocity and processes shih and wu 2020 suzuki suzuki 1960 and stallman stallman 1965 respectively developed the algebraic and analytical solutions of the one dimensional transient heat transport equation to compute the vertical hz flux using the periodic variated hz temperature at present the one dimensional analytical model has been widely utilized in the calculation and evaluation of regional sw and gw resources ju et al 2018 while more and more methods are being raised kalbus et al 2006 including the hydrochemical method ladouche and weng 2005 the permeability coefficient method landon et al 2001 the isotope tracing method su et al 2015 yin et al 2011 the numerical simulation method xie and batlle aguilar 2017 hydraulic gradient method chen et al 2014 etc the environmental characteristics within the hz shape not only the distribution transport and transformation of elements biehler et al 2020 but also the biological activity of enzymes in the hz graham et al 2018 li et al 2020 and then affect the hz biogeochemical processes zhu et al 2020 the hydrochemical composition of hz porewater fluctuates in a corresponding gradient owing to the combined effect of hydrodynamic and physicochemical in the hz which could be evaluated by the spatial and temporal variations in the hz main ions concentration this gradient change can assist to explain the formation and evolution of the hz porewater and determine the structure and extent of the hz engel et al 2019 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 xiao et al 2019 nitrate is a major pollutant in rivers that can cause eutrophication briggs et al 2014a hinshaw et al 2020 as well as a crucial component in river biogeochemical processes elisante and muzuka 2017 pittroff et al 2017 the hz plays a significate role in river nitrate transport which directly affect by dissolved oxygen do whereas hydrodynamic conditions affect do by influencing the hz internal environment hester et al 2014 it can propose countermeasures for the prevention and solution of nitrogen pollution in sw gw by evaluating nitrate transport in the hz in addition to investigating the biogeochemical processes in the hz harris et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2018 there are few studies on nitrate transport in specific regions especially in the hz where exist the sw gw interaction xiluodu reservoir is the third largest hydropower project in the world with a basin area of 454 400 km2 and has wide ecological impacts it is related to the fisheries agriculture and residents life across the basin especially the evolution of the ecological environment within the dam site area where the hz is an important component connecting sw and gw the evolution of the seepage hydrochemical characteristics of the hz also greatly affects the safety and stability of this large engineering such as the river valley contraction the dam foundation leakage and other engineering problems chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 the hz studies are mainly focused on large scale basin water and a certain moment but few of them study the evolution of the sw gw interaction in large reservoir dam site areas during a certain period zhou et al 2021 therefore this paper takes the xiluodu reservoir as a case study and aims to i clarify the hz extent hz exchange velocity and nitrate transport based on the isotope balance calculation water temperature tracing and exchange flux computation respectively ii determine the evolution of seepage hydrochemistry biological characteristics of the hz caused by large reservoir impoundment iii establish the foundation for the later study of river valley contraction and other engineering problems in the large reservoir area the research thoughts and approaches in the case study are not only suitable for the xiluodu reservoir but also applicable and instructive for the study of other similar large reservoirs 2 study area 2 1 project overview the xiluodu dam with a dam height of 285 5 m a control basin area of 454 400 km2 and a total reservoir capacity of 12 67 billion m3 is located on the jinsha river in the upper yangtze river bordering leibo county left bank sichuan province and yongshan county right bank yunnan province fig 1 the xiluodu reservoir impoundment began in november 2012 and firstly reached 540 m in june 2013 followed by the first stable impoundment level of 600 m in september 2014 the jinsha river has a nearly right angle turn at the doushaxi ditch in front of the dam fig 1 before impoundment the riverbed elevation and multi year average river level in the dam site area are around 357 m and 370 395 m respectively after impoundment the upstream reservoir and downstream river levels are between 540 600 m and 370 390 m respectively it is worth mentioning that the width of the downstream river remained constant after impoundment even though the impoundment increased the width of the upstream reservoir surface to about 490 m 2 2 geological conditions the dam area belongs to the leibo yongshan syncline basin which comprises three successive relative water resistant strata and three permeable strata they are the sand shale strata of the upper permian xuanwei formation p2x red claystone strata p2βn and silurian mud shale strata s the quaternary loose accumulation strata q emeishan basalt strata of the upper permian p2β and yangxin limestone strata of the upper permian maokou formation p1m respectively zhou et al 2022 the p2β strata is a 14 strata land phase basaltic volcanic flow with intermittent multi phase overflow with a total thickness of 490 520 m in the dam site area and is directly connected to the river reservoir the p1m and the s strata are primarily buried beneath the dam foundation with elevations typically less than 250 m and separated from the overlying p2β by p2βn strata the p2x and q strata are mainly above the basalt with the elevation usually exceeding 650 m none of the above four strata has a direct hydraulic connection with the jinsha river whose level is between 370 and 600 m before and after impoundment so they are not considered in this paper zhou et al 2021 the riverbed alluvium is generally about 15 20 m thick and its composition is mainly basalt in summary the main water storage medium in the dam site area hz is the basalt aquifer p2β 2 3 sampling and monitoring a comprehensive geological investigation was conducted at xiluodu reservoir from 1992 to 2000 56 sets of sw hzw and gw samples were collected by drilling from the riverbed and river banks in the dam site area with some samples locations shown in fig 2 blue points a total of 25 sets of sw upstream reservoir water usw downstream river water dsw hzw and gw samples were collected in two batches nearby from 2018 to 2021 with location in fig 2 red points the ph values of all the aforementioned samples were measured in situ using an acidic ph temperature measure instrument hi9124 hanna instrument while the portable water quality instrument multi3420 measured the total dissolved solid tds electrical conductance ec and dissolved oxygen do of samples and all measured values were averaged after three measurements the main hydrochemical components na k ca2 and mg2 were determined using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry while so 4 2 cl and no 3 were analyzed by ion chromatography lc 10a shimadzu hco 3 by titration with positive and negative charge balance errors less than 10 an lgr isotope analyzer was used to detect stable isotopes and the results were represented as the vienna mean standard for seawater vsmow in addition two long term monitoring points j11 1 j11 3 were installed in the upstream hz uhz and downstream hz dhz in 2010 respectively to monitor the hz water pressure and temperature for investigating the impoundment influence the seepage sensor gk4500s keikang usa and temperature sensor gk4400wp keikang usa were set at each of the deep and shallow sections of two monitoring locations and all data was transmitted to the central control system in real time via the fiber optic cable the dynamic changes in sw level and temperature are monitored from the hydrological observation stations upstream and downstream of the xiluodu reservoir 3 research methods 3 1 mapping the hyporheic zone mapping the hz extent is a prerequisite for evaluating the hz seepage and hydrochemical characteristics in the dam site area and the hz extent should consist of two dimensions the upper and lower boundary vertical and the extension width horizontal the current quantitative hz description is mainly based on triska s definition triska et al 1989 therefore the hzw can be determined by calculating whether the sw content in samples is between 10 and 98 engelhardt et al 2011 hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope content can reflect the mixing ratio of different water and is more stable and reliable than chemical ions so it is a good tracer to understand the origin and evolution of different water liu et al 2014 zhao and li 2017 zhou et al 2021 the stable isotope content in hzw mainly depends on the stable isotope content and mixing ratio of the two terminal water upper sw and lower gw so the mixing ratio of sw and gw at the sampling site can be inferred by the stable isotope content of collecting samples using the isotope mass balance equation below 1 δ 1 n 1 δ 2 n 2 δ n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 where δ 1 δ 2 and δ are the isotopic values δ 18o or δd in sw gw and samples respectively and η 1 and η 2 are the mixing ratios of sw and gw in the samples respectively by calculating the mixing ratio of all collected samples the hz extent in the dam site area can be quantified including the depth and width 3 2 calculating the hyporheic zone exchange flux the hydrodynamic conditions control the water exchange and mixing ratio between sw and gw the retention time and distribution patterns of materials and the physicochemical habitat characteristics within the hz deuerling et al 2018 therefore investigating the hz hydrodynamic characteristics is essential to clarify complex biogeochemical processes xie et al 2015 heat is a natural tracer that not only conducts diffusely through the hz medium but also convectively transports along with the hzw hence temperature tracer can be used to calculate the exchange velocity of sw hz interaction hyporheic exchange velocity zhang et al 2020 the heat exchange process in the hz can be described by a convective heat transfer model and the one dimensional heat transport model is established under the following assumptions i the water flow is parallel to the z axis vertical direction ii the thermal characteristics of the medium and water flow remain constant in both space and time iii the heat transfer occurs only in the z axis and iv the temperature of the water is always the same as that of the rock in contact the mathematical model of heat transport in the hz is as follows 2 λ e ρ c 2 t z 2 q ρ w c w ρ c t z t t where t is the temperature at depth z c t is time s z is the sediment depth m q is the flow velocity of porewater along the depth direction positive downward m s cw is the specific heat capacity per volume of water j kg c 1 c is the specific heat capacity per volume of the sediment j kg c 1 λe is the heat transfer coefficient of the sediment j s cm c 1 due to the complex structure of saturated porous media in the hz the hyporheic exchange has a high spatial variability vogt et al 2010 additionally the heat transport process is related to diurnal temperature difference seasonal temperature rainfall and snowfall vogt et al 2010 which makes eq 2 is more difficult to solve at present the representative analytical solutions of this model mainly include hatch solution hatch et al 2006 keery solution keery et al 2007 mccallum solution mccallum et al 2012 and luce solution luce et al 2013 the first two are the most widely used hatch established a time series analysis model using the amplitude decay and phase shift of the temperature time series curve to calculate the vertical hyporheic exchange velocity hatch et al 2006 the specific expressions are 3 q z a r c c w 2 κ e δ z ln a r α υ f 2 2 4 q z δ φ c c w α 2 4 π δ φ κ e p δ z 2 5 κ e λ e c λ sat c β v f 6 α v f 4 8 π κ e p 2 where q zar and q zδ φ are the vertical hyporheic exchange velocities calculated by the amplitude and phase methods respectively and δz is the spacing between the deep and shallow temperature monitoring points κe is the effective thermal diffusion coefficient of the saturated sediment λ sat is the thermal conductivity of the saturated sediment under static hydraulic conditions and β is the thermal dispersion coefficient a r and δφ are the amplitudes ratio and phase difference of the deep and shallow temperature time respectively α is the coefficient υ f is the transport speed of front temperature υ f qc w c keery neglected the thermal dispersion effect of heat transport within porous media keery et al 2007 considering that κe λ sat c in eq 5 and deducing that the analytical solution of eq 1 as 7 h 3 ln a r 4 δ z q z a r 3 5

the fluctuation amplitude phase lag and thermal dispersion and it can determine the magnitude and direction of the flow velocity with higher accuracy briggs et al 2014b both solutions include both amplitude and phase methods and numerous studies have shown that the two methods often fail to obtain consistent estimates irvine et al 2015 in contrast the amplitude method can estimate the velocities of both upward and downward flows with high applicability and fewer errors cuthbert and mackay 2013 in summary this paper uses the hatch amplitude method to calculate the hyporheic exchange velocity 3 3 determining the hyporheic zone no 3 fluxes evaluating no 3 transport in the hz can propose countermeasures for the prevention and solution of nitrogen pollution in sw gw harris et al 2022 lamontagne et al 2018 to quantify the no 3 hyporheic flux between hzw and sw and determine the migration and transformation processes of no 3 in the sw gw interaction the following equation was used for calculation 9 f net no 3 q c no 3 where fnet no 3 is the net no 3 flux between hzw and sw g d c no 3 is the no 3 concentration in the migrating sample sw in the downwelling and hzw in the upwelling g l q is the net flow flux between hzw and sw indicates downwelling indicates upwelling calculated using darcy s law l d the calculation of q is based on the water level of sw and hzw at the same moment with sampling 4 results 4 1 mapping the hyporheic zone before and after impoundment take the calculation before impoundment as an example according to the methods in section 3 1 it can be seen that each sample collected from underground is basically on both sides of the line with a relatively high correlation in the δ 18o δd figure fig 3 indicating that all underground samples are recharged by local water the δ 18o and δd values of the underground samples ranged between 10 24 to 7 93 and 77 00 to 55 10 respectively the δ 18o values of samples above 201 34 m varied substantially whereas the section below tended to remain stable indicating that the below section was mainly gw and the underground samples from the riverbed to 201 34 m were probably sw gw mixture that is possible hz extent according to eq 1 the mixing ratio of sw and gw at different sampling points was computed table 1 where the δ 18o and δd values of sw and gw were averaged as 14 33 104 60 8 48 58 3 respectively combining table 1 with the location of samples fig 2 it can be seen that the proportion of sw decreases as the sample elevation decreases while the opposite is true for groundwater the proportion of sw in the underground samples above 330 m is significantly greater than 10 which is considered hz according to definition while that below 320 m is significantly less than 10 which is gw therefore the hz lower boundary in the dam site area is between 320 and 330 m in elevation before impoundment since the multi year average river level is 370 395 m before impoundment the lateral riparian zone lrz below 395 m will also connect to the river and is the hz the hz upper boundary in the dam site area is 370 395 m the sw proportion in the hz of lrz is low compared with the same elevation samples under the riverbed table 1 mostly because the interaction between sw and hz weakens as moves away from the river bank causing the hz elevation to rise comparing fig 2 table 1 the proportion of sw at pd8 and pd82 which are about 125 m away from the river bank is slightly more than 10 indicating that the hz has extended to 125 m on both banks before impoundment in summary before impoundment it is determined that the hz upper and lower boundary is between 370 395 m and 320 330 m in elevation in the dam site area respectively with the horizontal direction extending almost 125 m from both banks after impoundment the reservoir water level fluctuates from 540 m to 600 m and the river width increases from 120 m to 490 m the upper boundary of uhz and dhz is 560 600 m and 370 390 m respectively the lower boundary of uhz and dhz is between 300 310 m and 320 328 m in elevation table 1 respectively according to the same computed method employed pre impoundment both indicate that the uhz was greatly expanded vertically while the dhz was almost unchanged the sw proportions in the uhz samples at 330 m elevation were 74 50 δd and 62 09 δ 18o which were much higher than that of samples in the same location before impoundment table 1 showing that the uhz increased vertically those in the dhz at 330 m elevation were 48 02 δd and 29 04 δ 18o which were the same as the corresponding positions before impoundment due to the limitation of site conditions the samples were concentrated in the reservoir area the calculation shows that the uhz horizontal direction extends at least 200 m from both original banks according to the collected samples while that of dhz is 166 m the increasing vertical extension of uhz is directly connected to the enhanced interaction between the reservoir water and the uhz water uhzw due to the raised reservoir level and the increased reservoir surface width 4 2 the hyporheic zone hydrodynamic characteristics before and after impoundment 4 2 1 the temperature tracing method using the temperature tracing method to calculate the hyporheic zone exchange zone is shown in section 3 2 this calculation was conducted by the vflux program which is the most widely used program for calculating the vertical hyporheic exchange velocity in the hz gordon et al 2012 the parameters required for the calculation process were mainly determined by field and indoor tests zhou et al 2022 the effective heat transfer coefficient λ sat thermal dispersion β specific heat capacity of water c w and sediment c and porosity of saturated sediment n are 0 00522 cal s cm c 1 0 001 m 1 kcal kg c 1 0 2084 kcal kg c 1 0 20 respectively to calculate the hz velocity between sw and hzw in the upstream and downstream of the dam site area before and after impoundment two temperature monitoring points were set up j11 1 j11 3 fig 2 the monitoring started in august 2010 so this calculation started on september 1 2010 which took as the t 0 t 0 d and may 31 2021 as the end of the calculation t 1 t 3193 d since the whole monitoring process takes too long too many data points may affect the calculation accuracy thus take the beginning of impoundment december 20 2012 as the cut off point and select three presentative periods for computation that is before impoundment june 9 2012 december 20 2012 after impoundment december 20 2012 february 5 2015 and stable impoundment cycle february 19 2019 may 5 2019 the calculation results are shown in fig 4 4 2 2 the hydrodynamic method darcy s law is employed to calculate the same period hyporheic exchange velocities from t 0 to t 1 based on the sw and hzw levels obtained from long term monitoring at j11 1 and j11 3 to verify the reliability of the temperature tracing method the sediment permeability coefficient in the uhz is 0 091 m d based on the field test results while that of the dhz decreased to 0 0085 m d due to sediment accumulation chen et al 2021 dam foundation impermeability curtain zhou et al 2022 the calculation results based on the hydraulic method are shown in fig 5 4 2 3 the hyporheic exchange velocity in different periods fig 4 shows that the uhz and dhz velocity in the dam site area before impoundment is between 0 008 0 03 and 0 002 0 009 m d respectively with dhz slower than uhz after impoundment t 950 d the uhz velocity starts to increase suddenly to 0 01 0 08 m d indicating that impoundment influences start to show up correspondingly the dhz velocity also starts to increase rapidly to 0 005 0 03 m d t 1300 d owing to the impoundment after six stable impoundment cycles t 3100 d the uhz and dhz velocity which is between 0 009 0 03 and 0 003 0 009 m d respectively all fall back to their pre impoundment values according to the temperature method the uhz and dhz velocities began to shift and increase dramatically at 100 and 450 days after the impoundment commenced december 20 2012 respectively and both of them have already returned to pre impoundment levels around 1320 days after the impoundment began fig 4 the hydraulic method further reveals that the uhz and dhz velocity start to decline slowly following the peak generated by impoundment and the uhz velocity gradually recovers to the pre impoundment level at roughly t 1750 d fig 5 while the dhz at around t 3200 d comparing fig 4 and fig 5 the two methods computation results are almost the same within the same magnitude and the changing trends of velocity in different locations and periods are virtually identical corroborating the dependability of the calculation results 4 3 the hyporheic zone biogeochemical characteristics before and after impoundment the hz environmental characteristics not only affect the present form and transport of elements but also influence the biological activity of enzymes which in turn affects the biogeochemical processes in the hz li et al 2020 therefore the study of the environmental and hydrochemical characteristics of hz porewater is the basis for an in depth study of the complex biogeochemical processes in the hz 4 4 temporal variation of major ion characteristics 1 before impoundment based on the hz extent determined in section 4 1 the piper diagrams of sw and hzw in the dam site area can be obtained fig 6 a sw and hzw have ph values of 7 9 and 7 8 respectively indicating that they are slightly alkaline their tds concentrations are 154 93 and 188 29 mg l respectively the hydrochemistry types of both sw and hzw are mainly hco3 ca mg fig 6a indicating that there is no obvious hydrochemistry evolutionary occurred during the sw hzw interaction before impoundment this is consistent with the gibbs diagram fig 7 demonstrates that the hydrochemistry of both sw and hzw is primarily driven by rock water dominance rwd rather than atmospheric precipitation dominance apd or evaporation concentration dominance ecd the γ na cl and γ hco 3 so 4 2 ca2 mg2 values in hzw are mostly larger than 0 fig 8 a and are mainly concentrated near the straight line y x while the opposite is true for sw in general indicating that cation exchange and adsorption cea is demonstrable in hzw and relatively weak in sw 2 after impoundment after impoundment the reservoir level rose by more than 200 m and the dam separated the dam site area into upstream and downstream parts cluster analysis was performed separately for the two batches of collected samples and revealed consistent results that all samples are divided into three main categories according to the hydrochemical characteristics fig 9 namely sw uhzw and dhz water dhzw the sw comprises upstream sw reservoir water usw and downstream sw river water dsw which have the similar hydrochemical features the ph values of usw dsw uhzw and dhzw were 8 02 8 06 8 09 and 8 12 which were marginally higher than pre impoundment the tds contents were 326 25 331 48 305 85 and 248 55 mg l respectively which were significantly higher than pre impoundment the hydrochemistry type of samples is more complicated as seen in fig 6 with usw and dsw both showing hco3 cl ca mg dhzw presenting hco3 ca and uhzw displaying hco3 ca na the dsw and usw properties after impoundment are essentially identical suggesting that the dsw is primarily recharged by dsw the disparities between dhzw uhzw and sw suggest that the hydrochemical properties evolved during the sw gw interaction and the degree of upstream and downstream consistency is not uniform the hydrochemistry of all water is still mainly impacted by rwd fig 10 but apd and ecd have a greater influence than pre impoundment the cea in the sw stays relatively weak uhzw is relatively weaker than pre impoundment while dhzw remains demonstrable fig 8 which corresponds to dhzw s larger na k concentration than uhzw fig 6 3 different seasons the hydrochemistry data in the dry season march april 2000 and the rainy season august 2000 were selected to study the hz hydrochemical features in different seasons fig 11 the ph of dry season hzw dry hzw and rainy season hzw rainy hzw were 7 51 and 8 15 respectively the tds content was 141 19 and 160 31 mg l both of which were higher in the rainy season which was mainly related to the elevated river level and significantly enhanced sw gw interaction in the rainy season the hydrochemistry type of dry and rainy hzw is hco3 ca mg fig 11a the dry hzw mainly falls in the first quadrant although not completely near the y x line while the rainy hzw primarily in the second quadrant fig 11b indicating that the stronger cea in the dry season which is consistent with the higher na k content in the dry hzw the contents of cl so 4 2 na and k in the hzw on the right bank are higher than left fig 11a which may be attributed to the stronger cea on the right bank fig 11b caused by the right angle turn at the doushaxi ditch fig 1 4 5 spatial variation of the major ion characteristics 1 the distance perpendicular to the river the hydrochemistry characteristics of hzw changed significantly in the direction perpendicular to the river fig 12 with the increase of distance from the bank the contents of ca2 mg2 and hco 3 in hzw decreased continuously the contents of k na increased gradually and the contents of cl and so 4 2 increased slightly this phenomenon is mainly due to increased water rock interaction wri and cea which makes ca2 and mg2 in hzw exchange k and na in the sediment the ca2 is exchanged into the sediment mainly in caco3 formation so the content of hco3 also decreases continuously it illustrates that away from the bank the association between sw and hzw declines as does the hz depth table 1 2 different burial depths fig 13 shows the main ion contents of hzw at different burial depths from top to bottom for p2β5 to p2β1 at the same location in general as depth increases the value of tds ca2 mg2 hco 3 na and so 4 2 of hzw all increase to different extents due to the enhanced wri and the lower gw recharge causing the difference between hzw and sw to gradually grow therefore as depth increases the correlation and interaction between sw and hzw both decline and the sw proportion in hzw eventually decrease to 10 indicating that the lower boundary of the hz has been reached while the porewater below the boundary is primarily dominated by gw the differences between the left and right banks are related to the basaltic strata tending to be downstream of the left bank in the dam area 3 the distance along the river before impoundment the main ion contents of hzw are close to each other along the river fig 14 indicating that the hzw is uniformly distributed along the river within the dam site area in contrast the characteristics of uhzw and dhzw after impoundment are somewhat different fig 6 fig 8 and both are different from the corresponding location pre impoundment indicating that impoundment has modified the regional hzw characteristics the distinction between uhzw and dhzw is due to artificial structures such as arch dams and impermeable curtains which weaken the formerly strong hydraulic connection between the upstream and downstream hz 4 6 characteristics and transport of no 3 in the hyporheic zone before impoundment the no 3 concentration in sw and hzw is between 2 5 5 5 and 4 7 mg l respectively with sw having a greater concentration fig 15 a the no 3 concentration in rainy hzw is 0 5 3 mg l larger than that in dry hzw and the no 3 concentration generally show a positive correlation with do content the difference in no 3 concentration between hzw and sw on the left and right bank is between 3 4 and 0 5 1 5 mg l respectively demonstrating stronger hydraulic interaction and connection between sw and hzw on the right bank after impoundment the no 3 concentration of sw and hzw ranged between 1 5 4 5 and 0 5 3 5 mg l respectively both smaller than pre impoundment particularly in hzw which was substantially lower fig 15b the no 3 concentration difference between hzw and sw upstream is between 0 5 1 mg l while that is 2 5 3 5 mg l downstream showing a better hydraulic connection between dsw and dhzw it is noteworthy that the greater do content in the rainy season with the lower no 3 concentration 0 5 2 5 mg l fig 15c illustrates the negative correlation between the no 3 concentration and do content since cl is conservative no 3 cl could be used to assist in discerning the concentration and dilution effects of water no 3 cl 1 indicates the concentrating effect and nitrification with no 3 increases and vice versa the ratio of samples was generally greater than 1 in the dry season and less than 1 in the rainy season fig 15 which also showed that the no 3 content was higher in the dry season in agreement with fig 15c the no 3 flux can be calculated by eq 9 as mentioned in section 3 3 since the content of hz expanded significantly after impoundment to better reflect the migration law the net no 3 flux calculated is the per area flux table 2 the entire dam site region should be separated into distinct zones to compare no 3 flux differences in different periods and locations it was divided using the dam axis area as the boundary which encompasses the area from the hyperbolic arch dam to the second dam dam axis figs 1 2 and upstream and downstream are determined respectively the same setting was utilized before impoundment owing to numerous hydroelectric buildings and seepage control structures the flux in the dam axis area after impoundment is not discussed before impoundment the river level is low in the dry season so the net no 3 flux is negative and vice versa table 2 in general the net no 3 flux diminishes steadily along the river after impoundment the reservoir level rises and it is continuously recharged hz so the net no 3 flux is always positive in both seasons which is consistent with the hzw velocity fig 4 because of the increased hyporheic exchange flow between sw and hzw the net no 3 flux rose dramatically after impoundment the upstream net no 3 flux is still larger than the downstream which is also related to the lower water level difference between dsw and dhzw both the no 3 per area flux table 2 and the hz extent increase fig 2 after impoundment suggesting that the no 3 net flux is substantially larger after impoundment than before 5 discussions the hz strata in the dam site area were determined to be the riverbed sedimentary layer and the basalt strata on both banks and below sedimentary based on the field tests and geological conditions which are derived from a vast number of boreholes fig 16 according to triska s definition the hz extent in the dam site area was quantitatively calculated by stable isotope δ 18o δd before impoundment the upper and lower boundary of hz is 370 395 and 320 330 m in elevation respectively with a horizontal width of 125 m from the river bank fig 1 fig 16 as the reservoir level rises after impoundment the width of the reservoir surface increases from the original 120 m to about 490 m making the horizontal width of the uhz and dhz extend to at least 200 and 166 m from the original river bank respectively similarly the elevated reservoir level increases the hydraulic gradient and connection between sw and hzw so the vertical hz depth also increases the upper and lower boundary of uhz is between 560 600 and 300 310 m in elevation respectively while that of the dhz ranges between 370 390 and 320 328 m the fluctuation of uhz and dhz is inconsistent because uhz is directly connected to usw whereas the connection between dhz and usw is through seepage around the dam or reservoir drainage the impoundment modifies the regional hydrogeological conditions which in turn alters the seepage field in the dam site area and the temperature and hydrochemistry fields in the seepage field are also transformed with it firstly the impoundment converts the seasonal mutual replenishment between sw hzw pre impoundment i e the alternating upwelling and downwelling to the continuous replenishment of sw to hzw which is always downwelling fig 16 continuous downwelling also leads to the positive value of net no 3 flux between sw hzw after impoundment table 2 secondly the raised reservoir level increased the seepage difference between sw hzw hence the hyporheic velocity of uhz and dhz increased substantially at about 100 d and 450 d after impoundment began december 20 2012 respectively fig 4 fig 5 thirdly because the hzw level rises continually with the reservoir s uninterrupted replenishment the seepage differential between sw hzw continues to decrease once the reservoir level reaches the stable cycle i e the reservoir level fluctuates periodically 540 600 m therefore the hyporheic velocity of uhz and dhz gradually returns to the same magnitude as pre impoundment and achieves a new stable state fig 5 both changes in the hyporheic velocity of uhz and dhz lag behind variations in reservoir level whereas the combined effect of the artificially impermeable structures as well as the sediment accumulation induced by the impoundment diminishes the originally intimate hydraulic connection between the uhzw and dhzw as a result the hyporheic velocity of dhzw had a more prominent hysteretic effect than the uhzw throughout both the initial rise and later fallback phases with the change of the seepage field the hydrochemical characteristics also change firstly the chemical characteristics ph tds ion content of sw and hzw are almost the same pre impoundment fig 6a showing a strong correlation because of the increasing hyporheic flow between sw hzw after impoundment the wri was continually reinforced causing the tds and each ion content of sw and hzw to climb to varying degrees fig 6b and the hydrochemistry types tend to be diverse secondly rwd was primarily responsible for the hydrochemistry of sw and hzw before impoundment fig 7 after impoundment the reservoir surface expanded and sw is subject to enhanced atmospheric precipitation and evapotranspiration resulting in increased ecd and apd effects in sw and hzw fig 10 in general the cea was consistently weak in sw but it is generally strong in hzw due to the wri fig 8 thirdly samples were categorized into sw and hzw because of minimal hydrochemistry differences between uhzw and dhzw before impoundment the dsw is primarily derived from the usw and has similar hydrochemistry after impoundment fig 6 therefore all samples were classified as the sw uhzw and dhzw fig 9 the uhzw primarily is recharged by usw with the high water level so the uhzw hydrochemistry is more usw while the dhzw is simultaneously affected by dsw and gw fig 8 therefore the uhzw and dhzw exhibit distinct evolutionary trends fourthly the main hydrochemistry of hzw before and after impoundment are strongly connected to the season depth of burial distance perpendicular to the river etc the closer to the rainy season the lower burial depth and the closer to the river bank the more similar hzw hydrochemistry is to sw and the more distinct it is from gw because the dam site area is only a small portion of the whole basin there is no evident association between the distance along the river and the hzw hydrochemistry in the dam site area as the impoundment not only the hydrochemistry field will change but also the biological field the riverbed is home to a diverse range of benthic animals whereas the hz is dominated by invertebrates and microbes that dwell in the pores of the sediments the water level difference between sw and hzw before impoundment has a seasonal effect i e alternating upwelling and downwelling fig 16 the downwelling carries oxygen nutrients organic matter and tiny invertebrates into the hz while upwelling can transfer nutrients to the riverbed which affects the primary productivity of algae and benthic community composition in the riverbed fig 16 as a result the alternating upwelling and downwelling stimulated biological activity in the riverbed and the hz resulting in positive and negative no 3 content table 2 fig 16 following impoundment the reservoir level rises and sw unidirectionally recharges hzw resulting in only downwelling as a response a substantial amount of oxygen invertebrates and microbes contained in sw flowed into the hz with the downwelling at the initial impoundment the organisms in the hz mostly conduct nitrification reactions with high do content causing the no 3 concentration to climb because of the substantial increase in the surface area of the pores requisite for microbial biological activities in the hz i e the increase in hz habitat the content and intensity of microbial activities are increasing because of the reduced do content caused by increased oxygen consumption for biological activities the organisms begin to convert to denitrification and the no 3 concentration drops fig 15 and the elemental n in the hz constantly escape in the form of nitrogen by denitrification the reservoir impoundment enables the downwelling to transport a significant number of microorganisms nutrients and oxygen into the hz in general hence enhancing the intensity of biological activities in the hz to some extent as shown in fig 16 the hz consists of the riverbed sedimentary and the shallow basalt but following impoundment the uhz comprises deeper and more basalt with more basalt and larger hz content the connecting surface of sw gw increases the hz lines in fig 16 meantime the increased water level difference between sw hzw accelerated the hyporheic flow velocity the larger connecting surface and hyporheic flow velocity mean more substance and energy exchange can transport from sw to hzw which ultimately exchange with gw as well as strengthened wri the transported sw which contains massive different ions and organisms and the strengthened wri lead to the evolution of the hydrochemistry of hz and make it takes on more biological habitat functions the basalt s low permeability and manmade water blocking constructions like dams and seepage curtains cause the weakened hydraulic connection and discontinuous seepage biogeochemistry fields of the uhz and dhz as the saturation line shows fig 16 the basalt aquifers below the water level of jinsha river are saturated pre impoundment the reservoir water level rises significantly within a short period post impoundment and the change of basalt water level on both banks is small due to the low permeability especially away from the bank the basalt water level will gradually grow to a certain amount in a vast region on both banks with the continuous impoundment i e the hz extent will develop further along with the increased saturated area of the basalt aquifer it is worth noting that the non sw component within the hz mainly comes from precipitation infiltration vadose zone water and leakage recharge due to the rise limestone level in summary before and after water impoundment there is a continuous and remarkable connection between sw and hzw including the comprehensive connection of seepage hydrochemistry and biological activities the impoundment impact the hydrogeological structures regional seepage field hydrochemistry characteristics of sw and hzw and the type and intensity of biological activities in the dam site area the evolution of these fields may also affect the safety and stability of the whole project for example the river valley contraction is closely related to the evolution of the regional seepage field of the hz 6 conclusions this paper investigates the characteristics and evolution of the seepage field temperature hydrochemical and biological field of sw hzw and gw in the xiluodu dam site area before and after impoundment based on various methods such as temperature tracing hydrodynamic cluster analysis and stable isotopes mass balance the sw hzw interaction is quantitatively investigated the research thoughts and methods used in this case will be helpful and applicable to other comparable large reservoirs the main conclusions are as follows 1 after impoundment the hz expands vertically and horizontally to the deeper riverbed and lateral riparian zone respectively especially the uhz 2 the sw hzw interaction in the dam site area changes from alternating upwelling and downwelling to continuous downwelling according to the hyporheic flow velocity and no 3 flux the hyporheic velocity between sw and hzw increases about three times after the initial impoundment and then fallback gradually based on the temperature tracing method using the monitored sw hzw temperature during both the initial rising and subsequent descent stages the change in hyporheic velocity of dhzw lags behind that of uhzw 3 the ph tds and ions contents of sw and hzw increased significantly after impoundment and the hydrochemistry type also changed the division of hzw changed from one category pre impoundment to two categories post impoundment uhzw and dhzw due to upstream and downstream discontinuity caused by artificial facilities the hydrochemistry of sw and hzw used to be mainly controlled by rwd while it evolved toward ecd and apd post impoundment the hzw hydrochemistry is strongly related to the season burial depth and distance perpendicular to the river but not to distance along river 4 the net no 3 flow between sw and hzw rises the enlarged hz pore surface area following impoundment enhances the intensity of biological processes in the hz which shifts from nitrification at the initial impoundment to denitrification at the later stage credit authorship contribution statement ziwen zhou methodology data curation writing original draft writing review editing zhifang zhou
