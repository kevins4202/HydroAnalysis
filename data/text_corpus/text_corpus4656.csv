allowed for the comparison of the measurements results with generally accepted empirical prediction methods and confirmed the utility of the developed measuring setup for the on line monitoring of jet induced loads the conclusions from the research are focused on the strengths and limitations of the presented measuring method and its applicability for the on line monitoring of loads induced by bow thrusters on seabed protection along the quay wall keywords bow thruster jet full scale measurements 1 introduction the bow thruster induced wash is the reason of degradation processes of the seabed and seabed protections situated along the quay wall the sediments movement and relocation of seabed protection elements reduce the under keel clearance and in case of large damages can affect the stability of the quay wall these phenomena are normally included in design processes and should be introduced in complex safety assessment methods of ship and port operation gerigk 2015 rutkowski 2016 santos et al 2014 bow thruster wash is important in shallow inland waterways lake and river harbours with dynamic changes of depths in modernized sea ports a growing number of high powered big vessels operated in confined areas increase the importance of vessels impact on port constructions with significant share of the propeller and thruster jet induced wash very large container vessels can perform manoeuvres in very tight areas in strong weather conditions up to the port operational limits using their thrusters and propellers to increase the efficiency of manoeuvres assisted by tug boats the average bow thruster power of most widely operated self manoeuvring vessels like ferries in terms of the projected windage area is assumed from 0 5 kw m2 to 0 96 kw m2 which for 150 m 170 m in length ferry gives usually bow thrusters power about 2 1200 kw the ultra large container ships over 8000 teu twenty feet equivalent unit 300 400 m in length are equipped with several 2000 3500 kw thrusters the power of bow thrusters installed on cruise vessels can reach 5500 kw wartsila 2016 the outflow velocity is proportional to the cube root of the applied power which means that the outflow velocities can reach several m s different types of seabed protection are used to prevent negative effects of stress fluctuations on the surface layer of the seabed pianc 2015 ship masters should comply with the requirements related to operational limits for the propellers and thrusters power used during port manoeuvers dependent on the seabed resistance to scoring or damage the limits can be exceeded in emergency cases when all available means can be used to ensure ship safety the more precise estimation of berthing and unberthing loads closer to their real values allows accepting fewer restrictions for propeller and thruster power used during manoeuvres the higher limits mean the widening of an operational window for self manoeuvring and decrease of the operational costs related to the tug boats assistance there are several empirical methods commonly used for the prediction of a jet velocity distribution the existing design guidelines provide the useful empirical formulae but some modern vessels like large containerships are out of the range of the conservative solutions http www pianc org edits articleshop php id 2015180 pianc 2015 the empirical methods and simplified cfd simulations of seabed scoring are based on main parameters of propellers and thrusters not considering the actual characteristics what can be also a reason for the uncertainty in thrust assessment especially important for inland vessels skupien and prokopowicz 2014 jachowski 2008 the assessment of possible jet induced damages is dependent on the available information of exceedance of jet velocity limits and underwater bed inspection the online monitoring of jet velocities can be a good solution to reduce the risk of serious damages of a berth construction and seabed protection sensitive to the jet wash the full scale on line measurements presented in the paper allowed studying the pressure field induced by bow thrusters of a berthing and unberthing vessel on the quay wall the direct measurements of the jet wash on the seabed were not possible due to the likely damage of instruments however the pressure induced on the quay wall can be converted into the jet velocity over the seabed using empirical methods or cfd simulation the available empirical methods are analysed in the paper to choose a model which could be implemented in the development of an online monitoring system 2 full scale measurements of the effective bow thruster jet pressure on the quay wall during unberthing the measurements of the effective bow thruster jet induced pressure on the tight vertical wall during berthing and unberthing operations allowed studying the phenomena related to the decay and reflection of the bow thruster jet in real conditions the presented summary is based on the selected measurements collected in port of gdynia the measurements were analysed to recognise the highest values of jet velocities generated by a ro pax ferry during her operation the

values of the dynamic pressure less than 2 5 kpa the highest measured values of jet velocities on the quay wall about 8 kpa corresponding to the flow velocity 4 m s were observed during unberthing operations the two selected unberthing manoeuvres u1 and u2 representative for the manoeuvres with the highest collected pressure values are discussed in the paper 2 1 experimental setup for full scale measurements the research was conducted at helskie ii berth in port of gdynia the scheme of the underwater part of experimental setup with indicated location of measuring instruments pm on the quay wall is presented in fig 1 the measuring system was composed of pressure sensors piezo resistive pressure transmitters 131s ii placed in the watertight casings integrated with the advanced electronic system microprocessor control system and communication module allowing for two step measurements the first step was the measurement and acquisition of the static pressure related to the depth of each pressure sensor this measurement was followed by the transition of the system to the auto calibration status resulting with the change of a reference point to the static pressure value locally measured for each sensor in the second step the measurements were taken for each pressure sensor from zero independently of the static pressure at its depth under the water surface giving the increased accuracy of measurements the measuring transducer range of static pressure was 0 300 kpa the measuring range of dynamic pressures was 125 pa 50 kpa with acc 0 1 fs the signal from the analogue sensor was converted into the digital form using a d converter to decrease disturbances and increase transmission distance the assumed minimum value recognised by the measuring system was 10 pa resulting from one level of the a d converter and 100 pa with the satisfactory level of measurements repeatability the finally accepted assumption was the measurement range of 100 pa 250 kpa with the accuracy of measurement equal to100 pa giving 0 1 relative percentage error the frequency of measurements was 2 hz and synchronization deviation of the system was 5 ms the underwater support structure abramowicz gerigk and burciu 2014 was a system of the 8 vertical stainless steel segmented pipes 8 pressure sensors were installed on each pipe with equal intervals between them and equipped with cables for power supply and communication the pipes were fixed to the ridges of larssen sheet piles with the screw pins the layout of sensors of the experimental setup installed on the quay wall is presented in fig 2 a part of the larssen sheet pile wall at the right side is marked with vertical lines to show the ridges the pressure sensors are marked as the nodes of the grid composed of 8 columns and 8 rows the perpendicular projections of the bow thrusters outlets are marked as the circles on the quay wall the seabed protection is divided into rectangular elements presenting the sand filled geotextile bags 2 2 laboratory tests of the measuring system the full scale tests were carried out in the towing tank of ship design and research centre in gdansk to confirm the correct operation of the system control the system stability and repeatability of measurements the pressure sensors were installed on the pole attached to the tow bridge the measuring surfaces of the sensors were directed towards the tow bridge motion they were positioned at the selected water depths 0 1 m 0 25 m and 0 35 m ensuring the uninterrupted measurements the results of an example measurement

pressure v m s is the flow velocity the diagram showing the difference between the dynamic pressure values measured during the tests and calculated from bernoulli eq 2 is presented in fig 4 the observed relative percentage error was less than 5 2 p 0 5 œÅ v 2 where v m s is the flow velocity œÅ 1000 kg m3 is the water density 2 3 full scale field measurements of bow thruster jet induced pressure the flow induced during unberthing of m f stena baltica observed on the free surface at helskie ii berth in port of gdynia is presented in fig 5 the unsteady turbulent flow generated by bow thrusters near the quay wall is the cause of pressure oscillations periodical in a short time of constant settings of bow thrusters the oscillations are considered as the main cause of braking of the polypropylene ropes connecting sand filled bags of seabed protection the turbulent events such as eddies and turbulent bursting play a critical role in the sediment scouring and transport the collected pressure distribution is dependent on the flow direction near the wall the sensors positioned perpendicular to the wall can measure the total pressure corresponding to the water velocity velocity components perpendicular to the wall give the positive readings above the static pressure value corresponding to the water depth level the velocity components lateral to the wall cause the pressure decrease and negative readings below the pressure values corresponding to the water depth level the time histories of pressure generated on the quay wall collected during unberthing manoeuvre u1 are presented in a separate drawing for each from 8 columns ci i 1 8 of 8 pressure sensors pmj j 1 8 fig 6 the most frequent unberthing procedure of a ferry was a combination of transverse and forward ship motion the significant pressure values were collected in column c6 at sensors pm2 pm3 and pm4 in front of the outlet opening of working bow thruster bt1 at the beginning of the manoeuvre and in columns c7 and c8 when the ship started to move forward no pressure changes were observed in column c1 negative values about 4 kpa were collected in columns c2 and c3 after 10 s of the manoeuvre the lower values about 6 kpa were observed in columns c4 and c5 just at the beginning of the manoeuvre and they increased to 2 kpa after 15 s when the ship moved forward 3d distribution of pressure field in successive seconds t 3 5 s and t 7 s during unberthing manoeuvre u1 is presented in fig 7 the time history of pressure generated on the quay wall collected during unberthing manoeuvre u2 is presented in fig 8 the significant values were collected at the beginning of the manoeuvre in front of working bow thruster bt2 in columns c3 and c4 for the sensors pm4 about 6 kpa pm2 and pm3 about 4 kpa the area of higher pressures decreased to 4 kpa appears at column 5 after 40 s due to the forward ship motion ship movement was also the reason of negative pressure collected in columns c7 and c8 3d distribution of the pressure field in successive seconds of the unberthing manoeuvre u2 is presented in fig 9 the maximum and minimum dynamic pressure values collected during several unberthing manoeuvres are presented in fig 10 their absolute values are corresponding to the flow velocities from 0 to 5 m s 3 applicability of the empirical methods for the prediction of the bed velocities produced by bow thruster three values and their relations are crucial when calculating velocities behind a working propeller efflux velocity longitudinal decay and radial decay of axial velocity different empirical methods presented in the literature can be used to calculate these values all dividing the description of propeller velocities in two regions i e zone of flow establishment and zone of established flow hamill 1987 3 1 efflux velocity the proper prediction and estimation of outflow velocities from the bow thruster may be based on the assumption that a bow thruster is sufficiently represented by a ducted propeller in such a situation first step in the calculation of bed velocities caused by bow thruster wash should be the estimation of flow velocity directly in front of the outflow opening of the bow thruster assuming uniform and undisturbed flow velocity across the thruster cross section the volumetric flow may be determined by eq 3 3 q u 0 œÄ 4 d p 2 where q is the volumetric flow m3 s u 0 is the initial flow velocity in front of the bow thruster m s d p is the bow thruster propeller diameter m the initial flow velocity from eq 3 can be derived from the energy balance in eq 4 4 p d 1 2 œÅ w u 0 2 q where p d is the bow thruster generated power w œÅ w is the water density kg m3 combining equations 3 and 4 the resultant formula for calculation of the initial flow velocity u0 in front of a bow thruster may be written a follows 5 u 0 1 37 p d œÅ w d p 2 1 3 from a practical point of view it is more suitable to transform eq 5 to the form including the bow thruster diameter dbt 6 usually the bow thruster diameter is about 2 5 larger than the propeller diameter 6 d b t 1 02 1 05 d p eq 5 may be transformed to eq 7 7 u 0 1 41 p d œÅ w d b t 2 1 3 it should be also noted that two factors reducing the efflux velocity have to be taken into account energy loss coefficient and thrust loss coefficient actually it is not possible to estimate both factors properly however based on experiments blaauw and van de kaa 1978 the most common formula to calculate the efflux velocity including losses is presented in eq 8 8 u 0 1 15 p d œÅ w d b t 2 1 3 the formula recommended by the committee for waterfront structures harbours and waterways recommendations of the committee for waterfront structures harbours and waterways eau 2012 2015 contains a different constant factor equal to 1 04 instead of 1 15 giving 10 less values of u0 flow velocities in transverse thruster jets in the design practice are often calculated according to german and dutch methods these two methods may give different results in the determination of the flow velocities and they are used as the comprehensive design methods pianc 2015 of necessary bed protections 3 2 longitudinal decay of axial velocity since the beginning of research on the propeller jet velocity different approaches to the issue of longitudinal decay of the axial velocity have been presented the difference between the methods is the assumed length of the zone of flow establishment where the jet velocity is constant and consequently the mathematical description of the velocity decay in the zone with established flow albertson et al 1950 assumed the length of the zone of flow establishment as 6 2 propeller diameters berger et al 1981 as one propeller diameter verhey 1983 1 5 propeller diameters hamill 1987 2 propeller diameters with a transition phase between 0 35 and 2 propeller diameters the generally accepted methods recommended by pianc pianc 2015 and used in practice called german method fuehrer and r√∂misch 1977 and dutch method blaauw and van de kaa 1978 estimate the zone of flow establishment as 2 6 and 2 8 propeller diameters respectively stewart 1992 and hashmi 1993 in their latest research propose a value of 3 25 propeller diameters as the end of the zone of flow establishment while lam et al 2011 suggested 3 68 propeller diameters in most of the cases the proposed description for the maximum axial velocity in the zone of established flow may be written according to eq 9 9 u m a x u 0 c 0 c 1 x d p c 2 where ct is the thrust coefficient Œ≤ is the blade area ratio p is the pitch ratio equal to propeller pitch related to the propeller diameter table 2 presents the values of coefficients c0 c1 and c2 of eq 9 proposed by different authors hashmi 1993 presented another way to describe the axial velocity decay using an exponential equation eq 10 10 u m a x u 0 0 638 e 0 097 x d p 3 3 radial decay of axial velocity it is assumed that the radial decay of axial velocity has a normal gaussian distribution around the axis and is valid only in the zone of established flow the equation for radial decay has therefore the following form 11 u x r u m a x exp 1 2 c r 2 r 2 x 2 where r is the radial distance to the propeller axis table 3 presents the radial decay of axial velocity at the propeller radius r equal to half propeller diameter and distance from the bow thrusters x equal to 0 4 b for bow thrusters bt1 and bt2 calculated with different methods the radial decay of axial velocity is about 90 only in the method proposed by albertson et al 1950 is about 50 3 4 quay wall and bed velocities when a bow thruster assumed as the ducted propeller is directed towards a quay wall the water jet strikes the wall directly and is deflected from this area in all directions the five zones of flow distinguished by schmidt 2000 are presented in fig 11 the bow thruster jet observed in cfd simulation is presented in fig 12 the jet velocity in the zone of flow establishment zone 1 is assumed as u m a x u 0 in zone 2 i e zone of established flow the equations presented in paragraphs 2 1 2 3 may be used to predict the jet velocities the equation describing jet velocity in zone 2 is valid for the distance up to 0 7 l where l is the distance between bow thruster outlet opening and quay wall because of the velocity decrease when jet is approaching the wall zone 3 where the jet hits the wall is called the pressure zone since the kinetic energy is converted into pressure which finds its maximum where the velocity is zero the conversion of the flow velocity to pressure takes place over a distance of 0 3 l in front of the wall zone 4 radial wall jet zone is characterised by the conversion of the pressure back to kinetic energy flowing radially from the pressure point at the distance of 0 3 l the flow velocity reaches its maximum again according to r√∂misch 1975 the loss of velocity during the change of flow direction due to the wall is negligible the velocity in zone 5 i e at the bottom is therefore equal to the velocity just in front of the quay wall introducing the dimension l in eq 9 and using the most common value proposed by schmidt 2000 the axial velocity of the jet induced by the bow thruster may be calculated according to eq 12 used in german method pianc 2015 12 u m a x u 0 1 9 l d p 1 0 the maximum velocity at the seabed in front of the quay wall 13 u max s e a b e d u 0 Œ± 1 9 l d p 1 0 where Œ± is the correction factor of value between 0 and 1 dependent on l dp ratio and z the distance between the propeller axis and seabed pianc 2015 eq 13 can be used when l dp is in the range between 3 and 8 in other cases eq 12 should be applied the dutch method compiled from the studies done by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 verhey 1983 blokland and smedes 1996 recommend eq 14 to calculate the maximum velocity caused by bow thruster jet at the bottom 14 u max s e a b e d u 0 2 8 z l d p 1 0 both german and dutch methods should be used as complete design procedures independently pianc 2015 report does not distinguish any formula however for vessels with bow thrusters situated close to the quay wall like inland cargo vessels german method gives more than twice bigger bed velocities than dutch method 4 indirect method of monitoring the seabed velocities generated by bow thrusters near the quay wall the absolute maximum and mean dynamic pressure values measured during the experiments presented in paragraph 2 3 in the area where the turbulent jet hits the wall in zone 3 are about 8 kpa and 4 kpa respectively the related velocities are 4 m s and 2 8 m s the mean pressure value obtained from full scale measurements on the on the quay velocity related to this pressure assumed as bed velocity initial velocities u0 bt1 and u0 bt2 for bt1 and bt2 thrusters accordingly velocities calculated at the distance l 0 4 b measured from the bow thruster outlet opening to the wall and z 0 9 t distance between the bow thruster axis and seabed using both german and dutch methods are presented in table 4 the bed velocities calculated using german method for transverse thrusters are equal 2 88 m s and 2 25 m s for bt1 and bt2 accordingly the same values obtained using dutch method are equal to 2 74 m s and 2 15 m s there is a good agreement of empirical prediction and full scale measurement for the measured mean values the maximum pressure values observed during a few seconds of the manoeuvres u1 and u2 were about 8 kpa for bt1 and 7 kpa for bt2 the corresponding velocities are 4 m s and 3 74 m s accordingly the difference of 1 m s is not significant if we assume the seabed protection designed for 7 m s velocities considering high powered bow thrusters of 5000 kw in shallow water the predicted bed velocities using empirical methods are over 5 m s and related dynamic pressure is about 14 kpa the temporary pressure increase should be recognised as it could be a reason of seabed protection damage by jets with more than 7 m s velocity 4 1 compensation of external disturbances the procedure of measuring system calibration presented in paragraph 2 1 allowed to set the initial value of total pressure equal to zero before a measurement this is the correct procedure in calm water conditions for the single measurements however for the long time online monitoring all disturbing phenomena should be considered the small changes of pressure due to water level changes at the quay wall observed before the manoeuvre u2 are presented in fig 13 the small disturbances as small waves presented in fig 13 can be neglected however 1 m change of water level magnitude is the reason of 10 kpa pressure change corresponding to 4 5 m s of flow velocity when the dynamic pressure value is considered the scheme of the module detecting a crossing of the warning limit to be implemented in the online monitoring system for loads generated on the quay wall and seabed protection is presented in fig 14 the important phenomena influencing pressure measurements at the quay wall are changes related to the water level and flow velocity influenced by tides wind waves ship waves swell natural water currents tidal currents or groundwater flow out near the quay wall the first system calibration allows taking into account hydrostatic pressure and periodically changed phenomena the velocity profile of tide waves can be input directly as a time history of water level and velocity of tidal current at a place of measurement the introduction of online corrections to the measurements should be based on on line readings and time history of measurements to determine the character of changes for example the water level change means the same change of pressure value at each sensor in the same column in case of the natural groundwater flow it should be superposed with natural current velocities based on the direction of the flow and input into the calibration module 5 conclusions the loads monitoring system presented in the paper should allow for the detection of all emergency situations when ship master uses the power of thrusters above the permissible limits this is the most important factor in the prediction of the condition of seabed protections in the form of a mattress of geotextile sand filled bags it can save maintenance cost related to the replacement of a wide area of damaged elements and allows avoiding the maintenance delays in operation of the berth acknowledgement this work was supported by the

manoeuvre the lower values about 6 kpa were observed in columns c4 and c5 just at the beginning of the manoeuvre and they increased to 2 kpa after 15 s when the ship moved forward 3d distribution of pressure field in successive seconds t 3 5 s and t 7 s during unberthing manoeuvre u1 is presented in fig 7 the time history of pressure generated on the quay wall collected during unberthing manoeuvre u2 is presented in fig 8 the significant values were collected at the beginning of the manoeuvre in front of working bow thruster bt2 in columns c3 and c4 for the sensors pm4 about 6 kpa pm2 and pm3 about 4 kpa the area of higher pressures decreased to 4 kpa appears at column 5 after 40 s due to the forward ship motion ship movement was also the reason of negative pressure collected in columns c7 and c8 3d distribution of the pressure field in successive seconds of the unberthing manoeuvre u2 is presented in fig 9 the maximum and minimum dynamic pressure values collected during several unberthing manoeuvres are presented in fig 10 their absolute values are corresponding to the flow velocities from 0 to 5 m s 3 applicability of the empirical methods for the prediction of the bed velocities produced by bow thruster three values and their relations are crucial when calculating velocities behind a working propeller efflux velocity longitudinal decay and radial decay of axial velocity different empirical methods presented in the literature can be used to calculate these values all dividing the description of propeller velocities in two regions i e zone of flow establishment and zone of established flow hamill 1987 3 1 efflux velocity the proper prediction and estimation of outflow velocities from the bow thruster may be based on the assumption that a bow thruster is sufficiently represented by a ducted propeller in such a situation first step in the calculation of bed velocities caused by bow thruster wash should be the estimation of flow velocity directly in front of the outflow opening of the bow thruster assuming uniform and undisturbed flow velocity across the thruster cross section the volumetric flow may be determined by eq 3 3 q u 0 œÄ 4 d p 2 where q is the volumetric flow m3 s u 0 is the initial flow velocity in front of the bow thruster m s d p is the bow thruster propeller diameter m the initial flow velocity from eq 3 can be derived from the energy balance in eq 4 4 p d 1 2 œÅ w u 0 2 q where p d is the bow thruster generated power w œÅ w is the water density kg m3 combining equations 3 and 4 the resultant formula for calculation of the initial flow velocity u0 in front of a bow thruster may be written a follows 5 u 0 1 37 p d œÅ w d p 2 1 3 from a practical point of view it is more suitable to transform eq 5 to the form including the bow thruster diameter dbt 6 usually the bow thruster diameter is about 2 5 larger than the propeller diameter 6 d b t 1 02 1 05 d p eq 5 may be transformed to eq 7 7 u 0 1 41 p d œÅ w d b t 2 1 3 it should be also noted that two factors reducing the efflux velocity have to be taken into account energy loss coefficient and thrust loss coefficient actually it is not possible to estimate both factors properly however based on experiments blaauw and van de kaa 1978 the most common formula to calculate the efflux velocity including losses is presented in eq 8 8 u 0 1 15 p d œÅ w d b t 2 1 3 the formula recommended by the committee for waterfront structures harbours and waterways recommendations of the committee for waterfront structures harbours and waterways eau 2012 2015 contains a different constant factor equal to 1 04 instead of 1 15 giving 10 less values of u0 flow velocities in transverse thruster jets in the design practice are often calculated according to german and dutch methods these two methods may give different results in the determination of the flow velocities and they are used as the comprehensive design methods pianc 2015 of necessary bed protections 3 2 longitudinal decay of axial velocity since the beginning of research on the propeller jet velocity different approaches to the issue of longitudinal decay of the axial velocity have been presented the difference between the methods is the assumed length of the zone of flow establishment where the jet velocity is constant and consequently the mathematical description of the velocity decay in the zone with established flow albertson et al 1950 assumed the length of the zone of flow establishment as 6 2 propeller diameters berger et al 1981 as one propeller diameter verhey 1983 1 5 propeller diameters hamill 1987 2 propeller diameters with a transition phase between 0 35 and 2 propeller diameters the generally accepted methods recommended by pianc pianc 2015 and used in practice called german method fuehrer and r√∂misch 1977 and dutch method blaauw and van de kaa 1978 estimate the zone of flow establishment as 2 6 and 2 8 propeller diameters respectively stewart 1992 and hashmi 1993 in their latest research propose a value of 3 25 propeller diameters as the end of the zone of flow establishment while lam et al 2011 suggested 3 68 propeller diameters in most of the cases the proposed description for the maximum axial velocity in the zone of established flow may be written according to eq 9 9 u m a x u 0 c 0 c 1 x d p c 2 where ct is the thrust coefficient Œ≤ is the blade area ratio p is the pitch ratio equal to propeller pitch related to the propeller diameter table 2 presents the values of coefficients c0 c1 and c2 of eq 9 proposed by different authors hashmi 1993 presented another way to describe the axial velocity decay using an exponential equation eq 10 10 u m a x u 0 0 638 e 0 097 x d p 3 3 radial decay of axial velocity it is assumed that the radial decay of axial velocity has a normal gaussian distribution around the axis and is valid only in the zone of established flow the equation for radial decay has therefore the following form 11 u x r u m a x exp 1 2 c r 2 r 2 x 2 where r is the radial distance to the propeller axis table 3 presents the radial decay of axial velocity at the propeller radius r equal to half propeller diameter and distance from the bow thrusters x equal to 0 4 b for bow thrusters bt1 and bt2 calculated with different methods the radial decay of axial velocity is about 90 only in the method proposed by albertson et al 1950 is about 50 3 4 quay wall and bed velocities when a bow thruster assumed as the ducted propeller is directed towards a quay wall the water jet strikes the wall directly and is deflected from this area in all directions the five zones of flow distinguished by schmidt 2000 are presented in fig 11 the bow thruster jet observed in cfd simulation is presented in fig 12 the jet velocity in the zone of flow establishment zone 1 is assumed as u m a x u 0 in zone 2 i e zone of established flow the equations presented in paragraphs 2 1 2 3 may be used to predict the jet velocities the equation describing jet velocity in zone 2 is valid for the distance up to 0 7 l where l is the distance between bow thruster outlet opening and quay wall because of the velocity decrease when jet is approaching the wall zone 3 where the jet hits the wall is called the pressure zone since the kinetic energy is converted into pressure which finds its maximum where the velocity is zero the conversion of the flow velocity to pressure takes place over a distance of 0 3 l in front of the wall zone 4 radial wall jet zone is characterised by the conversion of the pressure back to kinetic energy flowing radially from the pressure point at the distance of 0 3 l the flow velocity reaches its maximum again according to r√∂misch 1975 the loss of velocity during the change of flow direction due to the wall is negligible the velocity in zone 5 i e at the bottom is therefore equal to the velocity just in front of the quay wall introducing the dimension l in eq 9 and using the most common value proposed by schmidt 2000 the axial velocity of the jet induced by the bow thruster may be calculated according to eq 12 used in german method pianc 2015 12 u m a x u 0 1 9 l d p 1 0 the maximum velocity at the seabed in front of the quay wall 13 u max s e a b e d u 0 Œ± 1 9 l d p 1 0 where Œ± is the correction factor of value between 0 and 1 dependent on l dp ratio and z the distance between the propeller axis and seabed pianc 2015 eq 13 can be used when l dp is in the range between 3 and 8 in other cases eq 12 should be applied the dutch method compiled from the studies done by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 verhey 1983 blokland and smedes 1996 recommend eq 14 to calculate the maximum velocity caused by bow thruster jet at the bottom 14 u max s e a b e d u 0 2 8 z l d p 1 0 both german and dutch methods should be used as complete design procedures independently pianc 2015 report does not distinguish any formula however for vessels with bow thrusters situated close to the quay wall like inland cargo vessels german method gives more than twice bigger bed velocities than dutch method 4 indirect method of monitoring the seabed velocities generated by bow thrusters near the quay wall the absolute maximum and mean dynamic pressure values measured during the experiments presented in paragraph 2 3 in the area where the turbulent jet hits the wall in zone 3 are about 8 kpa and 4 kpa respectively the related velocities are 4 m s and 2 8 m s the mean pressure value obtained from full scale measurements on the on the quay velocity related to this pressure assumed as bed velocity initial velocities u0 bt1 and u0 bt2 for bt1 and bt2 thrusters accordingly velocities calculated at the distance l 0 4 b measured from the bow thruster outlet opening to the wall and z 0 9 t distance between the bow thruster axis and seabed using both german and dutch methods are presented in table 4 the bed velocities calculated using german method for transverse thrusters are equal 2 88 m s and 2 25 m s for bt1 and bt2 accordingly the same values obtained using dutch method are equal to 2 74 m s and 2 15 m s there is a good agreement of empirical prediction and full scale measurement for the measured mean values the maximum pressure values observed during a few seconds of the manoeuvres u1 and u2 were about 8 kpa for bt1 and 7 kpa for bt2 the corresponding velocities are 4 m s and 3 74 m s accordingly the difference of 1 m s is not significant if we assume the seabed protection designed for 7 m s velocities considering high powered bow thrusters of 5000 kw in shallow water the predicted bed velocities using empirical methods are over 5 m s and related dynamic pressure is about 14 kpa the temporary pressure increase should be recognised as it could be a reason of seabed protection damage by jets with more than 7 m s velocity 4 1 compensation of external disturbances the procedure of measuring system calibration presented in paragraph 2 1 allowed to set the initial value of total pressure equal to zero before a measurement this is the correct procedure in calm water conditions for the single measurements however for the long time online monitoring all disturbing phenomena should be considered the small changes of pressure due to water level changes at the quay wall observed before the manoeuvre u2 are presented in fig 13 the small disturbances as small waves presented in fig 13 can be neglected however 1 m change of water level magnitude is the reason of 10 kpa pressure change corresponding to 4 5 m s of flow velocity when the dynamic pressure value is considered the scheme of the module detecting a crossing of the warning limit to be implemented in the online monitoring system for loads generated on the quay wall and seabed protection is presented in fig 14 the important phenomena influencing pressure measurements at the quay wall are changes related to the water level and flow velocity influenced by tides wind waves ship waves swell natural water currents tidal currents or groundwater flow out near the quay wall the first system calibration allows taking into account hydrostatic pressure and periodically changed phenomena the velocity profile of tide waves can be input directly as a time history of water level and velocity of tidal current at a place of measurement the introduction of online corrections to the measurements should be based on on line readings and time history of measurements to determine the character of changes for example the water level change means the same change of pressure value at each sensor in the same column in case of the natural groundwater flow it should be superposed with natural current velocities based on the direction of the flow and input into the calibration module 5 conclusions the loads monitoring system presented in the paper should allow for the detection of all emergency situations when ship master uses the power of thrusters above the permissible limits this is the most important factor in the prediction of the condition of seabed protections in the form of a mattress of geotextile sand filled bags it can save maintenance cost related to the replacement of a wide area of damaged elements and allows avoiding the maintenance delays in operation of the berth acknowledgement this work was supported by the

23281,the influence of lateral pressure and stiffener type on the collapse behaviours of steel stiffened panels are investigated in the fe finite element analysis based on the numerical results the empirical expressions are derived for the ultimate strength assessment of stiffened panels under combined in plane axial compression and different levels of lateral pressure the regression formulae only include the plate slenderness ratio and column stiffener slenderness ratio hence to consider the influence of stiffener type the databases of sample points are separately grouped for various cross sections in the regression process at the same time for the convenient of utilizing the regression model the coefficients are expressed as water head in meters to investigate the approximating

which would be subjected to the compressive load and water pressure ultimate limit state method has been widely used in the ship design issc 2000 iacs 2014 for the safety of ship structure it is vital to predict the load carrying capacity of this kind of member there exist several methods to estimate the collapse behavious of ship structure including experiment numerical analysis and analytical method and so on many tests had been conducted in the past decades which could help the understanding of the collapse behavious of stiffened panel e g tanaka endo 1988 ghavami 1994 ghavami khedmati 2006 chen et al 1997 with the development of calculation capacity of computer numerical simulation is often used to estimate the collapse behavious of stiffened panel under various load conditions e g guedes soares soreide 1983 fujikubo et al 1997 ozguc et al 2007 and cho et al 2013 using numerical simulations wang moan 1996 and paik seo 2009 investigated the collapse behavious of stiffened panels under combined loads the influences of boundary conditions geometrical range xu et al 2013 dimensions and number of stiffeners tanaka et al 2014 also have been investigated on the collapse strength of stiffened panels under in plane compressive load using fe analysis yang et al 2018 investigated the influence of initial imperfections lateral pressure and strain rate on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under in plane dynamic compression since the numerical simulation is time consuming and the estimated result significantly depends on the researcher who perform the fe modelling it is necessary to use empirical formula for the assessment of load carrying capacity of stiffened panel which would be more useful for the design guedes soares gordo 1997 yao fujikubo 2005 and for the reliability analysis of ship structure mansour et al 1997 although the factors of safety in association with uncertainties and deviations should be considered carefully china classification society wang et al 2009 developed common structural rule computation software csr2sdp to calculate the ultimate strength of stiffened panel and hull girder which could improve the efficiency of ship design paik thayamballi 1997 paik et al 2001 fujikubo et al 2005a and harada et al 2007 had proposed serial formulae for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panel under the combination of in plane compression and lateral loads for the application in the design of ship structure puls 2005 and iacs hcsr requirement 2014 also give the formulations and computational procedure for predicting the ultimate strength of unstiffened plate stiffened panel and hull girder the external bottom plating and the lower parts of side shell are mainly subjected to the uniaxial and biaxial compressive loads and moreover to the relatively high external lateral pressure the effect of lateral pressure on plate collapse strength depends on the interaction of axial compression and lateral pressure wang moan 1996 and is usually accounted for by including an additional term in the interaction equations used for biaxial loads such as davidson et al 1992 and guedes soares gordo 1996 based on the results of nonlinear finite element analysis kim et al 2017 and ozdemir et al 2018 also proposed approximate formulas to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression the combination interaction of lateral pressure and constraint on plate edges would induce tensile stress which affects the collapse strength of stiffened panel under combined loads xu et al 2017 however this state of tensile stress is still not well considered in iacs hcsr requirements iacs 2014 for predicting the ultimate strength the existing data is used as the starting point for the formulation and more specimens are also simulated in the fe analysis as supplementation data in order for the regression of formula to be applicable to a desired wide geometrical range of stiffened panel for bulk carrier and vlcc very large crude carrier based on the numerical databases the regression analysis is used to derive the closed form empirical expressions for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panels used for marine applications 2 numerical analysis in order to derive the formulae for assessing the ultimate strength of stiffened panels the databases of numerical analysis are required thus a series of elastic plastic large deflection analyses are performed applying the nonlinear finite element method although there are part of numerical database in xu et al 2017 more specimens are also simulated to provide different geometrical dimensions 2 1 geometrical characteristics of the analysed stiffened panels since the accuracy of the regression formula significantly depend on the design sample point the dimensional range of plate and stiffener and their combinations should include most of the realistic member of ship structures it was found that the length width and thickness of the local plate are between 2 5 and 6 0 m 0 7 1 0 m and 12 36 mm from the statistical analyses of 46 ships by zhang 2016 considering the geometrical characteristics of bulk carrier and vlcc very large crude carrier the dimensions of the plate and stiffener are showed in table 1 table 2 and fig 2 which are given by iso international organization for standardization as benchmark and also had been used in the numerical analysis by tanaka et al 2014 parts of numerical results were presented in ref xu et al 2017 to investigate the influence of initial imperfection boundary conditions and lateral pressure on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels the design sample used to regression is very important for the accuracy of developed formulae for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and thus more specimens covering wider dimensional range are also simulated at the present study these data are used in the regression of formulae at the present paper the spacing between the adjacent transverse frames and longitudinal girders are denoted as l and s in fig 1 the aspect ratios of local plate are taken as 3 0 and 4 0 for bulk carrier and 5 0 for vlcc respectively to consider the effect of the geometrical combinations the designed sample points in the numerical analysis include three types of stiffeners i e flat bar angle bar and tee bar with four sizes and six thicknesses of the plates the lateral pressures 0 0 1 mpa and 0 2 mpa caused by water head are also considered there are totally 1296 designed sample points that are used in the regression analysis 2 2 finite element modelling shell element 181 with eight nodes in the fe program ansys are used for both stiffener and plate to simulate the load carrying capacity of the stiffener panels under the combination of uniaxial compression and lateral loads the perfect elastoplastic model of material is adopted in the fe analysis with which yield stress young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 313 6 mpa 205 8 gpa and 0 3 respectively the mesh density of element in the fe model should be appropriate for capturing the collapse behavious and then give enough accuracy results at the same time the computational time should be acceptable since many sample data points would be simulated that used in the regression analysis according to the analysis of element sensitive for obtaining the balance between required accuracy and computation time xu et al 2013 the element number on the flange and web of stiffeners are set as six and the element size on the plate is 85 mm fig 3 2 3 range of fe model loading and boundary conditions the geometrical range of fe model of the stiffened panels and external loads are showed in fig 1 the deformation of stiffened panel is not symmetric when the cross section of the stiffener is not symmetric e g for angle bar or there exists lateral load hence two bays spans model abcd in fig 1 with periodical boundary condition are adopted in the longitudinal and transversal edges in the numerical analysis more discussions about the setting of boundary conditions and geometrical range of fe model can be found in ref xu et al 2013 the lateral displacement is constrained but the rotation is free at the strong longitudinal girders and transversal frames denoted as dash line in fig 1 since which are not explicitly included in the fe model the setting of the boundary conditions is given by a2 b2 a3 b3 u z 0 Œ∏ x 0 a1 a4 u y 0 Œ∏ x Œ∏ x Œ∏ z Œ∏ z b1 b4 u y uniform in transverse direction Œ∏ x Œ∏ x Œ∏ z Œ∏ z a1 b1 u x 0 u y u

y 0 where the asterisk means that the same dof degree of freedom number is given to the nodes located at the same y and z coordinates at the two opposite edges it was found that the loading sequence of lateral pressure and in plane compression influence slightly the ultimate strength of stiffened panel yao et al 1997 hence two load steps are used to simulate the combination of uniaxial compression and lateral loads firstly the lateral pressure is applied on the plate perpendicular to the plate surface until the assumed levels of 0 1 0 2 mpa representing 10 m and 20 m water head after this step the in plane longitudinal compression is applied along the transversal edges of stiffened panel the setting of boundary condition is kept the same in the two steps of loading procedure 2 4 initial geometrical imperfections the manufacture of structural member would cause initial imperfections which normally reduce the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel and should be included in the fe analysis kmiecik 1971 the realistic measurement data of initial imperfections is generally not available in the design or theoretical investigation which is often considered as the superposition of fourier component kmiecik et al 1995 hence the equivalent initial imperfections of the stiffened panels are adopted here three types of initial geometrical imperfection for the local plate and stiffener are given by fujikubo et al 2005a initial imperfection of local plate 1 w 0 p l a 0 sin m œÄ x l sin œÄ y s b 0 sin œÄ x l sin œÄ y b column type initial deflection of stiffeners 2 w 0 s b 0 sin œÄ x l sin œÄ y b side ways initial deflection of stiffeners 3 v 0 s c 0 z h w sin œÄ x l where l and s are the length and width of local rectangular plates b is the width of the stiffened panels between girders m is the number of buckling half waves the magnitudes of the coefficient are 0 1 Œ≤ 2 t p for a 0 and 0 0015 l for b 0 and c 0 the buckling half wave number m of the local plate is predicted as a minimum integer that meets the demand as following paik thayamballi 2003 4 a b m m 1 since the linear buckling analysis could not give exactly the same shape with assumed fourier component instead the initial geometrical imperfections at given coordinate value are calculated by eqns 1 3 that are created directly in the fe modelling by apdl ansys program design language as shown in fig 4 2 5 simplified analytical method the overall collapse of grillage as an unit is often prevented in the design by enhance the stiffness of longitudinal girder and transverse frame hence in the analytical method the stiffened panel is simplified as a single stiffener with attached plate gordo guedes soares 1993 had proposed the formulae for calculating the average shortening average stress of stiffened panel and this procedure was also adopted by iacs hcsr requirement iacs 2014 three types of collapse modes are accounted for including plate buckling overall buckling and tripping buckling of stiffeners plate buckling 5 œÉ a c Œµ œÉ e a s œÜ w Œµ s t p a s s t p where œÉ e average stress at loading edge œÜ w Œµ effective width of local plate at every strain value a s

q is the lateral pressure q cr is the critical value with only considering the lateral pressure the average stresses of stiffened panels are calculated at each strain level in eqns 5 6 and 9 for the three collapse modes in which the smallest one is considered as the average stress the computational procedure is coded as in house program by matlab software 3 analysis of numerical results 3 1 influence of stiffener type fig 5 shows the shortening average stress curves of the stiffened panels with various lateral pressures and stiffener types in which the specimens with different stiffener types have the same plate slenderness and column slenderness the curves for the angle and tee bars are very close however which are very different with that for flat bar under various lateral pressures the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with angle tee bare are larger than that with flat bar for weak stiffeners Œª 1 010 however smaller than that for strong stiffeners Œª 0 165 to systemically identify this difference the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels with various dimensions are showed in fig 6 and fig 7 the results for flat bar are very different with that for angle tee bar even their Œª and Œ≤ are very close this difference is more pronounced for tripping buckling of stiffener with considering lateral pressure this difference has been also observed in the tests of steel stiffened panels of smith 1975 and the aluminium stiffened panels of paik et al 2007 for the uniaxial compression the ultimate strength decreases with the increase of the column slenderness for the stiffened panels with three types of bar in fig 6 for combined loads the reduction of the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panes still can be observed for angle and tee stiffeners however the shape of the ultimate strength column slenderness is convex for flat bar in fig 7 because of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels is influenced not only by the plate slenderness Œ≤ and column slenderness Œª but also by the flexural torsional rigidities of stiffeners especially for the cases with tripping buckling of stiffener this illustrates that this influence relate with the collapse modes of the stiffened panels which will be discussed next the column slenderness for various stiffener types are not exactly the same for most of cases in figs 6 and 7 for comparison of collapse shape part of dimensions of the stiffeners are slightly adjusted so that they have the same column slenderness for different stiffener types in which the column slenderness of the stiffeners are 1 010 for s1 and 0 165 for s4 and the plate slenderness is 2 07 fig 8 and fig 9 show the collapse deformation and stress distributions in which the collapse shapes of the stiffened panels having the same Œ≤ and Œª are similar for angle and tee bars which are different with that for flat bar for the strong stiffener s4 Œª 0 165 the failure modes of the stiffened panels are all tripping buckling of stiffeners however their collapse shapes are different for various stiffener types there are only one tripping half wave for angle and tee bars and several tripping half waves for flat bar since the torsional moment of inertia of stiffener are vital in the tripping buckling of stiffener which are 8 22 10 6 m4 1 05 10 6 m4 and 1 05 10 6 m4 for the flat angle and tee bars respectively relative to flat bar the angle tee bars having smaller torsional moment of inertia would give smaller torsional rigidity and then the load carrying capacity with the increase of Œª e g 1 01 the collapse type can be classified as overall buckling namely beam column failure of stiffener in this condition the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel mainly depends on the moments of inertia of stiffener the moments of inertia for flat bar is smaller than that for angle tee bars hence the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels with flat bar descend more quickly than that with angle tee bars with the increment of column slenderness in fig 6 this illustrates that the plate slenderness and column slenderness are the vital influential aspect on the load capacity of stiffened panel but the flexural torsional rigidity of stiffener is also very important when the collapse modes are the tripping buckling of stiffener 3 2 influence of lateral pressure the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels assessed by the numerical analysis and analytical method gordo guedes soares 1993 hu et al 2000 are showed in fig 10 for various lateral pressures in the fe analysis for the specimens with Œ≤ 2 07 the results of the stiffened panels under uniaxial compression are smaller than that with q 0 1 mpa the curves of lateral pressure vs ultimate strength is convex which illustrates that the lateral pressure does not always decrease the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels that depends on the collapse shape for the slender plate Œ≤ 3 49 with plate induced failure fig 11 the shape at ultimate strength is symmetrical along the frame girder and then the lateral pressure dominates collapse which always decrease the load carrying capacity for the thick plate Œ≤ 1 01 with overall buckling fig 12 the collapse shapes are overall periodical the lateral pressure would prevent the outer plane deform of outer side spans and then decelerate the yielding of material which would enhance the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels xu et al 2017 it also found that the normal load might enhance collapse strength and at the same time might accelerate the yielding of material that decrease the load carrying capacity of unstiffened plate fujikubo 2005b which depends on the collapse modes of the local plate under uniaxial compression for the square and rectangular plates under the combined effect of in plane longitudinal compression and lateral pressure teixeira guedes soares 2001 dealt with this problem by including an additional term in the interaction biaxial equations however the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels decreases with the increment of lateral pressure in the simplified analytical method which is different with that in the numerical simulations because of the stiffened panel is assumed as a single stiffener with attached plate in the simplified analytical method thus the lateral defamations are linearly summed by the deflection caused by the lateral pressure and initial imperfections which ignores their nonlinearly interactions and the influence of collapse shape this simplification dose not account for the strengthen influence of lateral pressure applying on the outer spans when the collapse shape is overall periodically hence it needs to consider the strengthen influence of water pressure in the formula for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels from the previous analyses the relationship between the plate slenderness and ultimate strength and collapse behavious are different for various stiffened types even they have the same plate slenderness and column slenderness in this circumstance it is very difficult to predict the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels using the same formula for different stiffener types especially when the regression expression only includes Œª and Œ≤ hence the influence of stiffener types will be considered in the regression model by using differential database groups for various stiffener types next 3 3 derivation of formulations the ultimate bending capacity of ship s hull girder is mainly governed by the ultimate collapse strength of the structural elements under in plane compression and normal loads induced by the hull girder bending moment and water head caused by the distributions of weight and buoyancy during operation of the vessel at sea the ultimate strength of stiffened panel is an important requirement for the safety of hull girder in ship design it is known that numerical simulation is a powerful method for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel however it would take much time to creating fe model and computation which also has convergence problem and numerical uncertainty for the same specimen it was found that the different persons might give up to 20 error due to the fe modelling of boundary conditions and geometrical range zhang khan 2009 thus it is highly desirable to propose close form formula for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel in the design and reliability analysis of ship structure using the least square method from testing database paik thayamballi 1997 derived an empirical formula to assess the load carrying capacity of steel stiffened panel under compressive load which is given as follows 11 œÉ u œÉ yseq 1 0

been proposed for aluminum stiffened panels under uniaxial compression by paik 2007 and combination of in plane compression and lateral loads by khedmati et al 2009 using the similar method the closed form formulations are developed for considering the influence of stiffener type to obtain more approximating results instead of eq 11 the polynomial expression with more coefficients and higher order is adopted and is given as follows 18 œÉ u œÉ yseq 1 c 0 c 1 Œª c 2 Œ≤ c 3 Œª Œ≤ c 4 Œª 2 c 5 Œ≤ 2 c 6 Œª 2 Œ≤ 2 c 7 Œª 3 c 8 Œ≤ 3 c 9 Œª 3 Œ≤ 3 c 10 Œª 4 1 Œª 2 when the stiffened panels with various stiffener types have the same plate slenderness Œª and column slenderness Œ≤ the polynomial approximating function eq 18 that only includes two variables Œª and Œ≤ would give the same results however which should be different from the previously investigations to consider the influence of stiffener type the databases of numerical results are separately grouped for various stiffener types in the regression analysis using the least square method paik 2007 the coefficients in eq 18 assumed as an approximating function can be calculated by n designed sample points from the results y i assessed by the numerical analysis assuming n k observations are available and x ij represent ith level of variation x j the corresponding observations are given by 19 x i 1 x i 2 x i k y i i 1 2 n and n k each observation x i1 x i2 x ik yi should meet the demand by 20 y Œ∑ Œµ where y is the vector of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels estimated by fe analysis 21 y t y 1 y 2 y n the magnitudes of various input variables are significantly different in many cases which might cause the undesirable omission of relative tiny value hence to avoid this problem the coding method is used to transform the input variables as non dimensional value in the multiple linear regressions which is given by 22 x i j Œæ i j max Œæ j min Œæ j 2 max Œæ j min Œæ j 2 i 1 2 n j 1 2 k the input variables Œæ ij is in natural unit and the range of the coded value x ij is between 1 1 the unknown coefficients c i are estimated by the following vector expression 23 c i t x i t x i 1 x i t y i 1 11 table 3 shows the coefficient of regression formulae eq 18 which are different for various stiffener types and lateral pressures using least square method the coefficients in eq 18 are described as function by input variables of water head h in m for the convenience of using these formulae as shown in table 4 thus the load carrying capacity of steel stiffened panel under uniaxial compression and lateral pressure can be estimated for any value of water head the comparisons of the fitting function and coefficients in eq 18 are showed in fig 13 for the stiffened panels with tee bar the coefficients r2 of multiple determinations are very close to one which illustrates that the fitting functions in table 4 give well agreement with that in table 3 4 analysis of results in regression formulations fig 14 and fig 15 show the comparison of non dimensionalised ultimate strength of the stiffened panels between the numerical analysis and regression formulae it can be observed that the results assessed by the regression formulae are well agreed with that in the fe analysis as in multiple linear regressions the approximating accuracy of the regression function can be estimated by the coefficient r 2 of multiple determinations which is statistical data that give the measurement of the correlation between the referential results and the assessment of the regression function and is given by 25 r 2 s s r s s t with 0 r 2 1 where total sum of squares s s t i 1 n y i y 2 regression sum of squares s s r i 1 n y ÀÜ i y 2 error sum of squares s s e i 1 n y i y i ÀÜ 2 where y i and y i are the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels predicted for each sample point in the fe analysis and regression model eq 18 y is the mean value the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels predicted by the numerical simulation and developed formulations are showed in fig 16 which check the accuracy of the regression model in eq 18 the corresponding coefficient of determination bias and cov coefficient of variation are also presented in table 5 the coefficient r 2 of determination give a statistic measurement that reflect the relevant between the design point and result assessed by the proposed formula which are 0 83 0 88 and 0 89 for the stiffened panels with flat bar angle and tee bar respectively the statistics data show that the regression formulae for the stiffened plates with angle tee bar give slightly more approximate results than that with flat bar this might be because that the scatter of results of the stiffened panels with flat bar is larger than that with angle tee bars as shown in fig 7 and then which is more difficult to be approximated due to the uncertainty of initial deflections numerical simulation technique and material characteristic the band of upper and down of œÉ u f œÉ u fem is an important value to see the correlation between the design point and regression model the mean percentage of the database within 15 error band is 90 this statistics data illustrates that the regression model could give acceptable results from view point of design and the reliability analysis of ship structure since which is easy to implement of prediction the limitation of regression formulae significantly depend on the geometrical range of design sample in which the range of Œ≤ Œª and height of web are between 1 and 3 49 0 15 2 48 and 150 550 for flat bar angle bar and tee bar stiffeners respectively the comparisons of the ultimate strength predicted by the regression formulae and analytical method are given in fig 17 it can be seen that the scatter degree of the results at the sample points is larger than that between the fe analysis and regression formulae the mean value of the ultimate strength in regression formulae is larger 13 than that in analytical method which might be caused by two aspects first the stiffened panel in the simplified analytical method is assumed as a single stiffener with attached plate in one span range which cannot consider the interaction of the adjacent members and thus might underestimate the ultimate strength besides the uncertainty of the initial imperfections external loads and geometrical dimensions are generally considered in the simplified analytical method which would give more conservative results for the safety of ship design to more clearly comparison with existing methods the dimensionless ultimate strength of stiffened panels under axial compression are plotted with different column slenderness in fig 18 table 6 also shows the statistical data of comparisons between the existing method and regression formulae in which œÉ u fem œÉ u ≈ã œÉ u csr œÉ u ≈ã œÉ u paik œÉ u ≈ã are the ratio of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels assessed by the fe analysis iacs csr requirements and paik thayamballi 1997 to that in the regression formulae respectively the results assessed by iacs csr requirements are very close with that in the fe analysis and are slightly smaller 3 than that in the regression formulae because of iacs csr requirements used in the design of ship structures consider the uncertainty of load residual imperfection and geometric dimensions for the structural safety these aspects considered in the designed rule would give more conservative results however the formulation proposed by paik thayamballi 1997 gives significantly smaller than that in the other three approaches the ultimate strength of stiffened panels might be fluctuating in the range of 0 Œª 0 5 this kind of behaviour is not captured in the fe analysis iacs csr requirement and formulae of paik which should be caused by limited number of assumed scenarios hence if the formula was developed by the regression method the dimensional range of designed data should be noticed xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b have conducted a serial tests of stiffened panels under axial comparision the corresponding dimensions of the stiffened panels are showed in table 7 the experimental results are compared with the proposed expression and iacs csr requirements iacs 2014 as shown in fig 19 the results predicted by the derived formulae are slightly larger than those in the tests and iacs csr requirements the maximum difference between œÉ u Œ∑ and œÉ u test are 25 for the stiffened panel fb45a2f6 which is unexpected because there exists fail test for example the panels fb45a2f6 and fb45b2f6 with two and four stiffeners in the longitudinal direction have the same dimensions of the plate and stiffeners however the difference of the experimental results between the two specimens already reaches to 18 and their permanent deformations after collapse in the tests are toward to opposite side in fig 20 this might be caused by the difference of the experimental boundary conditions the length of the supporting bar on the frame are different for the narrow fb45a2f6 and wide fb45b2f6 stiffened panels in fig 21 which would supply different lateral stiffness and then give the different collapse shapes fig 20 and ultimate strength actually there are only two experimental results beyond the range of 20 deviations hence the comparison with experimental results should concern the uncertainty of experiment the inappropriate configurations of supporting system and testing procedure might cause unexpected results however the mean value and cov of œÉ u Œ∑ to œÉ u test and œÉ u csr are 1 08 and 1 02 0 09 and 0 02 respectively except the fail tests the difference between the experiment and formulae are in the range of 8 which shows well agreement from the statistical point since there exists uncertainties of laboratory condition due to the fabrication and installation 5 conclusions serial numerical simulations of stiffened panels under combined uniaxial compression and lateral loads are conducted the numerical results show that the load carrying capacities of stiffened panels are similar between angle and tee bars which are different with that of flat bar even when their plate slenderness and column slenderness are very close this difference is more pronounced for the tripping buckling of stiffener since the torsional moments of inertia of flat bar are very different with that of angle tee bars this illustrate that the plate slenderness and column slenderness of the stiffened panels are the vital influential aspect on the load carrying capacity but the flexural torsional rigidity of stiffener is also very important for the tripping buckling with the increase of lateral pressure the load carrying capacity decreases for the stiffened panel with plate induced collapse mode however might increase for that with periodical shape of overall buckling this influence in the analytical method is not accounted for because in which the interaction between the adjacent members is not considered since the coefficients of regression functions are significantly depend on the database of sample data points based on the numerical database of separated groups for various stiffener types a serial of closed form empirical formulae for predicting of the ultimate strength for stiffened panels under combined uniaxial compression and lateral loads are derived by the regression analysis to consider the influence of stiffener type the results in the developed formulae are compared with that in the fe analysis and analytical method which shows that the regression models could give reasonable prediction for the convenience of calculation considering the lateral pressure the coefficients of the regression models are denoted as water head in meters comparing with numerical simulation the developed formulae are useful for predicting the load carry capacity of stiffened panels and reliability investigation of ship structure from the view of application

23281,the influence of lateral pressure and stiffener type on the collapse behaviours of steel stiffened panels are investigated in the fe finite element analysis based on the numerical results the empirical expressions are derived for the ultimate strength assessment of stiffened panels under combined in plane axial compression and different levels of lateral pressure the regression formulae only include the plate slenderness ratio and column stiffener slenderness ratio hence to consider the influence of stiffener type the databases of sample points are separately grouped for various cross sections in the regression process at the same time for the convenient of utilizing the regression model the coefficients are expressed as water head in meters to investigate the approximating

which would be subjected to the compressive load and water pressure ultimate limit state method has been widely used in the ship design issc 2000 iacs 2014 for the safety of ship structure it is vital to predict the load carrying capacity of this kind of member there exist several methods to estimate the collapse behavious of ship structure including experiment numerical analysis and analytical method and so on many tests had been conducted in the past decades which could help the understanding of the collapse behavious of stiffened panel e g tanaka endo 1988 ghavami 1994 ghavami khedmati 2006 chen et al 1997 with the development of calculation capacity of computer numerical simulation is often used to estimate the collapse behavious of stiffened panel under various load conditions e g guedes soares soreide 1983 fujikubo et al 1997 ozguc et al 2007 and cho et al 2013 using numerical simulations wang moan 1996 and paik seo 2009 investigated the collapse behavious of stiffened panels under combined loads the influences of boundary conditions geometrical range xu et al 2013 dimensions and number of stiffeners tanaka et al 2014 also have been investigated on the collapse strength of stiffened panels under in plane compressive load using fe analysis yang et al 2018 investigated the influence of initial imperfections lateral pressure and strain rate on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under in plane dynamic compression since the numerical simulation is time consuming and the estimated result significantly depends on the researcher who perform the fe modelling it is necessary to use empirical formula for the assessment of load carrying capacity of stiffened panel which would be more useful for the design guedes soares gordo 1997 yao fujikubo 2005 and for the reliability analysis of ship structure mansour et al 1997 although the factors of safety in association with uncertainties and deviations should be considered carefully china classification society wang et al 2009 developed common structural rule computation software csr2sdp to calculate the ultimate strength of stiffened panel and hull girder which could improve the efficiency of ship design paik thayamballi 1997 paik et al 2001 fujikubo et al 2005a and harada et al 2007 had proposed serial formulae for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panel under the combination of in plane compression and lateral loads for the application in the design of ship structure puls 2005 and iacs hcsr requirement 2014 also give the formulations and computational procedure for predicting the ultimate strength of unstiffened plate stiffened panel and hull girder the external bottom plating and the lower parts of side shell are mainly subjected to the uniaxial and biaxial compressive loads and moreover to the relatively high external lateral pressure the effect of lateral pressure on plate collapse strength depends on the interaction of axial compression and lateral pressure wang moan 1996 and is usually accounted for by including an additional term in the interaction equations used for biaxial loads such as davidson et al 1992 and guedes soares gordo 1996 based on the results of nonlinear finite element analysis kim et al 2017 and ozdemir et al 2018 also proposed approximate formulas to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under longitudinal compression the combination interaction of lateral pressure and constraint on plate edges would induce tensile stress which affects the collapse strength of stiffened panel under combined loads xu et al 2017 however this state of tensile stress is still not well considered in iacs hcsr requirements iacs 2014 for predicting the ultimate strength the existing data is used as the starting point for the formulation and more specimens are also simulated in the fe analysis as supplementation data in order for the regression of formula to be applicable to a desired wide geometrical range of stiffened panel for bulk carrier and vlcc very large crude carrier based on the numerical databases the regression analysis is used to derive the closed form empirical expressions for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panels used for marine applications 2 numerical analysis in order to derive the formulae for assessing the ultimate strength of stiffened panels the databases of numerical analysis are required thus a series of elastic plastic large deflection analyses are performed applying the nonlinear finite element method although there are part of numerical database in xu et al 2017 more specimens are also simulated to provide different geometrical dimensions 2 1 geometrical characteristics of the analysed stiffened panels since the accuracy of the regression formula significantly depend on the design sample point the dimensional range of plate and stiffener and their combinations should include most of the realistic member of ship structures it was found that the length width and thickness of the local plate are between 2 5 and 6 0 m 0 7 1 0 m and 12 36 mm from the statistical analyses of 46 ships by zhang 2016 considering the geometrical characteristics of bulk carrier and vlcc very large crude carrier the dimensions of the plate and stiffener are showed in table 1 table 2 and fig 2 which are given by iso international organization for standardization as benchmark and also had been used in the numerical analysis by tanaka et al 2014 parts of numerical results were presented in ref xu et al 2017 to investigate the influence of initial imperfection boundary conditions and lateral pressure on the collapse behaviours of stiffened panels the design sample used to regression is very important for the accuracy of developed formulae for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and thus more specimens covering wider dimensional range are also simulated at the present study these data are used in the regression of formulae at the present paper the spacing between the adjacent transverse frames and longitudinal girders are denoted as l and s in fig 1 the aspect ratios of local plate are taken as 3 0 and 4 0 for bulk carrier and 5 0 for vlcc respectively to consider the effect of the geometrical combinations the designed sample points in the numerical analysis include three types of stiffeners i e flat bar angle bar and tee bar with four sizes and six thicknesses of the plates the lateral pressures 0 0 1 mpa and 0 2 mpa caused by water head are also considered there are totally 1296 designed sample points that are used in the regression analysis 2 2 finite element modelling shell element 181 with eight nodes in the fe program ansys are used for both stiffener and plate to simulate the load carrying capacity of the stiffener panels under the combination of uniaxial compression and lateral loads the perfect elastoplastic model of material is adopted in the fe analysis with which yield stress young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 313 6 mpa 205 8 gpa and 0 3 respectively the mesh density of element in the fe model should be appropriate for capturing the collapse behavious and then give enough accuracy results at the same time the computational time should be acceptable since many sample data points would be simulated that used in the regression analysis according to the analysis of element sensitive for obtaining the balance between required accuracy and computation time xu et al 2013 the element number on the flange and web of stiffeners are set as six and the element size on the plate is 85 mm fig 3 2 3 range of fe model loading and boundary conditions the geometrical range of fe model of the stiffened panels and external loads are showed in fig 1 the deformation of stiffened panel is not symmetric when the cross section of the stiffener is not symmetric e g for angle bar or there exists lateral load hence two bays spans model abcd in fig 1 with periodical boundary condition are adopted in the longitudinal and transversal edges in the numerical analysis more discussions about the setting of boundary conditions and geometrical range of fe model can be found in ref xu et al 2013 the lateral displacement is constrained but the rotation is free at the strong longitudinal girders and transversal frames denoted as dash line in fig 1 since which are not explicitly included in the fe model the setting of the boundary conditions is given by a2 b2 a3 b3 u z 0 Œ∏ x 0 a1 a4 u y 0 Œ∏ x Œ∏ x Œ∏ z Œ∏ z b1 b4 u y uniform in transverse direction Œ∏ x Œ∏ x Œ∏ z Œ∏ z a1 b1 u x 0 u y u

y 0 where the asterisk means that the same dof degree of freedom number is given to the nodes located at the same y and z coordinates at the two opposite edges it was found that the loading sequence of lateral pressure and in plane compression influence slightly the ultimate strength of stiffened panel yao et al 1997 hence two load steps are used to simulate the combination of uniaxial compression and lateral loads firstly the lateral pressure is applied on the plate perpendicular to the plate surface until the assumed levels of 0 1 0 2 mpa representing 10 m and 20 m water head after this step the in plane longitudinal compression is applied along the transversal edges of stiffened panel the setting of boundary condition is kept the same in the two steps of loading procedure 2 4 initial geometrical imperfections the manufacture of structural member would cause initial imperfections which normally reduce the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel and should be included in the fe analysis kmiecik 1971 the realistic measurement data of initial imperfections is generally not available in the design or theoretical investigation which is often considered as the superposition of fourier component kmiecik et al 1995 hence the equivalent initial imperfections of the stiffened panels are adopted here three types of initial geometrical imperfection for the local plate and stiffener are given by fujikubo et al 2005a initial imperfection of local plate 1 w 0 p l a 0 sin m œÄ x l sin œÄ y s b 0 sin œÄ x l sin œÄ y b column type initial deflection of stiffeners 2 w 0 s b 0 sin œÄ x l sin œÄ y b side ways initial deflection of stiffeners 3 v 0 s c 0 z h w sin œÄ x l where l and s are the length and width of local rectangular plates b is the width of the stiffened panels between girders m is the number of buckling half waves the magnitudes of the coefficient are 0 1 Œ≤ 2 t p for a 0 and 0 0015 l for b 0 and c 0 the buckling half wave number m of the local plate is predicted as a minimum integer that meets the demand as following paik thayamballi 2003 4 a b m m 1 since the linear buckling analysis could not give exactly the same shape with assumed fourier component instead the initial geometrical imperfections at given coordinate value are calculated by eqns 1 3 that are created directly in the fe modelling by apdl ansys program design language as shown in fig 4 2 5 simplified analytical method the overall collapse of grillage as an unit is often prevented in the design by enhance the stiffness of longitudinal girder and transverse frame hence in the analytical method the stiffened panel is simplified as a single stiffener with attached plate gordo guedes soares 1993 had proposed the formulae for calculating the average shortening average stress of stiffened panel and this procedure was also adopted by iacs hcsr requirement iacs 2014 three types of collapse modes are accounted for including plate buckling overall buckling and tripping buckling of stiffeners plate buckling 5 œÉ a c Œµ œÉ e a s œÜ w Œµ s t p a s s t p where œÉ e average stress at loading edge œÜ w Œµ effective width of local plate at every strain value a s

q is the lateral pressure q cr is the critical value with only considering the lateral pressure the average stresses of stiffened panels are calculated at each strain level in eqns 5 6 and 9 for the three collapse modes in which the smallest one is considered as the average stress the computational procedure is coded as in house program by matlab software 3 analysis of numerical results 3 1 influence of stiffener type fig 5 shows the shortening average stress curves of the stiffened panels with various lateral pressures and stiffener types in which the specimens with different stiffener types have the same plate slenderness and column slenderness the curves for the angle and tee bars are very close however which are very different with that for flat bar under various lateral pressures the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with angle tee bare are larger than that with flat bar for weak stiffeners Œª 1 010 however smaller than that for strong stiffeners Œª 0 165 to systemically identify this difference the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels with various dimensions are showed in fig 6 and fig 7 the results for flat bar are very different with that for angle tee bar even their Œª and Œ≤ are very close this difference is more pronounced for tripping buckling of stiffener with considering lateral pressure this difference has been also observed in the tests of steel stiffened panels of smith 1975 and the aluminium stiffened panels of paik et al 2007 for the uniaxial compression the ultimate strength decreases with the increase of the column slenderness for the stiffened panels with three types of bar in fig 6 for combined loads the reduction of the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panes still can be observed for angle and tee stiffeners however the shape of the ultimate strength column slenderness is convex for flat bar in fig 7 because of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels is influenced not only by the plate slenderness Œ≤ and column slenderness Œª but also by the flexural torsional rigidities of stiffeners especially for the cases with tripping buckling of stiffener this illustrates that this influence relate with the collapse modes of the stiffened panels which will be discussed next the column slenderness for various stiffener types are not exactly the same for most of cases in figs 6 and 7 for comparison of collapse shape part of dimensions of the stiffeners are slightly adjusted so that they have the same column slenderness for different stiffener types in which the column slenderness of the stiffeners are 1 010 for s1 and 0 165 for s4 and the plate slenderness is 2 07 fig 8 and fig 9 show the collapse deformation and stress distributions in which the collapse shapes of the stiffened panels having the same Œ≤ and Œª are similar for angle and tee bars which are different with that for flat bar for the strong stiffener s4 Œª 0 165 the failure modes of the stiffened panels are all tripping buckling of stiffeners however their collapse shapes are different for various stiffener types there are only one tripping half wave for angle and tee bars and several tripping half waves for flat bar since the torsional moment of inertia of stiffener are vital in the tripping buckling of stiffener which are 8 22 10 6 m4 1 05 10 6 m4 and 1 05 10 6 m4 for the flat angle and tee bars respectively relative to flat bar the angle tee bars having smaller torsional moment of inertia would give smaller torsional rigidity and then the load carrying capacity with the increase of Œª e g 1 01 the collapse type can be classified as overall buckling namely beam column failure of stiffener in this condition the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel mainly depends on the moments of inertia of stiffener the moments of inertia for flat bar is smaller than that for angle tee bars hence the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels with flat bar descend more quickly than that with angle tee bars with the increment of column slenderness in fig 6 this illustrates that the plate slenderness and column slenderness are the vital influential aspect on the load capacity of stiffened panel but the flexural torsional rigidity of stiffener is also very important when the collapse modes are the tripping buckling of stiffener 3 2 influence of lateral pressure the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels assessed by the numerical analysis and analytical method gordo guedes soares 1993 hu et al 2000 are showed in fig 10 for various lateral pressures in the fe analysis for the specimens with Œ≤ 2 07 the results of the stiffened panels under uniaxial compression are smaller than that with q 0 1 mpa the curves of lateral pressure vs ultimate strength is convex which illustrates that the lateral pressure does not always decrease the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels that depends on the collapse shape for the slender plate Œ≤ 3 49 with plate induced failure fig 11 the shape at ultimate strength is symmetrical along the frame girder and then the lateral pressure dominates collapse which always decrease the load carrying capacity for the thick plate Œ≤ 1 01 with overall buckling fig 12 the collapse shapes are overall periodical the lateral pressure would prevent the outer plane deform of outer side spans and then decelerate the yielding of material which would enhance the load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels xu et al 2017 it also found that the normal load might enhance collapse strength and at the same time might accelerate the yielding of material that decrease the load carrying capacity of unstiffened plate fujikubo 2005b which depends on the collapse modes of the local plate under uniaxial compression for the square and rectangular plates under the combined effect of in plane longitudinal compression and lateral pressure teixeira guedes soares 2001 dealt with this problem by including an additional term in the interaction biaxial equations however the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels decreases with the increment of lateral pressure in the simplified analytical method which is different with that in the numerical simulations because of the stiffened panel is assumed as a single stiffener with attached plate in the simplified analytical method thus the lateral defamations are linearly summed by the deflection caused by the lateral pressure and initial imperfections which ignores their nonlinearly interactions and the influence of collapse shape this simplification dose not account for the strengthen influence of lateral pressure applying on the outer spans when the collapse shape is overall periodically hence it needs to consider the strengthen influence of water pressure in the formula for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels from the previous analyses the relationship between the plate slenderness and ultimate strength and collapse behavious are different for various stiffened types even they have the same plate slenderness and column slenderness in this circumstance it is very difficult to predict the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels using the same formula for different stiffener types especially when the regression expression only includes Œª and Œ≤ hence the influence of stiffener types will be considered in the regression model by using differential database groups for various stiffener types next 3 3 derivation of formulations the ultimate bending capacity of ship s hull girder is mainly governed by the ultimate collapse strength of the structural elements under in plane compression and normal loads induced by the hull girder bending moment and water head caused by the distributions of weight and buoyancy during operation of the vessel at sea the ultimate strength of stiffened panel is an important requirement for the safety of hull girder in ship design it is known that numerical simulation is a powerful method for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel however it would take much time to creating fe model and computation which also has convergence problem and numerical uncertainty for the same specimen it was found that the different persons might give up to 20 error due to the fe modelling of boundary conditions and geometrical range zhang khan 2009 thus it is highly desirable to propose close form formula for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel in the design and reliability analysis of ship structure using the least square method from testing database paik thayamballi 1997 derived an empirical formula to assess the load carrying capacity of steel stiffened panel under compressive load which is given as follows 11 œÉ u œÉ yseq 1 0

been proposed for aluminum stiffened panels under uniaxial compression by paik 2007 and combination of in plane compression and lateral loads by khedmati et al 2009 using the similar method the closed form formulations are developed for considering the influence of stiffener type to obtain more approximating results instead of eq 11 the polynomial expression with more coefficients and higher order is adopted and is given as follows 18 œÉ u œÉ yseq 1 c 0 c 1 Œª c 2 Œ≤ c 3 Œª Œ≤ c 4 Œª 2 c 5 Œ≤ 2 c 6 Œª 2 Œ≤ 2 c 7 Œª 3 c 8 Œ≤ 3 c 9 Œª 3 Œ≤ 3 c 10 Œª 4 1 Œª 2 when the stiffened panels with various stiffener types have the same plate slenderness Œª and column slenderness Œ≤ the polynomial approximating function eq 18 that only includes two variables Œª and Œ≤ would give the same results however which should be different from the previously investigations to consider the influence of stiffener type the databases of numerical results are separately grouped for various stiffener types in the regression analysis using the least square method paik 2007 the coefficients in eq 18 assumed as an approximating function can be calculated by n designed sample points from the results y i assessed by the numerical analysis assuming n k observations are available and x ij represent ith level of variation x j the corresponding observations are given by 19 x i 1 x i 2 x i k y i i 1 2 n and n k each observation x i1 x i2 x ik yi should meet the demand by 20 y Œ∑ Œµ where y is the vector of the ultimate strength of stiffened panels estimated by fe analysis 21 y t y 1 y 2 y n the magnitudes of various input variables are significantly different in many cases which might cause the undesirable omission of relative tiny value hence to avoid this problem the coding method is used to transform the input variables as non dimensional value in the multiple linear regressions which is given by 22 x i j Œæ i j max Œæ j min Œæ j 2 max Œæ j min Œæ j 2 i 1 2 n j 1 2 k the input variables Œæ ij is in natural unit and the range of the coded value x ij is between 1 1 the unknown coefficients c i are estimated by the following vector expression 23 c i t x i t x i 1 x i t y i 1 11 table 3 shows the coefficient of regression formulae eq 18 which are different for various stiffener types and lateral pressures using least square method the coefficients in eq 18 are described as function by input variables of water head h in m for the convenience of using these formulae as shown in table 4 thus the load carrying capacity of steel stiffened panel under uniaxial compression and lateral pressure can be estimated for any value of water head the comparisons of the fitting function and coefficients in eq 18 are showed in fig 13 for the stiffened panels with tee bar the coefficients r2 of multiple determinations are very close to one which illustrates that the fitting functions in table 4 give well agreement with that in table 3 4 analysis of results in regression formulations fig 14 and fig 15 show the comparison of non dimensionalised ultimate strength of the stiffened panels between the numerical analysis and regression formulae it can be observed that the results assessed by the regression formulae are well agreed with that in the fe analysis as in multiple linear regressions the approximating accuracy of the regression function can be estimated by the coefficient r 2 of multiple determinations which is statistical data that give the measurement of the correlation between the referential results and the assessment of the regression function and is given by 25 r 2 s s r s s t with 0 r 2 1 where total sum of squares s s t i 1 n y i y 2 regression sum of squares s s r i 1 n y ÀÜ i y 2 error sum of squares s s e i 1 n y i y i ÀÜ 2 where y i and y i are the load carrying capacity of stiffened panels predicted for each sample point in the fe analysis and regression model eq 18 y is the mean value the load carrying capacities of the stiffened panels predicted by the numerical simulation and developed formulations are showed in fig 16 which check the accuracy of the regression model in eq 18 the corresponding coefficient of determination bias and cov coefficient of variation are also presented in table 5 the coefficient r 2 of determination give a statistic measurement that reflect the relevant between the design point and result assessed by the proposed formula which are 0 83 0 88 and 0 89 for the stiffened panels with flat bar angle and tee bar respectively the statistics data show that the regression formulae for the stiffened plates with angle tee bar give slightly more approximate results than that with flat bar this might be because that the scatter of results of the stiffened panels with flat bar is larger than that with angle tee bars as shown in fig 7 and then which is more difficult to be approximated due to the uncertainty of initial deflections numerical simulation technique and material characteristic the band of upper and down of œÉ u f œÉ u fem is an important value to see the correlation between the design point and regression model the mean percentage of the database within 15 error band is 90 this statistics data illustrates that the regression model could give acceptable results from view point of design and the reliability analysis of ship structure since which is easy to implement of prediction the limitation of regression formulae significantly depend on the geometrical range of design sample in which the range of Œ≤ Œª and height of web are between 1 and 3 49 0 15 2 48 and 150 550 for flat bar angle bar and tee bar stiffeners respectively the comparisons of the ultimate strength predicted by the regression formulae and analytical method are given in fig 17 it can be seen that the scatter degree of the results at the sample points is larger than that between the fe analysis and regression formulae the mean value of the ultimate strength in regression formulae is larger 13 than that in analytical method which might be caused by two aspects first the stiffened panel in the simplified analytical method is assumed as a single stiffener with attached plate in one span range which cannot consider the interaction of the adjacent members and thus might underestimate the ultimate strength besides the uncertainty of the initial imperfections external loads and geometrical dimensions are generally considered in the simplified analytical method which would give more conservative results for the safety of ship design to more clearly comparison with existing methods the dimensionless ultimate strength of stiffened panels under axial compression are plotted with different column slenderness in fig 18 table 6 also shows the statistical data of comparisons between the existing method and regression formulae in which œÉ u fem œÉ u ≈ã œÉ u csr œÉ u ≈ã œÉ u paik œÉ u ≈ã are the ratio of ultimate strength of the stiffened panels assessed by the fe analysis iacs csr requirements and paik thayamballi 1997 to that in the regression formulae respectively the results assessed by iacs csr requirements are very close with that in the fe analysis and are slightly smaller 3 than that in the regression formulae because of iacs csr requirements used in the design of ship structures consider the uncertainty of load residual imperfection and geometric dimensions for the structural safety these aspects considered in the designed rule would give more conservative results however the formulation proposed by paik thayamballi 1997 gives significantly smaller than that in the other three approaches the ultimate strength of stiffened panels might be fluctuating in the range of 0 Œª 0 5 this kind of behaviour is not captured in the fe analysis iacs csr requirement and formulae of paik which should be caused by limited number of assumed scenarios hence if the formula was developed by the regression method the dimensional range of designed data should be noticed xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b have conducted a serial tests of stiffened panels under axial comparision the corresponding dimensions of the stiffened panels are showed in table 7 the experimental results are compared with the proposed expression and iacs csr requirements iacs 2014 as shown in fig 19 the results predicted by the derived formulae are slightly larger than those in the tests and iacs csr requirements the maximum difference between œÉ u Œ∑ and œÉ u test are 25 for the stiffened panel fb45a2f6 which is unexpected because there exists fail test for example the panels fb45a2f6 and fb45b2f6 with two and four stiffeners in the longitudinal direction have the same dimensions of the plate and stiffeners however the difference of the experimental results between the two specimens already reaches to 18 and their permanent deformations after collapse in the tests are toward to opposite side in fig 20 this might be caused by the difference of the experimental boundary conditions the length of the supporting bar on the frame are different for the narrow fb45a2f6 and wide fb45b2f6 stiffened panels in fig 21 which would supply different lateral stiffness and then give the different collapse shapes fig 20 and ultimate strength actually there are only two experimental results beyond the range of 20 deviations hence the comparison with experimental results should concern the uncertainty of experiment the inappropriate configurations of supporting system and testing procedure might cause unexpected results however the mean value and cov of œÉ u Œ∑ to œÉ u test and œÉ u csr are 1 08 and 1 02 0 09 and 0 02 respectively except the fail tests the difference between the experiment and formulae are in the range of 8 which shows well agreement from the statistical point since there exists uncertainties of laboratory condition due to the fabrication and installation 5 conclusions serial numerical simulations of stiffened panels under combined uniaxial compression and lateral loads are conducted the numerical results show that the load carrying capacities of stiffened panels are similar between angle and tee bars which are different with that of flat bar even when their plate slenderness and column slenderness are very close this difference is more pronounced for the tripping buckling of stiffener since the torsional moments of inertia of flat bar are very different with that of angle tee bars this illustrate that the plate slenderness and column slenderness of the stiffened panels are the vital influential aspect on the load carrying capacity but the flexural torsional rigidity of stiffener is also very important for the tripping buckling with the increase of lateral pressure the load carrying capacity decreases for the stiffened panel with plate induced collapse mode however might increase for that with periodical shape of overall buckling this influence in the analytical method is not accounted for because in which the interaction between the adjacent members is not considered since the coefficients of regression functions are significantly depend on the database of sample data points based on the numerical database of separated groups for various stiffener types a serial of closed form empirical formulae for predicting of the ultimate strength for stiffened panels under combined uniaxial compression and lateral loads are derived by the regression analysis to consider the influence of stiffener type the results in the developed formulae are compared with that in the fe analysis and analytical method which shows that the regression models could give reasonable prediction for the convenience of calculation considering the lateral pressure the coefficients of the regression models are denoted as water head in meters comparing with numerical simulation the developed formulae are useful for predicting the load carry capacity of stiffened panels and reliability investigation of ship structure from the view of application

23282,researches about the response of a circular cylinder fitted with splitter plates have been performed previously to control viv galloping as a structure instability has been found under some conditions which is of great interest recently however the mechanism of response for a circular cylinder in the presence of splitter plates has rarely been clarified in the present study different vibration characteristics have been observed for a circular cylinder with detached splitter plates 0 4 l d 5 0 where l is the length of splitter plates d is the external diameter of cylinder in a wind tunnel combined with previous study for galloping in square cylinders the patterns were comprehensively described there exist four kinds of response for different lengths of splitter plates viv which lies in a discrete range of wind velocity such as l d 0 4 0 5 the interaction between galloping and viv was also found such as l d 1 0 1 5 a combination of the velocity restricted excitation which occurs before viv onset velocities and interaction of viv and galloping where there exists separate branches in the response such as l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 a combination of the velocity restricted excitation and pure classical galloping such as l d 4 0 5 0 besides it was discovered that the built up time needed for pure galloping to reach a steady amplitude is much less than that when is related to viv furthermore the hysteresis loop was found in cases above fft spectrums of the streamwise velocity show the appearance of multiple harmonics keywords vortex induced vibration viv galloping splitter plates interaction between viv and galloping wind tunnel experiment 1 introduction circular cylinder structures have been widely utilized in practice while flow passes a cylinder alternate vortices shed and oscillating force is exerted on the cylinder structure under certain circumstances where the vortex shedding frequency is close to the nature frequency of the structure severe vibrations can be induced this fluid structure interaction is called vortex induced vibration viv blevins 1990 much attention has been drawn to the suppression of viv owing to the catastrophic events caused by viv severe resonances due to viv may cause the fatigue failure of structures based on the vortex formation mechanisms various strategies have been proposed to suppress the vortex shedding the passive control method has been introduced by attaching a device to the cylinder these devices include strakes splitter plates fairings and so on zdravkovich 1981 owen et al 2001 splitter plates have been verified to be effective to obstruct the separate shear layers interaction and suppress vortex formations roshko 1954 showed separate points can be stabilized by the splitter plates experiments performed by roshko 1954 apelt et al 1973 apelt and west 1975 unal and rockwell 1988 texier et al 2002 akilli et al 2005 gu et al 2012 manifest that the formation length can be extended and fluid force both the drag and the lift are greatly lowered however for flexibly mounted cylinders splitter plates do not necessarily suppress the vibration instead more serious responses can be induced a result in assi et al 2009 showed that the shear layer tends to reattach to the tip of the splitter plates and the strong vibration of the structure ensues separate shear layers would interact with the splitter plates with a higher fluid force exerting on the structure this structure response is categorized as galloping by assi et al 2009 which is common for square cylinders the classical galloping occurs typically for all flow velocities above a critical speed blevins 1990 and the vibration amplitude occurring in galloping is usually much larger than that of viv galloping as with viv is one of the most common flow induced vibrations in practice a fluid force is exerted on the structure in flow with noncircular cross section as the structure oscillates the fluid force changes with orientation to the flow if the oscillation fluid force tends to increase vibrations a large amplitude response can be induced intrinsically all noncircular cross sections are possible to gallop like the circular cylinder for researching viv the square cylinder is suitable for galloping study plenty of researches have been performed previously about the galloping response for the square cylinders in the smooth flow b and d b and d are streamwise and cross flow section dimensions are the key parameters to determine whether galloping is possible to occur in particular rectangular cylinders without specific b d are unable with respect to galloping parkinson 1963 for very small b d the section is stable at rest for the intermediate b d 0 75 b d 3 4 the sections can gallop from rest it has been revealed that the shear layers separating from the bluff body is crucial to the galloping phenomenon blevins 1990 corless and parkinson 1988 reattachments of shear layers would lead to the formation of a fluid force that strengthens the vibration this interaction of shear layers with the section afterbody is thought to be responsible for the typical galloping besides any section is susceptible to viv for those sections that can gallop it is possible that the two types of flow induced vibrations can interact with each other where galloping occurs in the range of viv lock in region scruton 1963 observed an oscillation that starts from the viv onset velocity and grows unrestrictedly with wind velocities parkinson and wawzonek 1981 investigated the interaction between galloping and vortex resonance by tests of a square cylinder the onset velocity lies close to or even lower than the vortex resonance wind speed consequently the mutual effects of the two types of responses exist a simulation and related experiments about a rectangular cylinder b d 2 0 by itoh and tamura 2002 also indicated the combination of viv galloping instability more recent experiments about a square cylinder performed by nemes et al 2012 vigorously support the interaction effect of viv and galloping and a transition from viv to galloping has been found mannini et al 2015 carried out experiments to get insights into the interaction mannini et al 2014 extensively reviewed the previous literature about viv and galloping interaction the response of the section in different situations was drawn as shown in fig 1 there exist no interaction where viv and galloping are separated full interaction where the response occurs around the range of viv and it is dominated by galloping partial interaction and the quenching where a response occurs at velocities lower than the vortex resonance flow speed the quenching effect was observed by santosham 1966 bouclin 1979 parkinson and sullivan 1979 bearman et al 1987 according to parkinson and dicker 1971 for the structures susceptible to both viv and galloping it is hard to determine which form is present previous researches about galloping of square cylinders have revealed only sections with b d in a certain range can gallop from rest parkinson and dicker 1971 these sections are therefore called soft oscillators for those sections with shorter after bodies b d is small galloping cannot erupt spontaneously unless a sufficient initial transverse velocity is given and they are called hard oscillators studies about response for a circular cylinder with auxiliary devices have been scarce the auxiliary devices were introduced to suppress viv while they may also give rise to the potential eruption of galloping even both viv and galloping may be present which makes the response more complicated assi et al 2014 has investigated the response of a circular cylinder attached with fairings and the severe response has been observed but in a discrete range of flow velocities zheng and wang 2017 has resurrected the results in assi et al 2014 by a numerical method to suppress the structure instability free to rotate devices were tested by assi et al 2014 these include free to rotate splitter plates and fairings which is capable of rotating freely around the main cylinder in the flow numerical simulations by xie et al 2015 also show the mitigation effect of free to rotation devices to viv limited work has been carried out about the response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates related researches are listed in table 1 assi et al 2009 has claimed that the circular cylinder gallops when it is attached with 0 25d 2 0d rigid splitter plate where d is the diameter of the cylinder however the test range of reduced velocities is limited and the complete response versus reduced velocity is not available in assi et al 2009 flow visualizations in assi et al 2009 assi and bearman 2015 indicated the reattachment of shear layers to the splitter plates the large added mass is present in assi and bearman 2015 and the frequency of the response is apparently lower than the natural frequency the phase jump in viv of bare circular cylinders vanishes for the response of circular cylinders with splitter plates in assi and bearman 2015 the low frequency galloping can be found in the water tunnel experiments by nemes et al 2012 for structures in air when the mass ratio is much larger the oscillation frequency is roughly equal to the natural frequency corless and parkinson 1988 novak 1972 the galloping response is observed in kawai 1990 where a stationary rigid splitter plate is mounted in the wake of a circular cylinder stappenbelt 2010 conducted water tunnel experiments about the response of a circular cylinder in the presence of splitter plates it was shown that for the cases of short splitter plates the vibration is similar to that of vortex induced vibration where the response is limited in a discrete range of velocity for those longer splitter plates the vibration persists at a high level once the streamwise velocity exceeds a certain value it must be known that the classical galloping for square cylinders occurs at all velocities above a critical value which is the same as the circular cylinder with long splitter plates above all a noticeable difference of response mechanism exists for the circular cylinder in the presence of splitter plates stappenbelt 2010 has categorized all the response as galloping the same as assi et al 2009 very few insights have been made previously about the mechanisms of response for a circular cylinder with splitter plates in the current study detailed wind tunnel experiments were carried out to explore the galloping mechanism for circular cylinders with splitter plates it is found that four kinds of response mechanisms are present for a circular cylinder with detached splitter plates of different lengths 2 experimental method 2 1 wind tunnel and experimental setup all experiments were performed in the low speed wind tunnel at key laboratory of power machinery and engineering ministry of education shanghai jiao tong university the test section was 0 6 m in width and height wind velocities could be adjusted in the range of 0 20 m s turbulence level here was less than 0 2 previous researches about the suppression of viv were carried out by sui et al 2016 in the wind tunnel the used parameters are listed in table 2 rigid hollow perspex tubes were used to make the cylinder model the diameter of bare cylinder model was 50 mm and its thickness was 3 mm corresponding reynolds number in current experiments was 3500 52000 the aspect ratio l d of the cylinder was 9 88 and the blockage ratio was 8 33 the influence of blockage ratio needs to be explained here on the one hand the increasing of blockage ratio would lead to a rise of spanwise correlation length blackburn 1994 the vibration of cylinders can also increase the correlation of vortex shedding along the cylinder axis toebes 1969 on the other hand the impact of blockage ratio also lies in the boundary effect when the vibrating cylinder comes close a wall according to roshko et al 1975 a significant lift is produced to repel the cylinder away from the wall raghavan et al 2009 also found that the wall boundary has an effect of suppressing the oscillatory amplitude raghavan et al 2009 has indicated that for gap ratio 3 0 the boundary effect is negligible the present experimental setup satisfied the condition therefore a correction of the amplitudes was not performed splitter plates were made of thin stainless steel sheets with the thickness of 1 mm the character length of splitter plates in our experiments included 0 4d 0 5d 1 0d 1 5d 2 0d 2 5d 3 0d 4 0d 5 0d the model was installed as shown in fig 2 four springs were mounted symmetrically in both ends of the model and were stretched long enough to remain in large tension avoiding the streamwise disturbance during all tests eight screw nuts and four spring washers at each end were used to restrain the rotation of the model the eight springs were all in the same plane splitter plates were installed stationary downstream of the cylinder the gap between cylinder and splitter plates was 0 2d the spacing 0 2d 10 mm was chosen in the test to mount the cylinder and splitter plates conveniently and make sure the cylinder was close enough to the splitter plate 2 2 measurements the model was allowed only to vibrate in the cross flow direction the corresponding displacement of the model was measured via a laser sensor keyence il 300 with a full range of 140 mm to maintain the air tightness in the experiments a tiny 45 reflector was fixed on the sidewall of the wind tunnel the laser was projected on the surface of the model via the reflection of the reflector the data was acquired through a self developed simultaneous measurement system the sampling card advantech pci1747u here has a high resolution of 16 bits and sampling rate up to 250 khz the sampling rate in present test was 1024 hz which was enough to capture the vibration the sampling program was developed by labview8 1 the sampling period was 60s and 10 amplitude where 10 amplitude was acquired by averaging 10 largest amplitudes of the time history of the displacement after the vibration becomes stable was obtained from the filtered data velocity fluctuations in the streamwise downstream direction were measured through a hotwire probe dantec 5511p the probe was placed at x d 6 0 y d 0 75 as shown in fig 2 the sampling rate was set to be 1000 hz large enough to capture the fluctuation of the velocity 3 method validation experimental setup was validated against the published results of zhou et al 2011 feng 1968 and govardhan and williamson 2000 of a circular cylinder m Œæ s in our experiments was 0 199 natural frequency and damping ratio were determined in the free decay test by fitting oscillation amplitude from the free decay tests to an exponential function y y 0 e Œ∑t where Œ∑ 2œÄf n Œæ s the decaying ratio Œ∑ can be obtained theoretically the damping should be measured in the void without the contribution of the still air resistance which is slightly nonlinear in the test the average damping was selected two initial conditions were used in the test a cylinder starting from rest increasing velocity the amplitude responses a d versus u r obtained through two methods from rest and increasing velocity were compared in fig 3 obviously the two results were in good agreement viv of bare cylinder in the initial condition from rest was selected in comparison with other responses in following figures the result in our experiments was compared to those in previous researches the re range in zhou et al 2011 was 6300 32000 and in present experiments for the bare cylinder it was 3500 17000 in fig 4 it is observed that the typical viv was obtained the synchronization range is from u r 4 45 to u r 9 29 the maximum amplitude a max d 0 62 appears at u r 5 90 the vortex shedding frequency was also added it is shown in fig 5 that st in the present experiment is 0 21 so the present method is well validated fft was applied to analyze the frequency of the streamwise velocity with all amplitudes normalized in fig 6 for u r 5 90 a 2f component and 3f component are found according to belloli et al 2012 the harmonics may be related to vortex shedding mode 4 results and discussion 4 1 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 0 4 0 5 results for the cases of l d 0 4 0 5 are shown in fig 7 apparently more severe responses occur in the presence of splitter plates where the dimensionless peak amplitude for a bare cylinder is roughly 0 62 while for splitter plate cases here they are about 0 87 1 01 the response is also postponed a little occurring at larger wind velocities besides the vibration vanishes abruptly the same as that in experiments conducted by stappenbelt 2010 as displayed in fig 7 the vibration amplitude in stappenbelt 2010 is much larger for the much lower mass damping ratio mass damping ratios are 0 00708 0 199 in stappenbelt 2010 and the present to discern the response here results in stappenbelt 2010 and those in assi et al 2009 assi et al 2014 and assi and bearman 2015 are included to discuss stappenbelt 2010 has ascribed the abrupt halting of response to galloping unlike the typical galloping the vibration is limited in a discrete velocity range however this sudden halt in the response has been also found in viv of noncircular sections fig 8 shows viv of a d section cylinder in feng 1968 a square cylinder in itoh and tamura 2002 and a triangular cylinder in seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 the reason why the response in the cases of short splitter plates is categorized as galloping in assi et al 2009 assi and bearman 2015 and stappenbelt 2010 is the much more severe response besides according to the flow visualization in assi and bearman 2015 and assi et al 2009 separated shear layers reattach to the splitter plate which renders the larger fluid force and the fierce vibration but under the situation of low reduced velocities especially around the viv velocities shear layers are susceptible to reattach to the section with long afterbodies due to the large attack angle during viv this scenario would result in a much larger fluctuating force which feeds the violent response the phase lag between the displacement and the lift force in assi and bearman 2015 remains at a value close to zero in the response of solid splitter plates without a phase jump in viv of circular cylinders as concluded by assi and bearman 2015 the galloping response of solid plates experiences no such shift in œï proving that the excitation mechanism is not of a resonant type where œï is the phase angle between the displacement and the lift is it enough to make the conclusion of galloping based on the absence of sharp phase angle jump and the amplitude response we must know the characteristics of viv are related to the shape of the bluff bodies those in the case of circular cylinders do not necessarily exist in noncircular cases the rapid jump of the phase angle in circular cases derives from the oscillation frequency jump or the change in the timing of vortex formation when the 2 s mode is transformed to the 2p mode govardhan and williamson 2000 phase angles in viv of a d section cylinder and the triangular cylinder do not show a jump which is displayed in fig 9 for the d section cylinder the phase angle varies from about 47 at the start of response to 62 in the end unlike the case of circular cylinders where œï experiences a rapid jump from about 0 to 180 the vortex shedding mode should as well be related to the shape of vibrating structures in seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 a t p pattern is observed t is a triplet vortices p is a pair of vortices for a triangular cylinder ongoren and rockwell 1988 observed in their experiments that phase jump does not occur if the structure has a significant afterbody in zhao et al 2014 for the response of a square cylinder a typical galloping begins to erupt from a u r lower than the viv resonance velocity the vibration follows a linear trail with u r but in the range of viv the trend of linearity would be violated there exists a kink in this regime which proves the dominance of viv instead of galloping as described by zhao et al 2014 the motion is driven by the unsteady vortex shedding as opposed to the long time average aerodynamic forces that dictate the motion during the typical galloping the vortex shedding frequency also shows the typical lock in phenomenon in fig 10 the large mass ratio in present experiments renders the absence of effects of added mass in assi and bearman 2015 and stappenbelt 2010 the added mass is responsible for the low frequency response therefore it is more reasonable conclude that the response here is still viv in the frequency spectrums shown in fig 11 for the case of l d 0 5 higher harmonics are present as well seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 ascribed the higher harmonics to the asymmetry in the vortex shedding of asymmetric sections another interesting phenomenon is the hysteretic effect in the response as shown in fig 7 the response range nearly doubles owing to the hysteretic effect we did a simple initial excitation test to show the phenomenon in fig 12 exerted by different initial conditions the model would end up in totally different situations compared to the hysteretic effect for bare cylinders here it would play a role in extending the response in the case of bare circular cylinders basically the hysteretic effect would only influence the position of the transition point between different response branches 4 2 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 1 0 1 5 the overall amplitudes against u r are displayed in fig 13 it is shown that the response persists at all velocities above a certain value the onset velocity is also lifted compared to viv of bare cylinders besides the onset velocity is increased as the extension of the splitter plate the amplitudes are much higher than that of viv the whole response is not similar to both viv and typical galloping where the vibration mounts up once the velocity exceeds a certain value take the case of l d 1 0 as an example after a local maximum at u r 10 37 the model vibrates less fiercely from a stagnation point at u r 20 02 it would follow a typical galloping trail the vibration amplitude in stappenbelt 2010 continuously increases with the u r unlike the present situation it is a full interaction of viv and galloping as shown in fig 1 the interaction effect in present tests is weaker for the much larger mass damping ratio based on the previous study about viv and galloping of square cylinders we may find some clues about the response here as reviewed by mannini et al 2014 galloping is possible to interact with viv fig 1 shows one of the possible responses when the interaction occurs which is similar to the cases of splitter plates discussed in this part therefore the vibration for a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 1 0 1 5 is the interaction response between viv and galloping besides the onset velocity increases as the lengthening of splitter plates a full interaction of viv and galloping can be witnessed in stappenbelt 2010 fig 14 depicts the trend of vortex shedding frequency versus u r the frequencies are all locked in the natural frequency spectrums of frequency here in fig 15 also illustrate the presence of harmonics especially at the large u r there together exist 2f component and 3f component in the spectrums the hysteretic effect disappears in current cases responses at the all u r can be built spontaneously 4 3 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 the amplitude response for models from rest is analyzed first as displayed in fig 16 the case in this part yields two branches we chose the case of l d 2 5 to discuss in details the first branch in the response is limited in a discrete range from u r 5 00 to u r 6 07 besides the amplitude is much lower than that of viv for bare cylinders afterwards the structure remains stationary till a second onset at u r 10 36 the response recurs at a pace and it is elevated rapidly at u r 14 67 however it is reduced again till a stagnation point at u r 22 19 after which it mounts up again the hysteresis loop makes the response in a totally different trail the oscillations for l d 2 0 3 0 follow a similar trend except a slight offset of the response onset to delve the response mechanism the vortex shedding frequency versus u r is displayed in fig 17 to discuss apparently the viv lock in occurs from the second onset of response the same as the case of l d 1 0 1 5 in the second response here viv is interfering with galloping the motion in this regime is driven by the unsteady vortex shedding first and then the long time mean aerodynamic forces that dictate the typical galloping seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 have also found the transition from viv to galloping in the triangular and square cylinder respectively concerning the first branch of response here it is much weaker and lies in a narrow range the vortex shedding frequency in this region is lower than the natural frequency indicating the response is not viv mannini et al 2016 has found a weak and narrow branch of response before viv for the square cylinder as well according to the previous study it is named as the quenching about the quenching effect bearman et al 1987 has indicated that it is a mitigation of galloping due to the vortex shedding however a similar low speed excitation was as well observed in the literature and it is not ascribable to a galloping excitation naudascher and wang 1993 interpreted this similar response as the resonance with the first mode of vortex shedding due to impinging leading edge vortices ilev it is still debated in the literature about the origin of the excitation mannini et al 2016 found that the onset velocity of this oscillation is independent of mass damping ratio unlike galloping to identify present results we did a test of different mass damping ratios in fig 18 the responses at low velocities for different mass damping ratios are illustrated the starting points remain constant which indicates the response is the velocity restricted excitation not the quenching evident hysteretic effects can be found here leading to a continuous response in increasing velocity in the fft spectrums displayed in fig 19 high frequency components are also present 4 4 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 4 0 5 0 similar to the cases of l d 2 5 2 5 3 0 above responses from rest for the cases of l d 4 0 5 0 in fig 20 here are in discrete ranges the vortex shedding frequency in fig 21 shows that viv is totally absent the structure does not vibrate when the vortex shedding frequency passes the natural frequency apparently the second part of response is a typical galloping trend without any interaction effect the first part in the response needs to be explained as mentioned above the origin of the low speed oscillation needs to be recognized in fig 22 the independence of the starting point from mass damping rations is apparent so the response is the velocity restricted excitation still multiple harmonics have been measured in fig 23 however the appearance of harmonics seems confusing though the asymmetric vortex shedding mode could be responsible further flow visualization is essential to address it the hysteretic loop in the response would act as a bridge rendering a single one branch for the test in increasing velocity 4 5 transient response another interesting phenomenon here is that the built up time needed to reach the steady vibration for pure galloping is much less than that when the response is related to vortex shedding four typical cases of l d 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 from rest are selected to discuss here to clearly show the trend of duration time in each case the time needed to reach a steady vibration was extracted fig 24 displays the history of duration n t to reach a steady amplitude against u r for viv in the case of l d 0 5 the duration is all more than 1000 cycles when viv interacts with galloping the time needed is much less a general trend of n t decrease versus u r can be witnessed besides the built up process for l d 2 0 is shorter than that in l d 1 0 a shrink of the built up time is apparent for the second branch in the case of l d 5 0 which proves the switch from a vortex shedding mechanism to another figs 25 28 show the built up process in the cases discussed here 5 conclusions 1 the viv and galloping response of a circular cylinder with detached splitter plates was explored experimentally in a wind tunnel in the current study 2 for a bare cylinder the synchronization occurs in the range of u r 4 45 9 29 the maximum dimensionless amplitude is about 0 62 the present method is well validated 3 for a circular cylinder with short splitter plates l d 0 4 0 5 the response is limited in a discrete velocity range it is the typical viv in these cases with the further increase of length of splitter plates viv would interact with galloping the high amplitude response occurs once the velocity exceeds a critical wind velocity in the cases of l d 1 0 1 5 a stagnation point exists in the response proving the presence of the interaction effect for the cases of l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 there are two separate branches in the response the amplitude in the first one is much lower than viv of bare cylinder the second response is very similar to that of the cases of l d 1 0 1 5 the difference is the weaker interaction effect for the cases of l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 there are two disperse branches for longer splitter plate cases l d 4 0 5 0 as well they are both more severe than viv and the interaction effect is absent in the latter branch the two branches are the velocity restricted excitation and galloping respectively 4 hysteretic effects can be observed in all cases except l d 1 0 1 5 this indicates under different initial conditions the model would end up in different situations any vibrations in current velocities may be the initial excitation to the response in the next velocity if the model is not set to be stationary 5 the built up time needed for pure galloping to reach a steady amplitude is much less than that in the response when is related to viv 6 harmonics appears in the fft spectrums for all cases asymmetric vortex shedding modes may be responsible for it acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the financial support from the national science foundation of china grant no 11372188 the

23282,researches about the response of a circular cylinder fitted with splitter plates have been performed previously to control viv galloping as a structure instability has been found under some conditions which is of great interest recently however the mechanism of response for a circular cylinder in the presence of splitter plates has rarely been clarified in the present study different vibration characteristics have been observed for a circular cylinder with detached splitter plates 0 4 l d 5 0 where l is the length of splitter plates d is the external diameter of cylinder in a wind tunnel combined with previous study for galloping in square cylinders the patterns were comprehensively described there exist four kinds of response for different lengths of splitter plates viv which lies in a discrete range of wind velocity such as l d 0 4 0 5 the interaction between galloping and viv was also found such as l d 1 0 1 5 a combination of the velocity restricted excitation which occurs before viv onset velocities and interaction of viv and galloping where there exists separate branches in the response such as l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 a combination of the velocity restricted excitation and pure classical galloping such as l d 4 0 5 0 besides it was discovered that the built up time needed for pure galloping to reach a steady amplitude is much less than that when is related to viv furthermore the hysteresis loop was found in cases above fft spectrums of the streamwise velocity show the appearance of multiple harmonics keywords vortex induced vibration viv galloping splitter plates interaction between viv and galloping wind tunnel experiment 1 introduction circular cylinder structures have been widely utilized in practice while flow passes a cylinder alternate vortices shed and oscillating force is exerted on the cylinder structure under certain circumstances where the vortex shedding frequency is close to the nature frequency of the structure severe vibrations can be induced this fluid structure interaction is called vortex induced vibration viv blevins 1990 much attention has been drawn to the suppression of viv owing to the catastrophic events caused by viv severe resonances due to viv may cause the fatigue failure of structures based on the vortex formation mechanisms various strategies have been proposed to suppress the vortex shedding the passive control method has been introduced by attaching a device to the cylinder these devices include strakes splitter plates fairings and so on zdravkovich 1981 owen et al 2001 splitter plates have been verified to be effective to obstruct the separate shear layers interaction and suppress vortex formations roshko 1954 showed separate points can be stabilized by the splitter plates experiments performed by roshko 1954 apelt et al 1973 apelt and west 1975 unal and rockwell 1988 texier et al 2002 akilli et al 2005 gu et al 2012 manifest that the formation length can be extended and fluid force both the drag and the lift are greatly lowered however for flexibly mounted cylinders splitter plates do not necessarily suppress the vibration instead more serious responses can be induced a result in assi et al 2009 showed that the shear layer tends to reattach to the tip of the splitter plates and the strong vibration of the structure ensues separate shear layers would interact with the splitter plates with a higher fluid force exerting on the structure this structure response is categorized as galloping by assi et al 2009 which is common for square cylinders the classical galloping occurs typically for all flow velocities above a critical speed blevins 1990 and the vibration amplitude occurring in galloping is usually much larger than that of viv galloping as with viv is one of the most common flow induced vibrations in practice a fluid force is exerted on the structure in flow with noncircular cross section as the structure oscillates the fluid force changes with orientation to the flow if the oscillation fluid force tends to increase vibrations a large amplitude response can be induced intrinsically all noncircular cross sections are possible to gallop like the circular cylinder for researching viv the square cylinder is suitable for galloping study plenty of researches have been performed previously about the galloping response for the square cylinders in the smooth flow b and d b and d are streamwise and cross flow section dimensions are the key parameters to determine whether galloping is possible to occur in particular rectangular cylinders without specific b d are unable with respect to galloping parkinson 1963 for very small b d the section is stable at rest for the intermediate b d 0 75 b d 3 4 the sections can gallop from rest it has been revealed that the shear layers separating from the bluff body is crucial to the galloping phenomenon blevins 1990 corless and parkinson 1988 reattachments of shear layers would lead to the formation of a fluid force that strengthens the vibration this interaction of shear layers with the section afterbody is thought to be responsible for the typical galloping besides any section is susceptible to viv for those sections that can gallop it is possible that the two types of flow induced vibrations can interact with each other where galloping occurs in the range of viv lock in region scruton 1963 observed an oscillation that starts from the viv onset velocity and grows unrestrictedly with wind velocities parkinson and wawzonek 1981 investigated the interaction between galloping and vortex resonance by tests of a square cylinder the onset velocity lies close to or even lower than the vortex resonance wind speed consequently the mutual effects of the two types of responses exist a simulation and related experiments about a rectangular cylinder b d 2 0 by itoh and tamura 2002 also indicated the combination of viv galloping instability more recent experiments about a square cylinder performed by nemes et al 2012 vigorously support the interaction effect of viv and galloping and a transition from viv to galloping has been found mannini et al 2015 carried out experiments to get insights into the interaction mannini et al 2014 extensively reviewed the previous literature about viv and galloping interaction the response of the section in different situations was drawn as shown in fig 1 there exist no interaction where viv and galloping are separated full interaction where the response occurs around the range of viv and it is dominated by galloping partial interaction and the quenching where a response occurs at velocities lower than the vortex resonance flow speed the quenching effect was observed by santosham 1966 bouclin 1979 parkinson and sullivan 1979 bearman et al 1987 according to parkinson and dicker 1971 for the structures susceptible to both viv and galloping it is hard to determine which form is present previous researches about galloping of square cylinders have revealed only sections with b d in a certain range can gallop from rest parkinson and dicker 1971 these sections are therefore called soft oscillators for those sections with shorter after bodies b d is small galloping cannot erupt spontaneously unless a sufficient initial transverse velocity is given and they are called hard oscillators studies about response for a circular cylinder with auxiliary devices have been scarce the auxiliary devices were introduced to suppress viv while they may also give rise to the potential eruption of galloping even both viv and galloping may be present which makes the response more complicated assi et al 2014 has investigated the response of a circular cylinder attached with fairings and the severe response has been observed but in a discrete range of flow velocities zheng and wang 2017 has resurrected the results in assi et al 2014 by a numerical method to suppress the structure instability free to rotate devices were tested by assi et al 2014 these include free to rotate splitter plates and fairings which is capable of rotating freely around the main cylinder in the flow numerical simulations by xie et al 2015 also show the mitigation effect of free to rotation devices to viv limited work has been carried out about the response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates related researches are listed in table 1 assi et al 2009 has claimed that the circular cylinder gallops when it is attached with 0 25d 2 0d rigid splitter plate where d is the diameter of the cylinder however the test range of reduced velocities is limited and the complete response versus reduced velocity is not available in assi et al 2009 flow visualizations in assi et al 2009 assi and bearman 2015 indicated the reattachment of shear layers to the splitter plates the large added mass is present in assi and bearman 2015 and the frequency of the response is apparently lower than the natural frequency the phase jump in viv of bare circular cylinders vanishes for the response of circular cylinders with splitter plates in assi and bearman 2015 the low frequency galloping can be found in the water tunnel experiments by nemes et al 2012 for structures in air when the mass ratio is much larger the oscillation frequency is roughly equal to the natural frequency corless and parkinson 1988 novak 1972 the galloping response is observed in kawai 1990 where a stationary rigid splitter plate is mounted in the wake of a circular cylinder stappenbelt 2010 conducted water tunnel experiments about the response of a circular cylinder in the presence of splitter plates it was shown that for the cases of short splitter plates the vibration is similar to that of vortex induced vibration where the response is limited in a discrete range of velocity for those longer splitter plates the vibration persists at a high level once the streamwise velocity exceeds a certain value it must be known that the classical galloping for square cylinders occurs at all velocities above a critical value which is the same as the circular cylinder with long splitter plates above all a noticeable difference of response mechanism exists for the circular cylinder in the presence of splitter plates stappenbelt 2010 has categorized all the response as galloping the same as assi et al 2009 very few insights have been made previously about the mechanisms of response for a circular cylinder with splitter plates in the current study detailed wind tunnel experiments were carried out to explore the galloping mechanism for circular cylinders with splitter plates it is found that four kinds of response mechanisms are present for a circular cylinder with detached splitter plates of different lengths 2 experimental method 2 1 wind tunnel and experimental setup all experiments were performed in the low speed wind tunnel at key laboratory of power machinery and engineering ministry of education shanghai jiao tong university the test section was 0 6 m in width and height wind velocities could be adjusted in the range of 0 20 m s turbulence level here was less than 0 2 previous researches about the suppression of viv were carried out by sui et al 2016 in the wind tunnel the used parameters are listed in table 2 rigid hollow perspex tubes were used to make the cylinder model the diameter of bare cylinder model was 50 mm and its thickness was 3 mm corresponding reynolds number in current experiments was 3500 52000 the aspect ratio l d of the cylinder was 9 88 and the blockage ratio was 8 33 the influence of blockage ratio needs to be explained here on the one hand the increasing of blockage ratio would lead to a rise of spanwise correlation length blackburn 1994 the vibration of cylinders can also increase the correlation of vortex shedding along the cylinder axis toebes 1969 on the other hand the impact of blockage ratio also lies in the boundary effect when the vibrating cylinder comes close a wall according to roshko et al 1975 a significant lift is produced to repel the cylinder away from the wall raghavan et al 2009 also found that the wall boundary has an effect of suppressing the oscillatory amplitude raghavan et al 2009 has indicated that for gap ratio 3 0 the boundary effect is negligible the present experimental setup satisfied the condition therefore a correction of the amplitudes was not performed splitter plates were made of thin stainless steel sheets with the thickness of 1 mm the character length of splitter plates in our experiments included 0 4d 0 5d 1 0d 1 5d 2 0d 2 5d 3 0d 4 0d 5 0d the model was installed as shown in fig 2 four springs were mounted symmetrically in both ends of the model and were stretched long enough to remain in large tension avoiding the streamwise disturbance during all tests eight screw nuts and four spring washers at each end were used to restrain the rotation of the model the eight springs were all in the same plane splitter plates were installed stationary downstream of the cylinder the gap between cylinder and splitter plates was 0 2d the spacing 0 2d 10 mm was chosen in the test to mount the cylinder and splitter plates conveniently and make sure the cylinder was close enough to the splitter plate 2 2 measurements the model was allowed only to vibrate in the cross flow direction the corresponding displacement of the model was measured via a laser sensor keyence il 300 with a full range of 140 mm to maintain the air tightness in the experiments a tiny 45 reflector was fixed on the sidewall of the wind tunnel the laser was projected on the surface of the model via the reflection of the reflector the data was acquired through a self developed simultaneous measurement system the sampling card advantech pci1747u here has a high resolution of 16 bits and sampling rate up to 250 khz the sampling rate in present test was 1024 hz which was enough to capture the vibration the sampling program was developed by labview8 1 the sampling period was 60s and 10 amplitude where 10 amplitude was acquired by averaging 10 largest amplitudes of the time history of the displacement after the vibration becomes stable was obtained from the filtered data velocity fluctuations in the streamwise downstream direction were measured through a hotwire probe dantec 5511p the probe was placed at x d 6 0 y d 0 75 as shown in fig 2 the sampling rate was set to be 1000 hz large enough to capture the fluctuation of the velocity 3 method validation experimental setup was validated against the published results of zhou et al 2011 feng 1968 and govardhan and williamson 2000 of a circular cylinder m Œæ s in our experiments was 0 199 natural frequency and damping ratio were determined in the free decay test by fitting oscillation amplitude from the free decay tests to an exponential function y y 0 e Œ∑t where Œ∑ 2œÄf n Œæ s the decaying ratio Œ∑ can be obtained theoretically the damping should be measured in the void without the contribution of the still air resistance which is slightly nonlinear in the test the average damping was selected two initial conditions were used in the test a cylinder starting from rest increasing velocity the amplitude responses a d versus u r obtained through two methods from rest and increasing velocity were compared in fig 3 obviously the two results were in good agreement viv of bare cylinder in the initial condition from rest was selected in comparison with other responses in following figures the result in our experiments was compared to those in previous researches the re range in zhou et al 2011 was 6300 32000 and in present experiments for the bare cylinder it was 3500 17000 in fig 4 it is observed that the typical viv was obtained the synchronization range is from u r 4 45 to u r 9 29 the maximum amplitude a max d 0 62 appears at u r 5 90 the vortex shedding frequency was also added it is shown in fig 5 that st in the present experiment is 0 21 so the present method is well validated fft was applied to analyze the frequency of the streamwise velocity with all amplitudes normalized in fig 6 for u r 5 90 a 2f component and 3f component are found according to belloli et al 2012 the harmonics may be related to vortex shedding mode 4 results and discussion 4 1 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 0 4 0 5 results for the cases of l d 0 4 0 5 are shown in fig 7 apparently more severe responses occur in the presence of splitter plates where the dimensionless peak amplitude for a bare cylinder is roughly 0 62 while for splitter plate cases here they are about 0 87 1 01 the response is also postponed a little occurring at larger wind velocities besides the vibration vanishes abruptly the same as that in experiments conducted by stappenbelt 2010 as displayed in fig 7 the vibration amplitude in stappenbelt 2010 is much larger for the much lower mass damping ratio mass damping ratios are 0 00708 0 199 in stappenbelt 2010 and the present to discern the response here results in stappenbelt 2010 and those in assi et al 2009 assi et al 2014 and assi and bearman 2015 are included to discuss stappenbelt 2010 has ascribed the abrupt halting of response to galloping unlike the typical galloping the vibration is limited in a discrete velocity range however this sudden halt in the response has been also found in viv of noncircular sections fig 8 shows viv of a d section cylinder in feng 1968 a square cylinder in itoh and tamura 2002 and a triangular cylinder in seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 the reason why the response in the cases of short splitter plates is categorized as galloping in assi et al 2009 assi and bearman 2015 and stappenbelt 2010 is the much more severe response besides according to the flow visualization in assi and bearman 2015 and assi et al 2009 separated shear layers reattach to the splitter plate which renders the larger fluid force and the fierce vibration but under the situation of low reduced velocities especially around the viv velocities shear layers are susceptible to reattach to the section with long afterbodies due to the large attack angle during viv this scenario would result in a much larger fluctuating force which feeds the violent response the phase lag between the displacement and the lift force in assi and bearman 2015 remains at a value close to zero in the response of solid splitter plates without a phase jump in viv of circular cylinders as concluded by assi and bearman 2015 the galloping response of solid plates experiences no such shift in œï proving that the excitation mechanism is not of a resonant type where œï is the phase angle between the displacement and the lift is it enough to make the conclusion of galloping based on the absence of sharp phase angle jump and the amplitude response we must know the characteristics of viv are related to the shape of the bluff bodies those in the case of circular cylinders do not necessarily exist in noncircular cases the rapid jump of the phase angle in circular cases derives from the oscillation frequency jump or the change in the timing of vortex formation when the 2 s mode is transformed to the 2p mode govardhan and williamson 2000 phase angles in viv of a d section cylinder and the triangular cylinder do not show a jump which is displayed in fig 9 for the d section cylinder the phase angle varies from about 47 at the start of response to 62 in the end unlike the case of circular cylinders where œï experiences a rapid jump from about 0 to 180 the vortex shedding mode should as well be related to the shape of vibrating structures in seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 a t p pattern is observed t is a triplet vortices p is a pair of vortices for a triangular cylinder ongoren and rockwell 1988 observed in their experiments that phase jump does not occur if the structure has a significant afterbody in zhao et al 2014 for the response of a square cylinder a typical galloping begins to erupt from a u r lower than the viv resonance velocity the vibration follows a linear trail with u r but in the range of viv the trend of linearity would be violated there exists a kink in this regime which proves the dominance of viv instead of galloping as described by zhao et al 2014 the motion is driven by the unsteady vortex shedding as opposed to the long time average aerodynamic forces that dictate the motion during the typical galloping the vortex shedding frequency also shows the typical lock in phenomenon in fig 10 the large mass ratio in present experiments renders the absence of effects of added mass in assi and bearman 2015 and stappenbelt 2010 the added mass is responsible for the low frequency response therefore it is more reasonable conclude that the response here is still viv in the frequency spectrums shown in fig 11 for the case of l d 0 5 higher harmonics are present as well seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 ascribed the higher harmonics to the asymmetry in the vortex shedding of asymmetric sections another interesting phenomenon is the hysteretic effect in the response as shown in fig 7 the response range nearly doubles owing to the hysteretic effect we did a simple initial excitation test to show the phenomenon in fig 12 exerted by different initial conditions the model would end up in totally different situations compared to the hysteretic effect for bare cylinders here it would play a role in extending the response in the case of bare circular cylinders basically the hysteretic effect would only influence the position of the transition point between different response branches 4 2 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 1 0 1 5 the overall amplitudes against u r are displayed in fig 13 it is shown that the response persists at all velocities above a certain value the onset velocity is also lifted compared to viv of bare cylinders besides the onset velocity is increased as the extension of the splitter plate the amplitudes are much higher than that of viv the whole response is not similar to both viv and typical galloping where the vibration mounts up once the velocity exceeds a certain value take the case of l d 1 0 as an example after a local maximum at u r 10 37 the model vibrates less fiercely from a stagnation point at u r 20 02 it would follow a typical galloping trail the vibration amplitude in stappenbelt 2010 continuously increases with the u r unlike the present situation it is a full interaction of viv and galloping as shown in fig 1 the interaction effect in present tests is weaker for the much larger mass damping ratio based on the previous study about viv and galloping of square cylinders we may find some clues about the response here as reviewed by mannini et al 2014 galloping is possible to interact with viv fig 1 shows one of the possible responses when the interaction occurs which is similar to the cases of splitter plates discussed in this part therefore the vibration for a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 1 0 1 5 is the interaction response between viv and galloping besides the onset velocity increases as the lengthening of splitter plates a full interaction of viv and galloping can be witnessed in stappenbelt 2010 fig 14 depicts the trend of vortex shedding frequency versus u r the frequencies are all locked in the natural frequency spectrums of frequency here in fig 15 also illustrate the presence of harmonics especially at the large u r there together exist 2f component and 3f component in the spectrums the hysteretic effect disappears in current cases responses at the all u r can be built spontaneously 4 3 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 the amplitude response for models from rest is analyzed first as displayed in fig 16 the case in this part yields two branches we chose the case of l d 2 5 to discuss in details the first branch in the response is limited in a discrete range from u r 5 00 to u r 6 07 besides the amplitude is much lower than that of viv for bare cylinders afterwards the structure remains stationary till a second onset at u r 10 36 the response recurs at a pace and it is elevated rapidly at u r 14 67 however it is reduced again till a stagnation point at u r 22 19 after which it mounts up again the hysteresis loop makes the response in a totally different trail the oscillations for l d 2 0 3 0 follow a similar trend except a slight offset of the response onset to delve the response mechanism the vortex shedding frequency versus u r is displayed in fig 17 to discuss apparently the viv lock in occurs from the second onset of response the same as the case of l d 1 0 1 5 in the second response here viv is interfering with galloping the motion in this regime is driven by the unsteady vortex shedding first and then the long time mean aerodynamic forces that dictate the typical galloping seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 have also found the transition from viv to galloping in the triangular and square cylinder respectively concerning the first branch of response here it is much weaker and lies in a narrow range the vortex shedding frequency in this region is lower than the natural frequency indicating the response is not viv mannini et al 2016 has found a weak and narrow branch of response before viv for the square cylinder as well according to the previous study it is named as the quenching about the quenching effect bearman et al 1987 has indicated that it is a mitigation of galloping due to the vortex shedding however a similar low speed excitation was as well observed in the literature and it is not ascribable to a galloping excitation naudascher and wang 1993 interpreted this similar response as the resonance with the first mode of vortex shedding due to impinging leading edge vortices ilev it is still debated in the literature about the origin of the excitation mannini et al 2016 found that the onset velocity of this oscillation is independent of mass damping ratio unlike galloping to identify present results we did a test of different mass damping ratios in fig 18 the responses at low velocities for different mass damping ratios are illustrated the starting points remain constant which indicates the response is the velocity restricted excitation not the quenching evident hysteretic effects can be found here leading to a continuous response in increasing velocity in the fft spectrums displayed in fig 19 high frequency components are also present 4 4 response of a circular cylinder with splitter plates of l d 4 0 5 0 similar to the cases of l d 2 5 2 5 3 0 above responses from rest for the cases of l d 4 0 5 0 in fig 20 here are in discrete ranges the vortex shedding frequency in fig 21 shows that viv is totally absent the structure does not vibrate when the vortex shedding frequency passes the natural frequency apparently the second part of response is a typical galloping trend without any interaction effect the first part in the response needs to be explained as mentioned above the origin of the low speed oscillation needs to be recognized in fig 22 the independence of the starting point from mass damping rations is apparent so the response is the velocity restricted excitation still multiple harmonics have been measured in fig 23 however the appearance of harmonics seems confusing though the asymmetric vortex shedding mode could be responsible further flow visualization is essential to address it the hysteretic loop in the response would act as a bridge rendering a single one branch for the test in increasing velocity 4 5 transient response another interesting phenomenon here is that the built up time needed to reach the steady vibration for pure galloping is much less than that when the response is related to vortex shedding four typical cases of l d 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 from rest are selected to discuss here to clearly show the trend of duration time in each case the time needed to reach a steady vibration was extracted fig 24 displays the history of duration n t to reach a steady amplitude against u r for viv in the case of l d 0 5 the duration is all more than 1000 cycles when viv interacts with galloping the time needed is much less a general trend of n t decrease versus u r can be witnessed besides the built up process for l d 2 0 is shorter than that in l d 1 0 a shrink of the built up time is apparent for the second branch in the case of l d 5 0 which proves the switch from a vortex shedding mechanism to another figs 25 28 show the built up process in the cases discussed here 5 conclusions 1 the viv and galloping response of a circular cylinder with detached splitter plates was explored experimentally in a wind tunnel in the current study 2 for a bare cylinder the synchronization occurs in the range of u r 4 45 9 29 the maximum dimensionless amplitude is about 0 62 the present method is well validated 3 for a circular cylinder with short splitter plates l d 0 4 0 5 the response is limited in a discrete velocity range it is the typical viv in these cases with the further increase of length of splitter plates viv would interact with galloping the high amplitude response occurs once the velocity exceeds a critical wind velocity in the cases of l d 1 0 1 5 a stagnation point exists in the response proving the presence of the interaction effect for the cases of l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 there are two separate branches in the response the amplitude in the first one is much lower than viv of bare cylinder the second response is very similar to that of the cases of l d 1 0 1 5 the difference is the weaker interaction effect for the cases of l d 2 0 2 5 3 0 there are two disperse branches for longer splitter plate cases l d 4 0 5 0 as well they are both more severe than viv and the interaction effect is absent in the latter branch the two branches are the velocity restricted excitation and galloping respectively 4 hysteretic effects can be observed in all cases except l d 1 0 1 5 this indicates under different initial conditions the model would end up in different situations any vibrations in current velocities may be the initial excitation to the response in the next velocity if the model is not set to be stationary 5 the built up time needed for pure galloping to reach a steady amplitude is much less than that in the response when is related to viv 6 harmonics appears in the fft spectrums for all cases asymmetric vortex shedding modes may be responsible for it acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the financial support from the national science foundation of china grant no 11372188 the

23283,this paper presents an optimization approach for the nonlinear control of wave energy converters wecs the proposed optimization method also presents the option of optimizing the system nonlinearities such as those due to the buoy shape such that the harvested energy is maximized for the sake of control design the control force and the system optimizable nonlinear force each is expressed as a truncated power series function of the system states the power series coefficients in both the control and system forces are optimized a hidden genes genetic algorithm is used for optimization the optimized system s nonlinear force is assumed to drive the design of the wec the numerical test cases presented in this paper show that it is possible to attain multiple fold higher harvested energy when using nonlinear control optimization the advantage of being able to optimize the wec design simultaneously with the control is the potential of harvesting this multiple fold higher energy without causing large wec motion and with less dependence on reactive power while this paper focuses on the optimization part of the problem the implementation of the obtained control in realtime is discussed at the end of the paper keywords wave energy conversion nonlinear wave energy conversion wec nonlinear control optimization 1 introduction one of the challenges in wave energy harvesting is the buoy motion control there has been significant developments on different control methods for wave energy converters wecs falnes 2007 most studies on the control of one degree of freedom heaving wecs adopt a linear dynamic model the cummins equation cummins which can be written as 1 m a z f e x u b v z k z f r where z is the heave displacement m is the buoy mass k is the hydrostatic stiffness due to buoyancy a is the added mass at infinite f e x is the excitation force u is the control force b v is a viscous damping coefficient and f r is the radiation damping force the buoyancy stiffness term is called the hydrostatic force this is linear model is usually implemented using boundary element methods bem that assume small motions around the mean position there are however multiple sources of possible nonlinearities in the wec dynamic model wolgamot and fitzgerald 2015 for example if the buoy shape is not a vertical cylinder near the water surface then the hydrostatic force will be nonlinear the coupling between the heave and pitch modes in a point absorber is nonlinear villegas and van der schaaf 2011 zou et al 2017 the hydrodynamic forces can also be nonlinear in the case of large motion giorgi et al 2016 control strategies that aim at maximizing the harvested energy usually increase the motion amplitude and hence the impact of these nonlinearities increases reference giorgi et al 2016 presents a numerical analysis for the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces at different levels from a full nonlinear model using computational fluid dynamics cfd tools to linear models corrected by the nonlinear froude krylov force as well as nonlinear viscous and hydrostatic forces the power take off pto unit may have nonlinearities as well bacelli et al 2015 reference retes et al 2015a points out that different wec systems should choose only the relevant nonlinear effects to avoid unnecessary computational costs for example in the case of heaving point absorbers the nonlinear froude krylov force is essential while the nonlinear diffraction and radiation can be neglected the nonlinear viscous effects are weak as well for point absorbers retes et al 2015a the nonlinear pto and mooring effects seem to be significant in fact references merigaud et al retes et al 2015b focus on the nonlinear froudekrylov forces and show that they are the dominant nonlinearities in the case of a heaving point absorber with nonuniform cross sectional area reference giorgi 2017 discusses representative linear models that provide an average model over the full operational space these models are more accurate than the linear models in the cases of large motions yet due to the average nature of these representative models they may not be very useful in controlling a wec in large motion linearizing the wec motion about an operation point is also not always feasible due to the fact that ocean waves change characteristic continuously and hence there is no single operation point reference penalba et al 2017 points out that for wec control in the case of large motions nonlinear models are inevitable reference giorgi and ringwood 2016 presents a computationally efficient way of computing the static and dynamic nonlinear froude krylov forces two methods are presented in giorgi and ringwood 2016 the first method assumes that the wave length is considerably longer than the characteristic length of the device and hence ignores the dependance of the pressure on the buoy surface on the surge coordinate the second method uses a mclaurin expansion to simplify the force integral calculation the latter method was demonstrated to be more accurate for various sea states most of the studies described above consider the modeling of different nonlinearities of a given wec and use the relevant ones in modeling the system reference giorgi and ringwood 2016 found that the harvested energy of the nonlinear wec is less than that of the linear system when using a latching control babarit et al 2004 durand et al cl√©ment and babarit 1959 nonlinear systems however possess some characteristics that can be exploited for higher harvested energy as pointed out in nayfeh and mook 2008 robinett and wilson 2011 this paper addresses the nonlinear one degree of freedom heaving wec from a different prospective the goal here is not to model the nonlinearities in the system rather the goal is to increase the harvested energy of the nonlinear wec compared to the linear one one way to increase the harvested energy of a nonlinear wec is to design a controller for the nonlinear wec in other words the control optimization process should take into account the nonlinearities in the wec allowing the control force to be nonlinear function of the system states the energy can be further increased if in addition to optimizing the control we optimize the system nonlinearities simultaneously with the control the nonlinear froudekrylov force for instance is dictated by the buoy shape hence the buoy shape can be optimized along with the control to maximize the energy the froudekrylov force is one source of the system nonlinearities in this paper the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic hydro forces along with all other optimizable nonlinear forces are referred to as the system nonlinearities the system nonlinearities and the control also nonlinear are here optimized simultaneously for the sake of control design it is convenient to express the optimizable system nonlinearities as a series function as follows 2 f s i 1 n s Œ± s i z i j 1 m s Œ≤ s j z j s i g n z where f s is the nonlinear force Œ± s i and Œ≤ s i are constant coefficients i n s and m s are the number of nonlinear terms that determine the order of the nonlinear forces eq 2 is written intuitively consider for example the proportional derivative pd controls which are widely used in linear systems in a pd control the proportional part is constructed as linear term in the state and the derivative term is constructed as a linear term in the state derivative the proportional term is a stiffness term since it has spring like effect which means this part of the force does not add remove energy on average the derivative term however is a damper like term and it continuously adds removes power one might think of nonlinear stiffness or damping terms as discussed in details in several references such as nayfeh and mook 2008 the first term in f s represents a nonlinear stiffness force and the second term contains a nonlinear damping force note that all Œ≤ s j are always negative coefficients and hence the second term is always a damping term energy flow is always from the water to the device optimizing the system nonlinearities means in this case finding the optimal coefficients Œ± s i and Œ≤ s i once the control and f s are optimized the wec system e g the buoy shape is designed so that the wec nonlinear force matches the optimized nonlinear force f s this last step of designing a wec system to generate a prescribed nonlinear force is not addressed in this paper the focus of this paper is on the optimization of f s and the control section 4 3 however presents a numerical case study for demonstration of optimizing both the control and the buoy shape simultaneously the cases when the optimized f s cannot be realized will also be discussed in section 6 also the case when there are nonlinear forces in the system that are not optimizable is addressed in section 6 2 dynamic model of the nonlinear wec system this section presents the dynamic model that will be used to approximate a nonlinear wec for the purpose of control design the nonlinearities in the dynamic model could be because of the buoy shape the large buoy motions and or the pto to model a nonlinear wec we start with a linear approximation that has a buoy of height h this is here referred to as the baseline model to simplify the presentation we start by assuming a regular wave then the work is extended to irregular waves in section 5 for the case of a linear wec in a regular wave the radiation force reduces to a linear damping and an added mass term the equation of motion in eq 1 then becomes 3 m a z c b v z k z f e x u where c is the radiation damping coefficient and a is the added mass at the excitation frequency the excitation force in this case can be written as 4 f e x f ÀÜ c o s œâ t œï where œâ is the excitation force frequency f ÀÜ is the amplitude of excitation force and œï is the phase of excitation force now consider the case of a nonlinear wec in which the additional nonlinear force compared to the baseline model in eq 3 is f s the nonlinear force f s is expressed as in eq 2 the control force is expressed as a summation of two quantities u u l u c where u l is the linear part of the control and u c is the nonlinear control part which is assumed in the form 5 u c i 1 n c Œ± c i z i j 2 m c Œ≤ c j z j where Œ± c i Œ≤ c i are constant coefficients i n c and m c are the number of nonlinear terms that determine the order of control forces the equation of motion of the system then is 6 m a z b v z k z f e x f r u l u c f s the equation of motion eq 6 is derived assuming that the buoy does not leave the water nor gets fully submerged in the water in the case of nonlinear wecs presented in this paper the motion of the buoy may grow large and these two cases should not be excluded hence the model in eq 6 is modified as follows consider the coordinates defined in fig 1 a range z z s is defined in which the model in eq 6 is considered valid the limit z s is selected based on the buoy dimensions and the wave height when z z s there are two possible cases the first case is when z 0 that is the buoy is or very close to being fully submerged under water the second case is when z 0 that is the buoy is or very close to being totally out of the water in these two cases the dynamic model in eq 6 is not valid and an approximate dynamic model is defined as follows case 1 z 0 the linear stiffness term becomes a constant k h 2 the nonlinear stiffness force will also be saturated that is f s i 2 n s Œ± s i h 2 i j 1 m s Œ≤ s j z j s i g n z the excitation force is assumed to remain the same as in eq 4 case 2 z 0 the buoy is out of the water so there is no buoyancy force on it meaning that k z m g where g is the gravitational acceleration there is no excitation force acting on the wec and there is no linear damping term in eq 6 also the nonlinear hydro force vanishes that is f s 0 the equation of motion reduces to m z m g u l u c the harvested power p t is expressed as 7 p t u c t u l z t u z t in the analysis conducted in this study u l is assumed a damping force as follows 8 u l b z where b is the linear control force damping coefficient b is negative the equation of motion in all the cases can be written in the state space form shown in eq 9 9 z z a z z 1 m 0 u l u c f s 1 m 0 f e x f r 1 m 0 g where g is defined as in eq 10 10 g 0 if z z s k h 2 if z z s z 0 m g if z z s z 0 the excitation force is defined in eq 4 except when z z s and z 0 it vanishes the linear damping coefficient is assumed constant in this paper the a matrix in eq 9 is defined as in equation 11 11 a 0 1 k m c m if z z s 0 1 0 0 if z z s in the above nonlinear wec model there are design coefficients for control design in eq 5 there are also coefficients in eq 2 for the nonlinear force in the dynamic model for a given buoy and wave conditions these coefficients in eq 2 will be fixed and a control design process would optimize the coefficients in eq 5 for optimal performance in this paper however it is assumed that the buoy is not yet designed and it is here attempted to optimize both sets of coefficients for maximum performance in other words we try to optimize both the control and the wec nonlinear forces simultaneously section 3 presents a case study on a buoy in a regular wave 3 case study 1 this section presents a simple illustrative numerical example to highlight the advantages that can be attained when optimizing both the system and control nonlinear forces consider the case of a system described by eq 9 that has optimizable nonlinear forces assume a buoy mass of 1 76 10 5 kg the linear stiffness force coefficient is 4 5449 10 5 kg s 2 the linear damping coefficient is 170 kg s the linear control force damping coefficient is 4 10 4 kg s the reference amplitude of excitation force is 263980 n its frequency is 0 628 rad s and its phase is 0 1 rad the buoy height is assumed 7 6 m and the limit z s is 3 4 m for the nonlinear part the number of nonlinear terms in the system nonlinear force is selected as n s 4 and m s 2 the nonlinear hydro force coefficients are 12

3211 6816 15 Œ≤ c 93730 1448 313067 8210 345133 6546 simulations are conducted for 60 s for this illustrative case the extracted energy from the linear system assuming no nonlinearities in the system is 3 247588 10 5 joules while the extracted energy from the nonlinear system is 6 615232 10 5 joules in 60 s as shown in fig 2 the nonlinear system produces about 2 0 times the energy harvested by the linear system fig 3 shows the power extracted by each system as expected the linear system does not need any reactive power since the control is just a linear damping the nonlinear system in this case needs reactive power the amount of which is very small though compared to the harvested power as shown in fig 3 where a zoom is made on a small part to show the level of reactive power note that the amount of reactive power dictates the size of the energy storage needed by the control system and the control designs that require less reactive power have the advantage of lower cost and less complexity compared to those control strategies that require bigger energy storage fig 4 shows the displacement for both systems where the dash horizontal line represents the z s limit beyond which the buoy is either totally in the air or totally submerged after an initial transition period the displacements of both wecs have about the same amplitude and frequency the same can be said about the velocities this result highlights the significant advantage that can be obtained when designing both the shape and the control simultaneously when designing for higher harvested energy the control design usually exploits the system nonlinearities and results in higher amplitude motions as compared to the linear motion in this case study however the nonlinear system has about the same motion amplitude as the linear one the reason is due to the nonlinear system force the latter seem to cancel the effect of the nonlinear control force on the buoy motion yet in computing the harvested power only the control force is multiplied by the buoy velocity the system force does not cancel the nonlinear control force in the power calculation if the reference amplitude of excitation force is increased to 1319900 n the amount of harvested energy increases to about 2 7 that of the linear system with minimal need for reactive power and a small motion amplitude 4 optimization using genetic algorithms before proceeding to the more realistic case of a buoy in irregular wave in section 5 we point out that the shape and control coefficients can be optimized so as to maximize the harvested energy the optimization problem can be formulated as follows 16 m a x i m i z e e 0 t p t d t subject to eq 9 where e is the energy harvested over a period t which can be expressed as 17 e 0 t p t d t 0 t u z d t 0 t z b z i 1 n c Œ± c i z i j 2 m c Œ≤ c j z j d t the design variables in this optimization problem are n s m s n c m c Œ± s i Œ≤ s j i 1 n s and j 1 m s Œ± c k and Œ≤ c l k 1 n c and l 1 m c the overall number of variables is variable since n s m s n c and m c are variables the variables n s m s n c and m c are usually referred to as architecture topology variables since they determine the overall number of variables to be optimized also this type of problem is usually referred to as a variable sized design space vsds optimization problem here the recently developed hidden gene genetic algorithm hgga abdelkhalik 2013 will be used to solve this optimization problem the hgga adopted in this paper is an optimization algorithm designed to handle vsds optimization problems section 4 1 briefs the hgga and section 4 2 details its implementation to optimize the control and shape of the case study presented in section 3 4 1 hidden genes genetic algorithm in standard genetic algorithms gas the variables of the optimization problem are coded in chromosomes each chromosome represents a solution and consists of the variables that are coded as genes the objective of optimization determines the fitness of the solution in fig 5 a solution with n variables is shown as a chromosome with n genes g 1 g 2 g n the genetic operations of selection mutation and crossover are applied on a population of these chromosomes and through generations iterations theses populations converge toward the optimal solution a simple ga starts with selecting two parents from the current generation or the randomly generated initial population this is called the selection process there are several criteria for selecting the two parents the one that is adopted here is the roulette wheel selection operator where a member is selected with a probability proportional to its fitness next mutation and crossover operations are applied on the selected parents as an example in binary coding genes are coded as 0s and 1s in the mutation process gene 1 may change to 0 with a probability of p m in the crossover operation parts of the chromosome strings are swapped in parents with a probability of p c to create new chromosomes some of the best chromosomes elite are transferred to the next generation with no change by repeating the ga operations in each generation the population converges to the optimal solution the hgga implemented in this paper is a biologically inspired approach that hides different genes in different chromosomes to create solutions of different architectures using the same coding method the chromosome string abdelkhalik 2013 by setting the chromosome length to the length of the longest possible chromosome l m a x assuming maximum number of design variables and turning some genes off different solutions of different architectures with lengths varying from of 1 to l m a x can be constructed the genes that are hidden are variables that do not affect the fitness of the solution yet they carry information they go through ga operations and may become active not hidden in future generations as an example a single point crossover operator in hgga is shown in fig 6 in this example the genes go through the crossover operator regardless of the hidden genes positions meaning that the genes are swapped at a random crossover point in fig 6 it is between the second and the third genes with probability p c just like a normal crossover operator then some genes in the children chromosomes are assigned as hidden based on the hidden gene assignment mechanism abdelkhalik and darani 2016 the implementation of the hgga to the wec control optimization is described in sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 2 optimization of case study 1 it is required to find the optimal number of nonlinear control and system coefficients as well as their values such that the objective function extracted energy is maximized the case study presented in section 3 is here optimized to maximize the harvested energy a population of 20 members along with only 5 generations are used in optimization the number of elite members is 2 a saturation limit is assumed on the nonlinear control force u c this saturation limit is equal to 1 1 m a x f e x also solutions that result in very high motion amplitude are excluded the maximum possible value for each of n s and n c is selected to be 6 while the maximum possible value for each of m s and m c is selected to be 4 this means that the chromosome is structured such that it has 6 genes for Œ± s 6 genes for Œ± c 4 genes for Œ≤ s and 4 genes for Œ≤ c the total number of genes is then 20 the lower and upper bounds of these design variables are listed in table 1 the input data for the optimizer are summarized in table 2 some of the design variables are hidden in each chromosome different chromosomes in general have different hidden genes which means that different solutions may have different nonlinear terms in the system and control forces the results of the optimization are presented in table 3 where the best found solution has 3 hidden genes in n c 4 hidden genes in n s 4 hidden genes in m s and no hidden genes in m c the value of each of the variables represented by hidden genes in the optimal solution is listed as 0 in table 3 the optimal values of the active non hidden variables are also listed with these optimized variables the energy harvested by the nonlinear system is 1 591022 10 6 joules this corresponds to about 4 9 times the energy harvested by the linear system simulated in section 3 fig 7 shows the performance of this optimized system where the harvested power is shown to be significantly higher than that of the linear system while still needing only a small amount of reactive power the motion of the nonlinear system is in the same order of magnitude as that of the linear one as depicted in fig 8 4 3 case study 2 conical buoy this paper focuses on the optimization of the nonlinear control and system forces without addressing how the optimized system forces can be realized this example however is presented to demonstrate how a buoy shape can be optimized along with the control consider a buoy of conical shape reference giorgi and ringwood 2016 presents an efficient way of computing the static and dynamic nonlinear froude krylov forces and shows that these nonlinear froude krylov forces reduces the amount of harvested energy compared to the linear system here it is shown that when a nonlinear control is optimized along with the shape a significant increase in the harvested energy can be achieved assume that the system nonlinear forces f s are only those due to the nonlinear froude krylov forces two variables are used in optimizing the cone dimensions the cone angle Œ∏ and the buoy radius at water level r w for simple presentation here we assume that f s Œ∏ r w is a function of only Œ∏ and r w the hgga presented in section 4 is used to optimize the control force u c and the buoy shape parameters Œ∏ and r w in this case the number of control variables is variables while the number of buoy shape variables is fixed 2 variables table 4 lists the ranges selected for the design variables where the number of control variables can be up to 12 a regular wave is assumed that has an amplitude of 0 3 m and a period of 9 s no viscous damping is assumed during the optimization process the hgga tries many solutions of different selections of the design variables for each set of the design variable the boundary element solver nemoh is used to compute the hydrodynamic coefficients needed to compute the linear diffraction and radiation forces then a motion numerical simulation is conducted using the model described in eq 9 at each time step in the numerical simulation the nonlinear static froude krylov force f f k s t t and the nonlinear dynamic froude krylov force f f k d y n t are computed for this conical buoy as function of the system states and the design variables as follows giorgi and ringwood 2016 18 f f k s t t f g 2 œÄ œÅ g m m œÉ 3 3 q m z œÉ 2 2 œÉ 1 œÉ 2 19 f f k d y n t 2 œÄ œá œÅ g a m 2 c o s œâ t q m 1 œá z œÉ e œá œÉ

gravitational acceleration and f g m g the nonlinear control force is also evaluated at each time step as function of the current states and the design variables the hgga process evolves until a convergence is achieved the results of optimization yields a buoy shape of radius r w 0 578 m and an angle of Œ∏ 16 5 that means the draft is 1 95 m and a nonlinear control of the form 20 u c 669 5 z 456 4 z 2 783 7 z 3 999 9 z 488 7 z 2 the results of the nonlinear controller are compared to two linear controllers the linear damping controller and the proportional derivative complex conjugate controller pdc3 abdelkhalik et al 2016 song et al 2016 the pdc3 control is a time domain control that approximates the complex conjugate control the pdc3 has both stiffness and damping terms and hence it can provide has reactive power unlike the linear damping control the pdc3 control is detailed in references abdelkhalik et al 2016 song et al 2016 it is designed based on a linear model for the wec yet it is here tested in a nonlinear environment using a propagator that has nonlinear froude krylov force to highlight the significance of having a nonlinear control force for the linear damping controller the damping coefficient is selected to be equal to Œ≤ c 1 in the nonlinear controller the pdc3 has stiffness and damping terms as follows 21 u p d c 3 k u p z k u d z the cone buoy with the shape that is obtained from optimization is simulated using a nonlinear model the harvested energy of the nonlinear and linear controllers are shown in fig 9 the results show the harvested energy increases by a factor of 3 5 in the case of the nonlinear controller compared to the linear controllers this result emphasizes the importance of designing a nonlinear control when the there are nonlinear hydrodynamic forces in linear wecs linear hydrodynamic forces and cylindrical buoy shape the pdc3 generates higher energy compared to the linear damping control in fact reference abdelkhalik et al 2017 presents a linear wec case study in which the complex conjugate control generates about 3 5 times the energy harvested using a linear damping control which is about the same ration this nonlinear control achieves in the case of a nonlinear wec in the steady state the nonlinear control force has a maximum value of about 2500 n while the linear one has a maximum of about 250 n for the damping controller and 1000 n for the pdc3 controller the displacement of the buoy in the nonlinear case has a maximum of 1 17 m while in the linear case it is 0 65 m for the damping controller and 2 25 m for the pdc3 controller the maximum buoy velocity in the nonlinear case is 1 6 m s while in the linear case it is 0 25 m s for the linear damping controller and 4 0 m s for the pdc3 controller 5 optimization of wecs in irregular waves the more realistic case is when the wec is in an irregular wave in this section we assume a bretschneider wave spectrum the main difference between this case and the previous regular wave case is in the calculations of the radiation and excitation forces here the radiation force is frequency dependant and is represented as added mass and added damping the excitation force is also frequency dependant the equation of motion of the buoy in such case is 22 m z f e x u l u c f s f r f b where m is the mass in addition to the added mass at infinite frequency f b is the linear buoyancy force f r is the linear radiation damping force and f e x is the linear excitation force all the nonlinear system forces are collected in the term f s the nonlinear control is u c the linear radiation damping force f r can be computed using a state space model of the form 23 x r a r x r b r z 24 f r c r x r where x r represents the radiation states the matrices a r b r and c r are calculated as functions of the added masses and added damping data note that when z z s and z 0 then f r 0 and m m the buoyancy force on the buoy f b can be calculated as 25 f b m g œÅ g v b s if z z s m g œÅ g v b if z z s z 0 m g if z z s z 0 where v b s is the submerged volume and v b is the total buoy volume the linear excitation force f e x is 26 f e x n 1 n a n f n exp i œâ n t œï n where n is the number of frequencies used to realize the wave a n are the wave coefficients f n are excitation force coefficients œâ n are frequencies and œï n are phase shifts consider the same system presented in section 3 but this time assuming a bretschneider wave spectrum with a peak period of 10 s and a wave amplitude of 0 7 m let the frequency range be œâ 0 01 0 037 7 rad sec the initial phase shifts are randomly selected in the range œÄ œÄ the nonlinear system and control coefficients are optimized using hgga the upper and lower bounds for the design variables are shown in table 5 the obtained results are presented in table 6 the total energy harvested in 60 s of simulation is 6 296549 10 6 joules from the baseline linear system the total energy harvested from the nonlinear system is 3 215181 10 7 joules which is about 5 times that harvested from the linear buoy as shown in fig 10 significant reactive power is needed in this case as shown in fig 11 the nonlinear system motion is significantly higher than that of the linear system as shown in fig 12 fig 13 shows the buoy velocity over time and fig 14 shows the control force on the buoy for both the linear and nonlinear cases note that in this simulation a saturation limit is assumed on the control force of 1 25 10 6 n 6 discussion this paper presents a study that attempts to optimize the nonlinear control along with the system nonlinearities to maximize the harvested energy it is assumed that these nonlinear system forces can be generated during the system design process such as the buoy shape design and or varying the buoy shape in realtime note that it is possible to extract the coefficients of the system nonlinear force f s using cfd simulations a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm for example can be used to fit the expansion in eq 2 to the nonlinear forces obtained from the cfd simulations this process can be used iteratively for designing a buoy shape that generates approximate prescribed nonlinear forces this process however is not addressed in this paper consider the case when it is not possible to find a buoy shape that would generate a prescribed optimized nonlinear force f s in such case it is possible to modify the nonlinear control terms to compensate for part or all of the unattainable nonlinear f s force for instance consider the case study presented in section 4 2 and assume that it is not possible to design a buoy shape that can provide the optimized force f s in such case it is possible to assume the buoy shape to be cylindrical for instance and set f s 0 the hgga is then used to optimize a nonlinear control force u c eq 5 this case is carried out and the results are shown in fig 15 the harvested energy in this case is 4 298156 e 10 5 joules which is about 1 32 times the harvested energy from the linear system in section 4 2 compare this energy amplification factor to the factor of 4 9 obtained in section 4 2 when both f s and u c were optimized this result supports the claim that a design optimization process that involves both the control and system nonlinearities might lead to more efficient energy conversion compared to the optimization of the control only for a given system section 2 presents the dynamic model adopted in the case of large motion which results in nonlinear effects it is possible to eliminate these effects by limiting the motion of the buoy using movement limiting or end stop mechanisms for instance one of the goals of this study however is to investigate the possibility of increasing the harvested energy when these nonlinearities are exploited as opposed to being avoided hence the general approach in this paper is not to avoid nonlinear forces but rather attempt to model these nonlinearities and optimize a control taking into consideration these nonlinear effects it is also noted that if the system has non optimizable nonlinear forces then these forces can be added to the equation of motion in eq 1 such case does not affect the generality of the proposed method in this paper since the optimizer will search for the optimal parameters in the optimizable forces in the presence of the non optimizable ones finally the optimization process described in this paper implements hgga which might not be suitable for realtime implementation the hgga is used in this paper for the purpose of design once the buoy shape is optimized the obtained values for the Œ± s and Œ≤ s coefficients become constants that do not change during operation regarding the control the coefficients Œ± c and Œ≤ c can be optimized off line for a range of sea states and stored in a look up table during operation this look up table can be used to select or interpolate the appropriate values for Œ± c and Œ≤ c moreover if a further tuning is needed during operation this look up table can be used to provide a good initial guess for a faster optimization algorithm this detail is not addressed in this paper 7 conclusions this paper presents an optimization approach for nonlinear control of wave energy converters this optimization method is also used for optimizing the nonlinearities in the system simultaneously with optimizing the control for maximizing the harvested energy and reducing the need for energy storage for reactive power the test cases presented in this paper demonstrated the feasibility of designing a nonlinear control that harvests multiple folds higher energy than that is obtained with a linear damping control depending on several factors including the wave conditions it is also demonstrated in this paper that nonlinearities in the wave energy conversion system can be optimized along with the nonlinear control and the resulting harvested energy is also multiple folds higher than a linear damping control when optimizing the wave energy converter nonlinear forces through buoy shape design for example it is shown that these nonlinear forces in the system serve as an energy storage and supply some or all of the needed reactive power this phenomena can be used to reduce the size of the energy storage in the system 
23283,this paper presents an optimization approach for the nonlinear control of wave energy converters wecs the proposed optimization method also presents the option of optimizing the system nonlinearities such as those due to the buoy shape such that the harvested energy is maximized for the sake of control design the control force and the system optimizable nonlinear force each is expressed as a truncated power series function of the system states the power series coefficients in both the control and system forces are optimized a hidden genes genetic algorithm is used for optimization the optimized system s nonlinear force is assumed to drive the design of the wec the numerical test cases presented in this paper show that it is possible to attain multiple fold higher harvested energy when using nonlinear control optimization the advantage of being able to optimize the wec design simultaneously with the control is the potential of harvesting this multiple fold higher energy without causing large wec motion and with less dependence on reactive power while this paper focuses on the optimization part of the problem the implementation of the obtained control in realtime is discussed at the end of the paper keywords wave energy conversion nonlinear wave energy conversion wec nonlinear control optimization 1 introduction one of the challenges in wave energy harvesting is the buoy motion control there has been significant developments on different control methods for wave energy converters wecs falnes 2007 most studies on the control of one degree of freedom heaving wecs adopt a linear dynamic model the cummins equation cummins which can be written as 1 m a z f e x u b v z k z f r where z is the heave displacement m is the buoy mass k is the hydrostatic stiffness due to buoyancy a is the added mass at infinite f e x is the excitation force u is the control force b v is a viscous damping coefficient and f r is the radiation damping force the buoyancy stiffness term is called the hydrostatic force this is linear model is usually implemented using boundary element methods bem that assume small motions around the mean position there are however multiple sources of possible nonlinearities in the wec dynamic model wolgamot and fitzgerald 2015 for example if the buoy shape is not a vertical cylinder near the water surface then the hydrostatic force will be nonlinear the coupling between the heave and pitch modes in a point absorber is nonlinear villegas and van der schaaf 2011 zou et al 2017 the hydrodynamic forces can also be nonlinear in the case of large motion giorgi et al 2016 control strategies that aim at maximizing the harvested energy usually increase the motion amplitude and hence the impact of these nonlinearities increases reference giorgi et al 2016 presents a numerical analysis for the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces at different levels from a full nonlinear model using computational fluid dynamics cfd tools to linear models corrected by the nonlinear froude krylov force as well as nonlinear viscous and hydrostatic forces the power take off pto unit may have nonlinearities as well bacelli et al 2015 reference retes et al 2015a points out that different wec systems should choose only the relevant nonlinear effects to avoid unnecessary computational costs for example in the case of heaving point absorbers the nonlinear froude krylov force is essential while the nonlinear diffraction and radiation can be neglected the nonlinear viscous effects are weak as well for point absorbers retes et al 2015a the nonlinear pto and mooring effects seem to be significant in fact references merigaud et al retes et al 2015b focus on the nonlinear froudekrylov forces and show that they are the dominant nonlinearities in the case of a heaving point absorber with nonuniform cross sectional area reference giorgi 2017 discusses representative linear models that provide an average model over the full operational space these models are more accurate than the linear models in the cases of large motions yet due to the average nature of these representative models they may not be very useful in controlling a wec in large motion linearizing the wec motion about an operation point is also not always feasible due to the fact that ocean waves change characteristic continuously and hence there is no single operation point reference penalba et al 2017 points out that for wec control in the case of large motions nonlinear models are inevitable reference giorgi and ringwood 2016 presents a computationally efficient way of computing the static and dynamic nonlinear froude krylov forces two methods are presented in giorgi and ringwood 2016 the first method assumes that the wave length is considerably longer than the characteristic length of the device and hence ignores the dependance of the pressure on the buoy surface on the surge coordinate the second method uses a mclaurin expansion to simplify the force integral calculation the latter method was demonstrated to be more accurate for various sea states most of the studies described above consider the modeling of different nonlinearities of a given wec and use the relevant ones in modeling the system reference giorgi and ringwood 2016 found that the harvested energy of the nonlinear wec is less than that of the linear system when using a latching control babarit et al 2004 durand et al cl√©ment and babarit 1959 nonlinear systems however possess some characteristics that can be exploited for higher harvested energy as pointed out in nayfeh and mook 2008 robinett and wilson 2011 this paper addresses the nonlinear one degree of freedom heaving wec from a different prospective the goal here is not to model the nonlinearities in the system rather the goal is to increase the harvested energy of the nonlinear wec compared to the linear one one way to increase the harvested energy of a nonlinear wec is to design a controller for the nonlinear wec in other words the control optimization process should take into account the nonlinearities in the wec allowing the control force to be nonlinear function of the system states the energy can be further increased if in addition to optimizing the control we optimize the system nonlinearities simultaneously with the control the nonlinear froudekrylov force for instance is dictated by the buoy shape hence the buoy shape can be optimized along with the control to maximize the energy the froudekrylov force is one source of the system nonlinearities in this paper the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic hydro forces along with all other optimizable nonlinear forces are referred to as the system nonlinearities the system nonlinearities and the control also nonlinear are here optimized simultaneously for the sake of control design it is convenient to express the optimizable system nonlinearities as a series function as follows 2 f s i 1 n s Œ± s i z i j 1 m s Œ≤ s j z j s i g n z where f s is the nonlinear force Œ± s i and Œ≤ s i are constant coefficients i n s and m s are the number of nonlinear terms that determine the order of the nonlinear forces eq 2 is written intuitively consider for example the proportional derivative pd controls which are widely used in linear systems in a pd control the proportional part is constructed as linear term in the state and the derivative term is constructed as a linear term in the state derivative the proportional term is a stiffness term since it has spring like effect which means this part of the force does not add remove energy on average the derivative term however is a damper like term and it continuously adds removes power one might think of nonlinear stiffness or damping terms as discussed in details in several references such as nayfeh and mook 2008 the first term in f s represents a nonlinear stiffness force and the second term contains a nonlinear damping force note that all Œ≤ s j are always negative coefficients and hence the second term is always a damping term energy flow is always from the water to the device optimizing the system nonlinearities means in this case finding the optimal coefficients Œ± s i and Œ≤ s i once the control and f s are optimized the wec system e g the buoy shape is designed so that the wec nonlinear force matches the optimized nonlinear force f s this last step of designing a wec system to generate a prescribed nonlinear force is not addressed in this paper the focus of this paper is on the optimization of f s and the control section 4 3 however presents a numerical case study for demonstration of optimizing both the control and the buoy shape simultaneously the cases when the optimized f s cannot be realized will also be discussed in section 6 also the case when there are nonlinear forces in the system that are not optimizable is addressed in section 6 2 dynamic model of the nonlinear wec system this section presents the dynamic model that will be used to approximate a nonlinear wec for the purpose of control design the nonlinearities in the dynamic model could be because of the buoy shape the large buoy motions and or the pto to model a nonlinear wec we start with a linear approximation that has a buoy of height h this is here referred to as the baseline model to simplify the presentation we start by assuming a regular wave then the work is extended to irregular waves in section 5 for the case of a linear wec in a regular wave the radiation force reduces to a linear damping and an added mass term the equation of motion in eq 1 then becomes 3 m a z c b v z k z f e x u where c is the radiation damping coefficient and a is the added mass at the excitation frequency the excitation force in this case can be written as 4 f e x f ÀÜ c o s œâ t œï where œâ is the excitation force frequency f ÀÜ is the amplitude of excitation force and œï is the phase of excitation force now consider the case of a nonlinear wec in which the additional nonlinear force compared to the baseline model in eq 3 is f s the nonlinear force f s is expressed as in eq 2 the control force is expressed as a summation of two quantities u u l u c where u l is the linear part of the control and u c is the nonlinear control part which is assumed in the form 5 u c i 1 n c Œ± c i z i j 2 m c Œ≤ c j z j where Œ± c i Œ≤ c i are constant coefficients i n c and m c are the number of nonlinear terms that determine the order of control forces the equation of motion of the system then is 6 m a z b v z k z f e x f r u l u c f s the equation of motion eq 6 is derived assuming that the buoy does not leave the water nor gets fully submerged in the water in the case of nonlinear wecs presented in this paper the motion of the buoy may grow large and these two cases should not be excluded hence the model in eq 6 is modified as follows consider the coordinates defined in fig 1 a range z z s is defined in which the model in eq 6 is considered valid the limit z s is selected based on the buoy dimensions and the wave height when z z s there are two possible cases the first case is when z 0 that is the buoy is or very close to being fully submerged under water the second case is when z 0 that is the buoy is or very close to being totally out of the water in these two cases the dynamic model in eq 6 is not valid and an approximate dynamic model is defined as follows case 1 z 0 the linear stiffness term becomes a constant k h 2 the nonlinear stiffness force will also be saturated that is f s i 2 n s Œ± s i h 2 i j 1 m s Œ≤ s j z j s i g n z the excitation force is assumed to remain the same as in eq 4 case 2 z 0 the buoy is out of the water so there is no buoyancy force on it meaning that k z m g where g is the gravitational acceleration there is no excitation force acting on the wec and there is no linear damping term in eq 6 also the nonlinear hydro force vanishes that is f s 0 the equation of motion reduces to m z m g u l u c the harvested power p t is expressed as 7 p t u c t u l z t u z t in the analysis conducted in this study u l is assumed a damping force as follows 8 u l b z where b is the linear control force damping coefficient b is negative the equation of motion in all the cases can be written in the state space form shown in eq 9 9 z z a z z 1 m 0 u l u c f s 1 m 0 f e x f r 1 m 0 g where g is defined as in eq 10 10 g 0 if z z s k h 2 if z z s z 0 m g if z z s z 0 the excitation force is defined in eq 4 except when z z s and z 0 it vanishes the linear damping coefficient is assumed constant in this paper the a matrix in eq 9 is defined as in equation 11 11 a 0 1 k m c m if z z s 0 1 0 0 if z z s in the above nonlinear wec model there are design coefficients for control design in eq 5 there are also coefficients in eq 2 for the nonlinear force in the dynamic model for a given buoy and wave conditions these coefficients in eq 2 will be fixed and a control design process would optimize the coefficients in eq 5 for optimal performance in this paper however it is assumed that the buoy is not yet designed and it is here attempted to optimize both sets of coefficients for maximum performance in other words we try to optimize both the control and the wec nonlinear forces simultaneously section 3 presents a case study on a buoy in a regular wave 3 case study 1 this section presents a simple illustrative numerical example to highlight the advantages that can be attained when optimizing both the system and control nonlinear forces consider the case of a system described by eq 9 that has optimizable nonlinear forces assume a buoy mass of 1 76 10 5 kg the linear stiffness force coefficient is 4 5449 10 5 kg s 2 the linear damping coefficient is 170 kg s the linear control force damping coefficient is 4 10 4 kg s the reference amplitude of excitation force is 263980 n its frequency is 0 628 rad s and its phase is 0 1 rad the buoy height is assumed 7 6 m and the limit z s is 3 4 m for the nonlinear part the number of nonlinear terms in the system nonlinear force is selected as n s 4 and m s 2 the nonlinear hydro force coefficients are 12

3211 6816 15 Œ≤ c 93730 1448 313067 8210 345133 6546 simulations are conducted for 60 s for this illustrative case the extracted energy from the linear system assuming no nonlinearities in the system is 3 247588 10 5 joules while the extracted energy from the nonlinear system is 6 615232 10 5 joules in 60 s as shown in fig 2 the nonlinear system produces about 2 0 times the energy harvested by the linear system fig 3 shows the power extracted by each system as expected the linear system does not need any reactive power since the control is just a linear damping the nonlinear system in this case needs reactive power the amount of which is very small though compared to the harvested power as shown in fig 3 where a zoom is made on a small part to show the level of reactive power note that the amount of reactive power dictates the size of the energy storage needed by the control system and the control designs that require less reactive power have the advantage of lower cost and less complexity compared to those control strategies that require bigger energy storage fig 4 shows the displacement for both systems where the dash horizontal line represents the z s limit beyond which the buoy is either totally in the air or totally submerged after an initial transition period the displacements of both wecs have about the same amplitude and frequency the same can be said about the velocities this result highlights the significant advantage that can be obtained when designing both the shape and the control simultaneously when designing for higher harvested energy the control design usually exploits the system nonlinearities and results in higher amplitude motions as compared to the linear motion in this case study however the nonlinear system has about the same motion amplitude as the linear one the reason is due to the nonlinear system force the latter seem to cancel the effect of the nonlinear control force on the buoy motion yet in computing the harvested power only the control force is multiplied by the buoy velocity the system force does not cancel the nonlinear control force in the power calculation if the reference amplitude of excitation force is increased to 1319900 n the amount of harvested energy increases to about 2 7 that of the linear system with minimal need for reactive power and a small motion amplitude 4 optimization using genetic algorithms before proceeding to the more realistic case of a buoy in irregular wave in section 5 we point out that the shape and control coefficients can be optimized so as to maximize the harvested energy the optimization problem can be formulated as follows 16 m a x i m i z e e 0 t p t d t subject to eq 9 where e is the energy harvested over a period t which can be expressed as 17 e 0 t p t d t 0 t u z d t 0 t z b z i 1 n c Œ± c i z i j 2 m c Œ≤ c j z j d t the design variables in this optimization problem are n s m s n c m c Œ± s i Œ≤ s j i 1 n s and j 1 m s Œ± c k and Œ≤ c l k 1 n c and l 1 m c the overall number of variables is variable since n s m s n c and m c are variables the variables n s m s n c and m c are usually referred to as architecture topology variables since they determine the overall number of variables to be optimized also this type of problem is usually referred to as a variable sized design space vsds optimization problem here the recently developed hidden gene genetic algorithm hgga abdelkhalik 2013 will be used to solve this optimization problem the hgga adopted in this paper is an optimization algorithm designed to handle vsds optimization problems section 4 1 briefs the hgga and section 4 2 details its implementation to optimize the control and shape of the case study presented in section 3 4 1 hidden genes genetic algorithm in standard genetic algorithms gas the variables of the optimization problem are coded in chromosomes each chromosome represents a solution and consists of the variables that are coded as genes the objective of optimization determines the fitness of the solution in fig 5 a solution with n variables is shown as a chromosome with n genes g 1 g 2 g n the genetic operations of selection mutation and crossover are applied on a population of these chromosomes and through generations iterations theses populations converge toward the optimal solution a simple ga starts with selecting two parents from the current generation or the randomly generated initial population this is called the selection process there are several criteria for selecting the two parents the one that is adopted here is the roulette wheel selection operator where a member is selected with a probability proportional to its fitness next mutation and crossover operations are applied on the selected parents as an example in binary coding genes are coded as 0s and 1s in the mutation process gene 1 may change to 0 with a probability of p m in the crossover operation parts of the chromosome strings are swapped in parents with a probability of p c to create new chromosomes some of the best chromosomes elite are transferred to the next generation with no change by repeating the ga operations in each generation the population converges to the optimal solution the hgga implemented in this paper is a biologically inspired approach that hides different genes in different chromosomes to create solutions of different architectures using the same coding method the chromosome string abdelkhalik 2013 by setting the chromosome length to the length of the longest possible chromosome l m a x assuming maximum number of design variables and turning some genes off different solutions of different architectures with lengths varying from of 1 to l m a x can be constructed the genes that are hidden are variables that do not affect the fitness of the solution yet they carry information they go through ga operations and may become active not hidden in future generations as an example a single point crossover operator in hgga is shown in fig 6 in this example the genes go through the crossover operator regardless of the hidden genes positions meaning that the genes are swapped at a random crossover point in fig 6 it is between the second and the third genes with probability p c just like a normal crossover operator then some genes in the children chromosomes are assigned as hidden based on the hidden gene assignment mechanism abdelkhalik and darani 2016 the implementation of the hgga to the wec control optimization is described in sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 2 optimization of case study 1 it is required to find the optimal number of nonlinear control and system coefficients as well as their values such that the objective function extracted energy is maximized the case study presented in section 3 is here optimized to maximize the harvested energy a population of 20 members along with only 5 generations are used in optimization the number of elite members is 2 a saturation limit is assumed on the nonlinear control force u c this saturation limit is equal to 1 1 m a x f e x also solutions that result in very high motion amplitude are excluded the maximum possible value for each of n s and n c is selected to be 6 while the maximum possible value for each of m s and m c is selected to be 4 this means that the chromosome is structured such that it has 6 genes for Œ± s 6 genes for Œ± c 4 genes for Œ≤ s and 4 genes for Œ≤ c the total number of genes is then 20 the lower and upper bounds of these design variables are listed in table 1 the input data for the optimizer are summarized in table 2 some of the design variables are hidden in each chromosome different chromosomes in general have different hidden genes which means that different solutions may have different nonlinear terms in the system and control forces the results of the optimization are presented in table 3 where the best found solution has 3 hidden genes in n c 4 hidden genes in n s 4 hidden genes in m s and no hidden genes in m c the value of each of the variables represented by hidden genes in the optimal solution is listed as 0 in table 3 the optimal values of the active non hidden variables are also listed with these optimized variables the energy harvested by the nonlinear system is 1 591022 10 6 joules this corresponds to about 4 9 times the energy harvested by the linear system simulated in section 3 fig 7 shows the performance of this optimized system where the harvested power is shown to be significantly higher than that of the linear system while still needing only a small amount of reactive power the motion of the nonlinear system is in the same order of magnitude as that of the linear one as depicted in fig 8 4 3 case study 2 conical buoy this paper focuses on the optimization of the nonlinear control and system forces without addressing how the optimized system forces can be realized this example however is presented to demonstrate how a buoy shape can be optimized along with the control consider a buoy of conical shape reference giorgi and ringwood 2016 presents an efficient way of computing the static and dynamic nonlinear froude krylov forces and shows that these nonlinear froude krylov forces reduces the amount of harvested energy compared to the linear system here it is shown that when a nonlinear control is optimized along with the shape a significant increase in the harvested energy can be achieved assume that the system nonlinear forces f s are only those due to the nonlinear froude krylov forces two variables are used in optimizing the cone dimensions the cone angle Œ∏ and the buoy radius at water level r w for simple presentation here we assume that f s Œ∏ r w is a function of only Œ∏ and r w the hgga presented in section 4 is used to optimize the control force u c and the buoy shape parameters Œ∏ and r w in this case the number of control variables is variables while the number of buoy shape variables is fixed 2 variables table 4 lists the ranges selected for the design variables where the number of control variables can be up to 12 a regular wave is assumed that has an amplitude of 0 3 m and a period of 9 s no viscous damping is assumed during the optimization process the hgga tries many solutions of different selections of the design variables for each set of the design variable the boundary element solver nemoh is used to compute the hydrodynamic coefficients needed to compute the linear diffraction and radiation forces then a motion numerical simulation is conducted using the model described in eq 9 at each time step in the numerical simulation the nonlinear static froude krylov force f f k s t t and the nonlinear dynamic froude krylov force f f k d y n t are computed for this conical buoy as function of the system states and the design variables as follows giorgi and ringwood 2016 18 f f k s t t f g 2 œÄ œÅ g m m œÉ 3 3 q m z œÉ 2 2 œÉ 1 œÉ 2 19 f f k d y n t 2 œÄ œá œÅ g a m 2 c o s œâ t q m 1 œá z œÉ e œá œÉ

gravitational acceleration and f g m g the nonlinear control force is also evaluated at each time step as function of the current states and the design variables the hgga process evolves until a convergence is achieved the results of optimization yields a buoy shape of radius r w 0 578 m and an angle of Œ∏ 16 5 that means the draft is 1 95 m and a nonlinear control of the form 20 u c 669 5 z 456 4 z 2 783 7 z 3 999 9 z 488 7 z 2 the results of the nonlinear controller are compared to two linear controllers the linear damping controller and the proportional derivative complex conjugate controller pdc3 abdelkhalik et al 2016 song et al 2016 the pdc3 control is a time domain control that approximates the complex conjugate control the pdc3 has both stiffness and damping terms and hence it can provide has reactive power unlike the linear damping control the pdc3 control is detailed in references abdelkhalik et al 2016 song et al 2016 it is designed based on a linear model for the wec yet it is here tested in a nonlinear environment using a propagator that has nonlinear froude krylov force to highlight the significance of having a nonlinear control force for the linear damping controller the damping coefficient is selected to be equal to Œ≤ c 1 in the nonlinear controller the pdc3 has stiffness and damping terms as follows 21 u p d c 3 k u p z k u d z the cone buoy with the shape that is obtained from optimization is simulated using a nonlinear model the harvested energy of the nonlinear and linear controllers are shown in fig 9 the results show the harvested energy increases by a factor of 3 5 in the case of the nonlinear controller compared to the linear controllers this result emphasizes the importance of designing a nonlinear control when the there are nonlinear hydrodynamic forces in linear wecs linear hydrodynamic forces and cylindrical buoy shape the pdc3 generates higher energy compared to the linear damping control in fact reference abdelkhalik et al 2017 presents a linear wec case study in which the complex conjugate control generates about 3 5 times the energy harvested using a linear damping control which is about the same ration this nonlinear control achieves in the case of a nonlinear wec in the steady state the nonlinear control force has a maximum value of about 2500 n while the linear one has a maximum of about 250 n for the damping controller and 1000 n for the pdc3 controller the displacement of the buoy in the nonlinear case has a maximum of 1 17 m while in the linear case it is 0 65 m for the damping controller and 2 25 m for the pdc3 controller the maximum buoy velocity in the nonlinear case is 1 6 m s while in the linear case it is 0 25 m s for the linear damping controller and 4 0 m s for the pdc3 controller 5 optimization of wecs in irregular waves the more realistic case is when the wec is in an irregular wave in this section we assume a bretschneider wave spectrum the main difference between this case and the previous regular wave case is in the calculations of the radiation and excitation forces here the radiation force is frequency dependant and is represented as added mass and added damping the excitation force is also frequency dependant the equation of motion of the buoy in such case is 22 m z f e x u l u c f s f r f b where m is the mass in addition to the added mass at infinite frequency f b is the linear buoyancy force f r is the linear radiation damping force and f e x is the linear excitation force all the nonlinear system forces are collected in the term f s the nonlinear control is u c the linear radiation damping force f r can be computed using a state space model of the form 23 x r a r x r b r z 24 f r c r x r where x r represents the radiation states the matrices a r b r and c r are calculated as functions of the added masses and added damping data note that when z z s and z 0 then f r 0 and m m the buoyancy force on the buoy f b can be calculated as 25 f b m g œÅ g v b s if z z s m g œÅ g v b if z z s z 0 m g if z z s z 0 where v b s is the submerged volume and v b is the total buoy volume the linear excitation force f e x is 26 f e x n 1 n a n f n exp i œâ n t œï n where n is the number of frequencies used to realize the wave a n are the wave coefficients f n are excitation force coefficients œâ n are frequencies and œï n are phase shifts consider the same system presented in section 3 but this time assuming a bretschneider wave spectrum with a peak period of 10 s and a wave amplitude of 0 7 m let the frequency range be œâ 0 01 0 037 7 rad sec the initial phase shifts are randomly selected in the range œÄ œÄ the nonlinear system and control coefficients are optimized using hgga the upper and lower bounds for the design variables are shown in table 5 the obtained results are presented in table 6 the total energy harvested in 60 s of simulation is 6 296549 10 6 joules from the baseline linear system the total energy harvested from the nonlinear system is 3 215181 10 7 joules which is about 5 times that harvested from the linear buoy as shown in fig 10 significant reactive power is needed in this case as shown in fig 11 the nonlinear system motion is significantly higher than that of the linear system as shown in fig 12 fig 13 shows the buoy velocity over time and fig 14 shows the control force on the buoy for both the linear and nonlinear cases note that in this simulation a saturation limit is assumed on the control force of 1 25 10 6 n 6 discussion this paper presents a study that attempts to optimize the nonlinear control along with the system nonlinearities to maximize the harvested energy it is assumed that these nonlinear system forces can be generated during the system design process such as the buoy shape design and or varying the buoy shape in realtime note that it is possible to extract the coefficients of the system nonlinear force f s using cfd simulations a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm for example can be used to fit the expansion in eq 2 to the nonlinear forces obtained from the cfd simulations this process can be used iteratively for designing a buoy shape that generates approximate prescribed nonlinear forces this process however is not addressed in this paper consider the case when it is not possible to find a buoy shape that would generate a prescribed optimized nonlinear force f s in such case it is possible to modify the nonlinear control terms to compensate for part or all of the unattainable nonlinear f s force for instance consider the case study presented in section 4 2 and assume that it is not possible to design a buoy shape that can provide the optimized force f s in such case it is possible to assume the buoy shape to be cylindrical for instance and set f s 0 the hgga is then used to optimize a nonlinear control force u c eq 5 this case is carried out and the results are shown in fig 15 the harvested energy in this case is 4 298156 e 10 5 joules which is about 1 32 times the harvested energy from the linear system in section 4 2 compare this energy amplification factor to the factor of 4 9 obtained in section 4 2 when both f s and u c were optimized this result supports the claim that a design optimization process that involves both the control and system nonlinearities might lead to more efficient energy conversion compared to the optimization of the control only for a given system section 2 presents the dynamic model adopted in the case of large motion which results in nonlinear effects it is possible to eliminate these effects by limiting the motion of the buoy using movement limiting or end stop mechanisms for instance one of the goals of this study however is to investigate the possibility of increasing the harvested energy when these nonlinearities are exploited as opposed to being avoided hence the general approach in this paper is not to avoid nonlinear forces but rather attempt to model these nonlinearities and optimize a control taking into consideration these nonlinear effects it is also noted that if the system has non optimizable nonlinear forces then these forces can be added to the equation of motion in eq 1 such case does not affect the generality of the proposed method in this paper since the optimizer will search for the optimal parameters in the optimizable forces in the presence of the non optimizable ones finally the optimization process described in this paper implements hgga which might not be suitable for realtime implementation the hgga is used in this paper for the purpose of design once the buoy shape is optimized the obtained values for the Œ± s and Œ≤ s coefficients become constants that do not change during operation regarding the control the coefficients Œ± c and Œ≤ c can be optimized off line for a range of sea states and stored in a look up table during operation this look up table can be used to select or interpolate the appropriate values for Œ± c and Œ≤ c moreover if a further tuning is needed during operation this look up table can be used to provide a good initial guess for a faster optimization algorithm this detail is not addressed in this paper 7 conclusions this paper presents an optimization approach for nonlinear control of wave energy converters this optimization method is also used for optimizing the nonlinearities in the system simultaneously with optimizing the control for maximizing the harvested energy and reducing the need for energy storage for reactive power the test cases presented in this paper demonstrated the feasibility of designing a nonlinear control that harvests multiple folds higher energy than that is obtained with a linear damping control depending on several factors including the wave conditions it is also demonstrated in this paper that nonlinearities in the wave energy conversion system can be optimized along with the nonlinear control and the resulting harvested energy is also multiple folds higher than a linear damping control when optimizing the wave energy converter nonlinear forces through buoy shape design for example it is shown that these nonlinear forces in the system serve as an energy storage and supply some or all of the needed reactive power this phenomena can be used to reduce the size of the energy storage in the system 
23284,cavitation characteristics and hydrodynamic forces of hydrofoils with bioinspired wavy leading edges were examined experimentally in a water tunnel force measurements were carried out using a waterproof load cell and cavitation patterns were recorded by directly imaging the hydrofoil surface all semi span hydrofoils had an underlying naca 634 021 profile with either a rectangular or swept leading edge planform the sinusoidal leading edge geometries were defined by three amplitudes of 2 5 5 and 12 and two wavelengths of 25 and 50 of the mean chord length results revealed that cavitation on the modified hydrofoils with the two larger amplitudes was largely confined to the regions directly behind the protuberance troughs whereas a baseline with flat leading edge and the smaller amplitude hydrofoils exhibited sheet cavitation over the entire span additionally cavitation on the modified hydrofoils appeared at consistently lower angles of attack than on the baseline model lift coefficient for the baseline model was generally comparable to or greater than that of the modified hydrofoils at the angles of attack considered except for the largest amplitude hydrofoils drag for the modified hydrofoils was equal to the baseline model for nearly the entire angle of attack range keywords hydrofoil cavitation leading edge protuberance lift and drag tubercle 1 introduction the past decade has witnessed significant growth in the research activity on airfoils hydrofoils wings and flow control surfaces with leading edge protuberances resembling the tubercles on the pectoral flippers of humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae fish et al 2011 the majority of these studies have focused on experimental testing and numerical simulations of flow at reynolds numbers of order 105 on a few airfoils with specific profiles and on wings with either rectangular or whale flipper resembling planforms the review article by fish and lauder 2006 discusses active and passive control by aquatic animals including the role of tubercles on the humpback whale flippers however no systematic studies of the effects of leading edge protuberances on the cavitation of hydrofoils have been performed the goal of the present experimental study was to examine the cavitation pattern and incipient cavitation number on two sets of hydrofoils with sinusoidal leading edge geometry three amplitudes and two wavelengths of the leading edge were examined on a rectangular planform in addition to a specific model with leading edge sweep the forces on all hydrofoils were measured in the presence of cavitation and compared with those on analogous baseline models with a straight leading edge the relevant past studies are reviewed below performance of idealized humpback whale flipper models with and without leading edge protuberances has been examined by miklosovic and collaborators the flipper may be described as a tapered finite span wing of aspect ratio 6 with a thick profile miklosovic et al 2004 measured the lift and drag of a flipper model with a naca 0020 profile at a reynolds number of one half million a 6 increase in the maximum lift and a 4 higher stall angle of attack for the flipper model with the protuberances was reported murray et al 2005 used the same models to observe the effects of tapering the leading edge they showed that flipper models with sweep angles of 15 and 30 had 9 and 4 respectively greater maximum lift compared to models without the leading edge protuberances the flow over a similar flipper model was computed using the detached eddy simulation des technique by pedro and kobayashi 2008 at an angle of attack of Œ± 15 and reynolds number of 5 0 105 they observed that separation near the tip of the flipper was reduced when the protuberances were present numerical simulation of the idealized flipper model was also carried out using two different turbulence models by weber et al 2011 they concluded that the stall pattern of the modified leading edge model is different than the model with a straight leading edge the effects of a sinusoidal leading edge on the lift and drag of a tunnel spanning full span naca 634 021 foil with leading edge geometries corresponding to that of the whale flipper fish and battle 1995 were investigated in a series of water tunnel experiments by johari et al 2007 foils with three different protuberance amplitudes and two different wavelengths were examined at a reynolds number of 1 8 105 and angles of attack up to Œ± 30 depending on the specific geometry of the leading edge lift on the modified foils was lower in the pre stall regime and higher in the post stall regime when compared to a baseline foil without any protuberances no drag reduction was observed for any of the modified leading edge airfoils studied the lift coefficient of the foil with the largest leading edge protuberance amplitude of 12 remained nearly constant over a broad range of angles of attack 10 Œ± 26 flow visualization using surface tufts showed that the flow over the protuberance peaks remains attached well past the stall angle of attack of the baseline foil johari et al 2007 2008 on the other hand flow separation occurred first in the troughs between the adjacent protuberances miklosovic et al 2007 observed similar trends for the lift and drag of a full span naca 0020 foil with sinusoidal leading edge at a reynolds number of 2 74 105 hansen et al 2011 measured the forces on two naca airfoils 0021 and 65 021 with different aerodynamic characteristics at reynolds number of 1 2 105 numerical simulation of foils with sinusoidal leading edges have also been carried out des was used to examine the flow over modified leading edge foils at reynolds numbers of 1 6 105 c√¢mara and sousa 2013 and 5 7 105 malipeddi et al 2012 and reynolds numbers up to 3 106 were examined by dropkin et al 2012 the findings of these numerical simulations verify the earlier experimental studies and provide detailed surface pressure distributions not available from the experiments the reynolds number beyond a certain value appears to have a minor effect on the force characteristics of leading edge modified foils other numerical simulations have investigated the formation of streamwise vortices rostamzadeh et al 2014 and stall delay skillen et al 2015 on airfoils with leading edge protuberances research on finite span wings with sinusoidal leading edges have been conducted on rectangular planform wings using panel methods watts and fish 2001 computed the flow on a naca 634 021 profile wing with an aspect ratio of two at an angle of attack Œ± 10 they observed a lift increase of 4 8 over the baseline wing and a 10 9 reduction of induced drag at this angle of attack guerreiro and sousa 2012 measured the performance of leading edge modified nasa ls 1 0417 wings with aspect ratios of 1 0 and 1 5 at reynolds numbers of 7 104 and 1 4 105 at the higher reynolds number lift enhancement was observed in the post stall regime consistent with the earlier study at similar reynolds numbers however at the lower reynolds number the leading edge modified wings had higher lift over a broader range of angles of attack due to the poor performance of the baseline wing most recently custodio et al 2015 made force measurements in a water tunnel on a series of low aspect ratio wings with multiple leading edge geometries and planforms at various reynolds numbers of interest to marine applications weber et al 2010 tested rudders with and without leading edge protuberances in a water tunnel at reynolds numbers up to 8 8 105 they indicated that the effects of leading edge modifications vanish at higher reynolds numbers yoon et al 2011 performed numerical simulation of rectangular wings with a sharp tip and a semi aspect ratio of 1 5 at reynolds number of 106 for rudder applications as well the rudder had a naca 0020 profile with protuberance amplitude and wavelength of 0 025 and 0 20 chord length respectively lift enhancement was observed only in the post stall regime similar to the lower reynolds number full span experiments lately several experimental and numerical studies have considered the effects of leading edge modifications on the performance of tidal turbines gruber at al 2011 shi et al 2016a 2016b and marine propeller blades ibrahim and new 2015 shi et al 2016c have also investigated cavitation and noise of a specific horizontal axis tidal turbine model with modified blade leading edges however there does not appear to be any systematic studies of the effects of leading edge protuberances on the cavitation of generic hydrofoils and wings or the hydrodynamic forces in presence of cavitation the primary objective of the present study was to establish the effect of various sinusoidal leading edge geometries on the cavitation characteristics and hydrodynamic forces of finite span hydrofoil models at reynolds number of 7 2 105 and angles of attack up to 30 this reynolds number was deemed sufficiently high such that further reynolds number increases would have minimal incremental effect the models consisted of a rounded tip rectangular planform with a semi aspect ratio of 2 15 and a swept planform with a semi aspect ratio of 2 0 the incipient cavitation numbers were compared among the various sinusoidal leading edge models and the baseline models the experimental technique is described in section 2 the results are presented and discussed in section 3 and the findings are summarized in section 4 2 experimental technique all experiments were carried out at the naval undersea warfare center nuwc closed loop water tunnel facility in newport ri the water tunnel test section was 0 30 m square and capable of reaching freestream velocities of up to 10 m s the freestream turbulent intensity on the tunnel centerline was measured to be about 0 6 for these tests the freestream velocity in the water tunnel was monitored at a point in the center of the water tunnel test section and 0 66 m upstream of the models using a laser doppler velocimeter monitoring and adjustment of the freestream velocity was required due to the variations caused by the different models and angles of attack in these experiments the freestream velocity was set at u 7 2 m s corresponding to reynolds numbers of re 7 2 105 based on the mean chord length of the hydrofoil models used no tripping device was used on the models to trigger transition 2 1 models various hydrofoil models with sinusoidal leading edge geometries similar to the wavelength and amplitude range of the protuberances found on the humpback whale flipper were designed and fabricated all models had an underlying naca 634 021 profile which is symmetric with the maximum thickness of 21 located at 40 of the chord this profile was chosen for its similarity to the humpback whale flipper cross section two sets of models distinguished by the planform geometry were fabricated rectangular planform models with a rounded tip and swept leading edge models the leading edge geometry was defined by a sinusoidal pattern with amplitude a and wavelength Œª the amplitude and wavelength were constant fractions of the chord length c three protuberance amplitudes of a 0 025c 0 05c and 0 12c along with two wavelengths of Œª 0 25c and 0 50c were examined in this study these values were chosen as they are representative of those found on the humpback whale flippers table 1 shows the dimensions and designation of the models tested for each set of models the mean chord length c and span b were kept the same to ensure that the planform area of all models in each set remained the same all leading edge modified models were compared to a protuberance free baseline model with the same planform area the two baseline models in table 1 had a naca 634 021 profile and were used for comparison with the leading edge modified models the leading edge of the modified models were blended into the baseline profile such that past a distance of three times the protuberance amplitude from the mean leading edge the modified and baseline airfoils were identical for example for the model with the medium amplitude protuberances the mean leading edge extended 0 05c upstream of the mean leading edge in the cross section corresponding to the peaks and contracted 0 05c back in the trough cross sections past 0 15c from the mean leading edge the profile of modified model was the same as the baseline naca profile the baseline and modified models have identical cross sections only at the protuberance inflection points the leading edge radius and cross section of the modified airfoils changed in the spanwise direction so that the top and bottom surfaces of the models were not wavy in the spanwise direction seven rectangular planform models with chord length of 102 mm and span of 214 mm were designed and fabricated from aluminum on a 4 axis cnc machine see fig 1 the models were polished and anodized resulting in a very fine surface finish of approximately 1 6 Œºm the models are considered hydrodynamically smooth for the testing conditions further details on the model details may be found in custodio et al 2015 the designation on each model in fig 1 corresponds to the ones in table 1 the flat edge of these models rested against the water tunnel bottom wall and all these models had the same aspect ratio including the rounded cap to investigate the effects of protuberances on a planform with a considerably larger spanwise flow than the rectangular models two models with leading edge sweep were designed the potential interaction of the spanwise flow with the protuberances and the resulting effect on the loads were of interest the swept leading edge planform models had a root chord length of 148 mm mean chord length of c 98 mm span of 200 mm and a leading edge sweep angle of 26 1 this sweep angle was chosen to have an aspect ratio close to the rectangular planform models these models were manufactured in the same manner as the rectangular ones and are shown in fig 2 the protuberance pattern on the modified model corresponded to the 4l rectangular planform model the protuberance amplitude and wavelength were constant fractions 12 and 50 respectively of the local chord length the flat edge rested on the bottom wall of the water tunnel test section 2 2 photography a flow visualization study was carried out to examine the cavitation characteristics of these models the angle of attack range examined ranged from 12 Œ± 24 in 3 increments cavitation was absent at angles of attack below 12 at the freestream velocity of 7 2 m s images were taken with a nikon d200 digital slr camera and strobe lighting to illuminate cavitation regions synchronized strobe lighting with an illumination time of approximately 1 Œºs was used to light both the front surface of the models as well as the background for contrast the flow visualization experiments were also used to observe the effects of leading edge modifications on the incipient cavitation number to determine the incipient cavitation number œÉ i the freestream static pressure was monitored in addition to the freestream velocity the incipient criterion used was the first visual cues of presence of vaporous cavitation near the leading edge the freestream velocity was increased from a minimum until the incipient cavitation condition had been reached on a given model at a fixed angle of attack and then the freestream velocity u i and static pressure p i were recorded afterward the incipient cavitation number œÉ i 2 p i p v œÅ u i 2 was computed using the water vapor pressure p v and density œÅ 2 3 force measurements a waterproof calibrated strain gage load cell model amti mk 4741 in conjunction with a msa 6 mini amplifier was used to measure the forces on the aforementioned models at angles of attack ranging from 12 Œ± 30 the load cell was capable of measuring forces up to 2224 n in the streamwise and transverse directions and 4448 n in the spanwise direction the amplifier allowed for zero biasing and anti alias low pass filtering with a 1 khz cutoff analog signals were passed through a national instruments ni scxi 1305 module and subsequently through a ni scxi 1120d module set to 10v inputs with 4 5 khz low pass filtering signals were then digitized at 1 khz and averaged subsequently by a labview program each set of strain gage voltages were multiplied by the calibrated crosstalk matrix all models were mounted to the load cell by means of an adapter plate which retained an axis of rotation centered about the quarter chord location of the models and transferred the forces directly to the load cell the load cell was housed inside a custom made mechanism which allowed measurement at various angles of attack the mechanism was capable of angle of attack adjustments up to 30 in increments of 1 5 the load measurement apparatus mounted below the water tunnel test section is shown in fig 3 where it was attached to the 4l model the measured forces were converted to lift and drag coefficients using the measured freestream dynamic pressure and the model planform area the bias errors associated with the measurements were due to the intrinsic uncertainty of the load cell the accuracy of the forces was determined through an inspection of the measured values by comparing the maximum and minimum values of the unprocessed data to the mean in a 100 sample dataset the resulting force uncertainties were approximately 1 8 n at the chosen freestream velocity which had a maximum uncertainty of 0 05 m s the uncertainty in the angle of attack was 0 3 stemming from the custom made mechanism to determine the uncertainties associated with the model chord length and span measurements were taken at several spanwise locations no more than a 0 8 and 0 5 difference from the nominal chord length and span of the models respectively were found the methods outlined in coleman and steel 1989 and in wheeler and ganji 1996 were used to determine the uncertainties of the lift and drag coefficients except for the drag coefficient at the low angles of attack the uncertainties for the force coefficients were less than 5 the correction methods laid out by pope and rae 1984 were used to account for the effects of water tunnel walls for all cases the buoyancy corrections were very small in comparison to the measured drag and therefore this correction was neglected throughout the solid and wake blockage effects in addition to the angle of attack correction were the primary corrections applied given that all the models had the same aspect ratio the corrections to the force coefficients were consistent and comparable among the various models additional details of the experimental setup data acquisition and processing may be found in custodio 2012 3 results 3 1 flow visualization the cavitation characteristics of hydrofoils at u 7 2 m s are presented in fig 4 6 cavitation can be distinguished by the white colored vapor produced in the low pressure regions images of the rectangular planform models with protuberances wavelengths of Œª c 0 25 and 0 50 are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the baseline hydrofoil is shown in figs 4a and 5a as with all the models examined cavitation was observed first at Œ± 12 in the core of the tip vortex with increased angle of attack cavitation in the tip vortex grew until Œ± 18 beyond which the tip vortex cavitation diminished as a result of stall at higher angles figs 4b and 5b illustrate that the models with protuberance amplitude of a c 0 025 8s and 4s had tip vortex cavitation characteristics similar to the baseline hydrofoil with an increase in the vortex cavity size up to Œ± 18 at angles of attack greater than Œ± 18 the size of the cavity generated by the tip vortex decreased gradually while the 8m model in fig 4c revealed a trend similar to that of the baseline the 4m model in fig 5c produced a vortex cavity that diminished at an earlier angle than the baseline the models with the largest amplitude protuberances 8l and 4l in figs 4d and 5d had tip vortex cavities that diminished at an even earlier angle than the baseline at the reynolds number of the experiments the baseline hydrofoil produced equal or greater lift than the modified models with the largest protuberances 8l and 4l and this resulted in a stronger tip vortex on the baseline hydrofoil in turn generating a larger vortex cavity the acceleration of flow over the leading edge of hydrofoils leads to reduced pressure producing cavitation along the leading edge cavitation at the leading edge of hydrofoil models was modified by the presence of protuberances to varying degrees as apparent in figs 4a and 5a sheet cavitation developed on the leading edge of the baseline hydrofoil with increasing angle of attack incipient cavitation occurred at an angle of Œ± 15 on the baseline hydrofoil sheet cavitation had spread along the majority of the baseline hydrofoil leading edge at Œ± 18 as the angle of attack was further increased to Œ± 21 the cavity associated with sheet cavitation enlarged and remained essentially unchanged as the angle of attack reached Œ± 24 for all leading edge modified hydrofoils cavitation initiated in the troughs of the protuberances this was due to the larger leading edge radius in the troughs leading to the lowest local pressures the two models with the largest protuberance amplitude of a c 0 12 8l and 4l cavitated at angles as low as Œ± 12 whereas all other modified rectangular hydrofoils started cavitating at Œ± 15 models with the smallest protuberance amplitude of a c 0 025 8s and 4s in figs 4b and 5b developed sheet cavitation at Œ± 18 similar to the baseline hydrofoil with increasing sheet size corresponding to an increase in angle of attack nearly the full extent of the span of these two hydrofoils was cavitating at the higher angles however sheet cavitation along the leading edge of the 8s and 4s models was limited to a somewhat smaller fraction of the chord length at the two higher angles when compared to the baseline hydrofoil in contrast with the baseline and smallest amplitude models cavitation on the two models with the largest protuberance amplitude 8l and 4l in figs 4d and 5d occurred only in the troughs and never extended to the protuberance peaks furthermore at Œ± 18 and beyond cavitation disappeared from the central trough for the 4l model see fig 5d and the cavitation pattern did not change with increasing angle the disappearance of central trough cavitation was a result of the interaction of vortices emanating from the shoulders of the protuberances which are described in detail in custodio 2012 the vortex interaction on the 4l hydrofoil would lead to increased local pressure behind the central trough a rather similar pattern was also observed on the 8l model in fig 4d however unsteadiness especially at the higher angles of attack produced transient cavitation cells behind the troughs at high angles of attack in fact cavitation along the leading edge of all modified hydrofoils was fairly unsteady the models with medium amplitude protuberances 8m and 4m in figs 4c and 5c had cavitation patterns similar to their larger amplitude counterparts cavitation appeared only in the troughs and the peaks remained free of cavitation no sheet cavitation was observed at any angle of attack and cavitation was confined to pockets behind the troughs moreover cavitation disappeared from the central trough at the higher angles of attack these observations revealed that the protuberance amplitude played a key role in the formation of cavitation patterns similar to the baseline hydrofoil small amplitude protuberances resulted in sheet cavitation except for the wavy geometry of the sheet being dictated by the leading edge on the other hand the larger amplitude protuberances created a different pattern with cavitation only in pockets behind the protuberance troughs the leading edge wavelength played only a minor role in establishing the cavitation patterns observed on the modified hydrofoils generally hydrofoils with the shorter wavelength developed transient cavitation cells at greater angles of attack compared to the hydrofoils with the longer wavelength the effect of protuberances on the cavitation characteristics of hydrofoils with leading edge sweep is shown in fig 6 cavitation was apparent in the tip vortex of the baseline model at the lowest angle of Œ± 12 however tip vortex cavitation disappeared altogether at angles of attack greater than Œ± 18 this was likely caused by tip stall which resulted in a weaker vortex strength no cavitation was visible on the leading edge of the baseline hydrofoil until an angle of Œ± 21 at angles of attack Œ± 21 leading edge sheet cavitation was present over the central one half of the baseline model span the lack of cavitation near the root as well as the tip of the hydrofoils were the result of low speed root and spanwise flow tip at these locations the cavitation pattern of the modified hydrofoil with leading edge sweep is shown in fig 6b contrary to the baseline hydrofoil tip vortex cavitation was apparent at all angles of attack considered with similar appearance throughout the entire range of angles incipient cavitation was observed in the troughs of the protuberances at angles as low as Œ± 12 as the angle of attack was increased cavitation was present only within the troughs the protuberance peaks remained cavitation free even though the baseline model was cavitating along the central portion of the span at Œ± 18 the central trough became cavitation free and remained so up to Œ± 24 this was due to the complex vortex interactions downstream of the central trough this pattern is analogous to that observed on the rectangular planform 4l model as both of these models have the same 0 12 c protuberance amplitude and 0 50 c wavelength 3 2 cavitation number the incipient cavitation number œÉ i for rectangular and swept planform leading edge modified hydrofoils is compared to their baseline counterparts over the 3 Œ± 24 angle of attack range in figs 7 and 8 a set of experiments was carried out to measure the incipient cavitation number for each hydrofoil at various angles of attack as noted earlier the incipient cavitation number at each angle of attack was calculated when cavitation first appeared on a hydrofoil s leading edge as the freestream velocity was increased the value of zero at the lowest angles of attack in the plots indicated that cavitation did not develop even at the highest tunnel velocity higher values of incipient cavitation number imply that for a given local static pressure and angle of attack cavitation will occur at a lower freestream velocity this dataset may be used to establish the velocity below which a hydrofoil will operate free of leading edge cavitation the dependence of incipient cavitation number on angle of attack is shown in fig 7 for the rectangular hydrofoils the baseline hydrofoil had the smallest incipient cavitation number among all the hydrofoils over the entire range of angles examined the modified hydrofoils with small 0 025c and medium 0 05c protuberance amplitudes had very similar incipient cavitation numbers which were nearly independent of protuberance wavelength the increasing trend of œÉ i with angle of attack for the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils followed that of the baseline hydrofoil the incipient cavitation number for the two hydrofoils with the smallest protuberance amplitude 4s and 8s was always greater than that of the baseline hydrofoil with a maximum difference of about 20 at the higher angles of attack past the angle of Œ± 6 the two hydrofoils with the largest protuberance amplitude of a 0 12 c had incipient cavitation numbers consistently greater than the baseline and the other modified hydrofoils with the same protuberance wavelength the data in fig 7 also revealed that the incipient cavitation number of these two hydrofoils 4l and 8l was wavelength dependent the 8l hydrofoil which had a wavelength one half of the 4l exhibited incipient cavitation numbers that were as much as 72 and 125 greater than the 4l and baseline hydrofoil values respectively the large incipient cavitation number of 8l at the higher angles was most likely due to the close proximity of protuberances that would lead to the most significant peak to trough pressure gradients among all hydrofoils examined at an angle of Œ± 15 leading edge cavitation was first observed on the baseline hydrofoil at a freestream velocity of u 7 2 m s apparent in figs 4 and 5 at the same angle of attack and static pressure incipient cavitation on the 4l and 8l models will appear at freestream velocities of u 6 3 and 5 0 m s respectively the incipient cavitation number for the swept planform hydrofoils is shown in fig 8 similar to the smaller amplitude rectangular planform hydrofoils the incipient cavitation number for the modified hydrofoil with leading edge sweep was approximately a constant percentage 50 greater than that of the baseline hydrofoil for all angles of attack at which leading edge cavitation was present consequently at a given angle of attack and local static pressure cavitation on the leading edge modified hydrofoil will appear at a freestream velocity that is 19 lower than the same for the baseline hydrofoil 3 3 force coefficients lift and drag measurements were carried out on the rectangular and swept leading edge planform hydrofoils to determine the effect of cavitation pattern on the hydrodynamic loads these tests were performed at a freestream velocity of u 7 2 m s corresponding to the velocity at which incipient leading edge cavitation occurred on the baseline hydrofoil at an angle of Œ± 15 at angles of attack Œ± 15 all hydrofoils exhibited cavitation in the core of tip vortex as well as at the leading edge to various extents at angles of attack Œ± 15 cavitation was also present in the tip vortex of all hydrofoils but leading edge cavitation was apparent only on select modified hydrofoils as described in the previous sections the lift coefficient of the baseline hydrofoil in fig 9 increased linearly at low angles of attack and continued to increase with angle of attack until Œ± 22 after which a gradual stall and loss of lift was observed cavitation appears to play a minor role in the lift characteristics of the baseline hydrofoil except after Œ± 19 where a prominent increase in lift was observed prior to stall this increase is attributed to leading edge cavitation as sheet cavitation covered the full extent of leading edge for the first time at this angle the drag coefficient of the baseline hydrofoil shown in fig 10 had a minimum value of 0 02 and increased with angle of attack in a quadratic manner for nearly the entire angle of attack range the lift to drag ratio of the baseline hydrofoil in fig 11 increased to a maximum value of l d 11 4 at Œ± 7 2 before decreasing continuously 3 3 1 effect of amplitude the effect of protuberance amplitude on the load characteristics of modified hydrofoils in the presence of cavitation is shown in figs 9 11 the lift coefficient of modified hydrofoils with wavelength of Œª c 0 50 and various amplitudes shown in fig 9 revealed that these hydrofoils performed similarly in the span of 0 Œ± 12 even though cavitation was present only on the 4l and 8l models in this angle of attack range while the 4l hydrofoil with the largest protuberance amplitude had the earliest onset of cavitation and the smallest lift slope the reduction in d c l d Œ± cannot be attributed to cavitation as tests in absence of cavitation at lower freestream velocity resulted in the same value custodio et al 2015 on the other hand the lift coefficient of 4s and 4m hydrofoils were somewhat greater than that of the baseline over the 16 Œ± 20 angles of attack range where cavitation was prominent for all models this increase in lift over the baseline for the small and medium amplitude models was due to the cavitation as the same was not present in the previous tests without cavitation there was a rather sharp increase in the lift curve for the 4l hydrofoil just beyond Œ± 12 similar to the same observed for the baseline hydrofoil at Œ± 19 these increases were ascribed to the presence of cavitation as the two hydrofoils first experienced the full extent of cavitation at these specific angles past stall the lift coefficient for the baseline was greater than that of the 4s 4m and 4l hydrofoils similar trends were also observed for the rectangular hydrofoils with the shorter wavelength of Œª c 0 25 all the hydrofoils had the same lift coefficient up to Œ± 12 the 8l hydrofoil with the largest amplitude of a c 0 12 stalled shortly afterward at Œ± 16 and had a maximum lift coefficient that was 30 less than that for the baseline foil the sharp rise in lift that was present for the 4l was absent from the 8l data with cavitation present on their leading edge the 8s and 8m hydrofoils had comparable lift values up to stall the lift coefficient for these two hydrofoils was greater than the baseline hydrofoil for the range of 15 Œ± 20 the maximum lift coefficient of 8s and 8m hydrofoils was less than the baseline and occurred at a lower angle of attack the lift for baseline hydrofoil was greater than that of all modified hydrofoils past stall the drag coefficient of modified hydrofoils with cavitation are shown in fig 10 the drag coefficient for the hydrofoils with small and medium amplitude protuberances was nearly the same as that of the baseline hydrofoil over the entire angle of attack range examined this trend was much different from that observed in cases where cavitation was absent custodio et al 2015 whereas the drag on modified hydrofoils was significantly higher than that of the baseline at the lower freestream velocities without cavitation the drag of modified hydrofoils was almost equal to the baseline case when significant regions with cavitation were present the presence of cavitation in the protuberance troughs appears to have smoothed out the hydrofoil surface exposed to external flow the drag coefficient of 8l was less than the baseline hydrofoil in the post stall regime this observation is also attributed to the presence of sheet cavitation on the leading edge of baseline model as it affected the flow field much more than the smaller pockets of cavitation in the troughs of 8l hydrofoil on the other hand the 4l hydrofoil had the largest drag coefficient at all angles consistent with the tests without cavitation the lift to drag ratio l d for the rectangular planform hydrofoils is plotted in fig 11 in general the baseline hydrofoil had equal or greater l d values than the modified hydrofoils for the majority of angles of attack the only exception was the 15 Œ± 20 range where the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils had a slight advantage over the baseline due to the relative lift increase in this range as noted earlier this was a consequence of cavitation the small amplitude hydrofoils 4s and 8s had l d values very close to the baseline as these models experienced sheet cavitation on their leading edge similar to the baseline model the 4m and 8m models had somewhat lower l d values particularly past stall the 4l and 8l models had the lowest l d values among all the rectangular planform hydrofoils because of the lower lift and higher drag values throughout the angle of attack range the bump in the l d curve for the 4l hydrofoil was due to the cavitation induced rise in the lift coefficient at Œ± 12 the maximum l d values and the angle at which it was measured are listed in table 2 this table presents the key hydrodynamic load characteristics for all rectangular planform hydrofoils 3 3 2 effect of wavelength to examine the effect of protuberance wavelength on the hydrofoil loads in the presence of cavitation the data in figs 9 11 are re plotted in fig 12 14 by grouping together the hydrofoils with the same leading edge amplitude but different wavelengths the data revealed that the lift drag and l d of the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils were practically independent of the protuberance wavelength even though the cavitation pattern was somewhat different on these hydrofoils at different angles furthermore drag coefficient of the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils was nearly identical to the baseline hydrofoil the minor differences in the lift coefficient and l d of the 4m and 8m were a result of cavitation residing only in the troughs and the 8m having twice as many troughs as the 4m lift coefficient of the two hydrofoils with the largest amplitude in fig 12 showed that these two hydrofoils along with the baseline perform similarly until Œ± 12 prior to the onset of cavitation at the leading edge beyond Œ± 15 the 4l hydrofoil has greater lift than the 8l but this discrepancy was not due to the cavitation as both of these hydrofoils had similar cavitation patterns the difference in c l for these two hydrofoils at the higher angles was also observed at lower velocities where cavitation was entirely absent on the other hand the c l difference between the baseline and these two hydrofoils at the higher angles stemmed from the existence of sheet cavitation on the leading edge of baseline model drag coefficient of 4l and 8l hydrofoils shown in fig 13 revealed that there were minute differences in c d between these hydrofoils at angles up to Œ± 20 however at greater angles drag coefficients became increasingly divergent c d of 8l became nearly constant while that of 4l hydrofoil continued to increase a similar trend was also observed at lower velocities when cavitation was absent thus the difference in the drag coefficient of these two hydrofoils at the higher angles was a result of the underlying flow characteristics related to the protuberance wavelength and not cavitation which had similar patterns on both hydrofoils the lift over drag ratio of 4l and 8l hydrofoils in fig 14 indicates that l d of 8l was greater than that of 4l for angles Œ± 15 whereas the trend is reversed at higher angles the lower l d at low angles is due to the slightly greater lift and marginally smaller drag of 8l hydrofoil in this regime where the cavitation pattern was the same for both models for larger angles the 10 greater lift of 4l increased the l d over that of 8l hydrofoil in the post stall regime l d of these two hydrofoils merged together similar to the drag coefficient the differences in l d between these two models were a result of the underlying flow and not the cavitation pattern or extent in contrast the significant difference between these two hydrofoils and the baseline at higher angles was an outcome of sheet cavitation on the baseline s leading edge 3 3 3 effect of leading edge sweep load characteristics of the leading edge modified swept planform hydrofoil are compared to the baseline in fig 15 the lift coefficient of the baseline hydrofoil was either greater than or nearly equal to that of the modified model for all angles of attack lift coefficient of the model with leading edge protuberances was the same as the baseline for angles up to Œ± 15 even though cavitation was present on the modified model and absent from the baseline the lift coefficient remained nearly constant until Œ± 24 and then began to decrease gently the baseline lift coefficient increased to its maximum value at Œ± 24 and a relatively hard stall followed the dip in the baseline lift curve at Œ± 21 coincided with the appearance of sheet cavitation on the leading edge of the baseline see fig 6 except for this dip the lift curve for the baseline hydrofoil was similar to that at lower freestream velocity where cavitation was absent custodio et al 2015 on the other hand the lift curve for the modified model did not level off in absence of cavitation and increased to Œ± 28 the drag coefficient of the swept planform hydrofoils in fig 15 was nearly the same for the two models at angles of attack less than Œ± 15 over the range of angles 15 Œ± 29 drag of the modified hydrofoil was slightly greater than that of the baseline with an increase of about 12 at even greater angles of attack drag coefficients of the baseline and modified hydrofoils become nearly equal to within experimental uncertainty the observed difference between the baseline and modified models can be attributed to the existence of cavitation in all troughs of the modified model at Œ± 15 the lift to drag ratio for the two swept planform models in fig 15 revealed that l d of the baseline model is equal to or greater than the modified model over the entire range of angles of attack this is not surprising as both the lift and drag of the baseline model was greater than the modified model table 3 shows the key hydrodynamic load characteristics of the swept planform hydrofoils 3 4 significance as stated in the introduction section there are a number of marine applications that have incorporated bioinspired geometrical features in their design examples utilizing hydrofoils with leading edge protuberances include rudders tidal turbines and marine propellers however there is a lack of knowledge on the hydrodynamic performance of such bioinspired features especially when operational conditions result in cavitation the studies reviewed in section 1 have generally examined the loading characteristics for one specific leading edge design the impetus for the current study stemmed from the need to examine the characteristics of a set of canonical models with a relatively broad range of geometrical parameters associated with the leading edge protuberances design of future marine applications employing leading edge modifications can thus be guided by the findings of the fundamental testing conducted in the present study this was the primary motivation for pursuing this investigation the key findings of this study are that all leading edge modified hydrofoils stalled at lower angles of attack than the straight leading edge baseline model even though the lift slope was barely affected by the sinuous leading edge moreover both the modified and baseline hydrofoils had smooth lift declines at stall the modified hydrofoils also had lower maximum lift coefficients than the baseline and the leading edge geometry resulted in slightly greater drag especially for the two models with the largest protuberance amplitude at the higher angles of attack thus from a hydrodynamic loading perspective there is no clear advantage in incorporating leading edge modifications into the design of underwater components at least for the low aspect ratio hydrofoils considered here on the other hand the cavitation pattern was radically different for the hydrofoils with the two larger amplitude leading edge protuberances when compared to the baseline model as opposed to the sheet cavitation present on the baseline and the smallest amplitude hydrofoils cavitation was confined to the concave areas downstream of troughs of the leading edge for the two larger amplitude models furthermore bubble and noise production appeared to be qualitatively reduced for the latter models compared to the baseline hydrofoil given that cavitation is generally a detrimental occurrence for underwater control surfaces and marine propellers and turbines geometrical features resulting in reduced bubble and noise creation vibration corrosion and acoustically detectable bubbly wakes may have a significant impact on the design of future marine components in particular the hydrofoil with the leading edge sinusoidal amplitude of 5 of the mean chord length had hydrodynamic loading characteristics similar to the baseline hydrofoil up to the stall angle yet reduced bubble production was confined to relatively small regions then for a component integrating this leading edge geometry corrosion treatments may be applied to the concave areas of the leading edge only as opposed to the entire hydrofoil surface additionally further studies are needed to quantify the noise and bubble production of such a component since a reduction in such undesirable features may be quite beneficial in operation recommendations for future work on quantifying the impact of cavitation pattern modification are discussed at the end of the next section 4 conclusions a series of experiments were conducted to determine the effect of bioinspired sinusoidal leading edge protuberances on the cavitation pattern and incipient cavitation number of rectangular and swept leading edge planform hydrofoils with semi span aspect ratios of two lift and drag forces were measured at reynolds number of 7 2 105 and at angles of attack up to 30 hydrofoil geometries with three leading edge protuberance amplitudes and two wavelengths were examined here based on the acquired data the following conclusions may be drawn 1 direct imaging revealed that cavitation on the modified hydrofoils with medium 0 05c and large 0 12c protuberance amplitudes was largely confined to the area directly behind the protuberance troughs whereas the baseline and small amplitude 0 025c hydrofoils exhibited sheet cavitation over the entire span the cavitation pattern was virtually unaffected by the protuberance wavelength for the two wavelengths of 0 25c and 0 50c studied here 2 the incipient cavitation number of baseline hydrofoil for both planforms was always less than that of the modified hydrofoils implying that for a given static pressure cavitation will appear at the leading edge of modified hydrofoils at lower freestream velocities than their baseline counterparts moreover hydrofoils with the largest protuberance amplitude had greater incipient cavitation numbers at all angles considered however the extent of cavitation regions was notably smaller for the larger amplitude hydrofoils 3 all hydrofoils exhibited a linear lift regime in absence of cavitation at smaller angles of attack lift of the baseline hydrofoil was comparable to or greater than that of the leading edge modified hydrofoils for the majority of angle of attack range for 15 Œ± 20 the lift of small and medium amplitude hydrofoils was slightly greater as a result of difference in cavitation characteristics the two hydrofoils with the largest amplitude stalled at lower angles of attack and had the smallest maximum lift coefficient similar to the rectangular planform case the baseline hydrofoil for the swept leading edge planform had equal or greater lift than the modified model at all angles of attack considered 4 with the exception of the rectangular planform hydrofoils with the large protuberance amplitude drag on the modified hydrofoils was comparable to the baseline hydrofoil for the entire angle of attack range this was a direct consequence of cavitation where increased drag on the baseline hydrofoil due to sheet cavitation was balanced by the increased drag due to the leading edge protuberances on the modified models 5 even with sheet cavitation on the baseline hydrofoil the lift to drag ratio for all the leading edge modified hydrofoils was practically less than or equal to the baseline model over the entire range of angles of attack this was not surprising as both lift and drag of the baseline models were superior to the modified models the key findings listed above naturally lead to a set of recommendations for future work in this topical area to extend and quantify the impact of leading edge modifications on marine applications given that propeller and turbine blades may operate at higher reynolds numbers that those reached in the current study future testing should be carried out at higher reynolds numbers to examine whether there are any reynolds number dependence for the loading and cavitation characteristics additionally quantification of bubble and noise production as well as loading unsteadiness should be pursued to address potential advantages of the leading edge modifications for marine applications significant reduction in these undesirable characteristics would have a major impact on the design of future underwater subsystems

23284,cavitation characteristics and hydrodynamic forces of hydrofoils with bioinspired wavy leading edges were examined experimentally in a water tunnel force measurements were carried out using a waterproof load cell and cavitation patterns were recorded by directly imaging the hydrofoil surface all semi span hydrofoils had an underlying naca 634 021 profile with either a rectangular or swept leading edge planform the sinusoidal leading edge geometries were defined by three amplitudes of 2 5 5 and 12 and two wavelengths of 25 and 50 of the mean chord length results revealed that cavitation on the modified hydrofoils with the two larger amplitudes was largely confined to the regions directly behind the protuberance troughs whereas a baseline with flat leading edge and the smaller amplitude hydrofoils exhibited sheet cavitation over the entire span additionally cavitation on the modified hydrofoils appeared at consistently lower angles of attack than on the baseline model lift coefficient for the baseline model was generally comparable to or greater than that of the modified hydrofoils at the angles of attack considered except for the largest amplitude hydrofoils drag for the modified hydrofoils was equal to the baseline model for nearly the entire angle of attack range keywords hydrofoil cavitation leading edge protuberance lift and drag tubercle 1 introduction the past decade has witnessed significant growth in the research activity on airfoils hydrofoils wings and flow control surfaces with leading edge protuberances resembling the tubercles on the pectoral flippers of humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae fish et al 2011 the majority of these studies have focused on experimental testing and numerical simulations of flow at reynolds numbers of order 105 on a few airfoils with specific profiles and on wings with either rectangular or whale flipper resembling planforms the review article by fish and lauder 2006 discusses active and passive control by aquatic animals including the role of tubercles on the humpback whale flippers however no systematic studies of the effects of leading edge protuberances on the cavitation of hydrofoils have been performed the goal of the present experimental study was to examine the cavitation pattern and incipient cavitation number on two sets of hydrofoils with sinusoidal leading edge geometry three amplitudes and two wavelengths of the leading edge were examined on a rectangular planform in addition to a specific model with leading edge sweep the forces on all hydrofoils were measured in the presence of cavitation and compared with those on analogous baseline models with a straight leading edge the relevant past studies are reviewed below performance of idealized humpback whale flipper models with and without leading edge protuberances has been examined by miklosovic and collaborators the flipper may be described as a tapered finite span wing of aspect ratio 6 with a thick profile miklosovic et al 2004 measured the lift and drag of a flipper model with a naca 0020 profile at a reynolds number of one half million a 6 increase in the maximum lift and a 4 higher stall angle of attack for the flipper model with the protuberances was reported murray et al 2005 used the same models to observe the effects of tapering the leading edge they showed that flipper models with sweep angles of 15 and 30 had 9 and 4 respectively greater maximum lift compared to models without the leading edge protuberances the flow over a similar flipper model was computed using the detached eddy simulation des technique by pedro and kobayashi 2008 at an angle of attack of Œ± 15 and reynolds number of 5 0 105 they observed that separation near the tip of the flipper was reduced when the protuberances were present numerical simulation of the idealized flipper model was also carried out using two different turbulence models by weber et al 2011 they concluded that the stall pattern of the modified leading edge model is different than the model with a straight leading edge the effects of a sinusoidal leading edge on the lift and drag of a tunnel spanning full span naca 634 021 foil with leading edge geometries corresponding to that of the whale flipper fish and battle 1995 were investigated in a series of water tunnel experiments by johari et al 2007 foils with three different protuberance amplitudes and two different wavelengths were examined at a reynolds number of 1 8 105 and angles of attack up to Œ± 30 depending on the specific geometry of the leading edge lift on the modified foils was lower in the pre stall regime and higher in the post stall regime when compared to a baseline foil without any protuberances no drag reduction was observed for any of the modified leading edge airfoils studied the lift coefficient of the foil with the largest leading edge protuberance amplitude of 12 remained nearly constant over a broad range of angles of attack 10 Œ± 26 flow visualization using surface tufts showed that the flow over the protuberance peaks remains attached well past the stall angle of attack of the baseline foil johari et al 2007 2008 on the other hand flow separation occurred first in the troughs between the adjacent protuberances miklosovic et al 2007 observed similar trends for the lift and drag of a full span naca 0020 foil with sinusoidal leading edge at a reynolds number of 2 74 105 hansen et al 2011 measured the forces on two naca airfoils 0021 and 65 021 with different aerodynamic characteristics at reynolds number of 1 2 105 numerical simulation of foils with sinusoidal leading edges have also been carried out des was used to examine the flow over modified leading edge foils at reynolds numbers of 1 6 105 c√¢mara and sousa 2013 and 5 7 105 malipeddi et al 2012 and reynolds numbers up to 3 106 were examined by dropkin et al 2012 the findings of these numerical simulations verify the earlier experimental studies and provide detailed surface pressure distributions not available from the experiments the reynolds number beyond a certain value appears to have a minor effect on the force characteristics of leading edge modified foils other numerical simulations have investigated the formation of streamwise vortices rostamzadeh et al 2014 and stall delay skillen et al 2015 on airfoils with leading edge protuberances research on finite span wings with sinusoidal leading edges have been conducted on rectangular planform wings using panel methods watts and fish 2001 computed the flow on a naca 634 021 profile wing with an aspect ratio of two at an angle of attack Œ± 10 they observed a lift increase of 4 8 over the baseline wing and a 10 9 reduction of induced drag at this angle of attack guerreiro and sousa 2012 measured the performance of leading edge modified nasa ls 1 0417 wings with aspect ratios of 1 0 and 1 5 at reynolds numbers of 7 104 and 1 4 105 at the higher reynolds number lift enhancement was observed in the post stall regime consistent with the earlier study at similar reynolds numbers however at the lower reynolds number the leading edge modified wings had higher lift over a broader range of angles of attack due to the poor performance of the baseline wing most recently custodio et al 2015 made force measurements in a water tunnel on a series of low aspect ratio wings with multiple leading edge geometries and planforms at various reynolds numbers of interest to marine applications weber et al 2010 tested rudders with and without leading edge protuberances in a water tunnel at reynolds numbers up to 8 8 105 they indicated that the effects of leading edge modifications vanish at higher reynolds numbers yoon et al 2011 performed numerical simulation of rectangular wings with a sharp tip and a semi aspect ratio of 1 5 at reynolds number of 106 for rudder applications as well the rudder had a naca 0020 profile with protuberance amplitude and wavelength of 0 025 and 0 20 chord length respectively lift enhancement was observed only in the post stall regime similar to the lower reynolds number full span experiments lately several experimental and numerical studies have considered the effects of leading edge modifications on the performance of tidal turbines gruber at al 2011 shi et al 2016a 2016b and marine propeller blades ibrahim and new 2015 shi et al 2016c have also investigated cavitation and noise of a specific horizontal axis tidal turbine model with modified blade leading edges however there does not appear to be any systematic studies of the effects of leading edge protuberances on the cavitation of generic hydrofoils and wings or the hydrodynamic forces in presence of cavitation the primary objective of the present study was to establish the effect of various sinusoidal leading edge geometries on the cavitation characteristics and hydrodynamic forces of finite span hydrofoil models at reynolds number of 7 2 105 and angles of attack up to 30 this reynolds number was deemed sufficiently high such that further reynolds number increases would have minimal incremental effect the models consisted of a rounded tip rectangular planform with a semi aspect ratio of 2 15 and a swept planform with a semi aspect ratio of 2 0 the incipient cavitation numbers were compared among the various sinusoidal leading edge models and the baseline models the experimental technique is described in section 2 the results are presented and discussed in section 3 and the findings are summarized in section 4 2 experimental technique all experiments were carried out at the naval undersea warfare center nuwc closed loop water tunnel facility in newport ri the water tunnel test section was 0 30 m square and capable of reaching freestream velocities of up to 10 m s the freestream turbulent intensity on the tunnel centerline was measured to be about 0 6 for these tests the freestream velocity in the water tunnel was monitored at a point in the center of the water tunnel test section and 0 66 m upstream of the models using a laser doppler velocimeter monitoring and adjustment of the freestream velocity was required due to the variations caused by the different models and angles of attack in these experiments the freestream velocity was set at u 7 2 m s corresponding to reynolds numbers of re 7 2 105 based on the mean chord length of the hydrofoil models used no tripping device was used on the models to trigger transition 2 1 models various hydrofoil models with sinusoidal leading edge geometries similar to the wavelength and amplitude range of the protuberances found on the humpback whale flipper were designed and fabricated all models had an underlying naca 634 021 profile which is symmetric with the maximum thickness of 21 located at 40 of the chord this profile was chosen for its similarity to the humpback whale flipper cross section two sets of models distinguished by the planform geometry were fabricated rectangular planform models with a rounded tip and swept leading edge models the leading edge geometry was defined by a sinusoidal pattern with amplitude a and wavelength Œª the amplitude and wavelength were constant fractions of the chord length c three protuberance amplitudes of a 0 025c 0 05c and 0 12c along with two wavelengths of Œª 0 25c and 0 50c were examined in this study these values were chosen as they are representative of those found on the humpback whale flippers table 1 shows the dimensions and designation of the models tested for each set of models the mean chord length c and span b were kept the same to ensure that the planform area of all models in each set remained the same all leading edge modified models were compared to a protuberance free baseline model with the same planform area the two baseline models in table 1 had a naca 634 021 profile and were used for comparison with the leading edge modified models the leading edge of the modified models were blended into the baseline profile such that past a distance of three times the protuberance amplitude from the mean leading edge the modified and baseline airfoils were identical for example for the model with the medium amplitude protuberances the mean leading edge extended 0 05c upstream of the mean leading edge in the cross section corresponding to the peaks and contracted 0 05c back in the trough cross sections past 0 15c from the mean leading edge the profile of modified model was the same as the baseline naca profile the baseline and modified models have identical cross sections only at the protuberance inflection points the leading edge radius and cross section of the modified airfoils changed in the spanwise direction so that the top and bottom surfaces of the models were not wavy in the spanwise direction seven rectangular planform models with chord length of 102 mm and span of 214 mm were designed and fabricated from aluminum on a 4 axis cnc machine see fig 1 the models were polished and anodized resulting in a very fine surface finish of approximately 1 6 Œºm the models are considered hydrodynamically smooth for the testing conditions further details on the model details may be found in custodio et al 2015 the designation on each model in fig 1 corresponds to the ones in table 1 the flat edge of these models rested against the water tunnel bottom wall and all these models had the same aspect ratio including the rounded cap to investigate the effects of protuberances on a planform with a considerably larger spanwise flow than the rectangular models two models with leading edge sweep were designed the potential interaction of the spanwise flow with the protuberances and the resulting effect on the loads were of interest the swept leading edge planform models had a root chord length of 148 mm mean chord length of c 98 mm span of 200 mm and a leading edge sweep angle of 26 1 this sweep angle was chosen to have an aspect ratio close to the rectangular planform models these models were manufactured in the same manner as the rectangular ones and are shown in fig 2 the protuberance pattern on the modified model corresponded to the 4l rectangular planform model the protuberance amplitude and wavelength were constant fractions 12 and 50 respectively of the local chord length the flat edge rested on the bottom wall of the water tunnel test section 2 2 photography a flow visualization study was carried out to examine the cavitation characteristics of these models the angle of attack range examined ranged from 12 Œ± 24 in 3 increments cavitation was absent at angles of attack below 12 at the freestream velocity of 7 2 m s images were taken with a nikon d200 digital slr camera and strobe lighting to illuminate cavitation regions synchronized strobe lighting with an illumination time of approximately 1 Œºs was used to light both the front surface of the models as well as the background for contrast the flow visualization experiments were also used to observe the effects of leading edge modifications on the incipient cavitation number to determine the incipient cavitation number œÉ i the freestream static pressure was monitored in addition to the freestream velocity the incipient criterion used was the first visual cues of presence of vaporous cavitation near the leading edge the freestream velocity was increased from a minimum until the incipient cavitation condition had been reached on a given model at a fixed angle of attack and then the freestream velocity u i and static pressure p i were recorded afterward the incipient cavitation number œÉ i 2 p i p v œÅ u i 2 was computed using the water vapor pressure p v and density œÅ 2 3 force measurements a waterproof calibrated strain gage load cell model amti mk 4741 in conjunction with a msa 6 mini amplifier was used to measure the forces on the aforementioned models at angles of attack ranging from 12 Œ± 30 the load cell was capable of measuring forces up to 2224 n in the streamwise and transverse directions and 4448 n in the spanwise direction the amplifier allowed for zero biasing and anti alias low pass filtering with a 1 khz cutoff analog signals were passed through a national instruments ni scxi 1305 module and subsequently through a ni scxi 1120d module set to 10v inputs with 4 5 khz low pass filtering signals were then digitized at 1 khz and averaged subsequently by a labview program each set of strain gage voltages were multiplied by the calibrated crosstalk matrix all models were mounted to the load cell by means of an adapter plate which retained an axis of rotation centered about the quarter chord location of the models and transferred the forces directly to the load cell the load cell was housed inside a custom made mechanism which allowed measurement at various angles of attack the mechanism was capable of angle of attack adjustments up to 30 in increments of 1 5 the load measurement apparatus mounted below the water tunnel test section is shown in fig 3 where it was attached to the 4l model the measured forces were converted to lift and drag coefficients using the measured freestream dynamic pressure and the model planform area the bias errors associated with the measurements were due to the intrinsic uncertainty of the load cell the accuracy of the forces was determined through an inspection of the measured values by comparing the maximum and minimum values of the unprocessed data to the mean in a 100 sample dataset the resulting force uncertainties were approximately 1 8 n at the chosen freestream velocity which had a maximum uncertainty of 0 05 m s the uncertainty in the angle of attack was 0 3 stemming from the custom made mechanism to determine the uncertainties associated with the model chord length and span measurements were taken at several spanwise locations no more than a 0 8 and 0 5 difference from the nominal chord length and span of the models respectively were found the methods outlined in coleman and steel 1989 and in wheeler and ganji 1996 were used to determine the uncertainties of the lift and drag coefficients except for the drag coefficient at the low angles of attack the uncertainties for the force coefficients were less than 5 the correction methods laid out by pope and rae 1984 were used to account for the effects of water tunnel walls for all cases the buoyancy corrections were very small in comparison to the measured drag and therefore this correction was neglected throughout the solid and wake blockage effects in addition to the angle of attack correction were the primary corrections applied given that all the models had the same aspect ratio the corrections to the force coefficients were consistent and comparable among the various models additional details of the experimental setup data acquisition and processing may be found in custodio 2012 3 results 3 1 flow visualization the cavitation characteristics of hydrofoils at u 7 2 m s are presented in fig 4 6 cavitation can be distinguished by the white colored vapor produced in the low pressure regions images of the rectangular planform models with protuberances wavelengths of Œª c 0 25 and 0 50 are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the baseline hydrofoil is shown in figs 4a and 5a as with all the models examined cavitation was observed first at Œ± 12 in the core of the tip vortex with increased angle of attack cavitation in the tip vortex grew until Œ± 18 beyond which the tip vortex cavitation diminished as a result of stall at higher angles figs 4b and 5b illustrate that the models with protuberance amplitude of a c 0 025 8s and 4s had tip vortex cavitation characteristics similar to the baseline hydrofoil with an increase in the vortex cavity size up to Œ± 18 at angles of attack greater than Œ± 18 the size of the cavity generated by the tip vortex decreased gradually while the 8m model in fig 4c revealed a trend similar to that of the baseline the 4m model in fig 5c produced a vortex cavity that diminished at an earlier angle than the baseline the models with the largest amplitude protuberances 8l and 4l in figs 4d and 5d had tip vortex cavities that diminished at an even earlier angle than the baseline at the reynolds number of the experiments the baseline hydrofoil produced equal or greater lift than the modified models with the largest protuberances 8l and 4l and this resulted in a stronger tip vortex on the baseline hydrofoil in turn generating a larger vortex cavity the acceleration of flow over the leading edge of hydrofoils leads to reduced pressure producing cavitation along the leading edge cavitation at the leading edge of hydrofoil models was modified by the presence of protuberances to varying degrees as apparent in figs 4a and 5a sheet cavitation developed on the leading edge of the baseline hydrofoil with increasing angle of attack incipient cavitation occurred at an angle of Œ± 15 on the baseline hydrofoil sheet cavitation had spread along the majority of the baseline hydrofoil leading edge at Œ± 18 as the angle of attack was further increased to Œ± 21 the cavity associated with sheet cavitation enlarged and remained essentially unchanged as the angle of attack reached Œ± 24 for all leading edge modified hydrofoils cavitation initiated in the troughs of the protuberances this was due to the larger leading edge radius in the troughs leading to the lowest local pressures the two models with the largest protuberance amplitude of a c 0 12 8l and 4l cavitated at angles as low as Œ± 12 whereas all other modified rectangular hydrofoils started cavitating at Œ± 15 models with the smallest protuberance amplitude of a c 0 025 8s and 4s in figs 4b and 5b developed sheet cavitation at Œ± 18 similar to the baseline hydrofoil with increasing sheet size corresponding to an increase in angle of attack nearly the full extent of the span of these two hydrofoils was cavitating at the higher angles however sheet cavitation along the leading edge of the 8s and 4s models was limited to a somewhat smaller fraction of the chord length at the two higher angles when compared to the baseline hydrofoil in contrast with the baseline and smallest amplitude models cavitation on the two models with the largest protuberance amplitude 8l and 4l in figs 4d and 5d occurred only in the troughs and never extended to the protuberance peaks furthermore at Œ± 18 and beyond cavitation disappeared from the central trough for the 4l model see fig 5d and the cavitation pattern did not change with increasing angle the disappearance of central trough cavitation was a result of the interaction of vortices emanating from the shoulders of the protuberances which are described in detail in custodio 2012 the vortex interaction on the 4l hydrofoil would lead to increased local pressure behind the central trough a rather similar pattern was also observed on the 8l model in fig 4d however unsteadiness especially at the higher angles of attack produced transient cavitation cells behind the troughs at high angles of attack in fact cavitation along the leading edge of all modified hydrofoils was fairly unsteady the models with medium amplitude protuberances 8m and 4m in figs 4c and 5c had cavitation patterns similar to their larger amplitude counterparts cavitation appeared only in the troughs and the peaks remained free of cavitation no sheet cavitation was observed at any angle of attack and cavitation was confined to pockets behind the troughs moreover cavitation disappeared from the central trough at the higher angles of attack these observations revealed that the protuberance amplitude played a key role in the formation of cavitation patterns similar to the baseline hydrofoil small amplitude protuberances resulted in sheet cavitation except for the wavy geometry of the sheet being dictated by the leading edge on the other hand the larger amplitude protuberances created a different pattern with cavitation only in pockets behind the protuberance troughs the leading edge wavelength played only a minor role in establishing the cavitation patterns observed on the modified hydrofoils generally hydrofoils with the shorter wavelength developed transient cavitation cells at greater angles of attack compared to the hydrofoils with the longer wavelength the effect of protuberances on the cavitation characteristics of hydrofoils with leading edge sweep is shown in fig 6 cavitation was apparent in the tip vortex of the baseline model at the lowest angle of Œ± 12 however tip vortex cavitation disappeared altogether at angles of attack greater than Œ± 18 this was likely caused by tip stall which resulted in a weaker vortex strength no cavitation was visible on the leading edge of the baseline hydrofoil until an angle of Œ± 21 at angles of attack Œ± 21 leading edge sheet cavitation was present over the central one half of the baseline model span the lack of cavitation near the root as well as the tip of the hydrofoils were the result of low speed root and spanwise flow tip at these locations the cavitation pattern of the modified hydrofoil with leading edge sweep is shown in fig 6b contrary to the baseline hydrofoil tip vortex cavitation was apparent at all angles of attack considered with similar appearance throughout the entire range of angles incipient cavitation was observed in the troughs of the protuberances at angles as low as Œ± 12 as the angle of attack was increased cavitation was present only within the troughs the protuberance peaks remained cavitation free even though the baseline model was cavitating along the central portion of the span at Œ± 18 the central trough became cavitation free and remained so up to Œ± 24 this was due to the complex vortex interactions downstream of the central trough this pattern is analogous to that observed on the rectangular planform 4l model as both of these models have the same 0 12 c protuberance amplitude and 0 50 c wavelength 3 2 cavitation number the incipient cavitation number œÉ i for rectangular and swept planform leading edge modified hydrofoils is compared to their baseline counterparts over the 3 Œ± 24 angle of attack range in figs 7 and 8 a set of experiments was carried out to measure the incipient cavitation number for each hydrofoil at various angles of attack as noted earlier the incipient cavitation number at each angle of attack was calculated when cavitation first appeared on a hydrofoil s leading edge as the freestream velocity was increased the value of zero at the lowest angles of attack in the plots indicated that cavitation did not develop even at the highest tunnel velocity higher values of incipient cavitation number imply that for a given local static pressure and angle of attack cavitation will occur at a lower freestream velocity this dataset may be used to establish the velocity below which a hydrofoil will operate free of leading edge cavitation the dependence of incipient cavitation number on angle of attack is shown in fig 7 for the rectangular hydrofoils the baseline hydrofoil had the smallest incipient cavitation number among all the hydrofoils over the entire range of angles examined the modified hydrofoils with small 0 025c and medium 0 05c protuberance amplitudes had very similar incipient cavitation numbers which were nearly independent of protuberance wavelength the increasing trend of œÉ i with angle of attack for the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils followed that of the baseline hydrofoil the incipient cavitation number for the two hydrofoils with the smallest protuberance amplitude 4s and 8s was always greater than that of the baseline hydrofoil with a maximum difference of about 20 at the higher angles of attack past the angle of Œ± 6 the two hydrofoils with the largest protuberance amplitude of a 0 12 c had incipient cavitation numbers consistently greater than the baseline and the other modified hydrofoils with the same protuberance wavelength the data in fig 7 also revealed that the incipient cavitation number of these two hydrofoils 4l and 8l was wavelength dependent the 8l hydrofoil which had a wavelength one half of the 4l exhibited incipient cavitation numbers that were as much as 72 and 125 greater than the 4l and baseline hydrofoil values respectively the large incipient cavitation number of 8l at the higher angles was most likely due to the close proximity of protuberances that would lead to the most significant peak to trough pressure gradients among all hydrofoils examined at an angle of Œ± 15 leading edge cavitation was first observed on the baseline hydrofoil at a freestream velocity of u 7 2 m s apparent in figs 4 and 5 at the same angle of attack and static pressure incipient cavitation on the 4l and 8l models will appear at freestream velocities of u 6 3 and 5 0 m s respectively the incipient cavitation number for the swept planform hydrofoils is shown in fig 8 similar to the smaller amplitude rectangular planform hydrofoils the incipient cavitation number for the modified hydrofoil with leading edge sweep was approximately a constant percentage 50 greater than that of the baseline hydrofoil for all angles of attack at which leading edge cavitation was present consequently at a given angle of attack and local static pressure cavitation on the leading edge modified hydrofoil will appear at a freestream velocity that is 19 lower than the same for the baseline hydrofoil 3 3 force coefficients lift and drag measurements were carried out on the rectangular and swept leading edge planform hydrofoils to determine the effect of cavitation pattern on the hydrodynamic loads these tests were performed at a freestream velocity of u 7 2 m s corresponding to the velocity at which incipient leading edge cavitation occurred on the baseline hydrofoil at an angle of Œ± 15 at angles of attack Œ± 15 all hydrofoils exhibited cavitation in the core of tip vortex as well as at the leading edge to various extents at angles of attack Œ± 15 cavitation was also present in the tip vortex of all hydrofoils but leading edge cavitation was apparent only on select modified hydrofoils as described in the previous sections the lift coefficient of the baseline hydrofoil in fig 9 increased linearly at low angles of attack and continued to increase with angle of attack until Œ± 22 after which a gradual stall and loss of lift was observed cavitation appears to play a minor role in the lift characteristics of the baseline hydrofoil except after Œ± 19 where a prominent increase in lift was observed prior to stall this increase is attributed to leading edge cavitation as sheet cavitation covered the full extent of leading edge for the first time at this angle the drag coefficient of the baseline hydrofoil shown in fig 10 had a minimum value of 0 02 and increased with angle of attack in a quadratic manner for nearly the entire angle of attack range the lift to drag ratio of the baseline hydrofoil in fig 11 increased to a maximum value of l d 11 4 at Œ± 7 2 before decreasing continuously 3 3 1 effect of amplitude the effect of protuberance amplitude on the load characteristics of modified hydrofoils in the presence of cavitation is shown in figs 9 11 the lift coefficient of modified hydrofoils with wavelength of Œª c 0 50 and various amplitudes shown in fig 9 revealed that these hydrofoils performed similarly in the span of 0 Œ± 12 even though cavitation was present only on the 4l and 8l models in this angle of attack range while the 4l hydrofoil with the largest protuberance amplitude had the earliest onset of cavitation and the smallest lift slope the reduction in d c l d Œ± cannot be attributed to cavitation as tests in absence of cavitation at lower freestream velocity resulted in the same value custodio et al 2015 on the other hand the lift coefficient of 4s and 4m hydrofoils were somewhat greater than that of the baseline over the 16 Œ± 20 angles of attack range where cavitation was prominent for all models this increase in lift over the baseline for the small and medium amplitude models was due to the cavitation as the same was not present in the previous tests without cavitation there was a rather sharp increase in the lift curve for the 4l hydrofoil just beyond Œ± 12 similar to the same observed for the baseline hydrofoil at Œ± 19 these increases were ascribed to the presence of cavitation as the two hydrofoils first experienced the full extent of cavitation at these specific angles past stall the lift coefficient for the baseline was greater than that of the 4s 4m and 4l hydrofoils similar trends were also observed for the rectangular hydrofoils with the shorter wavelength of Œª c 0 25 all the hydrofoils had the same lift coefficient up to Œ± 12 the 8l hydrofoil with the largest amplitude of a c 0 12 stalled shortly afterward at Œ± 16 and had a maximum lift coefficient that was 30 less than that for the baseline foil the sharp rise in lift that was present for the 4l was absent from the 8l data with cavitation present on their leading edge the 8s and 8m hydrofoils had comparable lift values up to stall the lift coefficient for these two hydrofoils was greater than the baseline hydrofoil for the range of 15 Œ± 20 the maximum lift coefficient of 8s and 8m hydrofoils was less than the baseline and occurred at a lower angle of attack the lift for baseline hydrofoil was greater than that of all modified hydrofoils past stall the drag coefficient of modified hydrofoils with cavitation are shown in fig 10 the drag coefficient for the hydrofoils with small and medium amplitude protuberances was nearly the same as that of the baseline hydrofoil over the entire angle of attack range examined this trend was much different from that observed in cases where cavitation was absent custodio et al 2015 whereas the drag on modified hydrofoils was significantly higher than that of the baseline at the lower freestream velocities without cavitation the drag of modified hydrofoils was almost equal to the baseline case when significant regions with cavitation were present the presence of cavitation in the protuberance troughs appears to have smoothed out the hydrofoil surface exposed to external flow the drag coefficient of 8l was less than the baseline hydrofoil in the post stall regime this observation is also attributed to the presence of sheet cavitation on the leading edge of baseline model as it affected the flow field much more than the smaller pockets of cavitation in the troughs of 8l hydrofoil on the other hand the 4l hydrofoil had the largest drag coefficient at all angles consistent with the tests without cavitation the lift to drag ratio l d for the rectangular planform hydrofoils is plotted in fig 11 in general the baseline hydrofoil had equal or greater l d values than the modified hydrofoils for the majority of angles of attack the only exception was the 15 Œ± 20 range where the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils had a slight advantage over the baseline due to the relative lift increase in this range as noted earlier this was a consequence of cavitation the small amplitude hydrofoils 4s and 8s had l d values very close to the baseline as these models experienced sheet cavitation on their leading edge similar to the baseline model the 4m and 8m models had somewhat lower l d values particularly past stall the 4l and 8l models had the lowest l d values among all the rectangular planform hydrofoils because of the lower lift and higher drag values throughout the angle of attack range the bump in the l d curve for the 4l hydrofoil was due to the cavitation induced rise in the lift coefficient at Œ± 12 the maximum l d values and the angle at which it was measured are listed in table 2 this table presents the key hydrodynamic load characteristics for all rectangular planform hydrofoils 3 3 2 effect of wavelength to examine the effect of protuberance wavelength on the hydrofoil loads in the presence of cavitation the data in figs 9 11 are re plotted in fig 12 14 by grouping together the hydrofoils with the same leading edge amplitude but different wavelengths the data revealed that the lift drag and l d of the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils were practically independent of the protuberance wavelength even though the cavitation pattern was somewhat different on these hydrofoils at different angles furthermore drag coefficient of the small and medium amplitude hydrofoils was nearly identical to the baseline hydrofoil the minor differences in the lift coefficient and l d of the 4m and 8m were a result of cavitation residing only in the troughs and the 8m having twice as many troughs as the 4m lift coefficient of the two hydrofoils with the largest amplitude in fig 12 showed that these two hydrofoils along with the baseline perform similarly until Œ± 12 prior to the onset of cavitation at the leading edge beyond Œ± 15 the 4l hydrofoil has greater lift than the 8l but this discrepancy was not due to the cavitation as both of these hydrofoils had similar cavitation patterns the difference in c l for these two hydrofoils at the higher angles was also observed at lower velocities where cavitation was entirely absent on the other hand the c l difference between the baseline and these two hydrofoils at the higher angles stemmed from the existence of sheet cavitation on the leading edge of baseline model drag coefficient of 4l and 8l hydrofoils shown in fig 13 revealed that there were minute differences in c d between these hydrofoils at angles up to Œ± 20 however at greater angles drag coefficients became increasingly divergent c d of 8l became nearly constant while that of 4l hydrofoil continued to increase a similar trend was also observed at lower velocities when cavitation was absent thus the difference in the drag coefficient of these two hydrofoils at the higher angles was a result of the underlying flow characteristics related to the protuberance wavelength and not cavitation which had similar patterns on both hydrofoils the lift over drag ratio of 4l and 8l hydrofoils in fig 14 indicates that l d of 8l was greater than that of 4l for angles Œ± 15 whereas the trend is reversed at higher angles the lower l d at low angles is due to the slightly greater lift and marginally smaller drag of 8l hydrofoil in this regime where the cavitation pattern was the same for both models for larger angles the 10 greater lift of 4l increased the l d over that of 8l hydrofoil in the post stall regime l d of these two hydrofoils merged together similar to the drag coefficient the differences in l d between these two models were a result of the underlying flow and not the cavitation pattern or extent in contrast the significant difference between these two hydrofoils and the baseline at higher angles was an outcome of sheet cavitation on the baseline s leading edge 3 3 3 effect of leading edge sweep load characteristics of the leading edge modified swept planform hydrofoil are compared to the baseline in fig 15 the lift coefficient of the baseline hydrofoil was either greater than or nearly equal to that of the modified model for all angles of attack lift coefficient of the model with leading edge protuberances was the same as the baseline for angles up to Œ± 15 even though cavitation was present on the modified model and absent from the baseline the lift coefficient remained nearly constant until Œ± 24 and then began to decrease gently the baseline lift coefficient increased to its maximum value at Œ± 24 and a relatively hard stall followed the dip in the baseline lift curve at Œ± 21 coincided with the appearance of sheet cavitation on the leading edge of the baseline see fig 6 except for this dip the lift curve for the baseline hydrofoil was similar to that at lower freestream velocity where cavitation was absent custodio et al 2015 on the other hand the lift curve for the modified model did not level off in absence of cavitation and increased to Œ± 28 the drag coefficient of the swept planform hydrofoils in fig 15 was nearly the same for the two models at angles of attack less than Œ± 15 over the range of angles 15 Œ± 29 drag of the modified hydrofoil was slightly greater than that of the baseline with an increase of about 12 at even greater angles of attack drag coefficients of the baseline and modified hydrofoils become nearly equal to within experimental uncertainty the observed difference between the baseline and modified models can be attributed to the existence of cavitation in all troughs of the modified model at Œ± 15 the lift to drag ratio for the two swept planform models in fig 15 revealed that l d of the baseline model is equal to or greater than the modified model over the entire range of angles of attack this is not surprising as both the lift and drag of the baseline model was greater than the modified model table 3 shows the key hydrodynamic load characteristics of the swept planform hydrofoils 3 4 significance as stated in the introduction section there are a number of marine applications that have incorporated bioinspired geometrical features in their design examples utilizing hydrofoils with leading edge protuberances include rudders tidal turbines and marine propellers however there is a lack of knowledge on the hydrodynamic performance of such bioinspired features especially when operational conditions result in cavitation the studies reviewed in section 1 have generally examined the loading characteristics for one specific leading edge design the impetus for the current study stemmed from the need to examine the characteristics of a set of canonical models with a relatively broad range of geometrical parameters associated with the leading edge protuberances design of future marine applications employing leading edge modifications can thus be guided by the findings of the fundamental testing conducted in the present study this was the primary motivation for pursuing this investigation the key findings of this study are that all leading edge modified hydrofoils stalled at lower angles of attack than the straight leading edge baseline model even though the lift slope was barely affected by the sinuous leading edge moreover both the modified and baseline hydrofoils had smooth lift declines at stall the modified hydrofoils also had lower maximum lift coefficients than the baseline and the leading edge geometry resulted in slightly greater drag especially for the two models with the largest protuberance amplitude at the higher angles of attack thus from a hydrodynamic loading perspective there is no clear advantage in incorporating leading edge modifications into the design of underwater components at least for the low aspect ratio hydrofoils considered here on the other hand the cavitation pattern was radically different for the hydrofoils with the two larger amplitude leading edge protuberances when compared to the baseline model as opposed to the sheet cavitation present on the baseline and the smallest amplitude hydrofoils cavitation was confined to the concave areas downstream of troughs of the leading edge for the two larger amplitude models furthermore bubble and noise production appeared to be qualitatively reduced for the latter models compared to the baseline hydrofoil given that cavitation is generally a detrimental occurrence for underwater control surfaces and marine propellers and turbines geometrical features resulting in reduced bubble and noise creation vibration corrosion and acoustically detectable bubbly wakes may have a significant impact on the design of future marine components in particular the hydrofoil with the leading edge sinusoidal amplitude of 5 of the mean chord length had hydrodynamic loading characteristics similar to the baseline hydrofoil up to the stall angle yet reduced bubble production was confined to relatively small regions then for a component integrating this leading edge geometry corrosion treatments may be applied to the concave areas of the leading edge only as opposed to the entire hydrofoil surface additionally further studies are needed to quantify the noise and bubble production of such a component since a reduction in such undesirable features may be quite beneficial in operation recommendations for future work on quantifying the impact of cavitation pattern modification are discussed at the end of the next section 4 conclusions a series of experiments were conducted to determine the effect of bioinspired sinusoidal leading edge protuberances on the cavitation pattern and incipient cavitation number of rectangular and swept leading edge planform hydrofoils with semi span aspect ratios of two lift and drag forces were measured at reynolds number of 7 2 105 and at angles of attack up to 30 hydrofoil geometries with three leading edge protuberance amplitudes and two wavelengths were examined here based on the acquired data the following conclusions may be drawn 1 direct imaging revealed that cavitation on the modified hydrofoils with medium 0 05c and large 0 12c protuberance amplitudes was largely confined to the area directly behind the protuberance troughs whereas the baseline and small amplitude 0 025c hydrofoils exhibited sheet cavitation over the entire span the cavitation pattern was virtually unaffected by the protuberance wavelength for the two wavelengths of 0 25c and 0 50c studied here 2 the incipient cavitation number of baseline hydrofoil for both planforms was always less than that of the modified hydrofoils implying that for a given static pressure cavitation will appear at the leading edge of modified hydrofoils at lower freestream velocities than their baseline counterparts moreover hydrofoils with the largest protuberance amplitude had greater incipient cavitation numbers at all angles considered however the extent of cavitation regions was notably smaller for the larger amplitude hydrofoils 3 all hydrofoils exhibited a linear lift regime in absence of cavitation at smaller angles of attack lift of the baseline hydrofoil was comparable to or greater than that of the leading edge modified hydrofoils for the majority of angle of attack range for 15 Œ± 20 the lift of small and medium amplitude hydrofoils was slightly greater as a result of difference in cavitation characteristics the two hydrofoils with the largest amplitude stalled at lower angles of attack and had the smallest maximum lift coefficient similar to the rectangular planform case the baseline hydrofoil for the swept leading edge planform had equal or greater lift than the modified model at all angles of attack considered 4 with the exception of the rectangular planform hydrofoils with the large protuberance amplitude drag on the modified hydrofoils was comparable to the baseline hydrofoil for the entire angle of attack range this was a direct consequence of cavitation where increased drag on the baseline hydrofoil due to sheet cavitation was balanced by the increased drag due to the leading edge protuberances on the modified models 5 even with sheet cavitation on the baseline hydrofoil the lift to drag ratio for all the leading edge modified hydrofoils was practically less than or equal to the baseline model over the entire range of angles of attack this was not surprising as both lift and drag of the baseline models were superior to the modified models the key findings listed above naturally lead to a set of recommendations for future work in this topical area to extend and quantify the impact of leading edge modifications on marine applications given that propeller and turbine blades may operate at higher reynolds numbers that those reached in the current study future testing should be carried out at higher reynolds numbers to examine whether there are any reynolds number dependence for the loading and cavitation characteristics additionally quantification of bubble and noise production as well as loading unsteadiness should be pursued to address potential advantages of the leading edge modifications for marine applications significant reduction in these undesirable characteristics would have a major impact on the design of future underwater subsystems
